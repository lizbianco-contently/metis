Mr. President, I rise today to begin a series of \nstatements in which I want to outline some of the research and other \nscientific benefits derived from NASA-funded programs. These are \nprograms that have benefit, by and large, for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country; indeed, for people all over the globe.\n  I note with pleasure that just recently, the House passed their \nappropriations bill regarding NASA's space station by a vote of 299 in \nfavor and 126 against. That is well over a 2-to-1 margin. I hope we can \nmatch that in the Senate.\n  But every year in the Senate, when the time comes to consider the \nNASA budget, there are those doubters, there are those people who want \nto cut it. I do not want to see excess money going into NASA either, \nbut I also think we need to step back once in a while and look at what \nwe are talking about with regard to research.\n  If there is one thing this Nation should have learned throughout its \nhistory, it is that money spent on research usually has a way of paying \noff in the future beyond anything we can see at the outset. That is \njust as true with research in space as it is with research that we have \ndone in other areas. Research by its very nature is not as amenable to \ncost accounting procedures as are some other programs. But that is why \nit is research: It is looking into the unknown, it is having inquiry \ninto things we do not yet know about and do not yet know the value of. \nYet, that has been at the heart of every bit of advance in science and \ntechnology that we have ever made as a nation.\n  Someone has to wonder, someone has to have a curiosity about what we \ndo not know in a certain area, how can we do things better, what would \nhappen if we knew the answer to a certain question. And they are \nwilling to go out and do something about it. They are willing to \nexercise their wonderment, their curiosity. This Nation is just replete \nwith examples of where that has been to our advantage. \n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\n  For example, we can think back in agriculture and we can see the old \nsettlers planting corn. When I was a boy back in New Concord, OH, a \ngood corn crop was probably 48 to 50 bushels per acre. That was \nconsidered pretty good around there in those days. Do you know what it \nwas last year not far from where I grew up? There was one farm pointed \nout to me that won the competition in that little part of our State \nnear Utica, OH, where our good friend, Gene Branstool, who was in the \nDepartment of Agriculture for awhile, comes from. That area had 239 \nbushels per acre last year on one of the farms--239 bushels per acre.\n  Back when I was growing up, the people thought 48 to 50 bushels was \npretty good. Why do we need research? Why would anybody spend money on \nit when we are getting 48 to 50 bushels off this land, where people \nbefore had only 30 or 35? But we put money into an agricultural \nresearch system, and out of that system came improvements in soil and \nfertilizers and hybrids, a tremendous step forward when you got to \nhybrids.\n  So the increase in production is not something that indicates farmers \nare working six or seven times as hard as they worked back when I was a \nboy, but it means that we did basic research, even though nobody knew \nwhat the outcome of it was going to be at that time.\n  Out of that research then came improvements in the hybrids, \nmachinery, fertilizers, soil stabilization, and all these things that \ngive us this wonderful production today that makes us the envy of the \nworld. We are not the envy of the world just because--just because--we \nhave great plains on which to conduct all of our agriculture. We have \nthat agricultural production out there largely because we did basic \nresearch more than anyone else in the world, and we are the envy of the \nrest of the world with that system that we set up in agriculture.\n  I can give other examples. In metals, we develop metals that now give \nmore reliable engines, valves, and generators, and all the things that \ngo to make up our industrialized society. We did metallurgical research \nthat was the envy of the rest of the world. Now there are some places \nin the world, Russia being one of them, where we envy them in some of \nthe metallurgical research they are doing. In some areas, we believe \nthey are probably ahead of some of our metallurgical research.\n  Aeronautical research--why would anybody want to get up and fly like \nthe birds? The Wright brothers wondered why not and then did it. That \nfirst flight they made was 120 feet long and took 12 seconds. Before \nthat day was over, they had done four flights, the longest one just a \nlittle under 900 feet, 59 seconds I believe it was. But they were \ncurious about why we could not get up and do sustained flights. People \nhave wondered for thousands of years, I suppose, why we could not fly \nlike the birds.\n  The Wright brothers were curious about it, and they were ridiculed by \nsome of the people at the time, because why would anyone want to do \nthis? Later on, when they were trying to sell one of the airplanes, or \na series of them, to the Army to use and were in Washington \ndemonstrating it, one of the people in Congress in one of the hearings \nwas quoted as saying, ``Why not just buy one airplane and let them take \nturns using it?''\n  Well, it shows how myopic the view is of some people. The airplane \nwas developed in part because we did basic research. Out of that start \ncame an aeronautical industry that, in turn, had its own research done. \nThe Government invested in wind tunnels and conducted lift experiments \nand drag experiments and metallurgical experiments along with some of \nthat to see what would hold up in a wind tunnel. Out of that came the \nlifting bodies and the aerodynamic surfaces that were the basis of our \nwhole aeronautical industry and helped develop such giants as Boeing, \nLockheed, Grumman, Northrop, McDonnell-Douglas, and all the rest of the \naviation companies that did not do all of that themselves. They could \nnot. They did not have the resources. Yet, the Government went ahead \nwith the research that let this whole new industry develop.\n  In medicine, we have had people concerned since we have been a nation \nin doing more medical research than any nation. Out of that has come a \nmedical system that is the envy of the world. At the same time, we have \nproblems with it because we want to see more people benefiting from \nthat system. But we have made our medical advances and breakthroughs \nlargely because of basic, fundamental research. We have people willing \nto go into the laboratories and conduct that kind of research in \noceanography, for example.\n  Those who would think that just because we have moved into this new \nenvironment of space--there are some who think we should lay that down \nand it cannot possibly have any advantage to us. Yet, we have found in \nthe past that exploring the unknown, whether it be in the lab or \ngeographical expansion--can be just as valuable as any of the other \nkinds of research that we do. But we still have those who doubt.\n  I am reminded of a quote that is sort of a favorite of mine because \nit shows how myopic some views can be. It involves Daniel Webster. He \nrose on the Senate floor when they were considering some territorial \nacquisitions from Mexico back in 1852. These were the lands beyond the \nMississippi. These were the great plains beyond the Mississippi. These \nwere the mountains and plains clear to the west coast. He did not like \nthat idea very much. Daniel Webster rose on the Senate floor and spoke \nin opposition to the purchase. He is quoted as having said the \nfollowing:\n\n       What do we want with this vast worthless area, this region \n     of savages and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and \n     whirlwinds of dust and cactus and prairie dogs? To what use \n     could we ever hope to put these great deserts or the \n     mountains that are covered to their very base with eternal \n     snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast, a \n     coast of 3,000 miles rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting, and \n     not a harbor on it? What use have we for this country? Mr. \n     President, I will never vote one cent from the Public \n     Treasury to place the Pacific coast one inch nearer to Boston \n     than it is now.\n\n  We look back today and think how myopic that view was. I am sure \neveryone that comes from States west of the Mississippi would first be \namused by Daniel Webster's statement. It shows how myopic the views of \neven well-educated, great public servants can become when they try and \njust assume that the status quo is what we are going to live with \nforever, and should live with forever.\n  When we look up at space, in order to stay up there, you have to go \nfast enough to set up enough centrifugal force going around the Earth \nso that you balance gravity, so that, we now can assume a zero gravity \nor microgravity environment. You cannot do that here on Earth. You can \nthrow something up in the air and for the time period it is going up \nand coming back down, it will be in a zero gravity condition or zero-G \ncondition. However such experiments are very short-lived.\n  In the spacecraft we have now, whether it be the space shuttle or the \ncoming orbiting space station, up there on a permanent basis, we now \nhave the capability of exercising this curiosity, exercising our \nwonder, exercising our look into the unknown to see how it can benefit \nus here on Earth. That is the reason why I rise today, to talk about \nthe value of this and some of the things that, even at this early stage \nof investigation, this early stage of research in space, is of value to \neveryone right here on Earth.\n  Let me take the last Space Shuttle flight that went up as an example. \nThe last flight was called an ``Ohio flight'' because, as it turned \nout, four out of the five people on board were from Ohio. The flight \nwas not set up that way, as an Ohio flight, to begin with. It was just \nthe luck of the draw on that assignment of crew that it turned out that \nfour of the five people were from Ohio.\n  I went down before their launch and spent a couple of days with that \ncrew down at Houston. It was intensely interesting. We went through \nsome of the simulations the astronauts use for training there, as well \nas reviewed some of the experiments and things they were going to do on \nthat particular flight. This was not an unusual flight in that regard. \nIt was a flight that had a number of experiments on board--a dozen or \nso--and some of them that may have a particular benefit to people right \nhere on Earth.\n  The people on that flight were Commander Tom Hendricks from \nWoodville, OH; Nancy Jane Curry from Troy; \n\n[[Page S11045]]\nMary Ellen Weber of Bedford Heights, Don Thomas of Cleveland; Kevin \nKriegle from Amityville, NY, who we made an honorary Ohioan for the \nduration of that particular mission. They did a great job. Many people \nwatched the other day as they landed successfully at the cape after \nbeing delayed in coming back because of weather.\n  But the important thing I want to stress this morning is that just on \nthat one flight, some of the things they had aboard may be of extreme \nvalue to everybody right here. Actually, they had a total of 18 \ndifferent experiments that were on board that flight. The primary \nmission was to put into space the TDRS satellite, the tracking and data \nrelay satellite system. This is a final installation of a series of \nspace-based communication and tracking networks that will be used for \nlower Earth orbit communications.\n  The amount of communications of data relay that that particular \nsatellite will be able to handle, to me, is sort of mind boggling. Once \nit is fully up and fully operational--it is up there now but not fully \noperational--it will be used as a spare in case one of the other TDRS \nsatellites develops problems. But its capacity, when fully operational, \nwill be to transmit information per second, equal to about a 20 volume \nencyclopedia, to be able to transfer that amount of data per second. \nThe communications that something like that provides and the ability to \ncommunicate with different parts of the world almost instantaneously is \nrather mind boggling to even consider.\n  I will not try and go through all 18 of these experiments, but \nanother one I was particularly interested in--and that the scientists \nat NASA are very excited about--is the bioreactor system. We were \nbriefed on that in Houston, and one of the scientists describing this \nsays that if this comes through the way they think it may, this is \nNobel Prize material. Well, it may well be. What it does is it makes a \nnew way of studying cancer cells and other cells that are in the human \nbody. It provides a new way of analyzing these cells and may lead to a \nnew way of treating them.\n  The reason it is different is this. In a laboratory here on Earth, if \nyou want to grow some cancer cells you usually must grow them on the \nbottom of a Petri dish. These cells grow in essentially a two-\ndimensional way. Scientists can then analyze the cells, but because \nthey are two dimensional, they do not exactly replicate how these \ncancer cells are found in the body.\n  A two dimensional model is not the cells' natural environment. Cancer \ncells in the blood stream, cancer cells in a tissue, are surrounded by \nother body fluids, body parts.\n  With the bioreactor, researchers can grow cells in a three-\ndimensional environment, more similar to what is found in the human \nbody. When cancer cells are allowed to grow in three dimensions, \nresearchers can use different experimental techniques, different drugs \nor lasers or whatever, to see how these cells or tumors may best be \ntreated. On a lab here on Earth a bioreactor has been used to grow \nsmall three dimensional breast cancer cells, but eventually the forces \nof gravity take over and these models fall apart. In a constant \nmicrogravity environment, like that of the space shuttle or space \nstation larger cell clusters can be grown--more similar to what is \nfound in the human body.\n  The first efforts at that are being done now, and were conducted with \nthis bioreactor development system which flew on the most recent \nshuttle. Stated in other terms, the ability of a bioreactor to provide \nthe environment and metabolic support required to grow and maintain \nmammalian cell cultures in microgravity.\n  This is a short statement, meaning, basically, what I said a moment \nago. The experiments that they were starting on this last flight on \nSTS-70 were with cancer cells. They want to see what reaction they get, \nhow they can maintain the cells there, what reaction they have to \ndifferent conditions, and so on.\n  Can I say right here that we have the answer to cancer near at hand, \nor the answer to AIDS near at hand? No. But out of an inquiry like this \nmight well come some advances that combine with others, and other \nresearch may give us a handle.\n  Surely, this environment that they are in, where they are surrounded \nby the normal body fluids in the reactor, is much more conducive to \nresearch.\n  The effect of microgravity on bone development has been an ongoing \narea of research. Research into osteoporosis, which is a degenerative \nbone disease, is one prime example. One thing that happens in \nmicrogravity is the body starts to correct itself, as it no longer \nneeds the same skeletal strength it has here on Earth to maintain \nitself up there.\n  We used to worry about this because if one's body eliminated enough \ncalcium and the bones became much less rigid, we used to joke about the \npossibility of ``jelly bones.'' Sometime in the future if a person went \non a long space flight, maybe you would come back and your bones would \nbe so weak, so much calcium was out of them, you might not be able to \nstand without taking a chance of breaking your leg.\n  Osteoporosis goes through much of this same process. Prolonged bed \nrest in the hospital creates some of that same process--the body \nthrowing off much of the calcium that it has in its bones.\n  In space, you develop some of these characteristics much more \nrapidly. That is the reason why you see some of the pictures coming \nback, people are up there exercising, exercising, exercising, about an \nhour every day on a treadmill, tied down with bungee cords, because \nthey find that hard exercise every day is the best way to prevent that \nfrom happening.\n  Here on Earth, one of the ways people prevent osteoporosis is by \ndaily exercise. Up there, we can then use additional chemicals or \nmedicines or whatever to see if we cannot reverse this process or at \nleast prevent it from happening, which will have a direct relationship \nright here on Earth.\n  Another experiment, commercial protein crystal growth. Crystallized \nhuman alpha-interferon protein. The protein crystal growth experiments \nhave been particularly interesting. These crystal growths occur with \nmore purity and sometimes in much different size in the weightlessness \nof space than they do here on Earth. It opens up a whole new area of \nexperimentation with regard to what may be of benefit right here on \nEarth. This particular crystal also may have some cancer benefits.\n  All of these things are not just curiosities in space, to be applied \nin space. They are of benefit to people right here on Earth. It always \nsurprises me when people do not seem to want to realize or they talk \ndown projects that may result in a whole new approach to disease. It \nmay result in what we call tailormade drugs; in other words, drugs that \nwill be tailored to a specific benefit to cope with a particular \ndisease or a particular medical difficulty. They are doing those \nexperiments there now.\n  Another experiment that has a title that is rather unwieldy may have \nsome defense applications for us. We do not know yet. We think it may. \nIt is called the HERCULES project. Now, HERCULES stands for hand-held, \nEarth-oriented, cooperative, real time, user-friendly, location \ntargeting, and environmental system. That is some handle for the \nproject HERCULES. What it is, is a space-based geolocating system to \nlocate a wide variety of features on the ground with great accuracy. It \nhas some defense applications that may come out of that, as well as \nother scientific applications.\n  Another experiment is microencap- \nsulation in space to produce novel pharmaceuticals in a weightless \ncondition which can be done with more purity than they can be done here \non Earth.\n  Another one is a midcourse space experiment, which supports the \ndevelopment of surveillance capabilities of ballistic missiles during \nthe midcourse of their flight. There are a number of experiments they \nperform on just that one flight.\n  Going back one flight before that, we all watched as astronaut Hoot \nGibson flew the STS-71 mission, the shuttle-MIR mission. There were \ngreat pictures of that, that I am sure many of my colleagues saw. On \nthat mission, in addition to just being able to rendezvous with two \n100-ton vehicles coming together up there in space, they did metabolic \nexperiments: Studying physiological responses in space, changes in \nblood volume, cardiovascular and pulmonary research, neurosensory \nresearch, how zero gravity affects brain \n\n[[Page S11046]]\ncommunication. Does that tie in with brain communication? We need \ninformation with regard to Alzheimer's disease or whatever. Also, \nbehavior and performance research, long-term effects of microgravity on \nmuscle coordination, mental acuity, and once again, the protein crystal \ngrowth experiments.\n  These are just a few of the things that are going on in the space \nprogram these days. I just mention these things now and, in subsequent \nremarks here on the floor, I want to give more information on some of \nthese. I wanted to set the stage this morning by going back in just a \nfew of the things that I have mentioned with regard to the value of \nbasic research in this country, and that NASA is out there, right now, \ndoing that kind of cutting edge, basic research, in this new laboratory \nof space.\n  Every year, NASA publishes a book called ``Spinoffs.'' This one is \n``Spinoff, 1994,'' a whole book full of some of the things that NASA \nhas been doing that are of value right here on Earth. Health and \nmedicine, environment and resources management, public safety, \nconsumer, home, recreational spinoffs, transportation, computer \ntechnology, industrial productivity, and manufacturing technology.\n  I will not try to read all the things here this morning for people, \nbut I commend them to my colleagues and the staffs here on the floor \nfor reading, to see what is going on in some of these areas. We will be \ntalking more about some of these things as time goes on.\n  I know the time is limited here this morning. I will make some more \nlengthy remarks in days ahead. I wanted to take this time this morning \nto set the stage for the upcoming debate on NASA's budget.\n  People have looked up for hundreds of thousands of years and wondered \nwhat is up there in the air, and then the Wright brothers went ahead \nand learned how to fly and learned how to stay up there for a period of \ntime, and people first thought, what use was it. But we know what use \nit became later on--our whole aircraft and airline industry that lets \npeople travel to far places around the world.\n  Every time we come up with a new capability for doing research, it \nseems that there are those who do not want to recognize that something \ngood may come out of it, whether it be agriculture research, metals \nresearch, aeronautical research, oceanography, geographical research, \nor whatever.\n  But, as I said starting out, if there is one thing this Nation has \nlearned, it is that money and time spent on basic, fundamental research \nin whatever area usually comes back and shows more value than we could \never foresee at the outset.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11043-6", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO C. ABBOTT SAFFOLD, SECRETARY FOR THE MINORITY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhailing the faithful service of Abby Saffold, who has served as \nsecretary to the Democratic caucus since 1987. Abby has been one of the \ngreatest fixtures in this body, and I cannot imagine the remarkably \ndifferent place this Chamber would have been without her.\n  I remember well the days when this body was not so divided by party \nlines. Abby is a rare example of a person who provided her expertise to \nall, regardless of party. She did not concern herself with which side \nof the aisle we were on. She was helpful to anyone who needed of her.\n  I am sure Abby could tell remarkable stories about the questions that \nwere posed to her throughout her career in the Senate. If someone was \nplanning a vacation for 1999, they would first call Abby to ask if the \nSenate would be in session--and she would know. I am sure that she has \nbeen asked countless times ``When will be be out of here tonight?'' \n``What's on the lunch menu today?'' or ``What's the best joke you can \ntell me, Abby?''\n  Abby has served as a school teacher and a case workers, and I am sure \nthat those experiences have led to her expertise in working for and \nwith Members of the Senate. She is well known for her endless knowledge \nof legislative procedures and negotiating skills, and for avoiding \ndisaster through her expertise.\n  Abby was here with us all the late nights, still sharp, awake, and \naware. There was no question whether she would be on the floor the next \nmorning, and she was just as cheerful.\n  Abby is undoubtedly one of the brightest luminaries we have had the \nopportunity to work with here in the Senate. She learned from her \nexperiences in Senator Byrd's office, working her way up from \nlegislative correspondent to her position as the secretary of the \nmajority, and most recently, as the secretary to the minority.\n  Senator Byrd taught her well. He passed on his attention for detail \nand professionalism to a truly great staffer. In appointing her, \nSenator Byrd gave us one of the greatest gifts any colleague could \nhave--the opportunity for us to know the endless kindness of Abby \nSaffold. As Senator Byrd recently said, ``Abby has done it all, and \ndone it all very, very well.''\n  As I look toward my own retirement, I would like to express by best \nwishes to Abby for hers. I doubt I will ever meet any finer person. We \nwill all miss her presence here in this Chamber.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11046-S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DUANE GARRETT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, only 48 years old, a veritable dynamo, \nexuding ideas and proposals, knowing his words commanded attention from \nthe humblest abode to the White House itself, Duane Garrett seemed to \nhave it all.\n  With a loving family, legions of friends, the respect and admiration \nof the lowly and highly placed alike, Duane appeared boundlessly \nblessed.\n  Lawyer, businessman, political adviser, art and stamp collector, \nsport savant, historian for the San Francisco Giants, fishing boat \nskipper--no one could fillet a salmon with such aplomb--radio talk show \nhost, television commentator, Duane was a talented universalist--the \nproverbial Renaissance man.\n  Serious and thoughtful in his political analysis, witty and full of \nfun in conversation, a tenacious fighter for what he believed, yet \npractical and down-to-earth in his judgments, Duane was a true prodigy.\n  A giving man, always surprising friends with a gift--a stamp to a \ncollector, a baseball card from a hero of long-ago to a young fan--but \nas only the generous can, Duane brushed aside gratitude. ``It was \nnothing. Just thinking about you,'' he would say.\n  And he would mean it because he gave from his heart.\n  With him, everything was done with enthusiasm born of interest in \npeople and intensified by an endless curiosity about our world and our \nplace in history.\n  He took to the microphone of his talk show with the same unrestrained \ngusto as he would enter a private conversation with an old friend.\n  He never held back. He always gave his all. He drew unselfishly from \nhis knowledge and experience. Widely read and deeply thoughtful, he cut \nquickly and expertly to the heart of issues.\n  Certainly, I benefited from this ability as he advised me over the \nyears, most recently as the cochair of my campaign for the U.S. Senate.\n  His candor could be counted upon. His word was his absolute bond. His \nthought was as rich and inventive as any person I know.\n  Also, he was a good friend, a person of great warmth and compassion. \nHis mere walking into a room brought a brightness and warmth.\n  His bearish looming over a podium at a political dinner--and he was \nmaster of ceremonies at countless of them for me--was sure to give \ninstant vibrancy to festivities. He was a master not only of long range \nideas and concerns, but of the moment.\n  Actually, when his many talents and attributes are added together, \nthe sum seems larger than life.\n  That makes his loss all the greater.\n  A giant who suddenly, without hint or warning, silences himself \ninevitably conjures a mystery.\n  But even in death there can be no detraction from what he contributed \nto life, no diminution of his love for Patty and his daughters, Laura \nand Jessica; no devaluation in the worth of the counsel and friendship \nhe gave, or of the affection and respect he received in return. \n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\n  While we may never learn or understand why this ebullient man should \nend his life, we can never subtract from his accomplishments.\n  We may never fathom the why of death, but we shall always be thankful \nfor the fullness of his life.\n  Outwardly, Duane was the epitome of confidence and elan, seemingly so \nimpregnable. Whatever pain he felt, or doubts he had, remained \nconcealed behind the customary lift of his head and broad smile.\n  What drove him to that final, solitary walk on the Golden Gate Bridge \nmay elude us, but what we shall always know is his love for his family \nand his zest whenever he was on the other end of the phone, or sitting \nin the living room or booming his opinion on radio or television.\n  His life is what matters. His death is mere punctuation that makes \nclear the substance and meaning that came before.\n  Indeed, Duane seemed to have it all, and for those of us who knew him \nhe endlessly seemed to give his all.\n  So very much alive, so bursting with ideas, so expressive, so \nreaching out to help others, Duane, even now that he is gone, \nreverberates in our mind in endless reminders of the vigor and \nprinciple he brought to politics and other endeavors.\n  Campaign manager, advisor, counselor, invariably shrewd and \ninsightful, always helpful, thoroughly unselfish, unfailingly available \nand generous with his time, Duane Garrett was always there.\n  And always shall he be.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11046-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11047-S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  FOREIGN RELATIONS REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment to the \nForeign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 to assist the President in \nhis efforts to deal with the growing threat to American interests from \nIran. President Clinton clearly sought to address this threat with his \nMay 6 Executive order establishing a full United States embargo of \nIran. It is my hope that short of successfully encouraging other \nnations from trading with Iran, an extremely challenging task, the \nPresident will be able to use the authority in this amendment to \nencourage other countries to at least refrain from contributing to \nIranian weapons capability.\n  The 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, which I cosponsored \nwith then-Senator Gore, established sanctions against third parties \nwhich assist Iran and Iraq in their efforts to rebuild their weapons \ncapabilities. It was a start, but it did not go far enough. Efforts by \nSenator Lieberman and me last year to expand the legislation were \nunsuccessful.\n  The 1992 bill was intended to target not only the acquisition of \nconventional weapons, but weapons of mass destruction as well. In the \nprocess of amending the bill to the 1993 Defense Act, however, the \nexplicit references to weapons of mass destruction were dropped.\n  The amendment I am offering today attempts to make these applications \nabsolutely clear. It also removes from the proposed sanctions \nexceptions for assistance under the Freedom Support Act, thereby \nremoving the benefit of the doubt Congress gave Russia in 1992. As I \nwill explain later in my statement, Russia has used this exception to \nthe detriment of United States policy in the Persian Gulf.\n  To the current list of sanctions against persons assisting Iran and \nIraq in its weapons programs, which already include procurement and \nexport sanctions, the amendments we are offering today add the denial \nof visas, denial of commercial credit, and denial of authority to ship \nproducts across United States territory. To the list of sanctions \nagainst countries offering similar assistance, the amendment adds the \ndenial of licenses for export of nuclear material, denial of foreign \nmilitary sales, denial of the transfer of controlled technology, denial \nof the transfer of computer technology, suspension of the authority of \nforeign air carriers to fly to or from the United States, and a \nprohibition on vessels that enter the ports of sanctioned countries.\n  The threat from Iraq is not an immediate concern. The most important \naspect of our policy with regard to Iraq must be to remain firm on the \nU.N. embargo. But given the history of the Iraqi military buildup \nbefore the gulf war, the sanctions included in the Iran-Iraq Act may at \na later date be as important with regard to Iraq as they are currently \nin the case of Iran. Once the embargo is lifted, there will be a great \ntemptation for cash-strapped economies to resume sales of military \nhardware to Iraq. Outside forces may once again be compelled to \nmaintain a balance in the region through arms sales and a dangerous \nescalation of firepower.\n  It is also vitally important to prevent the reemergence of an Iraqi \nconventional military threat. One need only observe the origins of the \nweapons which constituted the Iraqi threat in 1990 to know that the key \nto any post-embargo containment strategy will depend on our ability to \ninfluence Iraq's trading partners in Europe, Russia, the People's \nRepublic of China, and North Korea.\n  The threat from Iran is more immediate. The Iranian buildup in the \nPersian Gulf is common knowledge. Its importation of hundreds of North \nKorean Scud-C missiles, its intention to acquire the Nodong North \nKorean missiles currently under development, and its efforts to develop \nnuclear weapons are well established--as is its conventional weapons \nbuildup.\n  Successive CIA directors, and Secretaries Perry and Christopher have \nall testified to the effect that Iran is engaged in an extensive effort \nto acquire nuclear weapons. In February, Russia signed an agreement to \nprovide Iran with a 1,000 megawatt light water nuclear reactor. The \nRussians indicate that they may soon agree to build as many as three \nmore reactors--another 1,000 megawatt reactor, and two 440 megawatt \nreactors.\n  I have raised my concerns regarding this sale with the administration \non a number of occasions. I have maintained that under the Freedom \nSupport Act of 1992, which the Iran Iraq Act of 1992 was intended to \nreinforce, the President must either terminate assistance to Russia or \nformally waive the requirement to invoke sanctions out of concern for \nthe national interest.\n  The State Department has informed me that ``to the best of its \nknowledge, Russia has not actually transferred relevant material, \nequipment, or technology to Iran,'' and so there is no need to consider \nsanctions. I have been further informed that they are ``examining the \nscope of the proposed Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran, and as \nappropriate, they will thoroughly evaluate the applicability of \nsanctions,'' presumably, if at a later date they can confirm the \ntransfer.\n  I have no reason to question the State Department's evaluation of the \nfacts on the ground. However, I would note that there have been public \nreports of as many as 220 Russians employed at the site of the proposed \nreactor. There seems to be a dangerously obscure standard for \ndetermining when material, equipment, or technology useful in the \nmanufacture of nuclear weapons has actually been transferred, \nespecially when as is the case with Iran, the reactor may already be \npartially complete.\n  At what point in the construction of the reactors does the transfer \nbecome significant? Do we allow the Russians to build portions of the \nreactor which do not strictly involve the transfer of dangerous \nequipment or technology while Iran obtains the most vital assistance \nfrom other sources? Although I cannot make this determination myself, \ncommon sense and an appropriate sense of caution would dictate that any \nassistance provided Iran in its efforts to acquire nuclear technology \nis significant.\n  The administration declined to identify the dispatch of technicians \nto the site as sufficient proof that a technology transfer was \noccurring. However, now that we are approaching the completion of site \ninspection and preparation, and nearing the start of the actual \nconstruction, it is my hope that the President will make another \nassessment of the situation.\n  I would point out that although the administration may have technical \ngrounds for arguing that it is not yet required to invoke sanctions, \nmaking a determination on the applicability of sanctions sooner rather \nthan later would serve as necessary leverage in resolving the issue. My \nintention is not to gut U.S. assistance to Russia. It is \n\n[[Page S11048]]\nto prevent Russia from providing Iran dangerous technology. Waiting to \nmake a determination until the transfer is complete defeats the purpose \nof the sanctions.\n  Ultimately, I fear that the reason the administration has not made a \ndetermination is that it does not want to jeopardize our relationship \nwith Russia.\n  Based on this assumption and anticipating that the State Department \nmay at a later date find other ways to avoid compliance with the \nFreedom Support Act, the legislation we are introducing today makes the \nPresident's legal responsibility under the act more explicit.\n  We sent our Armed Forces to war in the Persian Gulf once in this \ndecade. They endured hardship to themselves and their families. Some \nwill live with the injuries they suffered in service to our Nation for \nthe rest of their lives. And, as is the case with every war, some never \nreturned. With the cooperation of our friends in Europe, whose own \nsacrifices to the effort to free Kuwait should not be forgotten, we \nmust see that the service of these brave men and women was not in vain.\n  Stability and security in the Persian Gulf is vital to the world \neconomy and to our own national interests. Aggressors in the region \nshould know that if we must, we will return to the Persian Gulf with \nthe full force of Operation Desert Storm. At the same time, our friends \nand adversaries elsewhere in the world should understand that the \nUnited States will do everything in its power to preclude that \nnecessity. It is my sincere hope that his legislation will serve as an \nindication of just how serious we are.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11047-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11048-S11049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         DON'T ABANDON HANFORD\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Nation's nuclear facilities are being \nsingled out for strident criticism these days. The Hanford site in \nWashington State is one of those pointed to for its alleged waste and \ninefficiency. In fact, some of my distinguished colleagues have \nproposed legislation that would dramatically, fundamentally, and \nperhaps dangerously affect the principles which govern cleanup at \nHanford.\n  I am troubled by these criticisms, Mr. President, not because they do \nnot make some good points--for certainly, Hanford's cleanup operation \nis not perfect--but because they ignore two important factors: first, \nthat cleanup operations at Hanford are actually progressing; and \nsecond, that this Government has an obligation to help communities \nwhich contributed in no small part to our victories in World War Two \nand the cold war.\n  The massive undertaking to clean up nuclear waste at Hanford is \noverseen by what is known as the Tri-Party Agreement. This agreement, \nforged in 1989, includes the Department of Energy, the Washington State \nDepartment of Ecology, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \nand is showing itself to be an effective means for guiding cleanup. As \na recent article in the Tri-Cities Herald noted:\n\n       Many in the Northwest, including former adversaries, say \n     the pact is the engine driving cleanup and, while slow in the \n     beginning, it now is speeding the work along.\n\n  From safety to new technology to administrative savings, Hanford has \nmade great strides. I submit for the Record a list of Hanford's recent \naccomplishments from the Tri-Cities Herald. It shows how far Hanford \nhas come, and how the Tri-Party Agreement has influenced and moved \ncleanup efforts.\n  The Blush Report, a review of Hanford commissioned by my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Johnston, cited the Tri-Party Agreement \nas the primary obstacle to efficient cleanup. But that report was \nwrong. Just ask the people who signed the Tri-Party Agreement, the \ncontractors who follow its guidelines, and the people of Washington \nState who benefit from its success. For all its faults, the Tri-Party \nAgreement serves as a constant reminder to the Federal Government that \ncleanup at Hanford is a top priority.\n  And officials at Hanford are now looking to move 2,300 tons of spent \nnuclear fuel away from the Columbia River three years earlier than \noriginally planned. This is not only good for the environment, but for \nthe taxpayer as well--it may save as much as $120 million. Would the \nFederal Government, on its own, take the initiative like this and \nactually try to finish a project ahead of schedule? I have my doubts.\n  A unique example of innovation at Hanford is the use of \nmicroorganisms to get rid of pollution. These microscopic creatures \nare, according to DOE News, ``stimulated with a vinegar-like solution \nto 'eat' chemical pollutants such as carbon tetrachloride and \nnitrates.'' Mr. President, surely no one can say that Hanford is in the \ngrips of bureaucratic sclerosis when it enlists what one local paper \ncalls ``vinegar-swigging microbes\" in the fight against pollution.\n  I recently received a letter from Mr. Kenneth Kensington of Viatech, \nInc., in Hastings, MI. Viatech is cooperating with the Department of \nEnergy on certain aspects of the cleanup, and Mr. Kensington writes \nthat such cooperation is valuable not just to Hanford, but to the \nprivate sector and the advancement of research and development as well.\n  Administratively, Hanford is also making great strides. Last April \nmembers of the Tri-Party Agreement met in St. Louis to create a \n``Blueprint for Action and Cost Control.'' As the Tri-City Herald \nreports, ``[t]he officials at the St. Louis meeting examined how to \nbetter manage projects, reduce costs and increase competition, track \nsavings and streamline the regulatory process.''\n  Mr. President, this strategy goes hand-in-hand with the legislation \nmy fellow members of the Washington State delegation and I have \nintroduced to reform cleanup at Hanford.\n  There is, Mr. President, another aspect to this issue, and that is \nthe responsibility the United States of America has for supporting \nfacilities like Hanford which provided the manpower and the materials \nthat helped fight and win both World War Two and the Cold War.\n  Beginning in the 1940's, the Federal Government asked the Hanford \ncommunity to join in the effort to combat Japanese, then Soviet, \naggression. Hanford responded to the country's call, and performed its \ntask magnificently, producing the materials to build up our Nation's \ndefenses and face up to first the fascist and then the Communist \nthreat. Tens of thousands of men and women worked on this mission, each \ncontributing in their own way to American strength and security.\n  Now, Mr. President, as we all know, the cold war is won, communism is \nvanquished, and we should all be thankful for the hard work and \ndedication of people in communities like Hanford. After all, these \ncommunities sacrificed a great deal. At Hanford, thousands of tons of \nnuclear waste lie underground, the result of a decades-long nuclear \neffort. I understand, Mr. President, that some of my distinguished \ncolleagues may be concerned by the cost of cleanup at Hanford, but I \ncannot believe they would suggest that we simply turn our backs on the \npeople who never faltered in their duty to their country.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee approved funding \nfor Hanford for 1996. I was very pleased by this, Mr. President. But I \nam still concerned about Hanford's long-term situation. I am very \nconcerned that we stand by our commitments.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will consider this issue \ncarefully. I hope they will do what is right by the people of Hanford, \nand not, in their rush to save dollars, forget Hanford's invaluable \nservice to America.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article from the Tri-City Herald be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Tri-City Herald, July 2, 1995]\n\n Significant Accomplishments Have Been Made, Milestones Reached Since \n                     Signing of Tri-Party Agreement\n\n       Here's a rundown of major accomplishments at Hanford since \n     the Tri-Party Agreement was signed in 1989:\n       Hanford's highest risk--the ``burping'' tank 101-SY--was \n     resolved by installing a giant mixer pump that controls \n     releases of hydrogen gases from the tank.\n       Fabrication was completed on a spar pump, the second of its \n     kind for waste tank use.\n       Contaminated liquid discharges to the soil were eliminated.\n       K Basins, which hold highly radioactive used nuclear fuel, \n     were made earthquake-proof.\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\n       Forty million dollars was saved by selling nitric acid \n     stored in the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Finishing Plant to \n     British Nuclear Fuels in England.\n       Getting that nitric acid out of PUREX will cut 10 months \n     off the former chemical processing plant's deactivation \n     schedule. The first shipment of nitric acid arrived in Great \n     Britain this month. Two shipments will leave Hanford each \n     week until December, when all 190,000 gallons will have been \n     removed.\n       The Uranium Oxide Plant deactivation is done, which mean \n     the former processing plant is ready for final cleanup and \n     disposition. This project was done four months early and \n     $800,000 under budget. Deactivation reduced the annual cost \n     of maintenance from $4 million to $40,000.\n       This so-called interim sludge stabilization program was \n     completed at the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) 85 days \n     early. That was the first major step in the eventual cleanup \n     of the plant.\n       The work was done inside two small furnaces in a PFP \n     glovebox. Moist, chemically reactive plutonium scraped from \n     236 containers was heated to 1,000 degrees Celsius, \n     converting it into about 30 kilograms of impure plutonium \n     oxide that was sealed in containers and placed in PFP's \n     shielded vaults. Stabilizing this material reduced total \n     worker radiation exposures by 25 percent.\n       Fuel was removed from the Fast Flux Test Facility four \n     months ahead of schedule and $475,000 under budget.\n       An evaporator was constructed and has reduced the amount of \n     radioactive liquids in underground tanks from 61 million \n     gallons to 55\n      million gallons. By evaporating a portion of the water and \n     thus concentrating the remaining liquid waste in double-\n     shell tanks, there will be more available storage space \n     for wastes to be transferred out of other troublesome \n     tanks.\n       The extra tank space provided by the evaporation means six \n     new tanks, at an estimated cost of $378 million, won't be \n     needed.\n       With evaporation, only water is removed. The condensate \n     water is being piped to nearby basins to await final \n     processing.\n       In the N Reactor complex, 13 of 32 buildings have been \n     deactivated and are ready for final disposal. Cleanup of the \n     N Reactor's fuel basin is to be done in 1997.\n       Two effluent disposal facilities have been built in central \n     and southern Hanford to treat contaminated liquids. The \n     liquids will no longer be dumped into the soil; a practice \n     that began in 1943.\n       The 200 Area Treated Effluent Disposal Facility was $25 \n     million under budget and fulfilled 12 TPA milestones.\n       Reduced annual overhead costs by $200 million and \n     infrastructure costs by $22 million.\n       The $31 million Waste Sampling and Characterization \n     Facility was built, a laboratory to provide analysis of \n     Hanford's wastes. The complex includes an analytical \n     laboratory, nuclear spectroscopy laboratory and solid-waste \n     storage facility. Nonradioactive and low-level radioactive \n     samples can be analyzed, as can samples that cannot be sent \n     to commercial laboratories.\n       250,00 pounds of carbon tetrachloride will soon have been \n     removed from the soil in the 200 Areas, nearly 34 million \n     gallons of contaminated ground water will have been treated, \n     56,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil excavated and 52 \n     buildings decontaminated and decommissioned.\n       A new drilling technology now in use at Hanford is safer, \n     three times faster and minimizes wastes better than \n     conventional drilling methods while producing higher-quality \n     samples.\n       K Reactor water basins have been converted into fish-\n     rearing ponds to revive Columbia River\n      salmon runs. The project is in cooperation with the Yakama \n     Indian Nation.\n       The Hanford Advisory Board was created to provide public \n     direction on cleanup from stake-holders throughout the \n     Northwest.\n       A super landfill was created in central Hanford to receive \n     debris and soil from the planned riverside cleanup.\n       Numerous buildings, including the B Reactor water treatment \n     plant, have been demolished.\n       Construction is under way on the $230 million Environmental \n     and Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a 200,000-square-foot \n     building that will house equipment and programs to study \n     molecular interactions and likely will lead to improved \n     cleanup technology.\n       The Fitzner-Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology reserve and the \n     North Slope have been cleaned. Combined, they make up 45 \n     percent of the 560-square-mile site. The lands, which had \n     contained no radiological contamination, are to be turned \n     back to the public, but a debate continues on who will get \n     the land. By 1997, another 65 square miles along the Columbia \n     River will be available for other uses.\n       Additionally, several new technologies are in use. They \n     include:\n       Virtual reality, a simplified version of a special \n     stereoscopic viewing system to inspect Hanford tanks. The \n     system gives operators the feeling they're actually in the \n     tank looking for structural flaws.\n       A high-temperature melter system to allow for more ``waste \n     loading'' during eventual vitrification of tank waste. \n     Increased operating temperatures allow greater flexibility to \n     incorporate more volume of waste into the glass, thus \n     reducing the number of radioactive glass logs to be sent to a \n     permanent repository.\n       A device that for the first time measured the amount of gas \n     in tank 101-SY.\n       a tungsten ball, about the size of a softball, that has \n     been suspended into that tank on a wire cable to provide \n     information on the thickness of waste inside.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11048-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2033 \noffered by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Hutchison's amendment providing \nguidance to the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Conference on Women in \nBeijing is important for the signal it sends to the administration--and \nto the United Nations.\n  The upcoming Beijing Conference offers a smorgasbord for radicals who \nare constantly fighting against traditional family values--paid for, in \npart, by American taxpayers. Organizers of this U.N. Women's Conference \nare determined to peddle their bizarre views of the family and the role \nof women. There is already too much kowtowing to fringe elements at the \nUnited Nations in New York and that is why this amendment is necessary.\n  The Senator from Texas and the Senator from Indiana clearly explained \nthe amendment yesterday. It simply urges the U.S. delegation to the \nBeijing Conference to promote genuine women's rights and traditional \nfamily values, and not the agenda of a few activists who have captured \nthe hearts and minds of U.N. bureaucrats.\n  In all honesty, Mr. President, it is astounding that an amendment \neven needs to be offered to protect the institutions of motherhood and \nthe family. But, experience has shown that if Congress ignores the \nBeijing Conference, the United Nations will soon be pushing every \ncountry in the world to accept the United Nations strange notion of \nmotherhood and family and even gender.\n  Some ideas promoted in the Beijing Conference ``Platform for Action'' \nare too bizarre to be believed, as I will explain in a moment. But, the \nAmerican people know exactly what is going on, thanks to a multitude of \nnews stories in the Christian and secular media.\n  You may remember, Mr. President, that some folks--but not this \nSenator--were sold a worthless bill of goods before last year's U.N. \nConference on Population Control in Cairo. Senators and Congressmen \nwere assured, promised, and guaranteed that Cairo Conference organizers \nand the U.S. delegation would not promote abortion-on-demand as a so-\ncalled international ``reproductive right.'' But that is exactly what \nhappened thanks to Tim Wirth, who was being advised by former \nCongresswoman Bela Abzug.\n  Senator Hutchison's amendment does not address this issue. But, it \nshould come as no surprise that organizers of the Beijing Conference \nare determined to repeat what happened at the Cairo Conference--that \nis, they will attempt to coerce prolife foreign governments into \ncreating a so-called ``right'' to abortion-on-demand.\n  Making matters worse, Mr. President, is the fact that this conference \non women's issues is to take place in China of all places, where women \nare routinely forced to undergo abortions and sterilizations against \ntheir will, in the name of population control. Holding the Conference \nin China is nothing less than a slap in the face to women everywhere. \nIt sends the clear signal that the United Nations finds China's \ngrotesque behavior acceptable.\n  Lest anyone think that I have exaggerated the extent to which the \nUnited Nations has pandered to extremists, ask yourself why the word \n``mother'' is virtually nonexistent in the Conference ``Platform for \nAction'' document. This is a conference on women, after all. Conference \norganizers prefer ``caretaker.'' The reason: because they dare not \ncondemn--indeed they probably endorse--so-called homosexual marriages.\n  Ask yourself, Mr. President, why Beijing Conference organizers refuse \nto agree to a definition of the word ``gende'' as meaning only male and \nfemale. The United Nations apparently has decided that the world is \nmade up of five genders: male, female, homosexual, bisexual, and \ntranssexual--whatever that is. The U.N. Conference Secretariat stated \nthat, ``gender is relative.'' What in the world does that mean?\n  This administration is also on record stating that ``gender \ndifferences'' are ``cultural--changeable, variable.'' [AID ``Gender \nAnalysis Tool Kit'']. And what is worse, Mr. President, they arrogantly \nwant to shove this nonsense down the throats of American taxpayers, and \nask them to pay for it.\n  It is obvious what is going on. These strange ideas and values may be \nacceptable to U.N. bureaucrats or even to some in this administration, \nbut they are not acceptable to the American people, and that is why \nthis amendment is important. I urge Senators to support Senator \nHutchison's amendment.\n  It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator, the manager on \nthe other side, is willing to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have looked at this amendment. We will \nbe happy to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2033) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2041\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the consolidation \n and reinvention of the foreign affairs agencies of the United States)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it \nbe stated. It is already at the desk. I ask that the clerk read it \nslowly because the amendment speaks for itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2041.\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONSOLIDATION AND \n                   REINVENTION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that it is necessary in \n     order to make the Government more efficient and to realize \n     significant budgetary savings for the American taxpayer--\n       (1) to consolidate and reinvent foreign affairs agencies of \n     the United States within the Department of State;\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\n       (2) to provide for the reorganization of the Department of \n     State to maximize efficient use of resources, eliminate \n     redundancy in functions, and improve the management of the \n     Department of State;\n       (3) to assist congressional efforts to balance the Federal \n     budget by the year 2002;\n       (4) to ensure that the international affairs budget \n     function shoulders an appropriate share of the reductions in \n     United States Government spending necessary to eliminate the \n     $4,800,000,000,000 budget deficit; and\n       (5) to strengthen--\n       (A) the coordination of United States foreign policy;\n       (B) the leading role of the Secretary of State in the \n     formulation and articulation of United States foreign policy;\n       (C) the authority of United States ambassadors over all \n     United States Government personnel and resources located in \n     United States diplomatic missions, in order to enhance the \n     ability of the ambassadors to deploy those resources to the \n     best effect that will attain the President's foreign policy \n     objectives; and\n       (D) the United States Foreign Service, as the forward \n     deployed civilian force of the United States Government, \n     through renewed emphasis on the original principles which \n     undergird the distinct Foreign Service personnel system. \n     These include worldwide availability, assignments based on \n     the needs of the service, rank in person, and merit-based \n     advancement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) consolidate within the Department of State, or \n     eliminate, such duplicative, overlapping, or superfluous \n     personnel, functions, goals, activities, offices, and \n     programs that the United States Arms Control and Disarmament \n     Agency, the United States Information Agency, and the Agency \n     for International Development have in common with the \n     Department of State in order to realize a budgetary savings \n     to the American taxpayer of at least $3,000,000,000 during \n     fiscal years 1996 through 1999;\n       (2) encourage the United States foreign affairs agencies to \n     maintain a high percentage of the best qualified, most \n     competent American citizens serving in the United States \n     Government while downsizing significantly the total number of \n     people employed by these agencies; and\n       (3) ensure that all functions of diplomacy be subject to \n     recruitment, training, assignment, promotion and egress based \n     on common standards and procedures, with maximum interchange \n     among the functions.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if ever an amendment submitted in this Senate spoke \nfor itself, this one does. That is why I asked the able clerk to read \nit in its entirety. And if there is a Senator who can offer an \nequivalent savings while preserving foreign affairs programs, I ask \nthat Senator, whomever he or she may be, to do so.\n  The point is, and the fact is, they cannot do it. It cannot be done. \nSo we are playing games with this business of not voting cloture and \nproceeding on this bill in concert with the administration, which has \nset out at the outset to say we will delay, we will obfuscate, we will \ndo everything to block this bill. That is what is going on.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. We do not need anybody \nexcept the two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, I yield the floor, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina. Let me say to my friend from North Carolina that I \nthink it is unfortunate that within a mere matter of hours on a bill we \nproceed to a cloture vote and behave as if somehow there is a major \neffort to delay a bill. I think there are 139 amendments on this bill--\n139 amendments; 94 of them--it is now 144 amendments--94 of them are \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle. Most of them are from my \ncolleague from North Carolina.\n  So to suggest that a bill that was laid down yesterday--was laid down \nFriday afternoon, to be technically correct--but first debated \nyesterday for a few hours, beginning at 2 o'clock in the afternoon is \nnow suddenly, on Tuesday morning, the subject of some kind of delay \nconfuses me and, in fact, I think sort of does an injustice to the \nlegislative process.\n  This is a very important bill. It represents a major overhaul of the \nmeans by which the United States of America delivers all of its foreign \npolicy effort in the world. It has the most significant reorganization \nin it in modern history. It has some $3 billion-plus of cuts. It is a \nvery significant altering of the mechanism of foreign policy.\n  There are many people in the U.S. Senate, Mr. President, who feel \nthat it runs roughshod over the constitutional prerogatives of the \nPresident of the United States. Let me give you an example. I think \nevery word of the amendment that the Senator just put in, with the \nexception of maybe five, I would support.\n  I think it is a very strong statement of what the Secretary of State \nought to do. It is a very strong statement, an exhortation to \nreorganization, we should do that. But it has a specificity as to a \nparticular department or a particular movement that we have suggested \nin keeping with constitutional prerogatives of the President ought to \nbe decided by the President.\n  All we are suggesting is give the President a mandate from the \nCongress to make the cuts, but allow the President to determine exactly \nhow they are going to be made.\n  I can remember my friends on the other side of the aisle over the \nyears that President Reagan and President Bush were in office \nconsistently coming to the floor and saying, ``Get the cotton-picking \nmicromanaging hands out of the administrative process. Congress \nshouldn't micromanage. Congress shouldn't decide every single movement \nof personnel. There ought to be some administrative capacity here.''\n  Here we are suddenly, because President Clinton is in office, and we \nare going totally role reversal back on all of those restraints on \nmicroman- \nagement, and we are telling them, ``You have to specifically get rid of \nthis department, you have to put it here; you have to get rid of this \ndepartment, you have to put it here; you have to get rid of this \ndepartment, you have to put it here.''\n  Now, all we have suggested is this would not be a problem if we came \nto the floor and adopted a compromise that was proposed by the \nadministration and Democrats, which would have suggested, look, give \nthe President a mandate for consolidation, but allow the President to \ndecide what he wants to consolidate and where, how it best will \nfunction.\n  Here there is a mandate that you put certain departments within the \nDepartment of State when all of the former Secretaries of State have \nsaid, while they may be in favor of the concept, they have no \nconfidence that the current State Department has the capacity to effect \nit. We have not addressed that here. There is nothing that deals with \nthe capacity of Foreign Service officers to pick up these particular \nmissions. There is nothing that deals with the capacity of these \nmissions to be effected within the context of the State Department. So \nwhile, on the one hand, you are making this enormous shift, there is no \ncommensurate administrative capacity or enablement to be able to \nactually implement the shift.\n  So I just say to my friend, this is an effort to legislate, not an \neffort to delay. Legislating is what we ought to do. We are supposed to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and make some wise decisions about how \nto best demand change or mandate it and how best to make these savings.\n  I wonder if my friend from North Carolina would be willing to mandate \nthe savings but take out the specificity and simply say we are going to \ntry to find X amount of savings within this Department in order to try \nto reduce the budget, but leave up to the President the capacity to be \nable to choose where that might occur.\n  May I ask my friend from North Carolina--turning to his sense-of-the-\nSenate request on page 3, reading at line 15, paragraph 1, the Senator \nsays, ``It is the sense of the Congress that the President should \nconsolidate within the Department of State or eliminate * * *.'' --I \nwonder if the Senator intends that it be an option of one or the other, \njust to clarify.\n  Mr. HELMS. Well, I say to the Senator, I have a corrected amendment \nhere, and to call for the regular order on amendment 2031, I will send \na second-degree amendment----\n  Mr. KERRY. I have asked a question of the Senator. But I do have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course you do. But I thought you wanted a remedy.\n  \n[[Page S11052]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I wanted to know what his intention was before I give up \nthe floor for any further action. I am trying to find out the status of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will answer that in due time, I say to the distinguished \nSenator. If he yields the floor, I will do it right this minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would like to just pursue a few thoughts, Mr. President, \nbefore we perfect this. I gather now that it does need an amendment, \nneeds to be perfected. I may not object to that. I want to clarify what \nit is we are precisely talking about.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield, why do you not put in a quorum \ncall, we will discuss it, and I think he will agree to the \nmodification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will do that in a moment in order to try \nto see if we can make an agreement on this. The Senator from \nConnecticut was here a moment ago. I know he wanted to address this \nparticular amendment. So I am hopeful to give him that opportunity. I \nsimply say to my friend again--and we can discuss this privately while \nin a quorum call--it is something we have had some discussion on in the \npast. I personally am not averse to some kind of consolidation, and I \nhave said that to the Senator. I personally think that there are ways \nto more effectively deliver the interests of the United States through \nour foreign policy establishment.\n  I do not think that this particular recommendation ought to be \ntreated lightly, and I have never suggested that. What I do think is \nthat we should try to construct a mechanism which affords the \nadministration the maximum amount of flexibility in keeping with the \nnotion that it is really their responsibility to decide which ``t'' to \ncross and which ``i'' to dot. I think, as the Senator from Connecticut \nwill demonstrate, there are very strong feelings here about one \nparticular shift versus another. So I ask my friend if, rather than \nputting in a quorum call, he and I could spend a minute visiting while \nthe Senator from Connecticut addresses the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is a call of the Chair. We have two Senators seeking \nrecognition. I will leave that to the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I certainly want to speak to this amendment and to the \nissue of consolidation, because I think it is more. As I said yesterday \nin my opening statement, I thought it was essential that there should \nbe bipartisanship on this consolidation. This is not a new issue. In \nfact, Secretary of State Christopher had recommended this originally, \nonly to be rejected in the inner-agency process. The Vice President has \nsaid through the process of reinventing Government he recommended and, \nin fact, said they would submit a proposal to the Congress that would \nyield $5 billion in savings through the consolidation, through the \nmerging and streamlining within the State Department and its related \nagencies. We have yet to see that proposal.\n  There has been no proposal forthcoming from the administration to \nachieve the goals that are outlined in the authorization in this \namendment before us today, or as mandated by the budget resolution that \npassed the Congress. We have a certain mandate to meet specific funding \nlevels for the 150 account, and the consolidation helps us to reach \nthat goal. So the administration, for the last 5 or 6 months, has not \nworked with the committee on this consolidation proposal in any \nfashion. They have not been proactive; they have not made \nrecommendations. They simply rejected the idea of any consolidation. \nThis is not a new issue.\n  Five former Secretaries of State did support this proposal. The fact \nis, they were not reticent in their support for this proposal. Former \nSecretary of State Eagleburger said that this consolidation was \nnecessary in order to change the focus at the top within the State \nDepartment. This would be the impetus for creating the change that is \nnecessary for this consolidation to work and that it was vital because \nthe State Department was going to have to approach its own agenda \ndifferently in advancing foreign policy goals.\n  After rejecting the Secretary of State's plan within the \nadministration, the only proposal the administration made with respect \nto consolidation and merging were two small elements within the \ndepartment. One was consolidating the State Department and the USIA \nOffice of Inspector General and a merger of the State Department Office \nof Foreign Missions and the Bureau for Diplomatic Security. That was \nit.\n  So we are now saying that we are going to move forward with the \nproposal. But that still could include the administration's proposal \nbecause the mechanism that is included in this legislation allows the \nPresident to propose alternatives or refinements to this plan and is \nrequired to submit a reorganization plan for each agency that would be \nconsidered by Congress by a resolution of approval under expedited \nprocedures.\n  So we give the President the opportunity to address this particular \nconsolidation plan. But today they have been silent. So I think that we \nhave an obligation to move forward on this issue because five former \nSecretaries of State said this is the direction we should take in order \nto reintegrate these policy functions,\n but also to make sure that we revitalize these agencies and these \nfunctions. That is what is important.\n\n  We have provided a detailed way in which to streamline and \nconsolidate the funding and personnel of foreign affairs agencies.\n  We need to take that approach. The administration, and I know that no \none thinks that we should dictate to the administration as to how we \nshould consolidate, but the President has a right to offer a plan. It \nis not just going to be this President who will be affected by this \nconsolidation. It is not aimed at a Democratic President by a \nRepublican Congress, because future Presidents--certainly I hope there \nwill be future Republican Presidents--will also have to live under this \nconsolidation proposal.\n  I said yesterday it is not a Republican plan, it is not a Democratic \nplan. It is an American plan as to how to make the State Department \nmore efficient and function more effectively in administering our \nforeign policy goals.\n  I hope we can support this consolidation. I think it is worthwhile \nfor the future. We have had a number of people who testified before the \nsubcommittee, suggesting this would be the appropriate approach to \ntake. We have to look differently at the way in which we handle our \ngoals within the State Department.\n  It is the end of the cold war. We have to make a transition to a \nbalanced budget. We have to consider new approaches.\n  This requires us to look at the kind of consolidation and integration \nin our foreign affairs infrastructure that will be more flexible and \ncost effective. I think that is what is so important. We need a more \nflexible foreign policy structure. That is why it requires us to \nintegrate our program decisions with changing, and frequently changing, \npolicy goals.\n  It was less of a problem before the cold war ended. We had a single \nparticular focus. Today, that is not the case. What was the rule is now \nthe exception. What was the exception is now the rule. That is why this \nconsolidation is so essential.\n  I hope that rather than engaging and saying this is a partisan \napproach, we want it to be a bipartisan approach. Unfortunately, the \nadministration was unwilling to be forthcoming in any suggestions, \nother than to say they were opposed to it. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Frederic \nS. Baron, a Pearson fellow in my office, be permitted privileges of the \nfloor for the duration of the debate on S. 908 and S. 961.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a number of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle have focused with some seriousness on the questions raised in \nthis bill. The amendment currently before the Senate, offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina, is, of course, a serious proposal and \ndeserves the kind of reasoned consideration that our colleague from \nMassachusetts has described.\n  I rise to speak about the impact of the bill before the Senate on one \nparticular agency, which is the U.S. Information Agency, and to make \nthe case, \n\n[[Page S11053]]\nrespectfully, to my colleagues and to the chairman of the committee and \nmembers who come forth with this proposal, why I believe the USIA \nuniquely should not be consolidated as part of the State Department, \nalthough the general request for consolidation I think is a very worthy \none.\n  Mr. President, I suppose I could spend this time explaining and \ndefending the work of the USIA. It is a modest but highly effective \nforeign affairs agency. I do first want to say that I believe more is \nat issue here than just the work of the USIA.\n  The proposal to consolidate or perhaps to abolish the USIA presents \nanother opportunity in this debate to address the choice that has been \nreferred to here on the floor that we face at this juncture in our \nhistory between two profoundly different views of America's role in the \npost-cold-war world.\n  The choice, put simply, is this: Will America remain involved and \nlead in shaping the values and ideas, the military realities and the \nmarkets of the modern world? Will we continue to reach out in search of \neconomic opportunities, cultural enrichment, and the alliances that \nstrengthen our national security? Or will we step back and become a \ndetached and reactive power that regards the wider world chiefly as a \nsource of difficulty and danger?\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that on both sides of the aisle here \nthe overwhelming majority of my colleagues have chosen the former \ncourse, which is to say staying involved in the world, exercising \nAmerica's leadership role in the world, because that is not only the \ncorrect course but the realistic course.\n  Having made that choice, it seems to me that we are then left with \nthe question of methods. What is the method we choose to remain \ninvolved and to remain the leader of the world, not just the free \nworld, but the world overall?\n  Mr. President, I understand that some of my colleagues who share my \nconcern for maintaining America's involvement and leadership have \nreservations about some aspects of our foreign aid program, including \nour involvement in the United Nations and other international \ninstitutions.\n  Mr. President, I want to respectfully suggest that for anyone who \nthinks that America must lead in today's world, it does not make common \nsense to favor the consolidation of the functions of the USIA to the \nDepartment of State, or certainly not to favor the abolition of the \nUSIA. In fact, if we reduce our foreign aid and scale back our \ninvolvement in other multilateral organizations, as other parts of the \nbill before the Senate would do, I suggest that we will even have a \ngreater need for a more robust, and I might say agile, USIA.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nHelms, and his committee, I say, have acted on a sound impulse, which \nis that we do need a searching reappraisal of the way we conduct our \nforeign policy in the post-cold-war era. The committee has produced a \ncoherent, centralized, new architecture for our foreign affairs \nagencies.\n  However, no organization is an end in itself. Organizations are tools \nthat we create to carry out our strategic and moral purposes as a \nnation. What are the goals? What is the strategy that the new \ncentralized foreign affairs edifice laid out in this bill is meant to \nserve?\n  It is, indeed, an impressive organization, but I think we have to \ncontinue to come back and ask, What is its purpose? In that sense, what \nis our purpose--our American purpose--in the world, after the cold war?\n  Today, the cold war that possessed our thinking and our energies for \nfour decades is over. The period of conflict with aggressive global \ntotalitarianism reaches back another generation even beyond the \nbeginning of the cold war. That is at an end. We are grappling with \nlarge and difficult questions about what role America should play in \nthe world that go deeper than our country has faced for over a half \ncentury.\n  Now, the problems we face in developing a broad foreign policy to \nguide us into the next century are extraordinarily difficult. As was \nclear on the Senate floor last week in the debate on Bosnia, we have \nnot yet reached a universal consensus about just when and how and under \nwhat circumstances the United States should exert its power and \nprestige in world affairs.\n  But disagree as we may about the specifics, so far as I have \nsuggested a moment ago, I think we have maintained a remarkably broad \nconsensus about one thing; that is, that the United States must \ncontinue our engagement with the world and must retain the capacity to \nlead, not out of the goodness of our hearts, but in the interests of \nour security and our principles.\n  That brings me back to the proposed consolidation or abolition of the \nU.S. Information Agency. Why is this such a key matter--an issue that I \npersonally regard as a fork in the foreign policy road?\n  Mr. President, although we are searching for a new course for the \nfuture, I want to argue here that we should not abandon existing \ninstitutions just because they were developed during the cold war. \nRather, we should profit from our experience in the cold war, which \nwas, obviously, a very difficult and trying experience, but it was \nultimately a successful experience.\n Where once we faced the Soviet Empire and feared a third world war, \nnow, democracy and free market systems are establishing themselves from \nVilnius to Vladivostok.\n\n  It is clear our military might was central to our success in the cold \nwar. So, too, was the skill and perseverance of our diplomats and \nnegotiators, and our political leaders. But what else ultimately helped \nus win this struggle that we sometimes overlook? My answer to that is \nthat we engaged people, not just governments, but the people of the \nnations who were our potential adversaries in debate and discussion \nabout the values, ideas and interests that guide the United States in \nworld affairs. Our not-so-secret weapon here in the cold war was \ninformation and contact with people throughout the world, particularly \nthose living under totalitarian regimes with the democratic world.\n  I think that had an enormous influence and helped and inspired \npeoples who were captive behind totalitarian walls to sustain their \nhopes and ultimately to rise up and create the pressure that \nmiraculously crumbled the Berlin wall and all that it represented.\n  Mr. President, rather than wiping our foreign policy slate clean, I \nthink we should draw upon the successes of the past to develop the \nforeign policy strategies for America's future. We must do this work \ntogether. Republican administrations can and should take credit for \nsome of the great successes of public diplomacy which have enduring \nrelevance today. The Reagan administration revived our understanding of \nthe importance of values, ideas, and information in international \naffairs, and strongly supported the independent role of the USIA in \nconveying those values, ideas, and information. Far from losing \nimportance, our values, ideas, and information--and an independent \nUSIA--I think will be even more crucial as we chart our course in the \nnext phase of world history after the cold war.\n  This new world is ever more democratic, ever more integrated into a \nglobal market economy, ever more linked by electronic communications. \nIn such a world, relations among governments obviously remain \nimportant. But, frankly, such government-to-government relations simply \ndo not matter as much as they did before. Increasingly, I believe, \nrelations between countries will depend, as they have in the recent \npast, upon the perceptions and interests of the public within those \ncountries, and particularly of what might be called key subsections of \nthe public within those countries--political and intellectual elites, \nare two examples.\n  So, U.S. foreign policy in the next phase, with communications \nparticularly growing as rapidly and in as revolutionary a fashion as \nthey do today, must go beyond government-to-government relations and \nreach the people of the world.\n  We always say the world is a small world. It is a dramatically \nsmaller world today. When I can sit at my personal computer--I have \njust been educated in the last several months--and try to reach one of \nmy children who is at school in Boston, in the State of my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, and find I cannot get into the so-called ``Gopher'' \nindex to Massachusetts, so I go to the worldwide index of indexes and I \nam instructed to go through the index \n\n[[Page S11054]]\nof the University of Southern Australia in Perth, find an opening \nthere, then go to North America, then to the United States, then to \nMassachusetts, then, at the risk of offending my colleague and alumnus \nof Yale, to Harvard, then to my son's room--and all of that happening \nin about 20 seconds--it is a very, very small world indeed.\n  We all know one of the forces that brought the Berlin wall crumbling \ndown was the availability of knowledge within the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union and Eastern Europe about what was happening \nelsewhere, knowledge that they obtained in ways that could not be \nstopped by the dictators. They obtained it over the radio and they \nobtained increasingly over the fax machine and the personal computer.\n  So the central roles of the Department of State as I see them are to \ndevelop our overall foreign policy and manage the relations our \nGovernment has with the governments of other countries. The Department \nof State, obviously, has extraordinary experience and skill at the work \nof government-to-government relations. But, as a recent statement by \nFreedom House put it: ``Public diplomacy--which is to say--our open \nefforts to win understanding and support among the peoples of foreign \ncountries on matters that affect U.S. national interests--suffers when \nit is subordinated to the demands of formal diplomacy.''\n  This Freedom House statement is a remarkable statement for its \ncontent and those who have signed it. It lays out in greater detail the \nargument for the separation of public diplomacy from formal diplomacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Freedom House letter \non the USIA be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this statement is especially impressive \nfor the list of leaders in America's foreign affairs community who have \nendorsed it--a list that includes Democrats and Republicans, \nconservatives and liberals. The signatories include, and it is a large \nlist, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Adviser in the \nCarter administration, Dr. Edward Feulner of the Heritage Foundation, \nour distinguished former colleague, Senator Malcolm Wallop, Lane \nKirkland, President of the AFL-CIO, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr, and \nAmbassadors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Andrew Young, all signing this \nstatement. A remarkable group, reflecting a broad consensus across \nideological and partisan lines in the foreign policy leadership of our \ncountry, in favor of keeping the USIA independent and strong, not \nconsolidating it into the State Department.\n  These opinion leaders base this judgment on long, practical \nexperience in the tough work of international relations. They \nrecognize, and I quote again from their statement: ``The culture of the \nState Department differs substantially from the culture of USIA.'' \nFormal diplomacy requires quiet, sometimes even secret negotiation; \ncareful attention to consistency, nuance and form; and a willingness to \ncontinue even when the pace is painfully slow. That is the work of the \nState Department. Public diplomacy--the work of the USIA--requires \nopenness, rapid response, and a willingness to put aside differences in \norder to make the most of agreement on broader themes that are shared \nby people throughout the world.\n  It says the obvious to say I have the highest respect for the foreign \npolicy and diplomatic professionals of the Department of State. But \ntheir training and their experience, in my opinion, does not prepare \nthem for the work in the informational environment, in the \ncommunications environment, the public-to-public environment, in which \nUSIA and its officers and employees operate.\n  Let me say, responding to what has been said here a while ago, that \nthe President and the Secretary of State should clearly determine the \nforeign policy of the United States. It is in the management and \nimplementation of that policy that I believe the distinctions between \nformal and public diplomacy, between the State Department and an \nindependent USIA, have their importance. It is in the management and \nimplementation that the differences in organizational cultures add \ntheir respective values to the product.\n  The value of distinct organizational cultures is no novel, New Age \nidea. It was grasped by President Eisenhower when he founded USIA, and \nhas proven itself in foreign affairs, now, for more than 40 years.\n  Operational autonomy is increasingly followed by corporations and \nother large financial institutions in the private sector. Centralized, \npyramidal structures are what modern management is, frankly, trying to \navoid. Teamwork is a recipe for success in both the public and private \nsectors. And the essence of teamwork, as it is understood in the modern \norganizational context, is in using the different talents of the \ndifferent members of the team in working to achieve a common goal. That \nis why I believe, here, organizationally, the better course is to leave \nUSIA independent.\n  As so many have said before me in this debate, victory in the cold \nwar presents the United States with rare new opportunities. To grasp \nthese opportunities, to advance our national interests and our moral \nprinciples, a more forward-positioned, engaged in aggressive economic, \npolitical, cultural, and communications, stance is required. The new \nworld we face also holds many challenges and dangers and obviously we \nmust be prepared to meet them. But I think we can best overcome those \nchallenges and avert or mitigate those dangers and build a more stable, \npeaceful, and democratic international environment through purposeful \nengagement--engagement which is enhanced by the kind of active public \ndiplomacy that an independent USIA can carry out.\n  What we now have is a plurality of means for engaging the wider \nworld, and presenting American policy and projecting American interests \nand principles to different audiences, and one might say different \nconsumers, worldwide. USIA inhabits the realms of the media, of \neducation, of what we are happy to call in this country civil society, \nand what we are hoping to help develop in many of the fledgling new \ndemocracies that were former wards of the Soviet Union.\n  The USIA, incidentally, Mr. President, serves all agencies of the \nU.S. Government, not just the Department of State--but Commerce, \nJustice, Treasury, Defense, and others.\n  It is useful, I think, to all involved, that the USIA's program stand \nat one removed from the government-to-government functions carried on \nby the Department of State. When the Voice of America carries a news \nbroadcast on a subject that is of some discomfort to a foreign \ngovernment, is it not a good thing that our Ambassador can honestly say \nthat the Voice of America is not controlled by--or organizationally \naligned with--the Department of State?\n  Or to give another example, when one of our exchange programs brings \na scholar from a foreign country to the United States who may be out of \nfavor with the government of his country, is it not helpful that our \nambassador can point out that the USIA, which has brought this scholar \nto America, is separate from the Department of State? And when that \ndissident goes home, will he or she not find it useful honestly to \nassert that their visit to the United States was not a foreign policy \nmission in behalf of the Department of State?\n  Mr. President, this formal separation is central I think to the \ncredibility of our exchange and broadcast programs which have so well \nserved America's interest in the cold war, which have so well served \nthe interests and the aspirations of people living behind the Iron \nCurtain during the cold war and can so well serve people throughout the \nworld who still yearn to be free?\n  People listening to USIA broadcasts around the world know that they \nare not hearing a propaganda instrument of the State Department but an \nindependent voice--incidentally, a voice speaking so often in their \nlanguage--reporting on world events and reflecting the views and values \nof the American people and helping make links between them in this \ncountry and the people of this country.\n  Mr. President, the United States Information Agency should not be \npart of the reorganization of foreign affairs agencies that are central \nto this bill. I say that respectfully. One of the \n\n[[Page S11055]]\namendments that I have filed among the 144 that are filed would remove \nthe USIA from the consolidation aspects of this bill, with the minor \nexception of the consolidation of inspector general functions, and \nwould maintain the USIA as an effective and independent agency.\n  We learned in the cold war that persuasion and involvement with \npeoples is the most powerful instrument that American democracy has in \nforeign affairs. The power of an idea, the power of an American idea, \nof the American idea conveyed to people around the world, ultimately is \nwhat cracked the Berlin wall. The kind of engagement USIA had, for \ninstance, with Solidarnosc--not just with people generally, but with \nspecific heroes in the fight for freedom--with Solidarity in Poland or \nwith the pro-democracy movements in Central America is the kind of \nengagement we need today throughout the world, and particularly, may I \nsay, with the coming generation of leaders in China and with the \nmodernizers in the Islamic world.\n  This is no time to pull back and stop speaking to the people of the \nworld and their future leaders. This is the time to continue effective \npublic diplomacy through the USIA--independent and strong--to meet new \nchallenges, seize new opportunities, and advance America's principles \nand strategic interests throughout the world.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From Roll Call, May 11, 1995]\n\n                  The Future of U.S. Public Diplomacy\n\n       New proposals have been advanced to place the United States \n     Information Agency (USIA)--long the chief instrument of \n     American public diplomacy--under the centralized control of \n     the State Department. We believe this proposed consolidation \n     and centralization would weaken American public diplomacy.\n       Why should the USIA remain independent? Through its \n     broadcasting, numerous exchange programs and links with \n     people throughout the world, it already is highly successful \n     in promoting American interests and articulating who we are \n     and how our policies and values are shaped. The State \n     Department has a different though related role. It explains \n     U.S. foreign policy to Americans and presents our \n     government's official positions to foreign governments. The \n     State Department values quiet negotiations, government-to-\n     government contacts, protracted discussion, compromise and \n     sometimes secrecy. A credible public diplomacy, by contrast, \n     requires openness, the ability to respond quickly to rapidly \n     changing world events, and independence in reporting, \n     analysis and comment. In short, the culture of the State \n     Department differs substantially from the culture of the \n     USIA.\n       There are other important reasons to retain the USIA's \n     present status.\n       Public diplomacy and formal diplomacy. While formal \n     diplomatic relations conducted by the State Department are an \n     important aspect of our government's diverse engagement with \n     other societies, public diplomacy--our open efforts to win \n     understanding and support among the peoples of foreign \n     countries on matters that affect U.S. national interests--\n     suffers when it is subordinated to the demands of formal \n     diplomacy. We have long-term interests in developing flexible \n     relationships with foreign educators, journalists, cultural \n     leaders, minority and opposition leaders that must not be \n     subjected to the daily pressures of official government-to-\n     government affairs. USIA has filled this niche by setting up \n     exchanges that introduce foreign representatives to U.S. \n     governmental, nongovernmental, private, business and cultural \n     institutions.\n       American values: independent voices, one theme. The \n     promotion of American political and economic values has been \n     an auspicious aspect of our foreign policy in recent times. \n     The spread of democracy and the global communication \n     revolution indicate that this form of engagement in foreign \n     affairs will be of great importance in the future. \n     Diversification and independence--not centralization and \n     uniformity--make the U.S.'s message more meaningful and \n     credible. The USIA's broadcasting and exchange programs \n     should remain free of interference from officials with \n     responsibilities in other areas. Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty, Voice of America and Radio Marti remains vital \n     sources of information around the world. In East Central \n     Europe and the former Soviet Union (where independent media \n     continue to face difficulties) RFE/RI is trusted precisely \n     because of its journalistic integrity. This would be \n     seriously compromised if they were perceived as official \n     organs of State Department policy.\n       Re-orientation before re-organization. The structure of our \n     foreign affairs agencies needs to be considered in light of \n     America's global strategy in a rapidly changing international \n     environment. Reorganization not rooted in a clear and \n     comprehensive understanding and consensus about goals and \n     missions cannot work or last. The USIA and federally-funded \n     international broadcasting have track records of success and \n     will continue to work. Indeed, with today's menacing \n     phenomena of international criminal activity, terrorism, \n     inter-ethnic hatreds and anti-democratic forces around the \n     world, the work of USIA is more critical than ever.\n       We understand that there will have to be some significant \n     reorganization and re-prioritization in foreign policy. Those \n     who have offered proposals for change have done some service. \n     The world has changed, in no small measure because of our \n     multilayered and multi-faceted foreign policy structures. Our \n     goal should be coordination between agencies, not the kind of \n     consolidated administrative centralism that will not work. \n     The task of the State Department and the public diplomacy \n     agencies should nurture one another, but must remain separate \n     to be truly effective.\n         Ned W.

Zogby, President, Arab American Institute.\n\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Connecticut for \na very thoughtful statement not just about USIA, but most importantly \nabout the overall changes that are taking place in the world and the \nimplications for the United States and for our foreign policy.\n  I think he has demonstrated the vision that is essential to any kind \nof decisionmaking with respect to the shuffling of the parts of our \nforeign public diplomacy effort. So I thank him for having shared those \nthoughts with us and I think provided a very important and credible \nstatement with respect to this issue.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express further, following up on some \nof the things that the Senator from Connecticut has said, I think it is \nreally important for us to understand, the United Nations \nparticularly--and for a lot of appropriate reasons, I might add--the \nadministration of the United Nations has been just sort of a morass \nwithout any seeming sense of concern or culpability, although I think \nin the last year perhaps the message may be beginning to get through.\n  But clearly, the ineffectiveness of the United Nations with respect \nto certain concerns, notwithstanding great successes, has clouded the \nimage of that institution in its 50th anniversary so that for a lot of \nAmericans, it is a very quick take. They think of foreign policy and \nthey tend to think not of a global climate change treaty, not of the \nMontreal protocol which will reduce CFC's in the air and help to \npreserve the ozone layer, they do not think about the treaty to \npreserve Antarctica or the treaties with respect to arms control \nthrough the years that made an enormous difference in helping to win \nthe cold war; they tend to think of the big symbols, and generally \nspeaking, the symbols of either confusion or sometimes failure.\n  The result is, if you want to get a good applause line when you go \nhome and give a speech, you can very quickly pick up a line that talks \nabout how you should not be giving aid to other countries, that the aid \nought to be coming back, you know, to whatever city in one State. If \nyou say that when you are in a particular place, people are quick to \nrespond and say, ``Boy, that is right. We ought to be get that money, \nnot these other folks.'' And in some cases, unfortunately, it is true. \nAID and others have had some programs sometimes that lack \naccountability.\n  But name for me the corporation in America that has not sometimes had \nan advertising campaign that has been overboard or an excess of expense \naccounts or an excess in departments. Most of the great buy-outs of the \n1980's were predicated on a lot of those far too expansive corporate \nbudgets where value was not limited and people saw that they had an \nopportunity to come in, pare down, create a far more productive entity, \nraise the share value, and sell it for a killing. Indeed, that happened \nover and over again.\n  This is no different. There is no bureaucracy on the face of this \nplanet that does not have organizational problems. The question is, \nwhat are we trying to do here, and what are the interests of the United \nStates?\n  Foreign policy is not some foreign engagement exclusively. Foreign \npolicy is the art of achieving our interests abroad. It is really an \nextension of the interests in every community here in our country. It \nis not really a foreign affair. It is a domestic interest that is \nrepresented through whatever happens abroad.\n  So when we engage in Latin America in an antidrug program, we are \nrepresenting the interests of people in Kansas City, in San Francisco, \nin Boston, in New York, in Los Angeles, and all across this country. \nAnd to whatever degree we can get the cooperation of Colombians or the \ncooperation of Ecuadorians or Panamanians or the Caribbean countries in \nhelping us to prevent the flow of cocaine or helping to prevent the \nflow of laundered money, we are representing our interests. That helps \nus here at home. It keeps perhaps 1 kid, 20 kids, hopefully 1,000 or a \nmillion kids out of trouble.\n  It seems to me that in the same way, Mr. President, in dozens of \nother ways, our interests are represented through the diplomatic \nefforts of our State Department in ways that a lot of Americans just \ntake for granted on a daily basis. Take, for instance, the interests of \nNew England in fishing. We have two of the most important fishing ports \nin all of the country in Gloucester and New Bedford, MA. Until \nrecently, our fishermen were able to go up and drag off the coast of \nCanada for scallops. Now, because of an international treaty, we are \nnot allowed to do that anymore, and we have huge tensions with Canada \nover the questions of fishing. We have huge tensions over the fish that \nare caught there, that are sold in the United States at a lesser price, \nthat take away from our fishermen and their livelihood.\n  So these are the relationships. This is not a foreign interest. This \nis not an expenditure of money somehow that goes to someone else's \nbenefit abroad. It goes to our benefit, Mr. President. Hopefully, if \nwell represented and well negotiated, it goes to our benefit.\n  There are dozens of other ways in which examples abound about how our \ninterests are or are not represented. We have millions of Americans \ntraveling abroad every year, millions probably even as I speak right \nnow. They expect to be able to walk into an embassy or a consulate \noffice and get answers. They expect to be able to get a visa. They \nexpect to have their interests represented. If they get in an accident \nabroad, if they have a sickness abroad, if something happens where they \nare falsely arrested or some other event takes place, we need to be \nable to represent the interests of those citizens abroad.\n  Increasingly, Mr. President, in every single sector that is important \nto the interests of Americans, we have been cutting over the last few \nyears.\n  We made an enormous cut in the foreign affairs budget just 2 years \nago. We made a cut 2 years before that. It has become sort of the \nwhipping boy, if you will, of the budgetary process because there is no \neasy, quick constituency in the United States that leaps up and says, \n``Oh, yes, I identify with that money.''\n  Already out of a $1.5 trillion budget, we spend less than 1 percent \nof the total budget on all of our foreign affairs interests, including \nforeign aid, and most of the foreign aid of this country, as we know, \ngoes to two countries: Egypt and Israel. So, if you take the almost $12 \nbillion, I think it is, that goes to Egypt and Israel, we are leaving \nourselves something like $8 billion for everything else that we wind up \ndoing around the world in respect to all of our treaties, all of our \nnegotiations, all of our representing of our citizens, all of our \nefforts to try to deal with international crime, with international \ncustoms problems, with all of the other interests that we have across \nthis planet.\n  I inform my colleagues that overseas workload has increased \ndramatically. My colleague from Connecticut was talking a few minutes \nago about what has happened with respect to the sort of closing in of \nthe world. The fact is that because the world is now smaller, because \nthere are more airlines flying more places, because communications are \neasier, because there is a much broader middle class, not just in \nAmerica, but in many other countries, people are traveling more. And \nbecause of that travel, there is far more of a relationship between \nnations than there was previously, much more commerce, much more just \nto keep track of.\n  The workload for our embassies in just issuing passports, the \nworkload in this country in issuing passports, is a 60 percent increase \nin the last few years. The overseas consular operations have exploded--\nvisas, increased services to Americans, refugee admissions. We have \nopened 30 new posts in the last 3 years because of the collapse of the \nSoviet Union and Europe. And yet, notwithstanding all of that increase, \nthere has been no financial increase whatsoever. All of these new \nposts, all of this new work has been taken up by virtue of \nconsolidation, cuts, deferred maintenance, reductions.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully suggest that a hard analysis of what \nhas been happening to the budget with respect \n\n[[Page S11057]]\nto the State Department and the capacity of our Foreign Service \nentities to do their jobs over the last years has been such a \nsignificant reduction that we are getting to the point where we are \nlosing our capacity to represent our own interests.\n  This is not smart anymore. This is the old story of cutting off your \nnose to spite your face. This is shooting yourself in the foot. It is \nreducing our own influence. I suggest that we ought to think hard about \nwhere we are going.\n  The State Department's budget has been frozen in recent years. In \nfact, the fiscal year 1996 request is underfunded by over $200 million, \nor by 10 percent when inflation and the exchange rate losses are \nfactored in. That is an important thing to recognize, Mr. President. We \noperate our foreign offices, obviously, in a lot of places where the \ncurrency is fluctuating. So we send people there with an expectation \nthat we are going to spend x amount of dollars. But because the dollar \nmay go down, you wind up having a huge increase in expenses and it \ncosts you a lot more to do the same business.\n  Have we increased the amount of money to represent that kind of \nincrease in costs? No. We have taken it out of the building fund, we \nhave taken it out of maintenance, we have cut other sectors, and we are \nbeginning to get to the point where we are reducing our own capacity.\n  The State Department has already reduced its work force by 1,300 \npositions, and it has cut administrative expenses by almost $100 \nmillion. We have reduced the size of the senior Foreign Service already \nby 10 percent, and we have cut diplomatic security programs by 15 \npercent. This is what has already happened.\n  Now we approach this bill, and I want to share with my colleagues why \nI think there is such a problem in this bill.\n  Despite the fact that this bill meets the administration's 1996 \nappropriations accounts for the State Department and the USIA, the \naggregate funding in this bill for 1996 is $450 million below the 1995 \nenacted level, and it is $330 million below the President's 1996 \nrequest. The total funding in the bill decreases sharply over the next \n3 fiscal years. The authorized funding under this bill for fiscal year \n1999 is over $1.3 billion below the 1995 enacted level.\n  I will add, Mr. President, that those cuts, that $1.3 billion by \n1999, does not reflect the steep reductions in foreign aid funding \nlevels for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 that are in the foreign aid bill. \nSo when you add those cuts to the foreign aid bill, you wind up with \nthe most significant reduction; in fact, you go below the function 150 \nbudget resolution figures for the next 2 years. I do not think we ought \nto go below the budget resolution figures in the 150 account for those \nnext 2 years, given the reductions that have taken place in the last \nyears.\n  Mr. President, 10 years ago, in the height of the cold war, when you \nhad a bipolar world with this intense focus on basically the Soviet \nbloc and China and whatever satellite countries of theirs were creating \nhavoc in other parts of the world, our total international affairs \nbudget was 2.44 percent of the total budget of our country--2.44. \nToday, it comprises only 1.3 percent. And in the last decade, the \nappropriations for function 150 have declined by $15.6 billion in \nfiscal year 1996 dollars. They have gone from $36.8 billion in 1985 \ndown to $21.2 billion in 1995, all of that cut, notwithstanding what \nthe Senator from Connecticut and I have just said with respect to an \nincrease in responsibility, an increase in the number of relationships \nand an increase in the numbers of issues that we now face.\n  I might add, Mr. President, now that you have a world where you do \nnot just deal with the Soviet Union and the whole focus is not on arms \ncontrol and the arms race, you actually have unleashed a whole set of \nadditional forces that make diplomacy far more complicated. In many \nways, when you had the Soviet Union and the United States and people \nwere dividing up along those lines, you had a much easier dynamic to \nwork with than the current international economic competitive \nstructure, with all of the attendant environmental, crime, refugee, \nethnic conflict and other issues that have been liberated.\n  I respectfully suggest that the world we face today requires a \nknowledge of what is happening in countries, an understanding of that \nethnic force, an understanding of who is who within the criminal \nconstellation, an understanding of the dynamics of how we can assist \nother countries to move toward sustainable development--a host of \nissues that are far more difficult to leverage and that require \npersonal relationships in the leveraging. Yet, here we are withdrawing \nourselves from the very capacity to create those kinds of personal \nrelationships.\n  Under the budget resolution, discretionary funding for the \ninternational affairs budget is reduced by $2.1 billion in fiscal year \n1996 alone. And by fiscal year 2002, the Budget Committee's target date \nfor the balanced budget, the mark for the function 150 discretionary \nfunding is $14.7 billion.\n  Mr. President, we are going to go from $36.8 billion in 1985 to $14.6 \nbillion in the year 2002, and we are somehow going to pretend that we \nare going to represent the domestic interests of the United States \nabroad with that budget while simultaneously meeting the needs of a \ncountry that prides itself in being the leader of the free world. I do \nnot think it makes sense. I think it is ill considered. I think it is \nshortsighted. I think it is contrary to our national interests, and it \nmay not be hyperbole to suggest that it is even dangerous for the \ninterests of this country.\n  I recognize that economies have to be achieved in all respects, with \nrespect to the Federal budget, including international affairs. But the \ndollar alone cannot be the sole measurement with respect to what we are \ndoing. We do not just have a fiscal deficit, Mr. President, we have a \nleadership deficit, we have an involvement deficit, we have a presence \ndeficit.\n  If you travel to Asia today, you will find greater presence of French \nand Germans and Japanese than you will Americans. I am consistently \nasked by foreign businessmen when the United States of America is going \nto get its act together and have the kind of presence necessary to \nsignal our determination to be a real player beyond what our weaponry \ngives us.\n  It seems to me that those are the kinds of things we ought to be \nthinking about as we arrive at a budget, not just an arbitrary 602(b) \nfigure that is thrown out by a couple of people sitting around saying, \n``We will give this much to this committee and that much to that \ncommittee,'' without a real measurement of what the real impact is in \nthe overall interest of our country.\n  In addition to the problematic budget areas, Mr. President, this bill \nalso contains several provisions that are designed to undermine and \nplace restrictions on the United States' participation in the United \nNations system. For example, the bill mandates that the United States \nwithdraw from several international organizations, including the \nInternational Labor Organization, and it eliminates funding for U.S.-\nassessed contributions to these organizations.\n  In addition, the bill places conditions on the full payment of the \nU.S.-assessed contributions to the United Nations and to peacekeeping \noperations that serve to weaken our leverage at the United Nations at \nthe very moment when our leadership is needed.\n  It is very difficult to go to Mr. Akashi and Boutros Boutros-Ghali \nand suggest to them that the role of the United Nations ought to be \ndifferent, and they ought to heed our advice at the same time we are \npulling back from an obligation, as well as from other involvement and \nefforts of the United Nations. If ever we wanted to invite others to \nbegin to spur whatever leadership we might be offering, it seems to me \nthat that is one of the ways to do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I would hope that in the course of the \ndeliberation on this bill we can try to rectify, to whatever degree \npossible, some of these things, so that we get back to the spirit of \nbipartisanship that governed the movement of this bill in the last 11 \nyears that I have been here. There was an unfortunate vote along party \nlines sending this bill to the floor. It is my hope that we can use \nthis time now in the legislative process to harmonize \n\n[[Page S11058]]\nand bring together a bipartisan effort when I think the Congress is \nmost well-served and certainly when the interests of the country are \nserved. Everybody knows that this country has been strongest when its \nforeign policy is bipartisan. The great standard was written by Arthur \nVandenberg. In recent days, we have had joint efforts--whether it was \nSenators Lugar and Nunn, who joined together with respect to Russia, or \nwhether it was Senator McCain and others here, who joined together with \nrespect to Southeast Asia--and we have been able to show that \nbipartisanship makes a difference and it makes this country strong. I \nhope we can find that in further efforts with respect to this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Kerry is one of the most articulate \nhuman beings I have ever heard. I wish that he had somehow recognized \nin his eloquent comments the many efforts that we made--when I say \n``we,'' I mean the Foreign Relations Committee majority--to work with \nthe administration.\n  I myself pleaded with the Vice President of the United States to let \nus get together, as the Senator has recommended. The bureaucracy \nprevailed in the Vice President's office. I am not being personally \ncritical of the Vice President. He has many things on his plate. But, \nin this case, the ball got away from him, and the heads of three \nagencies, which were going to be rolled into the State Department where \nthey belong, prevailed.\n  Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, went through the same \nagony last fall after the election when he recommended the sort of \nreorganization that the pending legislation represents. Secretary \nChristopher got his comeuppance, and he took it like a man. He is a \nfaithful, loyal member of the administration. He wrote a letter the \nother day to Senator Dole, which was amazing to me. Sometime during \nthis debate, I am going to put his letter in the Record and my response \nto it.\n  I wish we could get together, but at this moment, the White House is \ncalling the tune. There is nothing wrong with that. That is the way the \nadministration works. But they cannot have it both ways, that we want \nto do this and that, when in fact they have done everything in this \nworld, including personal invective, to undermine the pending \nlegislation. There were news conferences at the National Press Club \ndowntown. One of the bureaucrats made all sorts of remarks, including \none that I had written this bill on the back of an envelope. The press \ncame to me and said, ``What do you think about that?'' I said, ``Well, \nAbraham Lincoln did pretty well on the back of an envelope. I hope I \nhave done fairly well.''\n  But it has been a personal affront to these people that anybody could \nsuggest that their bureaucracies be trimmed. Let me tell you something \nabout the U.S. Information Agency. There is a great push to keep it \nlike it is. But let me tell you, Mr. President, if you retain the U.S. \nInformation Agency as it is, it will cost $320 million over the next 2 \nyears and $600 million during the 7-year effort to balance the budget.\n  Now, all the people who have been lobbied to keep the USIA just like \nit is better bear in mind what the Budget Committee is going to say \nabout that. And all sorts of suggestions have been made that, well, we \nare doing well, we just need to do better.\n  Well, tell me about the 600 people, Federal employees, in the U.S. \nEmbassy at Cairo, whose sole responsibility is to give away the \nAmerican taxpayers' money. What sense does that make? It costs $200,000 \na year to post one Federal employee overseas. They have 600 of them at \nCairo alone.\n  Mr. President, I have several dear friends among the heads of State \nof other countries who come to Washington, and they come to see me in \nmy capacity with the Foreign Relations Committee. If I had to pick a \nfavorite, I guess it would be Eugenia Charles, who is the former Prime \nMinister of Dominica. I am sad to say that the Prime Minister is not \nrunning for reelection. She is a pleasant, down-to-earth lady. She \nalways comes in my office with a smile on her face. The last time she \nwas here, which was about 3 or 4 weeks ago, give or take, she walked in \nand said, ``Well, Senator, I see you are trying to do something about \nyour foreign aid program.'' I said, ``Yes, ma'am, I am.'' She said, \n``Well, it is none of my business, but something ought to be done. Do \nyou realize, Senator, that it costs you more money to give away money \nthan you give away?'' And that is it. It is the bureaucracy that just \ngrows and grows and grows, and these efforts with the pending \nlegislation, from the administration that has not cooperated with the \ncommittee at all--John Kerry tried to. I do not know what sort of \ninstructions he got from the people downtown to the contrary. But I \nwish we could sit down and work out the difficulties. I am not going to \ngive away the store. I am not going to change this bill so that it does \nnot meet the budget resolution which was adopted by this Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. No, sir, I am not going to do that.\n  But if we can have an understanding that we are working on the same \nteam, being the Senate of the United States, trying to get a job that \nneeds to be done and needs badly to be done, then we can pull this bill \ndown and we can operate in good faith. But I cannot have Bill Clinton's \npeople looking over somebody's shoulder, because Bill Clinton already \nsaid he is going to veto it, and he does not even know what is in the \nbill. He wants to keep the status quo. He does not want to save any \nmoney on foreign aid. Otherwise, he would have sent somebody in good \nfaith up here to work with the committee, which we urged him to do, \nwhich we urged his Vice President to do. But we were stonewalled.\n  So do not give me all this stuff about the administration has not \nbeen consulted. Later on in the debate, we will talk about this \nbusiness of micromanagement. There has been plenty of what some would \ncall micromanagement in the past.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2042 to Amendment No. 2041\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk to amendment No. 2041.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2042 to amendment No. 2041.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n       .  SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONSOLIDATION AND \n                   REINVENTION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that it is necessary in \n     order to make the Government more efficient and to realize \n     significant budgetary savings for the American taxpayer--\n       (1) to consolidate and reinvent foreign affairs agencies of \n     the United States within the Department of State;\n       (2) to provide for the reorganization of the Department of \n     State to maximize efficient use of resources, eliminate \n     redundancy in functions, and improve the management of the \n     Department of State;\n       (3) to assist congressional efforts to balance the Federal \n     budget by the year 2002;\n       (4) to ensure that the international affairs budget \n     function shoulders an appropriate share of the reductions in \n     United States Government spending necessary to eliminate the \n     $4,800,000,000,000 budget deficit; and\n       (5) to strengthen--\n       (A) the coordination of United States foreign policy;\n       (B) the leading role of the Secretary of State in the \n     formulation and articulation of United States foreign policy;\n       (C) the authority of United States ambassadors over all \n     United States Government personnel and resources located in \n     United States diplomatic missions, in order to enhance the \n     ability of the ambassadors to deploy those resources to the \n     best effect that will attain the President's foreign policy \n     objectives; and\n       (D) the United States Foreign Service, as the forward \n     deployed civilian force of the United States Government, \n     through renewed emphasis on the original principles which \n     undergird the distinct Foreign Service personnel system. \n     These include worldwide availability, assignments based on \n     the needs of the service, rank in person, and merit-based \n     advancement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) consolidate and eliminate, such duplicative, \n     overlapping or superfluous personnel, functions, goals, \n     activities, offices, and programs that the United States Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Agency, the United States Information \n     Agency, and the Agency for International Development have in \n     common with the Department of State in order to realize a \n     budgetary savings to the American taxpayer of at least \n     $3,000,000,000 during fiscal years 1996 through 1999;\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\n       (2) encourage the United States foreign affairs agencies to \n     maintain a high percentage of the best qualified, most \n     competent American citizens serving in the United States \n     Government while downsizing significantly the total number of \n     people employed by these agencies; and\n       (3) ensure that all functions of diplomacy be subject to \n     recruitment, training, assignment, promotion and egress based \n     on common standards and procedures, with maximum interchange \n     among the functions.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me get back to one of the most heavily \nlobbied portions of the pending bill.\n  I said a while ago that keeping the U.S. Information Agency as it is \nwill cost $320 million over the next 2 years, and $600 million during \nour 7-year effort to balance the budget. Those who do not care whether \nthe budget is balanced or not in 7 years, do not care very much one way \nor another.\n  The effort to keep the U.S. Information Agency independent of the \nDepartment of State is misguided and it is out of step. The time has \ncome to recognize the problem and to reorganize our entire foreign \nrelations apparatus.\n  As John Kerry has said with his customary eloquence, public diplomacy \nis an extremely important part of the way this country conducts \nbusiness with other countries. It is, after all, the way we convey \nAmerican values and interests, and the way that we communicate the \nAmerican dream to the people around the world.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, it ought to be part and parcel of the \nlarger foreign policy effort, not shunted away out of sight, out of \nmind. As the single agency charged with the conduct of U.S. foreign \nrelations, the Department of State must be given a clear mandate and \nmust be provided with all the tools of the trade. Diplomacy can be a \nmost effective tool, but its effectiveness can be truly realized only \nwhen it is synchronized with all the rest of the diplomatic \ninitiatives.\n  That is just not the opinion of Jesse Helms, a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Five Secretaries of State have said the same \nthing. They have endorsed this bill which President Clinton, Vice \nPresident Gore, and now poor Warren Christopher, who is caught in a \nbind, say they oppose.\n  Now, S. 908 acknowledges what has to be the centrality of public \ndiplomacy of foreign affairs, by putting public diplomacy at the center \nof the foreign affairs apparatus.\n  I ask, what is a better way to make sure that this tool gets used \nfrequently, than to provide it to those who need it and to those who \nwill use it, by creating an Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy within \nthe Department of State, as this bill proposes? We will strengthen our \ncore foreign policy apparatus, and 5 former Secretaries of State have \ntestified and written letters of endorsement of this very proposal that \nis the pending business in the U.S. Senate.\n  As for the U.S. Information Agency, its consolidation into the State \nDepartment will allow us to stretch our dollars devoted to foreign \npolicy. It will cut out the waste. It will cut down on the bureaucracy. \nIt will cut out functions that really are not essential to our foreign \npolicy. They may be desirable, but they are not essential.\n  Now, in the case of international broadcasting, the irony is that S. \n908, the pending bill, is the best deal in town. They will not find a \nbetter one--not from Bill Clinton, not from Al Gore, not from anybody \nelse. Right here, it is pending before the U.S. Senate.\n  S. 908, Mr. President, assures the continuation of the restructuring, \nthe reduction, and the consolidation of broadcasting elements that \nbegan last fall. This bill will ensure that the Congress and the \nadministration keep their commitment to support broadcasting around the \nworld. Some of the people--lobbyists--who are opposing S. 908 would \nhave you believe otherwise.\n  Broadcasting, under this bill, will remain independent and will be \noperated by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which is a nonpartisan \nboard that sets the broadcasting policy.\n  In a very real way, S. 908, despite the protests of people who will \nsave it, passes the litmus test of USIA itself. It strengthens the role \nof public diplomacy in our foreign policy apparatus by integrating it \nwith larger foreign policy concerns.\n  As has been shown, S. 908 in no way eliminates or reduces the \ncapabilities needed to convey the American message to foreign \npopulations. That is the job it was created to do in the first place.\n  It preserves those capabilities, but it also makes a strong move to \nabolish waste and needless bureaucratic duplication. That is where some \nnerves have been rubbed raw.\n  Make no mistake, the amendment to retain USIA, any effort to retain \nUSIA independently, is a proposal to retain wastefulness and \ninefficiency. It is a tired old litany. I hope the Senate, if and when \nwe are given an opportunity to vote on the matter, will understand what \nit is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you Mr. President. I think the chairman has \naccurately stated the dilemma that faces members here in terms of \nmaking decisions about whether or not to move forward with a specific \nconsolidation proposal.\n  The real question is whether or not there is support--bipartisan \nsupport--for a consolidation proposal.\n  We heard from Senator Kerry this morning, who said that he supports \nconsolidation, the idea of consolidation. He basically said the same \nthing in committee.\n  The problem is, there has been no specific proposal forthcoming to \nachieve the goals of consolidation. That is the problem. Everybody \ntalks about consolidation, eliminating duplicating functions and \nresponsibilities, but there is no specific plan that has been put \nforward by the minority, on the committee or here on the floor, that \nachieves the goals that are necessary and indeed mandated by the budget \nresolution.\n  Even the Vice President said, back on January 27, that he would come \nforward with a plan for reinventing Government and these agencies in \nthe State Department that would achieve a savings of $5 billion. We \nhave no such plan.\n  The only recommendation the Vice President has made is eliminating 6 \nmissions and streamlining the contracting services within the agencies. \nThat is it. That will not achieve $5 billion. Even our savings are less \nthan $5 billion. The fact is the budget resolution requires us to \nachieve $3.6 billion.\n  Now, somebody can say how we do it differently. I cannot understand, \nfrankly, why the minority could not accept the principles that are \nembodied in the amendment that is before the Senate. It says, and it is \na sense of Congress, that the President should consolidate and \neliminate duplicative, overlapping or superfluous goals, activities, \noffices, and programs that the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency, the U.S. Information Agency, and the Agency for International \nDevelopment have in common with the Department of State, in order to \nrealize budgetary savings to the American taxpayers. That leaves $3 \nbillion during fiscal years 1996 through 1999.\n  That is the essence of the amendment now pending before the Senate. \nIt incorporates the principles of consolidation.\n  It is obvious that there is not an interest in working together in a \nbipartisan way to come up with a consolidation plan that can get a \nmajority of support here.\n  Now, the President--and I can understand, there is a dilemma here for \nthose on the minority side--the President proposed in his budget to \nincrease the 150 account by $1 billion. The budget resolution that \npassed this Congress requires us to cut by $3.6 billion. That is what \nwe have to do.\n  The President does not want to cut the foreign affairs account. He is \nasking for a $1 billion increase.\n  That is why I think we are meeting the resistance from the other side \nwith respect to consolidation, because they do not want to consolidate. \nThey do not want to eliminate. They do not want to do anything to \nchange the status quo. That is what last year's election was all \nabout--to change the status quo on how we conduct our business. That is \nwhat we have to do. That is our mandate here. It surprises me in a lot \nof ways to suggest that there are not ways in which we can do that. I \nhappen to think that consolidation is necessary because I think it will \nreinvigorate the departments and the agencies. I think it will \nreinvigorate the \n\n[[Page S11060]]\nState Department in the way it conducts its foreign policy \ndecisionmaking. I think it is necessary.\n  Does anyone here suggest that we should not look at the exchange \nprograms? I am a strong advocate of the exchange programs. But, believe \nit or not, the exchange programs have doubled. They have actually \ndoubled since 1990. They have doubled in the 1980's. So they doubled in \nthe 1980's and they have doubled since 1990. We are proposing that we \ncut $400 million in the exchange programs that are duplicative. They \nare spread out all over the U.S. Government. We are saying we should \nconsolidate and manage them because we do think they are important, \nespecially in this post-cold-war period. It is important for our young \npeople to have a chance to understand the cultures of governments of \nother countries. But does anybody think that we should not do it a \nlittle bit differently, given the proliferation of those exchange \nprograms? I say not.\n  What about the Agency for International Development? As I said, the \nDirector has done an outstanding job since he has been in that \nposition. But there is much more to be done. Even he said, several \nyears ago before he took that position, that the agency was a disaster. \nWe have spent on development assistance since the agency was created \n$144 billion, and we still provide countries with assistance. Countries \nhave received development assistance from 35 to 51 years consecutively. \nWe have not made any headway.\n  The point is, we have to do things somewhat differently. We should \ntie development assistance to our foreign policy goals. There is \nnothing wrong with that. Indeed, I think we will maximize the benefits \nfor our taxpayers, but also for our specific goal.\n  Sixty percent of the employees of the Agency for International \nDevelopment work here in Washington, DC. There are 9,000 employees in \nthe Agency for International Development--9,000. Just the \nadministrative costs alone represent 25 cents on every development \ndollar we spend, but that does not take into account the grants. That \nis where the other 4,000 employees come in. We have 5,000 under the \ntraditional administrative costs and overhead, and then we have another \n4,000 employees that are paid through the grants that we issue through \ndevelopment assistance in the Agency for International Development.\n  Is anyone suggesting that we should not cut or reform those programs \nto maximize the benefits for the American taxpayers and, indeed, the \nprogram? No one is saying that the essence of development assistance \nand helping countries for sustainable development for the future to \nbecome independent economically is not essential. It absolutely is. The \nquestion is how we achieve those goals.\n  That is what we are attempting to do with this legislation: To \nconsolidate and to improve the way in which we deliver these programs.\n  Public diplomacy--I have been a very strong proponent of the \nbroadcasting functions under the USIA. Again, the question is whether \nor not we can move those functions within the State Department. I had \nconcerns about maintaining the independence and integrity of the \nbroadcasting functions of radio, for example. But we maintain that \ncritical firewall in this legislation because we have a broadcasting \nboard of governors. So we will maintain the independence and integrity \nof radio. But there is not anything to say that we cannot do things \ndifferently in bringing them into the State Department hierarchy.\n  Edward R. Morrow, who was once the USIA Director, said that \noftentimes the agency was always brought in when a policy crash landed, \nbut was never there when there was a takeoff. I think they will correct \nthat longstanding problem. I think it is our responsibility to reform \nthe public diplomacy structure. We create an Under Secretary for Public \nDiplomacy. We create a fifth person so that preserves the Foreign \nService officers and their skills, because I have a great deal of \nrespect for their professionalism and their dedication to their job. \nThere is no greater demonstration of the way in which they perform than \nat the various embassies around the world. In fact, they are integrated \nfully into the process within the embassy. That is exactly the same \nkind of procedure we want to duplicate here in Washington, DC. \nEverybody works together.\n  Today, in a more democratic world than ever before, the foreign \npolicy in those countries is very, very essential to the formation of \npolicy in this country. That is what public diplomacy has become, an \nessential responsibility. I think we can emphasize that even more by \ntaking the USIA and putting it into the State Department. We are not \nhere to deemphasize it or say it is a lesser priority; absolutely not. \nWe are saying it is very much a priority, and we are going to protect \nthe integrity and the independence of broadcasting. In fact, we had the \nnomination hearing for the eight individuals who serve on that board, a \nvery distinguished group of individuals that will bring a broad array \nof experience into the public and private sector to manage this board \nin this transition. I have a great deal of confidence in their ability \nto manage a very crucial change in the broadcasting function.\n  I hope, as generally can be the case, that we just do not have this \nnatural visceral reaction in opposition to any kind of change. I am \ncertainly willing to consider any proposal and any ideas to reform the \nconsolidation that we have before us. I think we have to make a \ndecision that consolidation is very, very essential. But we are not \ngetting any specific or concrete ideas from the other side as to how to \nachieve it. We keep hearing, well, we support consolidation. But we \nhave been hearing that for 6 months, and nothing has come forward that \nwould suggest that they have a plan or indeed actually support any kind \nof plan for consolidation.\n  We will hopefully go through this legislation and hopefully we will \nhave a vote, which I am going to ask for in a moment on the pending \namendment, because I think it is important that we find out where \neverybody stands on the principle of consolidation of the State \nDepartment and its related agencies.\n  We are here today because we need to change the way in which we \nhandle the organizational structure of the State Department and other \nagencies. But we certainly want to do everything we can to make it \nright.\n  Senator Kerry mentioned the fact that we have increased \nresponsibilities on the embassies and our diplomatic corps. That is \ncertainly true. In fact, this last year, I attempted to mandate a cost \nsharing so we apportion the costs within each embassy among a variety \nof agencies, because the State Department is not the only one that \ncreates costs within our embassies. We have the Department of Commerce, \nthe Department of Defense, and other agencies that have \nresponsibilities for those embassies, and yet they do not pay their \nfair share of cost.\n  Unfortunately, I was not successful. I am not saying that we just \nshould cut. I am saying that we should cut in a responsible way through \nconsolidation. I do not think anybody can disagree on the purpose of \nconsolidation.\n  So as we move forward in this debate, perhaps there will be some \ninterest on the other side, and most specifically the administration, \nwhich obviously is governing the course and the direction of this \nlegislation, with respect to accepting the idea of consolidation or \nnot.\n                      opposition to abolishing aid\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose abolishing the Agency for \nInternational Development and merging its programs and personnel into \nthe State Department. This proposal will do more than simply move some \nboxes around on an organizational chart; it will make fundamental \nchanges in the ability of AID to perform its mission. As a result, it \nthreatens our ability to protect and advance important American \ninterests.\n  Let me begin by identifying three primary elements of AID's mission.\n  First, there is a clear and compelling humanitarian interest. AID's \nprograms tells others, and reminds us, that the United States is a \ncaring and compassionate Nation. That compassion and caring reflect \nboth our character as a country and our recognition that we have the \nresources and the responsibility to do what we can to help those in \nneed. Compassion has a place in foreign policy and our main instrument \nin this regard--in feeding children, providing housing and medical \ncare, building \n\n[[Page S11061]]\nroads and sewers, and so much more--is AID.\n  Second, AID is the instrument through which we get on with the task \nof building functional democracies around the world. What we sought to \npreserve throughout the cold war, we can now expand. Country after \ncountry, on continent after continent, want to establish representative \ngovernments, democratically elected and based on the rule of law and a \nrespect for human rights and liberties. The development assistance and \nexpertise developed by AID is the way to get them the resources they \nneed to achieve a result we all want. While there is an element of \naltruism in such programs, there is also a cold calculation that it \nserves our national interest. Wherever we are successful in ensuring \nthat democratic principles take root, we are less likely to face the \nprospect of intervention in a political crisis, with it the high costs \nof peacekeeping and emergency relief operations.\n  Third, AID's overseas assistance efforts provide for both immediate \nand long-term economic benefits to the United States.\n  In the short run, nearly 80 percent of AID's grants and contracts go \ndirectly to American firms and private organizations. This creates \nAmerican jobs, encourages American exports, and expands domestic \nprosperity. Over the longer run, our current and prospective foreign \nassistance efforts help to create future overseas markets for American \ngoods and services in developing countries. A built-in, long-term \npreference for American exports bodes well for continued employment and \nprosperity here as well.\n  So, Mr. President, the functions that AID preforms are important. And \nthe question now is whether we can continue that work in a new \norganizational structure.\n  I do not think we can or need to for three reasons.\n  First, AID is already reorganizing. The Agency is reinventing itself \nin order to become both more efficient and effective. Under the \nleadership of its Administrator, Brian Atwood, AID has already cut its \ncosts. Overseas, AID will have closed 21 missions between 1994 and \n1996. In its domestic operations, AID has eliminated 90 offices in \nWashington. Overall, AID has cut 70 senior positions and reduced total \nstaff by over 1,200. Moreover, AID is adopting a new development \nstrategy. Recognizing that its limited resources make it impossible to \nbe all things to all people, it is targeting fewer countries for more \nintensive assistance. While some may criticize this almost triage-like \napproach, it certainly reflects a willingness to adopt a leaner focus \nto the problems it confronts.\n  Second, the suggestion that the savings will come out of \n``administrative reforms'' is simply not credible. As I have indicated, \nAID has already scaled back. I do not believe there will be significant \nadditional administrative savings from this consolidation. The reality \nis that AID's overseas operations, like all U.S. Government agencies \nand departments operations in our embassies and consulates, already are \nfully integrated into State Department administrative services on a \nreimbursable basis. So, the proposed consolidation would not save any \nmoney abroad. And domestically, there is no room in the State \nDepartment to house AID's employees and functions, so we will not save \non building costs here in Washington, either.\n  The net result, I fear, is a further reduction in our developmental \nprograms. Some may say ``well its about time.'' But that kind of \nresponse is usually based on a profound misunderstanding of just how \nmuch we spend on foreign aid. While many believe that such programs \naccount for 8 to 10 percent of all Federal spending, in reality they \nnow constitute only \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of all spending by the U.S. \nGovernment. This level of spending already places us in the lowest \nranks of the developed world in terms of per capita spending on foreign \naid and assistance programs. Indeed, from 1956 to 1993, our share of \nofficial development assistance worldwide has dropped from 63 to 17 \npercent. Our current effort, then, is inadequate. This bill makes it \neven worse. And, as a result, it threatens our ability to protect the \nnational interests I identified at the beginning of these remarks.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have to note the major irony involved in \nthis proposal. This proposal to augment and centralize the State \nDepartment is made by precisely the same people who profess to believe \nthat ``big government'' should be decentralized and made more flexible.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, with this simple observation. \nDestroying AID is not the way to accomplish our foreign policy \nobjectives. It would not be efficient or effective, and we should not \ndo it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11050-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11061-S11066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     OPPOSING CONSOLIDATION OF USIA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose consolidating the U.S. \nInformation Agency.\n  We need to ask two questions about this proposal to abolish USIA and \nmerge its functions and personnel into an expanded State Department. \nFirst, will it result in a less costly set of information, cultural and \nexchange, and broadcasting programs in support of American foreign \npolicy objectives? Second, will it enhance the effectiveness of these \nprograms as we continue to readjust and redirect our foreign policy \ninterests?\n  Mr. President, the answer to both questions is ``no.''\n  Let us look initially at the purported cost-savings of merging USIA \ninto the State Department.\n  There is a seductive logic to the argument that merging USIA into the \nState Department would result in substantial administrative cost-\nsavings. But the facts reveal otherwise.\n  Managerially, USIA's overseas operations currently are well-\nintegrated with State's. USIA--like all departments and agencies \noperating from our Embassies and consulates--already reimburses the \nState Department for administrative support services, such as housing, \ncomputers, motor pools, and the like. Consolidation will not save any \nmoney overseas.\n  Would there be savings in U.S. operations by merging USIA into the \nState Department? I do not believe so. Aside from its foreign press \ncenters, the Agency by law has no domestic charter, no domestic \npresence. And we would not be able to eliminate the need for some sort \nof separate office space to house USIA's personnel and functions, since \nthe State Department has none to spare.\n  In fact, USIA on its own and in response to the President's and Vice \npresident's reinventing Government initiatives has already achieved \nmajor and substantial cost-savings. In this regard, I believe that it \nis important to remember that the Agency constitutes only 6 percent of \nthe total function 150 budget but accounts for 58 percent of the total \nsavings wrung from the 150 account in the past 2 years.\n  USIA has accomplished these savings by consolidating and \nrestructuring its own activities. USIA now has RIF authority and is in \nfact closing overseas posts and bringing officers home, as well as \ncutting overseas and domestic positions and staff.\n  By bringing together all of the U.S. Government's international \nbroadcasting activities, USIA will save more than $400 million by \nfiscal year 1997 and eliminate 1,250 staff positions. By creating a new \nInformation Bureau, USIA has reduced its policy and program staff by 30 \npercent for an annual savings of $10 million. And by streamlining and \ndownsizing its educational, cultural, and management functions, USIA \nhas wrought savings of almost $15 million and eliminated 186 positions \nthis year alone.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, significant, real cuts are being made by \nUSIA right now without consolidation. We cannot extract more savings by \nmerging USIA into the State Department without sacrificing the very \nprograms that support our foreign policy worldwide in the new \ninformation age.\n  Will consolidation enhance the effectiveness of the U.S. Government's \ninformation, broadcasting, and cultural and exchange programs? I do not \nthink so for at least two reasons.\n  First, the budget cuts raised by this bill for USIA--$118.6 million \nin fiscal year 1996 and an additional $81 million in fiscal year 1997--\nare general reductions. In fact, they have nothing to do with \nconsolidation and cannot be achieved by merging USIA into the State \nDepartment. To meet these spending levels, the Agency will have \n\n[[Page S11062]]\nto make deep cuts in its overseas presence and its core programs.\n  Second, USIA was carved out of the State Department in 1953 to \nfulfill a function--that of public diplomacy--that the State Department \nis inherently unable to perform. USIA was expanded in 1978--when \nState's Bureau of Cultural Affairs was abolished and its functions \ngiven to the Agency--when the State Department could not give high \npriority to programs that promote unofficial contacts between U.S. \npublic opinion leaders and their foreign counterparts overseas.\n  In other words, Mr. President, merging USIA back into the State \nDepartment flies in the face our historical experience. It is being \nproposed at precisely the time when the benefits of our cold war \nlabors--democracy-building world wide--are just beginning to be \nrealized in such far-flung places as Haiti, Angola, and Cambodia and \nrequire active, effective public diplomacy from USIA.\n  Finally, I note that--at a time when businesses across America are \ncreating more flexible, less centralized organizational structures, and \nwe are seeking to emulate this move in the Federal Government--it is \nhard to understand why any of my distinguished colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would advocate creating a mega-bureaucracy in the \nState Department.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose consolidating USIA.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would now like to ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment 2042, the amendment that is pending before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I intend at the appropriate time to offer \namendment No. 1964 on behalf of Senators Hatfield, Glenn, Simon, and \nBiden, and myself that would amend S. 908 in order to retain the \nindependence of ACDA from the Department of State.\n  The State Department authorization bill, S. 908, would, as reported, \nmake meaningless serious and comprehensive efforts in recent years to \nstrengthen and revitalize ACDA. Moreover, it would have this \nunfortunate effect without any significant savings with respect to \nACDA. As a result, its true price would be high.\n  As an aside, commenting on the words of the Senator from Maine, I \nappreciated her kind words about the Foreign Service, being the only \nForeign Service officer in the Senate. I think all of us recognize what \nthe Foreign Service does, and I appreciate the comments of Senator \nSnowe.\n  S. 908 as reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, would \nabolish ACDA and place the retained functions and personnel in a single \nbureau of the Department of State. That bureau would be one of five \nunder the control of an undersecretary also responsible for \ninternational narcotics, law enforcement, political-military affairs, \nhumanitarian assistance, refugees, and migration affairs. We believe \nthat what can only be described as a jumbled reorganization would be in \nerror that could prove very costly to our Nation, and to our arms \ncontrol efforts, for several reasons. First, this major downgrading of \nthe arms control apparatus at a time in which major threats to our \nsecurity are becoming both more diverse and more challenging is a \ndangerously shortsighted action. Second, it would muffle, if not \nsilence, the arms control voice at several major levels. Third, it \nwould deny the Secretary of State and the President the benefit of an \nindependent perspective and judgment on arms control and \nnonproliferation issues. For these and other reasons, it would be \ninevitable that our ability to identify and implement effective arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation activities would be diminished to the \ndetriment of our national security interests.\n  The amendment would require a serious and comprehensive effort to \neliminate duplication and overlap within and between the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency and the Department of State, while preserving \nthe agency's independence and authorizing the appropriation of \nnecessary operating funds.\n  In the course of committee markup of the legislation, I offered an \nalternative proposal--that the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency be \nretained and strengthened. At that time, my proposal was supported only \nby my Democratic colleagues. The amendment I intend to offer is more \nmodest in that it does not shift important non-proliferation \nresponsibilities to ACDA. Rather, it preserves the present \nrelationship, leaving the issue of the further strengthening of ACDA to \nbe resolved later. It also authorizes appropriations of $45 million in \nfiscal year l996 and in fiscal year l997, which allows for spending at \ncurrent levels.\n  I hope that a number of Senators of both parties--not just one, but \nboth parties--who understand arms control and nonproliferation issues \nand appreciate the value of ACDA as a specialized agency at the center \nof these issues will join in supporting the amendment.\n  Arms control activities were handled within the Department of State \nuntil 1961, when it was decided that a separate agency would be a \nbetter approach. As the final decisions were being considered, I \nremember going to the White House with the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nHumphrey, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Clark, to make the \ncase that arms control was a matter of such central importance to the \nUnited States that it should be the responsibility of an agency created \nby and operating under statute.\n  As I think we all can recall, when Senator Kennedy was running for \nPresident, he talked about it being a separate statutory agency. But \nwhen the time came and he was President, then the question came up \nwhether he had the votes for it to be made a statutory agency or \nwhether it should be set up by Executive order.\n  The decision made, on the recommendation of Arthur Schlesinger, at \nthat time to the President was that he stick to his guns and that we \nhave it as a separate statutory agency. This was a decision that \nPresident Kennedy made at that time. I believe that decision really \ncame out of the conversations Senators Clark, Humphrey, and I had with \nhim then.\n  McGeorge Bundy, who served both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson as \nNational Security Adviser, recalled the decisions on ACDA earlier this \nyear in testimony on this bill. He spoke of ``the requirements for \nfirst-class executive branch performance in the field of arms control. \nThese requirements are well met in the present executive arrangements; \nthey could be met only by most improbable good luck if the proposal \nbefore you (S. 908) should be adopted.''\n  Mr. President, no American has left a greater mark on arms control in \nthe modern era than Ambassador Paul H. Nitze. In a long and illustrious \ncareer, he has served Democratic and Republican administrations alike. \nHe understands fully the value of ACDA within any executive branch. He \nwrote me on July 6 to say: ``This reorganization I believe to be ill-\nadvised; folding the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) \ninto the State Department seems to me to be unnecessary and unwise.''\n  I think when a man of wisdom and experience and the depth of \nknowledge of arms control, as in the case of Paul Nitze, takes a view \nlike this, we all should take his view seriously.\n  Ambassador Nitze continues,\n\n       In my experience as an arms control negotiator, I always \n     found ACDA's input into the negotiating process to be expert, \n     insightful, and uniquely helpful. That input could well be \n     lost if the Agency does not remain independent. As recent \n     events in Iraq, Iran, and North Korea show, nonproliferation \n     and arms control are more important than ever. Eliminating \n     ACDA from the diplomatic effort to protect our security would \n     be like eliminating the Marine Corps from the military \n     effort. While it will never replace its larger brethren on \n     the foreign policy team, ACDA plays an essential role as a \n     lean and flexible vanguard, always ready to aggressively \n     counter the threat weapons of mass destruction pose to our \n     national security.\n\n  Paul Nitze concluded,\n\n       The game has changed, but the stakes are at least as great; \n     our national survival still hangs in the balance. We should \n     be strenthening our nonproliferation team, not abolishing it. \n     ACDA is a key part of the best team possible to face the real \n     and growing threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological \n     terrorism. In this new era of opaque and unpredictable \n     threats to our security, the vigilance that saw us through \n     the Cold War should not be relaxed.\n\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof Ambassador Nitze's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, the need for first-class arms control \nperformance has not always been recognized. Accordingly, in the past 34 \nyears, the agency has had its ups and downs, but it has been central to \nsome successes, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty, SALT I Interim \nAgreement, Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty, Biological Weapons \nConvention, Senate agreement to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, Intermediate \nRange Nuclear Forces [INF]\n Treaty, Threshold Test Ban Treaty, Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, \nand the Chemical Weapons Convention now pending before the Senate. \nWhile ACDA was not in charge of START I or START II, it did the bulk of \nthe backstopping work.\n\n  It is worthy of note that ACDA has fought alone in some key matters. \nThe State Department opposed negotiation of the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty in order to please NATO allies. ACDA persevered and won. When \nthe State Department wanted to eviscerate the ABM Treaty in the early \n1980's, ACDA fought for the traditional interpretation. Recently ACDA \nand the Energy Department have been supportive of the current nuclear \ntesting moratorium and of a comprehensive test ban. The State and \nDefense Departments have been the foot draggers. Recent press reports \nallege that the administration sided with the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff against ACDA and the Energy Secretary in its \ndecision not to agree with the Russians to negotiate further strategic \narms cuts beyond START II.\n  In 1991, the Bush administration did not seem to hold ACDA in \nparticular regard, and there was a general sense on the Hill that ACDA \nwas both insignificant and ineffectual. Senator Simon proposed, and the \ncommittee and Senate agreed to, an amendment requiring that the State/\nACDA inspector general, Sherman Funk, investigate ACDA and report back \nwith recommendations in December 1992. Mr. Funk ordered a very thorough \nstudy and analysis by an outside panel headed by Ambassador James \nGoodby. That panel explored all the options, including merger into \nState and concluded that ACDA should be kept independent and \nstrengthened.\n  The importance of the independence of ACDA can not be overemphasized. \nThis was the same logic that President Kennedy used when he said it \nshould be a statutory agency and it should be separate, and why he made \nthe decision to have it set up by statute.\n  Subsequently, I introduced legislation to strengthen and revitalize \nACDA. At the same time, the new administration was considering a plan \nto merge ACDA into State. That subsequently rejected plan is the \nprogenitor of the current majority plan to merge ACDA into State.\n  After their review, the President, on the recommendation of Secretary \nChristopher, decided to retain ACDA and support the bill I had \nintroduced as soon as some compromises were reached. That was done and \nthe bill, with bipartisan support in both Houses was enacted last \nspring. These are the highlights of the revitalization legislation, \nwhich is now law.\n  The bill enhanced the role of the ACDA in the areas of arms control \nand nonproliferation policy and negotiations in several ways: First, \nACDA was given primary responsibility for all arms control negotiations \nand implementation fora, including negotiation of a comprehensive \nnuclear test ban; second, positions for Presidential Special \nRepresentatives for Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament \nwere created and placed under the ACDA Director; and third, ACDA's role \nin nonproliferation was underscored by giving the Agency primary \nresponsibility for managing U.S. participation in the 1995 review \nconference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and primary \nresponsibility for other nonproliferation activities when so directed \nby the President.\n  The bill improved ACDA's role regarding arms transfers and \nnonproliferation. ACDA was given mandatory prior consultation and \nreview rights with respect to export licenses and other matters under \nboth the Arms Export Control Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act.\n  The bill strengthened the functioning of the Agency by eliminating a \nnumber of outdated or redundant reporting requirements and by \ndisbanding the General Advisory Committee, thereby permitting the \nAgency to reassign personnel to other substantive areas.\n  The results of the strengthening and revitalization are beginning to \nbe seen. Officials of ACDA are effectively involved in bringing an arms \ncontrol perspective to executive branch decision-making at various \nlevels. The Agency was in charge of the critically important and \nsuccessful effort this spring to secure the indefinite extension of the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. The Agency is currently running the efforts \nto achieve a comprehensive test ban in negotiations in Geneva. The \nAgency recently submitted a remarkably detailed and informative annual \nreport to Congress that included a section dealing with the adherence \nof the United States to its arms control commitments and the compliance \nof other nations with their obligations under arms control agreements. \nAny Senator reading this compliance report, in either classified or \nunclassified form, would have to agree that ACDA is on top of various \narms control problems and that it is willing to be open and forthright \nwith the Congress regarding these matters and what can be done to deal \nwith them.\n  I am convinced that ACDA is on the right track now. Having decided to \nstrengthen ACDA, it makes no sense now to abolish the agency and give \nits unique and specialized responsibilities to the Department of State. \nWithin very real budgetary constraints, we need to stay the course and \ncontinue to strengthen ACDA. Our amendment would do just that.\n  Mr. McGeorge Bundy also told the committee:\n\n       Arms control--especially the limitation of nuclear danger--\n     is not easy. It requires agreement among sovereign states who \n     often fear and mistrust each other. It can require limits on \n     weapons that a military service may initially prefer not to \n     limit. It requires technical understanding, political \n     sagacity, and coordination from the White House. What I would \n     emphasize in particular, from my own service with two \n     Presidents who were deeply and directly engaged in the effort \n     to limit nuclear danger, is that there must be a close and \n     continuous relation between the President and his staff and \n     the main center of arms control analysis and effort. The \n     government's senior people on arms control should have easy \n     access, as a matter of right and expectation, to the White \n     House.\n\n  The value of independent access to the President as cited by Mr. \nBundy cannot be overestimated. Many arms control and nonproliferation \nmatters should be considered at the interagency level and decided by \nthe President. To put arms control at a lower level within the \nDepartment of State would mean that the arms control voice would be \nmuffled and key questions could be dealt with inside the Department. \nUnder the present and preferred arrangement, the Director is the \nprincipal adviser on arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation \nmatter to the President, the National Security Council, and the \nSecretary of State. Thus, the Agency can be actively engaged and \neffective at whatever level is appropriate.\n  Much is made of the notion that abolishing agencies such as ACDA will \nsave large funds. The ACDA budget is currently about $55 million. \nACDA's core spending would remain at about $45 million under my \namendment. The Vice President has set about the task of making all \nfeasible reductions throughout Government, and indications are now that \nsignificant cuts can be made. With regard to ACDA and the State \nDepartment overlap, it is clearly largely within the Department, and \nthere can be reasonable savings in areas in which the Department \nduplicates ACDA pointlessly. Beyond that, it is hard to imagine cuts \nthat would not simply mean the termination of important programs.\n  I conclude that there could be some relatively insignificant savings \nrealized from the merger of ACDA into State, but the results would not \nbe an improvement. It would amount to dollars saved very foolishly--at \nan unfortunately high price. Too much is at stake. We should not take \nsteps that \n\n[[Page S11064]]\ncould lead to risks to our national security. In a challenging and \nthreatening international environment, reasonable amounts spent on ACDA \ncan only be seen as a sound investment.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          The Paul H. Nitze School\n\n\n                            of Advanced International Studies,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Claiborne: As a long term observer of U.S. foreign and \n     security policy, I write to you in opposition to the foreign \n     affairs reorganization bill soon to be considered by the \n     Senate. This reorganization I believe to be ill-advised; \n     folding the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) \n     into the State Department seems to me to be unnecessary and \n     unwise.\n       In my experience as an arms control negotiator, I always \n     found ACDA's input into the negotiating process to be expert, \n     insightful, and uniquely helpful. That input could well be \n     lost if the Agency does not remain independent. As recent \n     events in Iraq, Iran, and North Korea show, nonproliferation \n     and arms control are more important than ever. Eliminating \n     ACDA from the diplomatic effort to protect our security would \n     be like eliminating the Marine Corps from the military \n     effort. While it will never replace its larger brethren on \n     the foreign policy team, ACDA plays an essential role as a \n     lean and flexible vanguard, always ready to aggressively \n     counter the threat weapons of mass destruction pose to our \n     national security.\n       The global security environment has changed radically in \n     recent years. The proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons and the increasing flow of materials and \n     know-how from the former arsenals of communism are now the \n     chief threats to our nation. ACDA has been the champion of \n     nonproliferation within the U.S. Government for more than \n     thirty years. Without the 1968 Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) the number of aspiring \n     nuclear powers confronting us today would be an order of \n     magnitude greater. The NPT would never have been achieved \n     without an independent ACDA balancing the bilateral interests \n     promoted by the State Department. Just two months ago, ACDA \n     led the interagency effort which made the NPT unconditionally \n     permanent. Organizing consensus for indefinite extension \n     among the nearly 180 parties to the NPT was a great \n     diplomatic victory for the United States. An independent ACDA \n     proved it could succeed in a post-cold war leadership role \n     that would have been impossible for it to play as part of the \n     State Department.\n       The Soviet Union has collapsed under the weight of its own \n     bankrupt ideology and the global threat of communist \n     aggression has shattered. But the technology (and even the \n     very weapons and materials) used by the communists to \n     threaten our way of life continue to endanger our nation, \n     only now the danger comes from many sources instead of one. \n     The game has changed, but the stakes are at least as great; \n     our national survival still hangs in the balance.\n       We should be strengthening our nonproliferation team, not \n     abolishing it. ACDA is a key part of the best team possible \n     to face the real and growing threat of nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological terrorism. In this new era of opaque and \n     unpredictable threats to our security, the vigilance that saw \n     us through the Cold War should not be relaxed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul H. Nitze.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I strongly support Senator Helms \ninitiative to reorganize our foreign affairs agencies--the time has \ncome to restructure the Department of State, USIA, and ACDA to better \nserve American interests abroad in the new post-cold-war world.\n  The combination of diminishing resources and increased international \ntrade and economic competition require us to revise our priorities and \napproach and restructure our institutions.\n  During my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee and now on the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, I reached the same conclusion that \nmany of my colleagues did--foreign aid is almost as unpopular as it is \nmisunderstood.\n  Time and time again I have addressed audiences that really believe \nthat foreign aid represents at least 50 percent of our budget--if we \njust scaled it back to 5 percent we could balance the budget.\n  Well, as most of us know, foreign aid hovers around 1 percent of the \nFederal budget, and is shrinking by the day.\n  So why do so many people have the wrong impression?\n  I think the problem stems from the fact that no one really knows what \nwe do abroad or why? Sure they understand emergency food and medical \nsupport to a country that is experiencing an earthquake or similar \nnatural disaster.\n  But what does sustainable development mean and why is it important?\n  Why are we the largest contributor to global family planning \nprograms?\n  Do we really need to fund the International Office of the Vine and \nWine?\n  I share the view of many Americans that think our aid does not \nsupport clear cut U.S. interests. And, central to this problem is the \ndisconnect between the agencies administering foreign aid and foreign \naffairs.\n  I commend Senator Helms for his ambitious effort to reorganize our \nbureaucracy to better serve our interests. His proposal to integrate \nour aid and interests in one agency closely tracks legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year. I also support his emphasis on our trade \nand economic interests--assuring each regional bureau actually has a \ndeputy responsible for trade and development will enhance our global \nstanding and performance.\n  The reforms outlined in S. 908 are essential to rebuilding American \nconfidence in our foreign aid programs. The bill reduces waste and \nexpensive duplication of agency efforts. And, in scaling back and \nfocusing our resources and effort, we will strengthen the coherence and \neffectiveness of our programs and policies.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, prior to the Senator proceeding, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed a letter to the President of the \nUnited States from a series of groups with respect to this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Planned Parenthood,\n\n                                                    July 26, 1995.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We urge you to oppose all efforts to \n     prevent the United States from sending an official delegation \n     to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, to be \n     held in Beijing, China in September. The UN Conference on \n     Women is predicted to be the largest UN conference ever held; \n     184 government delegations and over 6,000 NGO representatives \n     are expected to attend the UN meeting. The Conference will \n     adopt a Platform of Action which outlines critical actions \n     governments must take to advance women's rights and access to \n     resources in many areas including health, education, \n     economics, human rights and the environment. Our \n     organizations--representing millions of Americans--are deeply \n     concerned about attempts to stifle US participation in this \n     important global conference.\n       In response to recent reports of increases in the number of \n     human rights abuses in China, there are efforts currently \n     underway in the Senate and House of Representatives to block \n     participation of a U.S. delegation the UN Conference on \n     Women. We strongly believe that human rights abuses in China \n     and in all nations must be confronted directly. Our \n     organizations abhor infringements upon the basic human rights \n     of all people. At the same time, we find the abuse, suffering \n     and inequities faced by millions of women worldwide equally \n     distressing. The purpose of the Fourth World Conference on \n     Women is to assess progress made in improving women's status \n     and seek real solutions to bringing women out of the cycle of \n     poverty, inequality and discrimination that continues to \n     entangle so many women and their families.\n       American women should not be denied the voice of their \n     government at this high level international meeting. There \n     are appropriate vehicles for dealing with this matter \n     including multilateral and bilateral policy discussions with \n     the Chinese--not in the context of a world conference about \n     women's issues. The matters of women's health, human rights, \n     education, employment and political status are much too \n     important for the U.S.--or any nation--to ignore by sitting \n     on the sidelines of this prominent forum. The U.S. would be \n     doing an injustice not only to American women but to all the \n     world's women, if its voice is silent in Beijing.\n       The decision to hold a women's conference in Beijing was \n     made years ago by many nations and agreed to by former U.S. \n     President George Bush and then Secretary of State James \n     Baker. While many would prefer that this conference be held \n     elsewhere, especially now that the Nongovernmental (NGO) \n     Forum has been forced to a less than adequate site some \n     distance outside of Beijing, we believe that U.S. attendance \n     is critical. In fact, it would be a victory for China, which \n     does not want to be criticized, for the U.S. to be absent \n     from this international event. What better forum to highlight \n     women's abuses in China and all other nations, than this \n     global conference of government delegates, NGOs and media? \n     The U.S. has been a leading advocate on human rights and \n     democracy. Further, it has been one of the strongest voices \n     at the UN for NGO access and accreditation. Restricting U.S. \n     participation in the Conference would undermine \n\n[[Page S11065]]\n     our ability to use this conference as an opportunity to pressure China \n     on democracy and human rights issues.\n       We, the undersigned, represent a wide array of citizen-\n     based groups working to improve the lives of all people. We \n     focus on issues concerning human rights, economic and social \n     development, health, environment and women's rights.\n       We urge you to oppose all efforts to prevent or restrict in \n     any way the United States' full participation in this \n     conference.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Friends Service Committee, American Association of \n     University Women, The African-American Institute, Bay Area \n     Friends of Tibet (San Francisco), Center for Women's Global \n     Leadership, Rutgers University, Douglass College, Centre for \n     Education, Development, Population, and Population \n     Activities, Chesrown Metzger International Group, Childhope, \n     Church Women United, Coalition for Women in Development.\n       Delegation of Original Women of Philadelphia (DOWOP), The \n     Development Gap, Family Care International, Feminist Majority \n     Foundation, Friends of the Earth, Heifer Project \n     International, The Hunger Project, InterAction, Institute for \n     Policy Studies, International Center for Research on Women \n     (ICRW).\n       International Committee of Lawyers for Tibet (San \n     Francisco), Laubach Literacy International, MAP \n     International, Ms. Foundation for Women, National Audubon \n     Society, The National Black Women's Health Project, Oxfam \n     America, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America, Population Action International.\n       Population Communication, Save the Children, Tibetan \n     Association of Boston, Tibetan Association of Northern \n     California, Tibetan Rights Campaign (Seattle), Tibetan \n     Women's Association/East Coast (New York), United Church of \n     Christ, Board for World Ministries, United Church of Christ, \n     Coordinating Center for Women, U.S.-Tibet Committee (New \n     York), Utah Tibet Support Group (Salt Lake City), World Women \n     in Development and Environment.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that such time \nbe provided for me to speak in regard to this matter, Senate bill 908.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the Foreign Relations Revitalization \nAct of 1995 represents an important step in establishing a coordinated \nand coherent foreign policy and a refocusing of our national priorities \nin this time of limited resources.\n  We need our foreign relations to be conducted at the highest level of \nintegration and coordination, and the highest level of representation \nof the interests of this country and of the American people. And a top \npriority must be to ensure that our influence is used to benefit our \ninterests and to ensure respect for American leadership.\n  Senate bill 908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995, is \na bill which will do that.\n  I want to commend the Presiding Officer, and the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Helms, for his guidance and direction in crafting \nthis important legislation that eliminates program duplication and \nestablishes a sense of clarity in the conduct of foreign relations. \nThis bill also streamlines the delivery of services by eliminating \nthree agencies and consolidating their remaining functions within the \nDepartment of State. I believe this will strengthen the role of the \nSecretary of State and will enhance his ability to organize a foreign \npolicy structure that will best serve our Nation.\n  We will not be well served by a foreign policy that continues to flow \nfrom the mouths of many. This is a very important issue, and one that \nthe full Foreign Relations Committee addressed on several occasions \nwith witnesses appearing from the Agency for International Development \n[AID], U.S. Information Agency [USIA], and Arms Control Disarmament \nAgency [ACDA]. I found it interesting that some witnesses indicated \nthat it was important that separate sub-interests of the United States \nbe represented vocally and that there be a competition of sorts--a \n``good-cop, bad-cop'' approach to foreign policy, whereby the folks who \nhanded out the foreign aid for the United States would maintain good \nrelations with a particular client nation, while the Department of \nState would essentially hold the line in protecting United States \ninterests.\n  I find that to be somewhat troublesome. I think we need to speak with \na single voice. I do not think someone should be handing out foreign \naid to a country at a time when that very country is clearly acting \nagainst our interests.\n  If we continue with a foreign aid proposal, it should be with an \nunderstanding that the person asking for coordination and cooperation \nin one arena is the same person that will be delivering foreign aid and \nthe kind of assistance that this country gives to other nations that \nare developing.\n  The network of competing fiefdoms can only undercut the authority of \nthe Secretary of State in conducting foreign policy. This bill will \nchange that. It would be difficult to believe that those individuals \nwho have tried to represent our interests with a singular, clear voice, \nwould not favor this reorganization. Thus, it is no accident that \nvirtually every previous Secretary of State who has had experience in \nthis arena supports this bill.\n  I believe that it is no accident that all the former Secretaries of \nState that came to speak with us supported this concept, and supported \nit very clearly, as did the current Secretary before his voice was \nmuffled by the Vice President and others who suggested that perhaps he \nshould not have that opinion.\n  Sadly, rather than grab the opportunity to play a constructive role \nin helping to shape this proposal, the administration sought instead to \nadopt a fighting posture, a fixed-bayonet, take-no-prisoner strategy.\n  I was particularly troubled by the secret minutes of an internal AID \nstaff meeting that were provided to members of our committee. In that \ninternal staff meeting, the staff was advised that ``Our strategy is \ndelay, postpone, obfuscate, derail. If we derail [the bill], we can \nkill the merger.''\n  This has nothing to do with the merits of this particular proposal. \nIt has to do with the preservation of the bureaucracy. The American \npeople deserve better from public servants than to sit around the \nconference rooms of these agencies figuring out how to derail, \nobfuscate and delay the will of the American people.\n  The American people not only deserve a sound foreign policy, they \ndeserve to have individuals operating in our agencies so as to comply \nwith the will of the Congress and the people, as expressed through the \nCongress.\n  An entrenched group of Government bureaucrats has been diligent in \ntheir efforts to hold the line at any cost, by stonewalling and \ndelaying the process. This represents precisely the attitude of \nGovernment that this last election was designed to change.\n  People have signaled very clearly a distaste for this. They not only \nwant our Government to reflect their wishes, they want the Government, \nwhen it reflects the America interests abroad, to do so coherently, \nconcisely, and clearly.\n  They think if we have a single voice in foreign policy representing \nthe administration, be it Republican or Democrat, that single voice is \nmost likely to get the job done, rather than if we have competing \nagencies, an agency handing out foreign aid resources, another agency \nasking for cooperation in some other area of the international arena.\n  There is another point that ought to be made here, and that is while \nthere has been wild speculation that this consolidation plan and the \ncorresponding reductions in some foreign assistance accounts is \nundertaken, somehow our national prestige will be threatened. I think \nit is important to understand that national prestige is reinforced and \nenhanced when we operate with a clear, coherent, concise, \nunderstandable foreign policy. Speaking out of both sides of our mouths \nmay be a habit that is understood politically in the United States. It \nis really not appreciated by the American people. It is certainly not \nappreciated in the international community, when various organizations \nfrom this country misrepresent our stated policy.\n  On the related topic of our national prestige, it is my sense that \nour stock will rise on the exchange of the world's international \ncommunity, when we let them know that we intend to seriously address \nour responsibilities.\n  This reorganization plan correctly recognizes the fact that there is \na direct correlation between our international prestige and our ability \nto express ourselves with clarity. Second, it recognizes a direct \ncorrelation between our international prestige and the fiscal health of \nthis country. \n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n  If we do not have the ability to put our financial house in order, we \nwill not be respected by countries around the world. If we continue to \nrace down the road to bankruptcy, our influence will not be \nsubstantial.\n  This is the first authorization measure to come before the U.S. \nSenate that makes good on the promise we extended to the American \npeople when we passed the budget resolution; that is, to have a \nbalanced budget, to put our financial house in order. I submit to you \nthat living within those rules and setting our priorities, financially \nas well as refining and clarifying our message in the international \ncommunity--all of these things have no promise whatever other than to \nraise the prestige of the United States and to set an example in the \nworld community that we should be responsible.\n  Unfortunately, there are those in this country who think that there \ncannot be any cuts at all in the foreign relations area. And the \nlobbyists came around with their buttons saying ``Just 1 percent.'' \nThey said that since our foreign aid budget represents only 1 percent \nof the total Federal budget, it cannot be touched. I just want to point \nout that the ``Just 1 percent'' is actually $14.3 billion. And I \nbelieve it can be touched.\n  Should it be abolished? I am not in favor of abolishing foreign \nassistance. But I am in favor of sending a signal around the globe that \nwhen American citizens are tightening their belts, and exercising \nfiscal responsibility, there will be some ripple effects in terms of \nour aid. Not that we are going to shut anything down, not that we are \ngoing to change our policy dramatically, but we need to send a clear \nsignal that the shared sacrifice here at home should be matched by a \ncertain degree of sacrifice around the world. If we did not have the \ncourage to ask them to participate in that respect, they would lose \nsome of their admiration for the way we do business and they would lose \nsome of their respect for us, and we would lose some of our ability to \ninfluence events around the world.\n  This administration seems to be following the same path as the \nforeign aid lobbyists leveling charges that this commonsense reform \nbill represents a dangerous shift toward isolationism. It is not a \nshift toward isolationism but rather a shift toward the development of \nrespectable foreign policy. We have dealt with foreign situations but \nwe have not had foreign policy. Policy is something that is coherent, \nthat sticks together, that you can forecast, that you can predict. It \nhas a philosophy about it. We have too many lawyers in the process and \ntoo few philosophers. We solved this problem, and we solved that \nproblem, and we solved this other problem. But we never do it in \naccordance with a philosophy. And the philosophy should be a philosophy \nwhich keeps us from having additional problems.\n  I remember when the leaders of the so-called foreign policy \nestablishment of this administration came to talk to the committee \nabout the North Korean situation and the problems which we had \nnegotiating with the North Koreans over nuclear issues. I asked the \nleadership of this administration's foreign policy what it was about \nthe way we solved that problem that would suggest to the rest of the \nworld that we should not do the same things that the North Koreans had \ndone. They said, ``Well, nothing. We think this is a unique situation, \nand it will not never happen anyplace else.'' So we could afford to \nmake this a very sweet deal for the people who went against the U.S. \ninterest because it could never happen again.\n  I submit to you that is not foreign policy. It may have temporarily \nsolved that problem. But that is not policy. That is just pragmatism at \nthe moment, and does not look down the road.\n  We need a foreign policy, and we need a Secretary of State with the \ncapacity to articulate that foreign policy with clarity, with \nsingularity, and coherently around the world.\n  The administration has pursued a ``Chicken Little'' approach to \ndenouncing the reorganization plan by issuing a series of gloom and \ndoom forecasts about how passage of this bill will result in damaged \nAmerican prestige abroad and the possible emergence of more Rwanda-type \nsituations.\n  Well, it is just not so. The sky will not fall if the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency is abolished. At the present time, the State \nDepartment, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the CIA all have \ndepartments that are dedicated to pursuing arms-control-related \nfunctions. We have the ability to handle these issues in a coherent, \nrational, integrated, coordinated way if we make the changes that are \nin this important legislation which is before us.\n  It is time that we prioritize. Some said we cannot afford to reduce \nour foreign aid at all in 1993. AID helped fund a visit to the United \nStates by a group of Romanian architects so they could study U.S. \narchitecture. Was this a priority for a country whose economic \ninfrastructure was devastated by 40 years of Communist rule? I doubt \nit.\n  Last week, the Washington Times reported that AID recently spent \n$175,000 to produce 3,000 of these gender analysis tool kits.\n  I think the American people might wonder if the purchase of gender \nanalysis tool kits is the right kind of priority setting.\n  AID even floated a plan to help supply Moscow with street lamps. I \nknow that crime has gotten to be a problem in Moscow. But it is a tough \nsell to say to the people of the United States of America, some of whom \nlive in inner-city neighborhoods in the United States that make Moscow \nafter dark look like a trip to Disney World, that we should spend \nmillions of dollars putting street lights in Moscow, particularly at a \ntime when Moscow was spending billions of dollars grinding up the \npeople of Chechnya. I wonder.\n  Again, it is a question of establishing priorities.\n  In closing, and with great enthusiasm, I want to draw attention to \nthe key features of this reform legislation. It says we do not have \nunlimited resources, we need to set priorities, and we need policy, and \npolicy should not be articulated by contradictory messages issued by a \nvariety of organizations. It says we must maximize our influence, and \nin order to maximize our influence, let us not speak with many voices \nin contradictory messages; let us speak with one voice so those who \ndeliver the benefit can also be those who ask for the cooperation.\n  It says that we in the United States of America will not sacrifice \nwithout expecting others to sacrifice along with us, because ultimately \nwhen we have the kind of fiscal integrity that we ought to have, the \nentire world will benefit. When our house is in order, we will be the \nleader that provides the kind of message and the kind of opportunity \naround the world which will lift the performance of many nations with \nus.\n  We cannot spend as we have in the past in ways that are \ncounterproductive. As the world desperately needs a leader--and there \nis only one--the United States must revamp its capacity to deliver that \nleadership with clarity and coherence, and the Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act does that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure, because it is a major \nstep forward in our world leadership responsibilities.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, before the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri leaves for the policy luncheon, I want to say that he has made \nan extraordinarily brilliant speech. He has said it all, and he said it \nwell. If I may reminisce just one moment, one of the first people I met \nin another State after I came to the Senate was a young man in Missouri \nnamed John Ashcroft. I went to Missouri to work with him on a little \nmatter. I have admired him ever since. He has had a distinguished \ncareer, and he has already begun a distinguished career in the U.S. \nSenate. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11061-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I proposed an amendment to \ninstruct the United States delegation as to the sense of the Congress \nregarding the representative American perspective the United States \ndelegation should promote at the United Nations Fourth World Conference \non Women which will be held in Beijing, China from September 4 to 15, \n1995. I am pleased that the amendment was adopted today by voice vote.\n  My amendment instructs the U.S. delegates to recognize the importance \nof motherhood, to uphold the traditional family as the fundamental unit \nof society upon which healthy cultures are built, and to define or \nagree with definitions of gender only as the biological classification \nof male and female.\n  Most Americans would be surprised to learn that an amendment of this \nnature was even necessary. Most Americans would respond that of course \na U.S. delegation to an international conference would be eager to \nuphold the family as the fundamental unit of society and of course, \nthat there are only two genders, male and female.\n  However, the delegates to the Fourth World Conference on Women have \nmade these simple concepts an issue, and therefore, we need to be clear \nthat our U.S. delegation represents the views of most Americans.\n  At the last preconference meeting, held in New York City in March \n1995, one nation suggested that the word ``mother'' be removed from the \nplatform document and replaced with ``caretaker.''\n  What about the traditional family? We have heard a great deal of \ndiscussion lately about families and the important role they play in \nthe well-being of children and society. Conservatives and liberals \nalike are lamenting the breakdown of the American family and the dire \nconsequences--such as increased crime, high teen pregnancy rates, drug \nuse and lower educational performance which result from a breakdown in \nthe family and family values.\n  On all sides of the political spectrum there is a growing \nunderstanding that the family is the single most important factor in \ncombating these problems.\n  Finally, on the issue of gender Mr. President, this issue on its face \nseems ridiculous. At the March 15, 1995 Preparatory Committee meeting \nfor the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, delegates prepared \na draft platform. The word gender appears 184 times in that document. \nThe use of gender had never been an issue as a majority of delegates \nassumed that the term did not need definition.\n  In response to the various questions about the definition of gender, \nthe conference leadership floated the definition:\n\n       Gender refers to the relationship between women and men \n     based on socially defined roles that are assigned to one sex \n     or the other.\n\n  Delegates pressed for bracketing the word gender until a definition \ncould be agreed upon. Bella Abzug of the U.S. delegation in an angry \nspeech contested the bracketing saying:\n\n       We will not be forced back in the ``biology is destiny'' \n     concept . . . the meaning of the word ``gender'' has evolved \n     as differentiated from the word sex to express the reality \n     that women's and men's roles and status are socially \n     constructed and subject to change.\n\n  Many delegates became convinced that this move to refine gender was \ndesigned to forward an entirely different agenda, and not to further \nthe interests of ordinary women, the primary purpose of the Conference.\n  When many of these delegations sought to define gender as ``male and \nfemale, the two sexes of human being'' that definition proved \nunacceptable to many Western nations and even the U.S. delegation did \nnot want to be bound by a two-gender definition. The United Nations \nresponded to these concerns by issuing a statement that said ``gender \nis a relative concept'' and its ``roles can vary with time and \ncircumstance.''\n  It is for that reason that my amendment sought to ensure that the \nU.S. delegation agree with the definition of gender as the biological \nclassification of male and female, which are the two sexes of the human \nbeing.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment was to ensure that those \nwho represent the women of the United States at a world conference on \nwomen must indeed be representative of the majority of the women in \nAmerica. The amendment which the Senate adopted today sends a strong \nmessage in support of motherhood and the family, and traditional values \nwhich have made America a great nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11067-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am going to give President Clinton an \nopportunity to micromanage the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When \nhe is in the mood to have some ambassadors confirmed or some treaties \nconsidered, and that sort of thing, all he has to do is send word that \nhe no longer believes in that memorandum that was circulated by the \nAgency for International Development, the memorandum that said the way \nthe administration is going to beat this bill is to ``delay, postpone, \nobfuscate, derail.'' Well, his minions have done that in denying an \nopportunity to have cloture on this bill.\n  Invariably, as the Senators know, and as one of the reporters said, \nthe shoe is on the other foot--and that is correct. But this is an \nimportant bill, and the budget requirements of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee cannot be met without this bill, or some bill very close to \nit. \n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n  The point is that there has been no cooperation extended. There has \nbeen a lot of rhetoric, and that is the end of it. Mrs. Helms raised a \ndumb son, maybe, but she did not raise a stupid one. I understand the \nname of the game. The administration and its supporters have wanted \nthis bill to die a quiet death. It is not going to die. It is going \nback on the calendar, but it will return. Just as MacArthur said, I \nwill return, the administration can count on this bill's return.\n  I will enjoy the Tuesdays and Thursdays when we normally have \nbusiness sessions of the Foreign Relations Committee. The bill will not \nbe killed with the administration's tactic. It is going to keep coming \nback and back and back until we get a vote. If the Senate votes down \nthe bill, fine. That is fair enough. Or, if there is a move by Members \nof the Senate on the other side who want to present a concrete \nalternative, that will be fine. Or, if we can get now what we did not \nget before, a commitment from the Vice President of the United States--\nyou know, the fellow who is in charge of reinvention of Government--\nthat he and his associates will work with us, that will be fine. If the \nPresident of the United States indicates that he wants some ambassadors \ncleared and he wants his representatives in the Senate to cooperate in \njointly producing a bill, that will be fine.\n  But I appreciate the Senators on the Republican side, and I \nappreciate my good friend, Senator Pell, for having voted for cloture \nin both instances today.\n  At a later time, I will have more to say, and I thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11067-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 908\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, let me say to my colleague from North Carolina that \nwe have indicated to him that this would be back up again. We discussed \nthat with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. It is an important bill. But I think in the spirit \nof trying to get some things done--we can get on hopefully with part of \nthe recess--this is the best course to follow.\n  So I thank my colleague from North Carolina for his agreeing with \nthat procedure.\n  There will be votes throughout the day.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would just like to say to the majority \nleader and to the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I respect and appreciate the decision of the majority leader \nwith respect to the bill that was just on the floor, but I want the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to know that \nthe quote he read has already been disavowed. It is not the policy of \nthe Democratic side, and that is not what we are trying to do with \nrespect to this bill.\n  I would be happy to engage with the Senator further as we have \nprevious to this to try to see if we can arrive at some kind of \nunderstanding. It is an important piece of legislation. We are not \ntrying to avoid it altogether. But I think it was premature in its \ncurrent state, and we would be happy to work with the Senator from \nNorth Carolina in an effort to see if we can come up with a reasonable \nbipartisan approach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11068-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SENATE'S SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to my colleagues now what we would like to \ndo between now and the 12th of August--hopefully by the 12th, if not \nbeyond the 12th; that is, to complete action on the energy and water \nappropriations, to complete action on the DOD authorization bill, to \ncomplete action on welfare reform, to complete action on the DOD \nappropriations bill, and I am advised by Senators Stevens and Inouye--\nwe had a meeting in my office this morning--that could be done in one \nday. Marty was there, I might add, the Democratic leader's \nrepresentative. It was not a party meeting. They said what we could do. \nAnd there is also a hope, because we have had some conversations that \nthere may be renewed interest in getting some agreement, if possible, \non reg reform, that we can either finish it before we leave for the \nrecess, or finish it when we are back.\n  So I would just say in the spirit of everybody trying, I know there \nare going to be important amendments, and I know they want them to be \ndebated. Everybody has that right.\n  According to the appropriators, the DOD appropriators, many of these \namendments that are going to be taken care of in DOD authorization we \nwill treat the same in the appropriations bill. It might speed up the \nprocess. So that would be very helpful.\n  I say to the Democratic leader, I do not think we have tried to pile \nup too much here if everything goes well and if we all cooperate on \nboth sides. Most of these issues involved are not partisan issues. They \nare policy issues where you have Republicans and Democrats, \nparticularly in DOD, maybe in this energy and water, you have \nRepublicans and some Democrats on each side of the issues, so they are \nnot partisan issues. There should not be any partisan roadblocks that I \nknow of. I am not as familiar with the bills as obviously the managers \nare.\n  So we will now move to energy and water. And I will be very happy to \nyield to the distinguished Democratic leader if he wanted to make any \ncomments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would subscribe to what the majority \nleader indicated. None of the legislation contemplated for completion \nexcept perhaps welfare reform--we will have to see where we are on \nthat, but I think by and large the legislation pending is all \nlegislation that I am hopeful we can work through.\n  I am not as optimistic about the degree to which we can work through \nthese very significant amendments on DOD unless we have some \nunderstanding as to what the timeframe may be and whether or not some \nof these amendments could be offered as amendments to defense \nappropriations, but there are very serious questions here that have to \nbe addressed. And I think Members ought to expect long days and a \nSaturday session in order for us to accomplish all that the leader has \nset out for us to accomplish in the next week and a half.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be a Saturday session. I appreciate the Democrat \nleader mentioning that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11068-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11068-S11080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOP- MENT APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate business is the energy and water \nappropriation bill, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1905) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1996, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we are going to try to \nfinish this energy and water appropriations bill today. I have been \nadvised by the managers that they think that can be done. They have \nresolved one of the contentious issues.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I should like to address one portion of \nthat bill for just a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we recommence the debate on the \nappropriations for energy and water, I should like to express my \nappreciation to the distinguished chairman of that appropriations \nsubcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, and his colleague, the \nSenator from Louisiana, for the thoughtful and generous treatment they \nhave accorded to two projects in the State of Washington that are of \ngreat importance to that State. The subcommittee has approved and the \nSenate is now considering funding for the Yakima River Basin water \nenhancement project and the Columbia \n\n[[Page S11069]]\nBasin project. Each of them is beneficial both to irrigators and fish \nand wildlife and the Yakima Indian Nation in central Washington.\n  Last year, under the leadership of the Senator from Louisiana, \nCongress passed authorizing legislation creating the Yakima River Basin \nwater enhancement project. This program will fund water conservation \nand storage measures which will secure irrigation water supplies for \nfarmers, help salmon populations in the basin, and be of considerable \nbenefit to the Yakima Indian Nation as well.\n  Specific programs within the project are the Cle Elum Reservoir, the \nChandler pumping and powerplant, the Kachess Dam and Reservoir, \nirrigation and instream flow studies, enhancement of tributaries water \nsupplies and environmental compliance activities.\n  Further down the river, the Columbia Basin funding will help complete \nthat project's drainage system. It will assure a sustainable irrigation \nproject that will be able to meet its Federal repayment obligations and \ngenerate the project's intended social, environmental, and economic \nbenefits. Once a drainage inventory is finished, local irrigation \ndistricts and the local Bureau of Reclamation office will be able to \nexpedite work and reduce overhead burdens to finally complete the \ndrainage system, saving taxpayer dollars in the long run.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, weather is an uncertain thing. And if \nyou are a farmer faced with a drought, your entire livelihood is in \njeopardy. Washington State is no stranger to severe water shortages, \nand funding for these projects will make water supply more certain for \nfarmers within their areas.\n  These projects also improve conditions for fish. Already, at the \nYakima project, fish passage facilities have been installed at project \ndams and screens have been placed at irrigation diversions.\n  I am truly pleased that the Senate subcommittee and full committee \nhave approved funding for the Yakima enhancement and Columbia Basin \nprojects. Both are excellent measures for helping Washington State \nagriculture.\n  I encourage support for the overall bill and once again thank the two \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are now on the energy and water \nappropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Tennessee \nwants to wait a couple of minutes on the committee amendments, and we \nare going to obviously wait for that. But I might say to Senators that \nhave expressed an interest in amendments, the leader has asked us to \nget this bill finished tonight, and there are two Senators who have \ntold me they have amendments. I hope they could get here in the next \nfew minutes and we can get a reasonable time agreement and vote on \nthem.\n  Senator Bumpers indicated he had a gas-cooled reactor amendment. \nMaybe we could just ask Senator Bumpers' office if he could come down \nand offer that and do that rather quickly. Senator Jeffords on the \nRepublican side has a renewable resource amendment.\n  If Senator Jeffords could come down and share that with us so we can \nmove quickly with it. We are working up some amendments that we are \ngoing to make en bloc for various Members. But we cannot do anything on \nthe committee amendments until we get word from the Senator from \nTennessee who has a hold on those committee amendments.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed, I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the difficult things on this bill--which \nare nuclear waste in Nevada--we hope the new spallation source will be \nworked out. We believe that the Princeton problem has been worked out. \nThe difficult things, those that would have tied us up for a long time, \nI believe have been worked out. And it is my hope that dealing with two \nfairly short amendments, we will be ready to go to final passage.\n  I ask the Senator from New Mexico, does he not share my view that we \nought to be able to go to final passage very shortly?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, unless there are Senators that have not \nconferred with me--and I have had plenty of notes given to me; we are \nworking on most of them--I think most of them are solved. I think that \nconclusion is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would, from my standpoint, like to put Senators on \nnotice that if they have something they want in the bill, something to \ngo in the managers' amendment, please contact us so we can put it in, \nbecause we may be ready to wrap up, we hope, early this afternoon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Robert \nSimon be allowed the privilege of the floor during consideration of \nH.R. 1905, the energy and water appropriations bill, and any votes \nthereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be agreed to, en bloc, except as to the amendment \nfound on page 23, line 7, and the amendment found on page 38, line 19, \nand that the bill as thus amended be regarded as original text for the \npurpose of further amendment, provided that no point of order shall \nhave been waived by agreeing to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The committee amendments are printed in the Record of July 31, \n1995.)\n\n\n       Excepted Committee Amendment beginning on page 23, line 7\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, as I understand it, the first \ncommittee amendment which I exempted from that unanimous-consent \nrequest is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2053 to the Committee Amendment beginning on Page 23, \n                                 Line 7\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the provision relating to the expansion of a \n                  facility for the storage of uranium)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2053 to the committee \n     amendment on page 23, line 7.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 24, line 7, strike ``135(a)(2), 135(d), 135(e), \n     141(g), 145'' and insert ``135(d), 135(e),''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this has been agreed to by the two \nSenators from Nevada, myself, and the ranking member. I have no \nobjection to its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this has been worked out with the two \nSenators from Nevada. We support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2053) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S11070]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we are working with Senator \nJeffords and his staff regarding an amendment that he has. I ask \nSenator Bumpers and his cosponsor if they could be ready in a few \nminutes. We could take that amendment and get the debate, and maybe \nthere is a vote needed on that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mark \nTurner, who is a Javits Fellow detailed to the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, be allowed floor privileges during the debate \nof the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe, through oversight, after amending the first \ncommittee amendment, I did not proceed to have that amendment adopted, \nas amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first \ncommittee amendment, as amended.\n  The committee amendment beginning on page 23, line 7, as amended, was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] has an amendment on behalf of himself and \nthree other Senators. We are going to accept the amendment. He is going \nto modify it and then send it up. He agrees to speak up to 15 minutes \non the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if I may respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, that is perfectly all right with me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent there are 15 minutes on the \namendment and then we proceed to a vote on the amendment, and we intend \nto accept it at the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I will be proposing an amendment \nvery shortly which will help maintain the United States support for its \nsolar and wind power. It would restore $25 million and offset this by \nreducing funding for the Department of Energy's operations budget.\n  Mr. President, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 began to outline an \nenergy security strategy for our country. As I have argued many times \nbefore, energy security is vital to our economy and our national \nsecurity. I believe that renewable energy resources are important \ncomponents of our energy security strategy and must not be compromised.\n  The United States now imports in excess of 50 percent of the oil we \nuse to power our homes, automobiles and workplaces. This is a national \nsecurity concern, and our dependence on foreign sources of energy is an \neconomic security risk.\n  Mr. President, every month the Commerce Department releases its \nstatistics on the balance of our trade. The numbers are very grim. We \nare running huge trade deficits, and oil imports are a major reason \nwhy. Imports of oil constitute an enormous drag on our balance of \npayments and serve only to export U.S. jobs abroad.\n  In contrast, more than one-half of the manufacturing capacity of the \nU.S. solar industry is geared to exports. Northern Power Systems from \nmy State of Vermont markets wind turbine technologies around the globe. \nIf a city, town or power system in Saudi Arabia wants to build a wind \nturbine, they call Waitsfield, VT. Nevertheless, without adequate \nFederal support, the United States leads in developing renewable energy \ntechnologies will slip.\n  The U.S. Information Agency predicts that the worldwide market for \nrenewables and efficiency technologies will equal $280 billion through \nthe year 2010. However, they also point out that at the current rate of \ngrowth, the United States will capture less than 8 percent of this \nmarket. Why? Because Europe and Japan are funneling more and more money \nto their renewable companies in the form of capital financing and \nexport promotion. And that export promotion is what does the most \ndamage, especially deals they can give.\n  Mr. President, despite the proven successes of renewable energy \nprograms and their overwhelming public support, the renewable accounts \nhave been hit disproportionately hard in this bill. Funding for wind, \nsolar, and biomass programs have been cut 27 percent from the fiscal \nyear 1995 levels compared to a 15-percent cut in the Department of \nEnergy's overall energy supply research and development accounts.\n  We have made commitments to many small companies through public and \nprivate partnerships to drive renewables research and development to \nthe marketplace. We are just entering year 3 of a 5-year commitment to \nthe solar and wind field. To pull the plug now would constitute a \nserious abrogation of our commitment and undermine much of the progress \nwe have witnessed in the past few years.\n  In this time of fiscal constraint, hard choices must be made, and I \nagree with many of them. But solar and wind programs are working. These \nprograms have enormous nationwide benefits for a very small investment. \nFor example, the DOE wind program is working closely with Kotzbue \nElectric Association 30 miles inside the Arctic Circle in Alaska to \nsupply reliable wind energy and reduce dependence on diesel generators. \nThe Florida Solar Energy Center in Cape Canaveral works with more than \n100 solar manufacturers, resulting in significant exports to Latin \nAmerica. The AWT-26, one of the world's most advanced wind turbines, is \nbeing developed by former Boeing engineers outside of Seattle, WA.\n  Mr. President, we are pushing forward, working to lead this booming \nglobal market, and we will succeed if Congress maintains its commitment \nto wind and solar research and development. The money that is spent on \nrenewable energy programs has a direct impact on this country's bottom \nline. Overall, we can expect more than $4 billion in annual fuel cost \nsavings by the year 2000, more than $8 billion by the year 2010, and \nnearly $26 billion by the year 2020. Solar, biomass, wind and \ngeothermal energy systems will also create many thousands of jobs by \nthe year 2000.\n  This amendment simply asks the Department of Energy to speed up \nimplementation of the strategic alignment and downsizing plan, thereby \nreducing administrative costs. Currently, the Department spends $377 \nmillion for general management and program support functions.\n  One of the largest pieces of this budget is the field operations \noffices. These offices are the paperwork side of our national labs. A \nless than 10 percent cut of $25 million will help do what needs to be \ndone to keep us on track.\n  My amendment would shift this amount from administrative functions to \nsupport for solar, wind, and biomass programs. This money would not be \nused for overhead and paperwork but to finance important programs that \nassist small companies in the development of advanced renewable \ntechnology.\n  The goal we seek to accomplish today with this amendment has been \nrecommended by the Galvin task force, \n\n[[Page S11071]]\nwhich reviewed our national labs, and the Daniel Yergin task force, \nwhich advised DOE on how to best downsize.\n  Mr. President, we may hear arguments today that downsizing the \noperations office in this matter is not wise. However, this Friday \nSecretary Hazel O'Leary will announce additional components of her \nstrategic realignment plan. I expect a major component of her plan is \nto downsize the operations office, saving millions and millions of \ndollars in overhead costs.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing is moving money from paperwork and \nbureaucracy to technology and the development of science from top-down, \ncommand-and-control administration to technology transfer and \ninternational competitiveness and from duplicative management to small \nbusiness. Clean economic growth is not a contradiction in terms. New \ngenerations of environmental technologies are making it possible to \nhave both. To be truly strong, the U.S. economy must be efficient, \nclean, and fueled by stable supplies of energy. By voting for this \namendment, the Senate will help ensure that we attain these goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I ask my friend, what was the purpose of the quorum \ncall?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I was getting the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2054\n\n(Purpose: To provide that certain funds appropriated for the Department \n of Energy operations be available instead for energy supply, research \n    and development activities relating to certain renewable energy \n                                sources)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, at this time I offer my amendment and \nask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside for the \npurposes of consideration of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment of the Senator from Vermont.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Roth, Mr. Grams, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2054.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, line 23 insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . FUNDING FOR ENERGY SUPPLY, RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES RELATING TO RENEWABLE \n                   ENERGY SOURCES.\n\n       ``(a) Reduction in Appropriation for Departmental \n     Administration.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount appropriated in title III of this Act under \n     the heading Departmental Administration is hereby reduced by \n     $37,000,000.\n       ``(b) Increase in Appropriation for Energy Supply, Research \n     and Development Activities.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the amount appropriated in title III \n     of this Act under the heading Energy Supply, Research and \n     Development Activites is hereby increased by $37,000,000.\n       ``(c) Availability of Funds.--Of the funds appropriated in \n     title III of this Act under the heading Energy Supply, \n     Research and Development Activites--\n       ``(1) not less than $4,500,000 shall be available for solar \n     building technology research;\n       ``(2) not less than $78,929,000 shall be available for \n     photovoltaic energy systems;\n       ``(3) not less than $28,443,000 shall be available for \n     solar thermal energy systems;\n       ``(4) not less than $55,300,000 shall be available for \n     biofuels of which no less than half shall go toward the \n     Biomass Electric Program;\n       ``(5) not less than $42,000,000 shall be available for wind \n     energy systems;\n       ``(6) not less than $8,000,000 shall be available for \n     international solar energy programs;\n       ``(7) not less than $9,000,000 shall be available for \n     hydrogen research;''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, I am sponsoring an amendment that \nwould restore $37 million into solar and renewable energy programs. The \noverall DOE energy supply account was cut 15.6 percent, while the \noverall renewable accounts were cut by 27 percent. My amendment would \nbring into line the budget reduction of the solar and renewables \nprogram to the percentage reduction level of the other DOE energy \nsupply accounts.\n  This amendment would restore funding for solar and renewable energy \nprograms at the expenses of overhead. It would transfer 37 million from \nDOE's departmental administration to solar and renewable energy \nprograms. This represents a 10-percent cut in DOE's overhead. Recent \nstudies show that we need to reduce bureaucracy, cut overhead burdens \nand costs to have more effective and efficient R programs.\n  The Galvin Task Force Report, recently commissioned by the Department \nof Energy, recommended that bold action be taken regarding the \nreduction of administrative oversight. The report further states, DOE \nshould be able to accomplish a substantial reduction in oversight \nwithout reducing the dollars spent directly on R scientists and \nengineers. In addition, the Yergin Task Force also recently recommended \nthat DOE reduce total energy R costs by cutting directly at \nadministrative compliance and overhead costs. This amendment would \nrestore funding for solar and renewable energy programs by cutting \nadministrative costs identified in these reports.\n  I believe that funding renewable energy programs is an important \nissue to our Nation. Renewable energy programs promise to supply \neconomically competitive and commercially viable energy, while also \nassisting our Nation in reducing greenhouse gases and oil imports. The \nNation should be looking toward alternative forms and sources of \nenergy, not taking a step backward by cutting funding for these \nprograms.\n  My own State of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In \n1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first \nphotovoltaic laboratories in the Nation. The university has been \ninstrumental in developing solar photovoltaic energy, the same type of \nenergy that powers solar watches and calculators.\n  Delaware has a major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, which is \nnow the fastest growing manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in the \nworld. In collaboration with the University of Delaware and Astro \nPower, Delaware's major utility--Delmarva Power & Light--has installed \nan innovative solar energy system that has successfully demonstrated \nthe use of solar power to satisfy peak electrical demand. Through this \ncollaboration, my State has demonstrated that solar energy technology \ncan be an economically competitive and commercially viable energy \nalternative for the utility industry.\n  It is vital that we continue to manufacture these solar cell products \nwith the high performance, high quality, and low costs required to \nsuccessfully compete worldwide. Investment in Department of Energy \nsolar and renewable energy programs has put us on the threshold of \nexplosive growth. Continuation of the present renewable energy programs \nis required to achieve the goal of a healthy photovoltaic industry in \nthe United States. While the solar energy industries might have evolved \nin some form on the their own, the Federal investment has accelerated \nthe transition from the laboratory bench to commercial markets in a way \nthat has already accrued valuable economic benefits to the Nation.\n  The solar energy industries--like Astro Power--have already created \nthousands of jobs and helped to reduce our trade deficit through \nexports of solar energy systems overseas, mostly to developing nations, \nwhere two billion people are still without access to electricity.\n  International markets for solar energy systems are virtually \nexploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy \nis already one of the lowest cost options available to developing \ncountries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized \npower generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems.\n  The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing \nheavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership \nwith their \n \n[[Page S11072]]\n\nown solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and Germany held the \nlead in world market share for photovoltaics; the United States has \nonly recently recaptured international market dominance. Cutting \nfunding for commercializing these technologies would have a chilling \neffect on the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an international \nscale in these billion-dollar markets of today and tomorrow. The \nemployment potential of renewables represents a minimum of 15,000 new \njobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade.\n  It is imperative that this Senate support solar and renewable energy \ntechnologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our \neconomic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My State has \ndone and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and \nreliable energy future by supporting this amendment.\n                           Amendment No. 2054\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Jeffords \namendment and am pleased to be an original cosponsor. Over the past \n2\\1/2\\ years, I have had the opportunity to help formulate our \nrenewable energy policies, both as a member of the House Energy R \nSubcommittee, and now as a member of the Senate Energy Committee. This \namendment represents an important step forward in our efforts.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, we have a strong commitment to \nrenewable and alternative energy resources. Solar, wind, and biofuels \nplay a key role in Minnesota's overall energy blueprint, and these \npriorities are shared across this Nation. Our amendment demonstrates \nthis understanding while reducing redtape and bureaucracy at the same \ntime.\n  Too many taxpayers' dollars are being wasted on bureaucracy and red-\ntape in Washington and not on programs that help meet the energy needs \nof the people of Minnesota. If we are going to spend the taxpayers' \nmoney, we had better make sure it is for their benefit, and not for a \nbloated bureaucracy.\n  By slashing bureaucracy and eliminating $25 million from departmental \nadministration, we are able to increase the levels of funding for solar \nand renewables. Even DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary endorses this type of \napproach--her proposal for strategic realignment estimates potential \nsavings of nearly $2 billion through consolidating and realignment of \nthe current DOE structure.\n  Limiting the scope of Government--while expanding funding for \nrenewable energy resources--are goals which can be achieved together, \nas this amendment so clearly demonstrates.\n  The Jeffords amendment reflects a balanced prioritization of our \nlimited energy dollars. It is my strong hope that by maintaining a \nFederal commitment to solar and renewable programs, we will be able to \nachieve a strong and vibrant industry that is capable of thriving in \nthe free market.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Jeffords \nrenewable amendment. It allows us to pursue renewable energy resources \nat the same time we protect the taxpayers, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of such a proposal. Thank you and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senator Jeffords as a \ncosponsor of his amendment to restore funding to the solar and \nrenewable budget of the Department of Energy fiscal year 1996 spending \nbill.\n  Our amendment restores $25 million to this vital account, boosting \nfunding for solar, wind, and biomass energy research. Renewable energy \nhas the potential to reduce pollution, decrease our dependence on \nimported fuels, and produce good paying jobs here in the United States.\n  The United States has the opportunity to lead the world in clean, \nrenewable energy technology. Vermont in particular has taken the lead \nwith the development of wind and biomass energy technology. This \n``green technology'' has the potential to generate more than virtually \npollution free energy, it generates good paying manufacturing jobs in \nVermont and throughout the country.\n  The energy and water appropriations bill passed by the House \nmortgages the future of our energy program by dramatically reduced \nfunding for the solar and renewable energy budget, cutting it by 22 \npercent. I think that is a shortsighted approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So, the amendment (No. 2054) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for accommodating us \non the floor. We are pleased to have accommodated him. But I thank him \nfor accommodating us on time so we can move ahead with the bill and, \nhopefully, finish it in the next couple hours. I thank the Senator very \nmuch.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for accommodating us. This will be an important amendment to \nhelp. And I am very pleased to accommodate the committee with our \npromptness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask that that be withheld for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senators that have amendments \nthat they think are going to have to take time and perhaps be voted on, \nthat they accommodate the leadership of the Senate, the leadership on \nthe Democrat side and the Republican side.\n  Some colloquies earlier in the day indicated we wanted to get our \nschedule completed, especially on these issues that do not appear to be \npartisan in nature. So we have made a commitment to stay here tonight \nand finish this bill. I do not see any reason why we have to keep \nSenators here tonight. If Senators have amendments, please come down \nand offer them. I think that is only fair. So once again, I am not \ngoing to name Senators, but, please, if Senators have some amendments \nthat they want us to consider and that clearly need debate, would they \nplease come on down or call us and tell us?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Very seriously, this bill should not go into tonight. \nThe difficult things are worked out. If Senators will come down and \noffer these amendments, we can be gone this afternoon. And so I urge \nSenators not to wait until tonight. Frankly, we ought to go to third \nreading if Senators are not going to be here to offer their amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I said we pledged to get finished tonight, but it looks \nto me like we should be finished here early enough to get home and have \ndinner with our families for a change. On this bill, there were three \nmajor issues, and we have solved them, at least to the satisfaction of \nthe Senators that contested the issues. With Senator Lautenberg from \nNew Jersey, we have agreed to an amendment he has with reference to \nfusion energy. We solved the Nebraska Senator's issue, at least in this \nbody, with reference to interim nuclear waste. We have satisfied the \nissue between the Senators from Tennessee and the committee. We are \nwaiting for a colloquy on that. And, indeed, I believe we are real \nclose to solving it with the Senate Committee on Armed Services for a \ncolloquy with reference to our nuclear stockpile.\n  If we are able to work that out, whatever is left would be the \nBumpers amendment, who--the Senator has at least told us about it. And \nwe understand perhaps Senator Brown has an amendment with reference to \ntwo of the commissions that we funded, or one of them. And Senator \nBrown, and maybe Senator Brown's staff could advise Senators, we would \nbe ready for him shortly if he could come down. And I think maybe we \nhave heard that there might be one on the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. We do not know that.\n  All right. That is all that we are aware of that will require debate. \nWe have a number of amendments we will offer as chairman and ranking \nmember \n\n[[Page S11073]]\nas we wrap this up. Some we will not be able to accept. And the \nSenators will have to understand that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am prepared to enter into a colloquy \nwith the distinguished Senators from Tennessee. We can either enter it \nin the Record or we can state it here on the floor, whichever they \nprefer. What is Senator Thompson's preference?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator will state it briefly.\n  I would like to state what I understand to be language that is agreed \nto by the managers of this bill. It is language which clarifies the \nintent of the committee and replaces references in the committee report \non pages 96 and 97 with regard to the siting of the new spallation \nsource project. Part of the agreed-upon language is as follows:\n\n       The conferees make no recommendation with regard to the \n     siting of the new spallation source project. The Department \n     of Energy shall make that determination in a fair and \n     unbiased manner.\n\n  Am I correct in stating that this is part of the language that is \nagreed to for the purpose of legislative history?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the following \nlanguage is also agreed to by the managers:\n\n       The conferees direct the Department to evaluate \n     opportunities to upgrade existing reactors and spallation \n     sources as a cost-effective means of providing neutrons in \n     the near term for the scientific community while the next \n     generation source is developed. This evaluation shall be \n     available prior to the Appropriations Committee's hearings on \n     the Department's fiscal year 1997 budget submission.\n\n  Am I correct in stating that this language is also agreed to?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just read it carefully, and I ask that \none word be deleted, and then I will say we agree.\n  Where it says, on the second line of what the Senator read \n``spallation sources as a cost-effective means,'' I wonder if we can \nstrike the word ``a'' and just say ``sources as cost-effective means'' \ninstead of ``a cost-effective means.''\n  Mr. FRIST. That will be agreeable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we strike that ``a,'' then my answer to the \nSenator's question is that is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I believe it is our further \nunderstanding that our conferees will seek to place the agreed-upon \nlanguage in the conference report; am I correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. Let me say to both Senators \nfrom Tennessee, it has been a pleasure working with them on this. They \nhave been tenacious. We had a genuine discussion at length and we came \nup with something at least this Senator believes is workable and good \nfor spallation and neutron acceleration in the future. I think that is \na very important part of the necessary science for the United States.\n  I think the second part of it means that we will not fall behind \nwhile we proceed with the new major construction, and the first \nindicates that the Department will decide on a fair and equitable basis \nthe site for the big machine, which will cost in excess of a billion \ndollars.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. This will help us move forward in those ways, and we \nappreciate the accommodation of the Senator from New Mexico and his \nwillingness to work with us on this.\n  Mr. FRIST. We do appreciate it, Mr. President. It does reflect, I \nthink, the critical importance placed on the Department of Energy's \nrecommendations in making this site in the best way that they see fit \nin terms of overall systems development for the entire country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, I wonder if any \nof the other Senators who arrived have amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, we are right \nnow attempting to see if we can work this out, if we could have a \nlittle more time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2054, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it has come to my attention, and I \nbelieve Senator Jeffords from Vermont agrees, that there is a \ntypographical error in the amendment that the Senator offered, which \nhas been agreed to by the Senate. So I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be modified, as per the amendment which I now send to the \ndesk. This change is agreed upon by the Senator from Vermont, the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modification of the \namendment previously adopted? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, after line 23 insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FUNDING FOR ENERGY SUPPLY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n                   ACTIVITIES RELATING TO RENEWABLE ENERGY \n                   SOURCES.\n\n       ``(a) Reduction in Appropriation for Departmental \n     Administration.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount appropriated in title III of this Act under \n     the heading Departmental Administration is hereby reduced by \n     $25,000,000.\n       ``(b) Increase in Appropriation for Energy Supply, Research \n     and Development Activities.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the amount appropriated in title III \n     of this act under the heading Energy Supply, Research and \n     Development Activities is hereby increased by $37,000,000.\n       ``(c) Availability of Funds.--Of the funds appropriated in \n     title III of this Act under the heading Energy Supply, \n     Research and Development Activities--\n       ``(1) not less than $4,500,000 shall be available for solar \n     building technology research;\n       ``(2) not less than 78,929,000 shall be available for \n     photovoltaic energy systems;\n       ``(3) not less than 28,443,000 shall be available for solar \n     thermal energy systems;\n       ``(4) not less than 55,300,000 shall be available for \n     biofuels of which no less than half shall go toward the \n     Biomass Electric Program;\n       ``(5) not less than 42,000,000 shall be available for wind \n     energy systems;\n       ``(6) not less than 8,000,000 shall be available for \n     international solar energy programs;\n       ``(7) not less than 9,000,000 shall be available for \n     hydrogen research;''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it necessary to reconsider and table that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Bumpers is \ngoing to offer an amendment with reference to the water-cooled reactor. \nI understand he is willing to enter into a time agreement of 1 hour \nequally divided. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally \nallocated to Senator Bumpers and Senator Johnston.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will check with Senator Stevens and make sure that \nhe can come down and be part of this argument.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2055\n\n (Purpose: To terminate the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor Program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts. \n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending committee \namendment will be set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, and Mr. Kerry proposes an amendment numbered 2055.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike lines 22-23 on page 20 and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``$2,793,324,000 to remain available until \n     expended. Provided That, no more than $7,500,000 of such \n     funds shall be used for the termination of the Gas Turbine-\n     Modular Helium Reactor program.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is a complicated subject dealing \nwith $12.5 million, not a lot of money around here. But considering the \nbudget constraints we are operating under, we need to be very careful \nwhat we spend. It is, to use the technical term, $12.5 million to \ncontinue the ``gas turbine-modular helium reactor.''\n  This is a project that has been around for a very long time. A lot of \nmoney has already been spent on the program. Make no mistake about it, \nwe have put $900 million into it, and industry has put almost as much. \nBut it has been sagging simply because it is not viable. It is not \nviable technically within the time frame within which we ought to \ncomplete it and the National Academy of Sciences says you cannot leave \nplutonium lying around stored for the periods of time that you are \nlikely to have to store it before this reactor is completed and has the \nability to burn it.\n  In addition to that, the National Academy of Sciences says leaving \nplutonium stored is a dangerous proposition, and the longer you leave \nit stored, the more dangerous it becomes because of the threat of \ndiversion of the plutonium to weapons.\n  The Academy does not like the program. I do not like it. A lot of \npeople do not like it, and they do not want to spend any more money on \nit. The first reactor that was used for demonstration of this \ntechnology was in Pennsylvania back in 1967 to 1974. Then a larger \ncommercial plant was built in Colorado. And after operating for 16 \nyears, it was finally shut down because it could only operate 14 \npercent of the time.\n  Now, Mr. President, just like the super collider and a host of other \ntechnologies we have undertaken, including the liquid metal breeder \nreactor, there always comes a time to shut these things down. In 1993--\nand I hope all Senators will listen to this--the U.S. Senate, this \nbody, voted 58-41 to terminate this program. But we got over to \nconference, which is so often the case, and we receded to the House and \nthe project continued.\n  This year, the Appropriations Committee in the House provided $20 \nmillion to continue this thing, and Congressman Klug offered an \namendment to kill it, and the vote to kill this project in the House \nthis year was 306-121.\n  Now, what we have had here is a little shell game. We did not put any \nmoney in, and the House did. They did not put in any money, and we did. \nNow we are back to we did not have any money in it until it was offered \nin the Appropriations Committee a few days ago, after the House just \ngot through killing this thing by 306 votes to 121. This is pork at its \nworst. There was $12.5 million in the bill here on the floor right now. \nBut do you know why? The Senator from Alaska--which was certainly his \nright--put it back in in committee. He won it there by 15-8. But \nSenator Domenici, in the chairman's mark, had torpedoed this thing. He \nleft $7.5 million in the budget to terminate. That is the termination \ncost.\n  Incidentally, my amendment only cuts $5 million. The Senator from \nAlaska got $12.5 million put back in. I am only cutting 5 of that \nbecause I agree with Senator Domenici. We ought to use that $7.5 \nmillion to torpedo this project once and for all. The senior Senator \nfrom Texas, with whom I agree about 1 percent of the time, made what I \nthought was a good statement the other day in committee. He said, \n``When the Department of Energy, or anybody else, wants to get rid of \nsomething, why do we not, at least occasionally, if the bureaucrats \nwant to get rid of it, honor their requests?'' It is very seldom they \nwant to.\n  When I think of all the unmet needs of this country, and when I think \nof all the pressures on the domestic discretionary spending side of \nthis budget, and here the House has killed this thing almost 3-to-1, \nand you are talking about a project that would cost $5.3 billion to \ncomplete--we are not talking about a bean bag here, Mr. President. The \nFederal share would be $2.6 billion.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at this point?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is not the $5.3 billion figure the Senator refers to \nthe amount for the new production reactor, which was a different \ndesign, and that was wholly financed by the United States?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Repeat your question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The $5.3 billion figure the Senator refers to was for \nthe new production reactor, which was designed several years ago, \ndifferent from this design, and wholly supported by the United States \nand nothing by either foreign countries or by the domestic industry, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, DOE said that they would expect this to cost \nbillions to complete.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of whose dollars?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Half Government and half private. That is the way the \nproject has been operated so far.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But the $5.3 billion was the cost of the new production \nreactor which was the tritium reactor for the manufacture of tritium, \nwas it not?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, you could be right about that, I am not sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And there has been no cost put on this.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, $5.3 billion is $5.3 billion.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This is a different design from the new production \nreactor on which the $5.3 billion estimate was made.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You are talking about something different from the gas \nturbine modular helium reactor?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This design is different. The initial design of the new \nproduction reactor had a steam cycle. This has no steam cycle and has a \n50 percent higher efficiency.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me just say that it is a different design reactor, \nbut the figures I am using are sort of a horseback guess by the \nDepartment of Energy of what it would cost for the new design, not the \nold design.\n  Well, to get on with the story, we can always find some rationale to \nkeep a project going--new design, old design, anything to keep the \nmoney flowing. But you ought to bear in mind, there has not been one \nsingle nuclear plant built in the last 20 years, and right now there is \nnot one single utility in America that has any plans to build one.\n  So you are talking about 20 years we have not built one, and \ncertainly if somebody started trying to license one now, it would take \nanother 20 years, and nobody is going to license one under current \ntechnology ever again.\n  I started off confessing that I am not a physicist. I did not even \nhave high school chemistry. These subjects are difficult to me. They \nare not difficult for the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Do you know what the National Academy said? The best argument that \nthe Senator from Alaska can make, or anybody else can make, for going \nforward with this project is that this advanced reactor will burn \nplutonium. That is a highly desirable goal.\n  Everybody in the U.S. Senate wishes we could wave a wand and some new \ntechnology would appear to burn plutonium, get rid of it. One of the \narguments that has consistently been made for this reactor is that is \nwhat it will do. I am not going to argue whether ultimately, after we \nspend $5 billion, we might have something that would burn plutonium.\n  I want to make a couple of points. One I have already made, that \nburning plutonium in a new reactor is even more dangerous than our \npresent situation, because it will be years and years and years before \nthis reactor is ready. Meanwhile, we will have all this plutonium \nstored, and then even after we finish it, it will take years and years \nand years to burn it up, during which time it is always subject to a \ndiversion--to Qadhafi, North Korea, or whoever. \n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n  A more compelling argument is the one the National Academy of \nSciences made when they said, in 1992, ``The committee believes that no \nfunds should be allocated for development of high-temperature gas-\ncooled reactor technology within the commercial nuclear power \ndevelopment budget of DOE.''\n  In addition to that, they have said there are two much more \npreferable ways to get rid of plutonium. One is to fabricate it with \nother fuel and burn it up; the other, which is essentially my favorite, \nis vitrification, a process which we have also spent a lot of money on \nand which so far as we know will pay rich dividends.\n  Now, Mr. President, further quoting the National Academy of Sciences, \nin their 1994 report said, ``These advance reactor types themselves, \nhowever, are not economically competitive with other sources of \npower.'' Listen to that: ``These advance reactor types themselves are \nnot economically competitive with other sources of power,'' and the \navailability of plutonium as fuel does not make them economical. The \nstorage of large stocks of weapons--plutonium--until such reactors \nbecome competitive, is not attractive for security reasons.\n  Now, Mr. President, none of the research for this goes on in my \nState. I do not know where it goes on. I do not have a dog in the \nfight. All I know is I have been waking up screaming for the last 6 \nmonths--not about a budget cut, not about trying to balance the budget, \nbut about our priorities.\n  I spoke at the Governors School in my State last Saturday. There are \n400 of the presumably brightest students in my State. They go to a 6-\nmonth school at a little liberal arts college called Hendrix College, \nwhere my sons went to school. When I walked out, a woman who accosted \nme said, ``My son who is here will not be able to get a college \neducation.''\n  We did not elaborate on that. But we are cutting student loans, we \nare cutting income investments, earned income tax credits. We are going \nto wind up cutting welfare for the poorest of the poor. I have no \nobjection to reforming welfare. We will wind up cutting food stamps. We \nare going to cut everything that affects about 30 to 40 percent of the \npeople in this country, and we are going to increase defense spending \n$7 billion above what the Defense Department says they want-- $7 \nbillion above the President's request--but still, twice as much as \nvirtually the rest of the world combined. Here is an opportunity to \nsave a paltry $5 million, and in the future, lord knows how many \nmillions.\n  The National Taxpayers Union, the Citizens Against Government Waste, \nall those people are strongly in favor of this amendment, and \ntorpedoing this technology, not once and for all, but at least for the \nforeseeable future, until the National Academy of Sciences says it has \na lot more promise than it has now.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I yield to the Senator from Alaska 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have authored the provision in the \nreport that Senator Bumpers' amendment seeks to delete because of my \nbelief that this new technology, which has not been analyzed by the \nNational Academy, may be critical to our energy future.\n  What I am trying to accomplish by the change that was made in the \nreport is to create the availability of $5 million to complete the \nstudy by the National Research Council of the technical feasibility and \neconomic potential of GT-MHR for power generation.\n  I got into this because of my role in arms control. One of the \nproblems we have run into is the destruction of plutonium. I have been \ntold that this process will destroy plutonium as it is used to produce \nelectric power.\n  As a matter of fact, I think the claim can truly be made that this \nnew concept--and it is a new concept--has the potential to destroy \nweapons-grade plutonium and eliminate its proliferation potential.\n  If the Senator will look at the report on page 91, what we have done \nis increase the funding of $5 million over the cost of the close-out of \nthe program with the understanding that no more than the $5 million is \navailable until the National Research Council has completed its study \nand the results have been reported.\n  That means that the $5 million is available to do just what the \nSenator from Arkansas says has not been done. It is available for \nmaking the study and to report to respective committees of Congress. If \nit finds that this process has as much potential as we believe it has, \nthe program will not be closed down. It will be continued.\n  Now, this is an entirely new procedure. It is a concept of a gas-\ncooled reactor with a very high rate of efficiency. It is something \nthat should be reviewed by the National Academy before the project is \nclosed up.\n  Let me say that the Senator from Arkansas is right in one respect. \nThe Government and industry have put $1.5 billion into trying to find a \ntechnology to accomplish the results that the program originally sought \nof nuclear power generation meeting the safety requirements of our \ncountry.\n  One of the added benefits of this new concept is that it is possible \nfor this gas turbine modular helium reactor to use plutonium for the \npurpose of generating power and at the same time accomplish the world's \nsought-after result of destroying plutonium.\n  I believe that this is something which the Senate should realize what \nwe are trying to do, which is to get a review of the technology. The \ntechnology is much different from that which has been the subject of \nthis vast investment in the past. This is a technology which uses \nceramic-coated fuel and uses inert helium as the heat transfer medium. \nIt allows higher operating temperatures than can be found in the water-\ncooled reactors. The water-cooled reactors have been the ones used by \nthe world's nuclear power plants.\n  This GT-MHR process uses higher temperature helium coolants directly \nto drive the turbine that drives the generator. As a result, the \nefficiency is much higher than the water-cooled reactors. But, what is \nmore, it then has the side benefit that was brought to my attention, \nand that is that it will destroy weapons-grade plutonium so it can no \nlonger be used for nuclear weapons. The GT-MHR not only destroys it and \ndegrades it while generating electricity, it is really not even a \nproblem as far as waste disposal. This has been one of the great \ndifficulties with nuclear-powered generation in the past.\n  I believe that what we are trying to do is let the scientific \ncommunity now analyze this new concept that is available, and only \nexpend Federal money in the future, if GT-MHR is found to have the \nfeasibility and economic potential as it has been represented by those \nwho have developed it and presented it to the Department of Energy.\n  The Senator says this is pork. There are no nuclear reactors in my \nState. There is no helium in my State. There is nothing connected with \nthis process in my State. I am the one that offered this amendment for \none purpose only, to get the National Research Council to determine \nwhether this process has the potential to accomplish two national \nbenefits: First, to provide a process by which we can start developing \nan industry that can provide environmentally safe nuclear-generated \nenergy; and, second, that the process that has been presented will in \nfact destroy plutonium at the 90-percent level in so accomplishing the \nfirst benefit. I think the second benefit is the one that is most \nimportant to the world.\n  There are enormous stakes here. There is no question about that. If \nthis process proves valid, as people believe it will, this $5 million \nmay be the most important $5 million we have ever invested. We are not \ninvesting it in the process. We are investing in investigating the \nprocess to determine if it has the potential as presented. If it does, \nthen the research will continue with the $7.5 million that was intended \nto be used to close out the program. And Congress will be directly \ninvolved in how much, if anything, the Federal Government will put into \nthe further advancement of this concept.\n  But for now, what we are doing is saying $5 million will be used \nduring the period of the evaluation. That is the maximum that can be \nused to evaluate this process. After having spent $1.5 billion in \ngetting this from the very beginning of nuclear technology development \nto the present, and not having successfully found a process \n\n[[Page S11076]]\nthat will meet our needs, it seems to me to be very little to ask that \nwe put up $5 million to check this latest technology.\n  This technology is important because it hinges on two different types \nof technology in order to be successful--the new gas turbine and the \ngenerator that has been used in the past. If the technology is proven \nto have the potential that we feel it does, then, I think we will have \na program that will meet more than our national needs. It will meet the \nworld's needs.\n  There are assertions that the Senator from Arkansas has made that I \nbelieve should be answered. I can answer them for the record. But I \nthink the most important thing to note is that this has not been \nreviewed before at this level.\n  I will reserve what time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes and ten seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is 10 minutes sufficient for the Senator?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Five minutes is fine.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers amendment to \nterminate the gas-turbine modular-helium-reactor program. For the past \n30 years, the Department of Energy's program has only served as another \nFederal monetary waste. To date, the taxpayers have already spent $900 \nmillion to advance gas-coolant reactor technology. One would imagine \nthat after costing the American public nearly $1 billion, we would see \nsome type of tangible technological benefits. But this is not the case.\n  In 1992, the National Academy of Sciences study concluded that the \ngas-cooled reactor has low market potential. Last month the DOE stated \nin a report by the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board that it did not \nsee any further need to continue to develop the program.\n  The report said--this is a quote we have not heard yet, I do not \nbelieve anyway, at least I have not:\n\n       This technology requires a very expensive, long-term \n     development program that cannot be supported in the near \n     future. Given industry's low interest in this technology, DOE \n     has requested termination of the Gas Turbine Modular Helium \n     Reactor Program.\n\n  But I have to say, Mr. President, that my concern is not a technical \nconcern. Yes, I am concerned about the energy industry. I believe, had \na lot of this money been spent to develop enhanced recovery programs \nand to do something to stop the demise of the domestic oil industry, I \nwould be in strong support of it. That is where our money should have \ngone.\n  The GAO report estimates that the total cost to design and construct \na gas-cooled reactor should be approximately $5.3 billion, of which \ntaxpayers are expected to absorb approximately 50 percent. Mathematics \nwould tell us that we would save more than $2 billion of hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars simply by going with the President, Congress, DOE, and \nthe National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, and \nthe list goes on and on.\n  Congress has been trying to terminate funding for this program for \nthe last several years. Finally, this year, the House adopted an \namendment to eliminate the program altogether. Rightfully, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee authorized $7.5 million to cover the \nDepartment of Energy's termination of this program. The administration, \nthe Bush administration, the Reagan administration, Congress, \nscientists and many of the fiscal unions, such as the National \nTaxpayers Union, the National Tax Limitations Committee, the Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, are united in their campaign to terminate the \nproject. The Department of Energy, like the rest of us, must make \nmassive budget cuts if we are to ever keep our commitment to the budget \nresolution that we made that would eliminate the deficit by the year \n2002.\n  We can no longer afford such luxuries as the gas-cooled reactor that \ndo not earn their Federal keep. With the possibility of the dismantling \nof DOE, the administration has made a wise decision to end the program \nthat only serves as a liability.\n  America is watching both the House and the Senate as we bring Federal \nspending back under control. By supporting this amendment, we are \nlegislating exactly the way we said we would last November by \nappropriating wisely and cutting out programs that continue to waste \nFederal dollars intended for future generations.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not as impressed as I should be, I guess, \nwith the National Academy of Sciences, but I am impressed with the \nNational Taxpayers Union and many of the groups that are looking at \nthis from a fiscal perspective.\n  I would only say this is a good example of what Ronald Reagan said in \none of the greater speeches I have ever heard, entitled ``Rendezvous \nwith Destiny,'' way back in 1965 when he said there is nothing closer \nto immortality on the face of this Earth than a Government program. I \nthink this is such a program.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  There is a lot of technology involved here, but the question is \nreally quite simple. What the Stevens amendment does--and it is a very \nsound amendment--it simply says that before we take this program, which \nhas a promise of burning 85 to 95 percent of the plutonium which is put \nthrough the cycle--and that compares with 20 percent of plutonium which \nwould be burned in a light-water reactor, but before we stop this \ntechnology which has that capacity, that hope of burning 85 to 95 \npercent of the plutonium, we get a report from the National Research \nCouncil, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences. No more \nthan $5 million may be spent until that evaluation takes place. That is \nall the amendment does.\n  We have done in this country research on these high-temperature gas \nreactors over a period of many years. This is a new design which has \nnever been evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences. It is 50 \npercent more efficient than the previous design. It is the first design \nthat has used the high-temperature helium gas directly against the \nturbine, which is a radical new design.\n  Moreover, the main reason we want to do this is because of plutonium \nburnout, but it also has the added advantage in that this reactor \ncannot melt down. Its fuel density and maximum temperature is less than \nthe melt rate of the fuel. So if you lost all coolant, there would be \nno possibility of a meltdown of this reactor, which is one of the \nreasons that Mr. Mikhailov, who is the Russian Energy Minister, wants \nto build this reactor in a consortium with America. They have a \nproposal whereby they would put up half of the costs, and the net cost \nto the United States, if this were done, would be about $350 million, \nnot $5.3 billion.\n  Mr. President, the fact is we do not know the answers to these \nquestions about exactly what it would cost because, frankly, we need an \nevaluation by the National Research Council of the National Academy of \nSciences. Really, as a matter of prudence, we ought to have the \nNational Academy of Sciences look at this brand new technology, this \nbrand new design before we scrap this program in which so much has been \ninvested, which has such hope not only for plutonium burnup but it has \ntremendous hope for being meltdown proof. It is what we call a \npassively safe reactor.\n  I might add, it also has the capacity and capability to make tritium \nin a reconfiguration, which is the reason it was picked as the top \ncandidate for the new production reactor. In any event, this is a very \nprudent thing to do, to have the National Academy of Sciences look at \nthis matter before we scrap the reactor. And that is all the Stevens \namendment does. It represents real progress. We are not committing this \ncountry by this amendment to build the reactor or to spend additional \nmoney but simply to have the National Academy of Sciences look at this \ndesign. That is all it does. \n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\n  Mr. President, did the Senator from Alaska desire additional time at \nthis point?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield me just a \ncouple more minutes, I do not want to use it all because I want to \nrespond in the end. But, I would like to reference the committee \nreport, and I encourage my colleagues to read it.\n\n       The Committee understood that the GT-MHR has the capability \n     of destroying 90 percent of weapons grade plutonium 239 when \n     used alone and over 99 percent of the plutonium 239 when used \n     in combination with an accelerator-driven reactor without the \n     need of reprocessing or recycling of the material. The \n     evaluation shall also include, therefore, a review of the \n     technical capability of the reactor to accomplish the near \n     total destruction of weapons grade plutonium alone or in \n     combination with an accelerator without reprocessing and \n     recycling. The study shall be supported by funds within this \n     account and shall be completed no later than 90 days \n     following the signing of this bill into law. If the results \n     reported are positive, the balance of the funding shall be \n     released to continue the development of the GT-MHR and, if \n     negative, the balance of the funding shall be applied to the \n     program closeout.\n\n  In other words, all we are doing is saying give the National Research \nCouncil an opportunity to review this before it is closed out. If they \nfind that the Senator from Arkansas is correct, it will be closed out. \nIf they find that those who have presented the process are correct, \nthey will continue to analyze and find out how to apply this new \ntechnology to these two very vital world goals.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 5 minutes to the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas, and I must say to my friends I do so on a \npersonal level with some reticence because I worked so closely with \nboth the proponents of this. Nevertheless, I feel very strongly that \nthis is one of the moments where Congress really needs to just make the \ncut. The House has voted by 306 to 121 to cut the funding for this. We \nhave been toying around with this technology since 1970. We have spent \nnow some $900 million to date for the technology. But no commercial \nbuyer is prepared to step up for this technology. Gas-cooled reactors \nemploy what is known as a passive cooling system, and these do not \nallow for the use of conventional containment structures to prevent the \nrelease of radiation in case of accidents. That lack of containment \ncould be a serious problem and would represent a major safety tradeoff.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. KERRY. Not on my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On my time. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield but not on my time. If I can use the time of the \nSenator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. Just on my time on that point. The Senator said \nthat they do not allow for the use of containment. You cannot put \ncontainment over a gas-cooled reactor. It is simply that it is not \nnecessary because the fuel density and the temperature is such that it \ncannot melt down. You cannot have that kind of accident where hydrogen \ngas accumulates and you have an explosion and you need containment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am not suggesting you have a meltdown structure, but you \ncould nevertheless have a release of radiation, and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission's advisory committee has suggested that they are \nnot willing to accept these approaches. Moreover, in order for this \ntechnology to be competitive, you would have to complete the R phase, \nwhich would cost another $700 million, and then in order to make the \ntechnology commercial, you are going to have to build a full-scale \ndemonstration plant.\n You are going to have to operate that successfully for another $1 \nbillion.\n\n  Now, various reports of the National Academy of Sciences, the most \nrecent of which was released this month, have unfailingly rejected this \nreactor technology for either mission, for the mission of providing \nenergy or for the mission of getting rid of nuclear plutonium. So, Mr. \nPresident, if you look at what the Electric Power Research Institute, \nwhich is a research arm of the electric utility industry, said, they \nreported in 1991 that the HTGR was just not cost competitive. Now, if \nthe private sector refuses to finance the R on a gas-cooled reactor, \nwhy should the taxpayers? It just does not make sense. I mean, this is \none of those projects which we have got to have the courage to say it \ndoes not make sense economically, the science is not good. There are \nother alternative means of dealing with what is being proposed. This is \nthe same argument as the ALMR. It took us 2 years to cut the ALMR. We \ncut it. But it was being proposed as a way of getting rid of nuclear \nunspent fuel.\n  I think that truly, Mr. President, this particular expenditure of \n$900 million since 1970, chasing some kind of legitimate mission using \ntaxpayers' money on an ongoing process, in a year when we are cutting \neducation, we are cutting Medicare, we are cutting all of the other \nprograms that are of such importance, and here we are once again trying \nto protect one of the great chases. Truly this is the kind of program \nthat makes the wool and mohair subsidy look like support for the 101st \nAirborne or for cancer research. It simply does not stand up to \nscrutiny under the National Academy Of Sciences itself, under the \nprivate sector's own judgments. And therefore, the U.S. Senate ought to \nstep up to bat and terminate it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator yield me 1 minute for a question of my \nfriend from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator understand that the $5 million is for \nthe study by the National Research Council? I do not understand how I \ncan be accused of promoting pork when I am giving $5 million to the \ncouncil that you and I support. Why should we not give the money to the \none council that ought to tell us if this process has the potential to \ndestroy over 90 percent of the weapons grade plutonium in this country?\n  Mr. KERRY. My answer is the judgment has already significantly been \nmade by the private sector and by the National Academy of Sciences that \nit is not worth pursuing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is absolutely not true. This process \nhas not been examined. The National Academy wrote to Senator Bradley on \nDecember 10, 1993, stating that they did not examine this GT-MHR \nprocess. That is precisely why we are giving the $5 million so they \nwill examine this process before we consider closing out the program.\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not use any more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes, 7 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Johnston?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 4 minutes, \nthirty seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator want to yield back the balance?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am sorry. I missed that.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes, thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just want to say to my colleagues there \nare three powerful arguments for finally terminating this program which \nhas been around for 30 years. One is the National Academy of Sciences \nthat said there are two eminently better methods of using up plutonium: \nFabricated fuel, and vitrification.\n  Second, this is a much more dangerous project because you have to \nstore plutonium for much longer periods of time, and that subjects it \nto diversion for weapons use.\n  And third, we are headed for a $5.3 billion project, 50 percent of \nwhich Uncle Sugar will have to put up.\n  Now, Mr. President, what do you have to do around here? The \nDepartment of Energy does not want it. The \n\n[[Page S11078]]\nNational Academy of Sciences says it is a terrible idea. And the costs \nare staggering. What do you have to do to convince people to terminate \nsomething around here? The Senator from Alaska read from the committee \nreport. I assume he wrote it. That is committee report language that he \nwrote. It has no technical value. And the Senator from Alaska says he \nwants to put $5 million into this study. After 30 years, \n$1,800,000,000, we are going to study it. And, Mr. President, here is \nwhat the Department of Energy said:\n\n       The Department does not support continued funding of the \n     Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor. There are significant \n     questions about the viability of this reactor type, including \n     whether the fuel will retain fission products to the extent \n     necessary for safety. There is little utility interest in \n     this technology, and we believe that development of this \n     reactor concept would require Federal expenditures in excess \n     of $1 billion [just] over the next decade.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not get into these things lightly, \nparticularly coming from an oil producing State--the most significant \noil producing State in the Union.\n  Now, I am arguing for this review by the National Research Council \nbecause of the report that came to us that this process will destroy \nplutonium. The Senator from Arkansas has repeatedly said that the \nNational Academy has examined this process. That is not true. Again I \npoint out that on December 10, 1993, in a letter to Senator Bradley, \nthe chairman of the NAS committee stated that ``The National Academy \nCommittee did not examine and therefore could not evaluate the gas \nturbine reactor.'' GT-MHR is a new process. And as the report says--and \nit is true that I did have something to do with writing that report--\nthat the information we have is, that when combined with an \naccelerator, this GT-MHR process can destroy 99 percent of plutonium \n239 while producing economically and environmentally sound electirc \npower for the future of the country.\n  Now, I think the Senate should concentrate on what we have done. We \nhave not said go ahead with this process. We have not said fund any \nmore of this process. We have given $5 million to the National Research \nCouncil and said, examine this process and report back to us in 90 \ndays. If you find this process cannot live up to the claims, then go \nahead and shut down the program with the $7.5 million. If you find that \nit can, then report that back to the four committees and we will go \nfurther.\n  Now, I cannot think of anything more simple than the process of \nlooking at what we have done. We have provided $5 million for the \nevaluation of this unique, new process that the National Academy \nCommittee did not examine, and could not evaluate because of the fact \nthat it was not submitted to them. We are now submitting to them the \ngas turbine reactor program known as GT-MHR with a 90-day deadline and \na maximum amount that they can spend for the evaluation of $5 million. \nI think that is the fairest thing we can do for the taxpayers, \nparticularly for those of us who are worried about what to do with \nplutonium.\n  What are we going to do with plutonium, Mr. President? Are we just \ngoing to let it sit out there and worry about how to destroy it? We \ncannot destroy it today. This system burns it. It is possible to burn \n99 percent of it without cost to the taxpayers, and provide cheap \nelectric energy in the process. We are going the spend billions of \ndollars to try to destroy this plutonium. This process could destroy it \nwhile producing normal utility electric power for our consumption. Now \nI think it is a very fine process. I hope it is evaluated and I urge \nthe Senate to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the Senator from Louisiana prepared to yield back \ntime?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of the \ntime.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield back the balance of my time, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to Senators who are coming \ndown now, to vote, could you search your offices and your minds and see \nwhether you have any other amendments? We would like very much to get a \nlist right after this. We know of four amendments. If there are any \nothers, we would like to know about them. We are not seeking time \nagreements yet, just to see how many there are because we would like to \ntell our leaders what this looks like for the remainder of the evening.\n  So if Senators have any amendments that they want to offer, can they \nget us information? Maybe we will accept some of them. It will very \nmuch help us in our endeavor to get through at an early hour. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2055. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 38, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 347 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatfield\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n  So the amendment (No. 2055) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, let me ask again, if \nany Members have amendments that we will vote on, I would like to know \nabout it. I assume the same holds true for Senator Johnston.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  We know we have a Dorgan amendment that is ready to go.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me tell Members what I know, and Senators on our \nside, if you have something to add to this, I would appreciate it.\n  Senator Grams has an amendment with reference to the Appalachia \nRegional Commission. I assume Senator Grams would be ready at some \npoint on that.\n  Senator Wellstone has a water level amendment. We would have to \noppose that. I would like very much for him to be ready soon.\n  Senator Brown's amendment has been solved. Senator Dorgan has a \nsense-of-the-Senate on line-item veto, is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am advised Senator Dorgan says his \nside could take 10 minutes; I suppose our side could take even less \nthan that. I suggest 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have to check that out. We will see \nwhere we are.\n  Are there any other amendments that Senators have that might be \noffered?\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator from New Mexico have my amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is regarding the $65 million for a cancer institute.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, how much time would the Senator from \nArkansas want on that amendment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to accommodate the expedient \ndisposition of this bill. I suggest an hour, and we will try to cut it \nto 30 or 40 minutes. One hour equally divided.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Why do we not cut it to 30 or 40 minutes going into \ndebate?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is not always easy to get the unanimous consent to \nextend the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me suggest that your amendment will be very \ncontroversial, and I think the Senator understands that.\n  Without setting time agreements, I would like to see what the \namendments are. If you have one that has to do with the superconducting \nsuper collider closedown--\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is the only one we have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be in order, and there be second-degree amendments \npermissible on any of them: Senator Grams on Appalachia, Senator \nWellstone on water level, Senator Dorgan on a sense-of-the-Senate on \nline-item veto, and Senator Bumpers on superconducting super collider, \nand that there be no other amendments in order.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator would yield, we have a package of agreed \namendments. If you could make an exception to that, accept those which \nare cleared by managers on both sides.\n  Second-degree amendments were permitted or not permitted?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I cannot follow because I cannot hear.\n  Now, Mr. President, could I propose a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator would yield for a moment, I did have an \namendment that we are trying to work out. At this point, I reserve a \nspot, in case we do not work it out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will try it again.\n  I was going to clear Senator Abraham's amendment.\n  Senator Hutchison would like to inquire, a little more specifically, \nof Senator Bumpers and see if we cannot get an agreement. Could the \nSenator tell the Senator from Texas precisely what his amendment would \ndo?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, briefly, when we terminated the \nsuperconducting super collider, we entered into an agreement with the \nState of Texas, which was obligated at that time to spend close to $1 \nbillion. They had already spent quite a bit of it.\n  I guess you would say there were two parts of the termination \nagreement. One dealt with the employees severance package; the other \nwas with the State of Texas. There was $65 million that the Federal \nGovernment was going to put up to assist Texas in building a cancer \ninstitute on the site where the super collider was being built.\n  Texas has now decided that they will not build the cancer institute \nthere and wants us to give them the $65 million. My amendment would \nrescind the $65 million.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas seek recognition?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand what the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas does. I will oppose the amendment because it was part of the \npackage deal that the Federal Government agreed with the State of Texas \nto do. Although there was a change, we will discuss that during the \namendment.\n  My question is, when is this amendment going to be brought up and \nwhat is the proposed time agreement for the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will defer to the distinguished floor manager on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the Senator from Texas \nand other Senators, I was not looking for a time agreement. I was \nmerely looking to establish a list of primary amendments and see if we \ncould agree on those, and then we will work out time agreements and \nmaybe even work out some of the amendments.\n  It will be sometime this evening. I understand that is not \nnecessarily in the best interests of the Senator from Texas, but we \nhave been asked to complete this bill today.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, just one other point. This would put this \nbill on all fours with the House bill which has already done what my \namendment would do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendments that be in order on this bill are the Grams amendment on \nAppalachia; Wellstone; Dorgan on line-item veto--these amendments are \nsubject to second-degree amendments-- Senator Feingold on TVA; Senator \nHarkin on hydrogen research; and Senator Pressler; I understand we are \nexempting any amendments that could be agreed upon by the two managers; \nand Senator Abraham has an amendment he will offer right quick that we \nare going to accept, so that would be subject to both managers' \nagreement.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We would need a Byrd second-degree amendment to the \nGrams amendment, and a Byrd first-degree relevant amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the Byrd second-degree amendment beyond Grams? \nWhat was the second one?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Second degree to the Grams amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that is all? You did not have another one on Byrd?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And a Byrd first-degree relevant amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK.\n  Let us add to the unanimous-consent request the following: A Byrd \nsecond-degree amendment to the Grams amendment, a Byrd relevant \namendment, and a Burns relevant amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold the \nrequest, I am advised we need to hotline it and we will try to do so \nvery quickly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. I withhold.\n  Let us proceed.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I misspoke myself a while ago and in \nfairness to the Senator from Texas I want to correct it. The amendment \nis what the Congressman from the district where the super collider is \nlocated tried to do in the House, but because of the House rule, was \nnot permitted to offer the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield for a minute, I know that \nwas what was meant and I appreciate his correcting it because I think \nthe Congressman does not understand the agreement. We will debate this \nfully but it is not the House bill and, of course, I am going to try to \nkeep it from being in the Senate bill as well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Abraham, I had agreed to accept the Senator's \namendment and then Senator Mack wanted some time so I will yield to him \nafter the Senator's amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2056\n\n(Purpose: To repeal section 7 of the Magnetic Fusion Energy Engineering \n                                  Act)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment I think \nwill be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator, under the \npresent parliamentary situation it will require the pending amendment \nbe set aside.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside. This is an amendment on behalf of myself as \nwell as Senators Grams and Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] for himself, Mr. \n     Grams and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2056.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\n       On page 41, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 510.

The Senate is still not in order.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in putting together the budget I think \nMembers on all sides worked hard to try to identify various \ndepartments, agencies, commissions, boards, and councils whose \nfunctions were either unnecessary or duplicative of other activities \ngoing on in Government.\n  Working in conjunction with a number of my fellow freshman Members of \nthis body, we have tried using the assumptions made in that budget, \nusing suggestions that have been previously made by the GAO, by the \nCBO, in some cases by the President in the budget submission he made, \nto try to identify numerous agencies of Government which no longer fill \ntheir purpose and which consequently ought to be terminated. The \npurpose of this amendment, and it is the first of several we will be \nbringing during the course of the appropriations debates, is to bring \nto an end to these various no longer necessary Government agencies.\n  The amendment I am offering today will repeal the authorization of \ntwo technical panels who have outlived their usefulness, the Technical \nCommittee on Verification of Fissile Material and Nuclear Warhead \nControls and the Technical Panel on Magnetic Fusion. Neither of these \npanels currently receives funding. Nor do they have the support of \neither Congress or the executive branch. In other words, they are \ndeadwood that should be cleared away as part of the process of \nbalancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, Congress has the opportunity to produce something a \nvast majority of Americans want very deeply, a balanced budget. But to \ndo so means trimming the fat from Government and cutting spending. This \namendment represents a step in that direction. It terminates the \nactivities of two Federal panels whose job is either finished or never \nbegan.\n  More important, it sets the tone I believe we should adopt with all \nof our spending bills. And so, as I said, from time to time during the \nappropriations process, a number of us are going to be working together \nbringing other similar amendments to the floor in the hope we can \nproduce the tangible reduction of numerous activities, agencies, and \nprograms in Government that have outlived their usefulness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Ashcroft as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, did we adopt the amendment?\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2056) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Mack speaks I wonder if I \ncould ask Senator Grams if he would let us follow a routine, now. \nSenator Dorgan has also been waiting on a line-item veto sense-of-the-\nSenate. He would agree to 15 minutes per side. Could we have him go \nnext and then the Senator would follow immediately after that?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That will be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2057\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the conference on S. 4, \n                        the Line Item Veto Act)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2057 at the desk \nwhich I would like to call up. Is there an amendment pending before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Ford, Mr. Robb, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Bradley, and Mr. Wellstone proposes an amendment numbered \n     2057.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONFERENCE ON S. 4, THE \n                   LINE ITEM VETO ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the line item veto was a major plank in the House \n     majority's ``Contract with America'' and has received strong \n     bipartisan support in the 104th Congress;\n       (2) the House of Representatives on February 6, 1995, \n     passed H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act, on a vote of 294-134;\n       (3) the Senate on March 23, 1995, passed S. 4, the Separate \n     Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1995, on a vote of 69-\n     29;\n       (4) the House passed S. 4, with the text of H.R. 2 \n     inserted, by voice vote on May 17, 1995, 50 days after \n     passage by the Senate;\n       (5) notwithstanding the failure of the House to request a \n     conference, the Senate disagreed with the House amendment, \n     requested a conference and appointed conferees on S. 4 on \n     June 20, 1995;\n       (6) the papers for S. 4 have been held at the desk of the \n     Speaker of the House for 42 days and the Speaker of the House \n     has not yet moved to appoint conferees;\n       (7) with the passage of time it increasingly appears that \n     the Congress may pass and send to the President not only the \n     appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 but also the \n     reconciliation bill required by H. Con. Res. 67 (the \n     concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget \n     for fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and \n     2002) without first passing and sending to the President a \n     line item veto bill; and\n       (8) the House majority leadership has publicly cast doubt \n     on the prospects for a conference on S. 4 this year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Speaker of the House should move to appoint \n     conferees on S. 4 immediately, so that the House and Senate \n     may resolve their differences on this important legislation;\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we operating under a time agreement by \nunanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not been formally entered into.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on this \namendment there be 15 minutes on a side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Dorgan will do me a favor. I \nforgot, I left Senator Mack standing. He had been recognized and I \nasked him if he would wait for us and I did not go back to him. He \nwants to speak for 2 minutes and then it will be Mr. Dorgan's turn on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will be happy to do that. It is my \nunderstanding there will not be a second-degree on my amendment, and I \nwill have an up-or-down vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11068-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11080-S11081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PRESIDENT CLINTON'S STATEMENT ON LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, earlier today, in a statement made by \nPresident Clinton, he said he was planning to veto the legislative \nappropriations bill, and I find that, frankly, very disappointing. \nThere have been many press reports suggesting the Clinton White House \nis in a constant campaign mode. His decision to veto the bill is \nclearly the decision of candidate Clinton, not President Clinton. \nCandidate \n\n[[Page S11081]]\nClinton is playing games. He is misleading the American people.\n  This year the Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, cut its own spending \nby nearly 9 percent. A cut of this magnitude has not occurred in 40 \nyears, I might say, the last time the Republicans controlled the \nCongress.\n  The legislative branch bill has not been vetoed since 1920. Let me \noutline a couple of the specifics about what we have done: An overall \nreduction of $206 million; reduction of Senate committee budgets by 15 \npercent; elimination of the Office of Technology Assessment; a 2-year, \n25-percent reduction in the budget of the General Accounting Office.\n  This is part of what the President had to say today:\n\n       [The Congress] is way behind schedule on virtually every \n     budget bill . . . but one bill, wouldn't you know, is right \n     on schedule--the bill that funds the Congress, its staff, and \n     its operations. I don't think Congress should take care of \n     its own business before it takes care of the people's \n     business.\n\n  If you listen to that statement, there is an implication there that \nthey have increased spending in the legislative branch. This is one of \nthe most misleading statements that I have heard.\n  The President likes to talk about common ground and solving the \nfiscal crisis responsibly, but when it comes to spending cuts he is \ntotally absent. We are leading by example. Candidate Clinton is leading \nby rhetoric. It is disappointing and bodes poorly for finding the \ncommon ground he claims to embrace.\n  We hear a lot of talk about a train wreck coming in October. \nPresident Clinton likes to talk about avoiding it. But when it comes \ntime for demonstrating good faith, President Clinton takes a walk and \ncandidate Clinton comes into play. It may make good politics, but \nPresident Clinton is not being served well by candidate Clinton, and \nneither are the American people.\n  The American people elected us to cut spending. We are doing it, and \nBill Clinton is standing in the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11080-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11081-S11099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2057\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I correct that amendment 2057 is now \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment for myself, and \nSenators Kohl, Breaux, Ford, Robb, Bradley, Wellstone, and Harkin.\n  Mr. President, if you will notify me when I have used 3 minutes, I \nwould appreciate that.\n  This is a very simple amendment. Many of us feel that the President--\nany President--ought to have a line-item veto. I voted for the line-\nitem veto when President Bush was in office and when President Reagan \nwas in office, and I have voted for the line-item veto now that \nPresident Clinton is in the office of the Presidency.\n  On February 6, the U.S. House passed a line-item veto bill. The next \nmonth, on March 23, the U.S. Senate passed a line-item veto bill. A \ngreat amount of time has intervened, and there has not even been a \nconference. The House has not even appointed conferees.\n  Many of us feel that a line-item veto is a good policy, that it will \nhelp in reducing the deficit, that it will certainly help in trying to \ntake out, from some of the legislation that moves through the Congress, \nspecial projects that have not previously been authorized or heard or \nsubstantially discussed. Many of us believe that we ought to see a \nline-item veto conference report passed by the House and the Senate and \ngiven to this President before the appropriations bills hit his desk \nand before the reconciliation bill comes to this President.\n  If a line-item veto is good policy--and, indeed, in my judgment it \nis--then it seems to me that the Speaker of the other body ought to \nappoint conferees. Let us have a conference, let us pass the conference \nreport, and let us give this President the line-item veto to be able to \nuse it to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  I do not understand why this is not a matter of high priority for a \nHouse that on February 6 passed a line-item veto bill but now in August \nhas not even been able to find time to appoint conferees. This \namendment is very simple. It explains what I have just said, and it \nsays it is the sense of the Senate that the Speaker of the House should \nmove to appoint conferees on S. 4 immediately--that is, the line-item \nveto bill--so that the House and the Senate may resolve their \ndifferences on this important legislation. I at least believe that the \nline-item veto in the hands of this President--any President--makes \nsense in terms of public policy, and I hope he has the line-item veto \nbefore the appropriations bills and the reconciliation bill come to his \ndesk.\n  That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl, who is a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of this bill, and I believe \nvery strongly that it can be a very useful, in fact, perhaps decisive \ntool in order to avoid the budget impasse and a breakdown of the whole \nprocess, in order for us to avoid having the kind of a ``train wreck'' \nthat will not allow us to pass a budget come this fall.\n  It was in the Contact With America. Not only Democrats but also \nRepublicans are very supportive of the line-item veto. And there is a \nsuspicion that the only reason we are not going to pass it right now is \nbecause we have a Democrat in the White House instead of a Republican. \nThat is not the way to conduct budget policy in this country. That is \nthe way to conduct politics. I think it is the kind of Government that \nthe American people are sick and tired of. They do not want to see a \ncontinuation of it. They are supportive in overwhelming numbers of the \nline-item veto. It is something that we can do. It is something that \nwill contribute to an effective budget come this fall.\n  I think we are all winners. There are no losers if we pass the line-\nitem veto.\n  So I support this amendment by the Senator from North Dakota. I think \nthat we, as a body, should encourage the House to appoint their \nconferees so that we can resolve the minor differences between the \nHouse and the Senate on the line-item veto and get on with the \nimportant work in behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am an original sponsor of the pending \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, and it states simply that the House of \nRepresentatives should move to appoint conferees on S. 4, the line-item \nveto bill, and that we should not send appropriations bills to the \nPresident until we pass line-item veto legislation.\n  It may seem odd to see two Democratic Senators calling for action on \nthe line-item veto, one of the most popular plans in the Contract With \nAmerica. But as long time supporters of the line-item veto, we are \nunhappy that such an important tool for budget discipline has \napparently been lost in the bog of balanced budget politics.\n  We ought to move the line-item veto legislation because it is a tool \nthat can trim the fat of Government and highlight the spending choices \nthat must be made if we are going to balance the budget. We ought to \nmove the line-item veto legislation now because it is a tool that could \nsave us from the budget impasse that we may be facing.\n  Many now speculate about the coming budget train wreck. The President \nhas already threatened to veto six of the appropriations bills passed \nby the House. Veto override vote counts are taking place on a tax bill \nthat hasn't even been drafted. And White House Chief of Staff Panetta \nis drawing up plans for the anticipated shut down of the Government at \nthe beginning of the fiscal year.\n  It does not have to happen this way, and it should not happen this \nway.\n  The 104th Congress could be remembered as the Congress where balanced \nbudget changed from a slogan to the status quo. The House passed a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment; the Senate is one vote away \nfrom doing so.\n  The Republican majority passed a Budget Resolution that balances the \nbudget. The Democrats proposed an alternative that does the same, and a \nvast majority of our party voted for it. The President has his own \nbalanced \n\n[[Page S11082]]\nbudget plan on the table. No longer is the debate over whether we \nshould balance the budget--we are now talking about how we will balance \nthe budget.\n  This remarkable change in business-as-usual could all be lost if the \ndebate shifts away from budget priorities and toward budget politics. \nPassing the line-item veto is one way to stop that from happening.\n  If the President has the line-item veto, he does not have to shut \ndown whole agencies because he disagrees with one or two riders in the \nbills that fund those agencies. He can line-item veto out the pork or \nthe politics and send just those items back to Congress for further \ndebate. No unnecessary show down--just a straightforward debate on \nspending priorities.\n  Similarly, if the President has the line-item veto, he doesn't have \nto veto an entire tax bill because he objects to specific items. He can \nline-item veto his objections, send them back to Congress for another \nvote, and again force a clear national debate on spending priorities.\n  Balancing the budget means hard choices about where taxpayer dollars \nshould go and should not go. It is debate about what we are as a nation \nand what we will become. It is a serious debate--not one that ought to \ndisintegrate into a chaotic Government shut down. Giving the President \nline-item veto will focus the debate on priorities and away from \npolitical points.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and send a strong \nmessage to the House: Pass the line-item veto that was in the Contract \nWith America. Pass the line-item veto that passed the House and the \nSenate. Don't let budget politics keep us from doing what most of us \nbelieve is good budget policy. Give the President the line-item veto.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for bringing this amendment to the floor.\n  There is no doubt that many people are surprised that, after \ndescribing the line-item veto along with a balanced budget amendment as \nthe crown jewels of the Contract With America, we still have not had a \nsingle conference on the bill, the line-item veto.\n  The House passed it, I believe, in January and the Senate in \nFebruary. Recently, there have been indications that the House would \nappoint conferees after their recess begins, which, of course, would \npreclude any mention of a full conference until after the August \nrecess. And there has been no meeting of the conferees that have been \nappointed on the line-item veto.\n  I think maybe for a change we ought to talk about reality here, Mr. \nPresident; that is, there are significant forces afoot who do not want \nthe line-item veto sent to the President's desk until after the 13 \nappropriations bills are dispensed with. I do not agree with that.\n  For 8 years that I have come to the floor of this body in support of \nthe line-item veto, I said that I would support the line-item veto \nwhether it was a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. I think \nit is wrong of us to delay. But I am afraid it is going to be delayed, \nand I believe that it is wrong of us to do so.\n  Senator Coats and I were often accused--and we brought this bill up \ntime after time--of saying, well, you would support this bill only if \nthere was a Republican in the White House. We steadfastly maintained \nthat was not the case. I still maintain that is not the case. I urge my \ncolleagues to make every effort they can to see that conferees are \nappointed.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out one other aspect of this issue; \nthat is, that it has been said that there are significant differences \nbetween the Senate-passed and the House-passed bill. Yes, that is true, \nbut it is mainly in the vehicle. The fundamental aspect of the line-\nitem veto that takes a two-thirds vote to override a Presidential veto \nis there.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that Senator Coats and I would be \nmore than willing to accommodate the House in practically whatever \ndesires they may have, especially since the House version more closely \nresembles our original proposal than that which finally emerged from \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, speaking as a Member of this body from this side of \nthe aisle who for 12 years has been involved in this issue, I think we \nare doing a great disservice to the American people in the things we \npromised them last November--we Republicans promised them last \nNovember--by delaying final passage of this very, very significant \nchange in the way that the Government in Washington does business. It \nis supported by 73 percent of the American people.\n  Therefore, I am grateful that the Senator from North Dakota has \nbrought this bill up. I want to assure him that I and the Senator from \nIndiana and others will continue to do everything in our power to see \nthat this bill is moved along. Very frankly, if someone accuses us of \ndragging our feet on this issue, there is some legitimacy to that \naccusation, and I regret very much to have to admit that on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I congratulate the \nSenator for bringing this to our attention, not only to the Members of \nthis body but hopefully to the Members of the other body, as well as to \nthe attention of the American public.\n  Do any of us remember the big public display and the big publicity \ngathering they had on the steps of the Capitol when the Contract With \nAmerica was announced? There was a huge public display, and it made all \nthe evening news.\n  One of the key plans in that Contract With America was action to be \ntaken on the line-item veto. What happened to it? Where is it? Where \nare the conferees from the other body who were willing to sit down and \nfinish this incredibly important part of the contract?\n  Nineteen Democrats over here voted for it, and Republican colleagues \nhere supported it. The Senate appointed the conferees. We found 18 \nwilling souls to sit down with the other body and work out the \ndifferences. Cannot the House find 18 Members who are willing to sit \nwith the Senate, Republican and Democrats, and work out the differences \nbetween the House- and Senate-passed bills?\n  Sometimes what people do in this business, they give a great \npolitical speech and then they sort of forget and hope everybody else \nforgets what they said because this is, in effect, what is happening. \nThey make this great political announcement and pronouncement on the \nsteps of the Capitol that the line-item veto was absolutely essential \nto Western civilization, and then the House passes it and the Senate \npasses it and the House will not appoint the conferees.\n  We can send them 18 names and say, ``Here, pick one of these or pick \nanybody you want to pick. Just pick somebody to sit down and meet with \nthe Senate.''\n  If this was so important and it justified being put in their Contract \nWith America, is it not still important in August to find 18 House \nMembers who can sit down with the Senate and talk with us? Is it that \ndifficult to do? Or is maybe there is another reason? Maybe the reason \nis that all these appropriations bills are now working their way \nthrough the House and the Senate.\n  I have heard some of them say, ``Well, we may do this after we finish \nwith the appropriations bills and they have already been signed.''\n  That is after the fact. The whole purpose of a line-item veto is to \nsay that some items in an appropriations bill should not become the law \nof the land. And they are saying, ``Well, we want to do the \nappropriations bills first and then maybe sometime next year we will \nappoint the conferees.''\n  The time is now. The American people do remember what politicians say \non the steps of the Capitol, and I suggest that our House conferees \nshould be appointed. We can send them a list and they can pick. We can \nsend them 435 names and just pick 18. It is not that \n\n[[Page S11083]]\ndifficult. Start with A and just go right down the list. When we get \n18, stop, send us the names, we have a meeting, and we can work this \nout. If it is important enough to put in the contract, it is important \nenough to at least finish the job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INHOFE). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I wish to join in the commendation of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and support that he has received in bringing forth this \nresolution. I wish to thank him as well as the Senator from Wisconsin \nfor their support when the issue was before the Senate.\n  This obviously is an effort which involves the Members from both \nsides of the aisle because it deals with a very fundamental, important \nprinciple, and it is a principle underlying the way in which decisions \nare made that affect the way in which taxpayers' dollars are spent.\n  We had what many would consider a historic debate on this issue. This \neffort to provide the President with line-item veto power had been \ntried numerous times dating well into the last century, always failing \nto gain a majority of support in necessary votes in both Houses of the \nCongress to send to the President for his signature.\n  We accomplished that goal this year, and it was a historic vote. We \nfundamentally altered the balance of power between the legislative \nbranch and the executive branch in terms of how dollars are spent. The \nCongress had forfeited the power that it held, gave it to the executive \nbranch. In doing so, it made the statement and the commitment to the \nAmerican people that business as usual, that is, attaching unrelated, \nunnecessary spending items to otherwise necessary appropriations bills, \nwas going to end, or at least we would provide a vehicle to end that \npractice. We would shed light on that practice. And Members would have \nto come to the floor and defend the particular item, so-called pork \nbarrel item, that was attached to a particular appropriations bill.\n  Therefore, what I think the voters have asked of us, that is, that \nour yea be yea and our nay be nay on the specific item in question be \ncast as a vote in this Chamber, so that we no longer would hide \nspending from the direct public scrutiny and from the accountability \nthat ought to fall to each of us in terms of where we stood on a \nparticular spending item involving their tax dollars.\n  So we passed that historic legislation but in two very different \nforms. The form that the Senate used was a very different form than \nwhat the House used. In fact, the House used a form that Senator McCain \nand I originally had used on a number of occasions. We have led this \neffort over the last several years, coming ever closer to a majority \nand finally had the breakthrough this year, for which we were grateful. \nBut in doing so, we adopted what many would say is a somewhat \nconvoluted vehicle to deliver the substance of line-item veto.\n  Reconciling the two differences between the House and the Senate, \nwhile it appears on its face to be a very complicated matter, really is \nnot that complicated, because the underlying substance of the \nlegislation is the same. It is simply the vehicle which delivers that \nsubstance that is different. Senator McCain and I have said repeatedly \nthat we are willing to negotiate that substance and sit down with our \ncolleagues from the House of Representatives and work out an acceptable \nvehicle to accomplish that very end.\n  Now, the House has not yet appointed conferees. The Senate has. \nSenator McCain and I have urged the leadership in both the Senate and \nin the House to accomplish this fact. Discussions have been held with \nthe leadership, and I know that the majority leader is committed to \nmoving forward. I know that has been communicated to the House.\n  Obviously, this is an extraordinary year. Our plates are full as they \nnever have been before. We are dealing with an extraordinary level and \ndegree of complex legislative changes. We are redefining the role of \nGovernment. We are redefining how we spend the taxpayers' dollars, and \nso there is a great deal before us. That has, unfortunately, delayed \nthe process of getting some of these conferences together to resolve \nsome of this legislation that has passed both Houses of the Congress. \nBut we do, I believe, have a commitment from both Houses now to move \nforward with this legislation, to appoint conferees, to meet as soon as \nis possible and bring back to both bodies the line-item veto in a form \nthat is acceptable and that can be given to the President for his \nsignature, which I believe he has indicated he would sign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Let me say, Mr. President, if I could ask unanimous \nconsent for 30 seconds, there is no objection to acceptance of the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that has been offered by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. If he is willing to accept that, we do not feel it \nis necessary to have a vote. Obviously, that is the decision the \nSenator has to make, but it is perfectly acceptable to our side. It is \na good resolution, and I am proud to support it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend from North Dakota. Let me compliment him, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Coats, Senator Breaux, and Senator McCain for the \neffort that is being put forth this evening.\n  I wish to associate myself with the comments that have been made by \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As I voted for line-item veto \nwhen it passed the Senate, I believe in March, I said I did not like \nthe procedure, and I think my friend from Indiana agreed with that.\n  The underlying legislation is there. We just need to refine the \nprocedure. And I think it will get there. This is good policy. I used \nit as Governor of Kentucky, as other Governors have used it. It works. \nYou just line the item, send it to the legislature with a message, and \nthey either approve it or disapprove it. It is good policy. It ought to \ncome sooner than later.\n  So it is ironic to me that after we have been pounded, if I can use \nthat word, by those on the other side for years now to pass line-item \nveto, now that we have an opportunity and we have joined together in a \nbipartisan fashion, we cannot get it done. We cannot arrive at the \nconference for purely political reasons. They do not want to give this \nPresident an opportunity to have the line-item veto as appropriations \nbills come, as the reconciliation bill comes. Now that we are on the \nverge of passing this into law, the Speaker says I do not have time to \ndo it. But as we have heard, he can write two books. He can go out on \nthe trail and sell his books. But he does not have time to sit down and \npick a handful of friends to get on a conference committee and let us \nwork it out. I think the Speaker should listen to his colleagues on the \nSenate side of the same party that are sending the same message.\n  We need to get this done. But, Mr. President, as we try this \nbipartisan effort, when we talk about everything being bipartisan, we \nrun into a bump. Mr. President, I believe we have finally found who \nruns the political agenda on Capitol Hill. And that is the Speaker of \nthe House. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for offering this amendment. I \njoin with others that have already spoken on this particular amendment \nin support. I particularly want to commend our Republican colleagues, \nbecause this is a situation where it might be in their interest to take \na little different course of action.\n  During the time when we had a Republican President and a Democratic \nmajority in the Congress, I took the same position that I do now. I \nsometimes kidded colleagues on this side of the aisle suggesting that \nif we were to give this particular request to the then-Republican \nPresident of the United States, it might not be a gift that was enjoyed \nto the extent that remarks might have suggested it would be. \n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\n  In this particular case, it puts the burden directly on the President \nto make some of the very difficult decisions that Members of the \nlegislature frequently want to find a way not to have to make. So I \nstrongly encourage colleagues to vote in support of this. And I \nencourage those in the other body to encourage the Speaker to make \nthose appointments so we can get on with the business. It does not make \nsense to suggest that it is an amendment that only makes sense if you \nhave a certain majority and a certain party in the Presidency. And I \nhope that very shortly the Speaker will find time to make these \nappointments.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the status of the time on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 minutes 19 \nseconds. And the other side has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to use only another minute or so. \nIf the Senator from New Mexico wishes to comment, I would be happy to \nhave him comment. I will ask for 1 minute and then a recorded vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me then use 1 minute and then yield back our time and \nask for a recorded vote at the end.\n  I would like to say that I offer this amendment because I think there \nare some who have said very strongly that they favor a line-item veto, \nbut they have become lost in the wilderness somehow on this issue. \nThere is an old saying, ``There's no prevailing wind that favors a ship \nthat does not know where it is going.'' So we would like to help those \nwho we think are lost in the wilderness get found today. We would like \nto provide a prevailing wind to help them move toward a line-item veto \nconference, bring the line-item veto back to the House and the Senate, \nand then send the President the line-item veto--this President, and \nevery President, Republican or Democrat.\n  I say to my friends, Senator Coats and Senator McCain, no one, in my \njudgment, will, with good cause, ever suggest that they have stalled on \nthis issue. They have been consistent for years on this issue, as have \nI and others, who for years have voted for the line-item veto, no \nmatter who is in the White House, because we think it will measurably \nhelp deal with some of the problems that exist in appropriations bills \nand authorization bills and fiscal policy. And we just think it is the \nright thing to do.\n  So I very much appreciate the comments that have been made today by \nSenator McCain and Senator Coats, and especially by Senators Kohl, \nBreaux, Robb, and Ford on our side of the aisle. And with that, I hope \nthe Senate will register a strong expression today that we would like \nto see those who are stalling to stop stalling, stop dragging their \nfeet, help us get a line-item veto passed; appoint conferees, have a \nconference and give this President the line-item veto. In my judgment, \nit is good for the country.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a recorded vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reclaim 30 seconds of my time.\n  Mr. President, I did not participate in the debate. It was a good and \ninteresting discussion. But I think that there might be other reasons \nthat the House has for not having appointed conferees. I understand \nthey have some rules that are difficult in terms of how long they can \nbe in conference before certain other rules take effect. And, frankly, \nI have no understanding that they are peculiarly delaying this because \nthey did not want the line-item veto.\n  Nonetheless, this ought to serve as a useful tool in reminding \neveryone to get on with the bill that is highly touted and was debated \nhere in the Senate in a very adequate and thorough manner.\n  I yield back any of my 30 seconds.\n  I join in asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been properly seconded.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that I be permitted, at the request of the \nmajority leader, to seek the following unanimous consent, which I \nunderstand is satisfactory with the other side. And then we will \nproceed to vote.\n  Could I do that, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nH.R. 1905; that they be limited to relevant second-degree amendments \nand the excepted committee amendment be agreed to and considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendments. I will state the \namendments: Senator Byrd, relevant; Harkin, hydroresearch; Grams, \nAppalachia Regional Commission; Feingold, TVA; Wellstone, water level \nand reservoir; Pressler, water authorization; Brown, salary cuts--I \nbelieve that is resolved. We will strike salary cuts. Bumpers, SCSC \nclose down; Dorgan--we just did that. And the managers' amendment, \nwhich we will do jointly. In addition, Senator Burns, Flat Head Indians \nirrigation; Hatfield, relevant; Specter, an amendment regarding a \nmedical center.\n  That is the extent of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is one penciled in I did not see. \nSenator Boxer from California, Corps of Engineers offices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota, amendment No. 2057.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER (when her name was called). Present.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (Later the following occurred:)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2057\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I voted against the amendment today by Mr. \n\n[[Page S11085]]\n  Dorgan and other Senators which expresses the sense of the Senate as \nbeing that the Speaker of the House should move to appoint conferees on \nS. 4 immediately so that the House and Senate may resolve their \ndifferences on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I voted against this amendment for a number of \nreasons, one of which is, I think we ought to do everything we can to \nimprove the comity between the two Houses rather than taking actions \nthat will undermine that comity. I say this without casting any \nreflection on any of the Senators who cosponsored or voted for the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment today dealing with the conference on the \nline-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Senate now going on 37 years and I \nwas in the House 6 years prior to that. In these nearly 43 years, I \nhave seldom seen one body taking action to tell the other body how it \nshould conduct its business. I do not think this is good. I feel that \nmost Senators would certainly not like to see the House pass amendments \nor resolutions that called upon the Senate to take certain actions.\n  Both Houses in which I have served have been very careful over the \nyears to observe the responsibilities, the duties, the prerogatives, \neach of the other. Each House has been conscious of that.\n  I have been disturbed in recent times that Senators, on this floor, \nhave called the names of House Members from time to time and in some \ncases were critical of what House Members had done or how they had \nvoted.\n  Mr. President, I do know that in the last Congress the Speaker of the \nHouse, at least the leadership, called to the attention of a Member or \nMembers of that body the rules against referring to Members of the \nSenate by name.\n  And so for a number of reasons I voted against the amendment. I did \nnot speak against it, but I told the chief sponsor that I would vote \nagainst it and told him why.\n  I feel I should state for the Record, now that the vote has occurred, \nmy opposition to the amendment. As I say, I do not believe that the \nSenate should involve itself in the internal matters relating to the \nother body. It is my opinion that the House is perfectly capable of \ndetermining what it wishes to do and when it wishes to do it in \nrelation to the appointment of conferees on the line-item veto bill or \nany other bill. Even had I supported the amendment, I would have had \nreservations about addressing the business of the other body. I think \nwe should restrain ourselves from doing such things.\n  Another reason why I opposed the amendment was because I did not \nagree with paragraph (b)(2) which, as I understood it, read that the \nCongress should pass the conference report.\n  Now, that paragraph may have been stricken from the amendment.\n  I understand that paragraph was stricken from the amendment.\n  The reconciliation bill will be the vehicle used by the Republican \nmajority to include massive tax cuts. There were those who said we \nought to give the President this line-item veto; there were others who \nsaid that the reasons they did not want to give the President a line-\nitem veto now, was because we have President Clinton--a Democrat--in \nthe White House, and they did not want him to veto line items in the \nreconciliation bill.\n  I have said all along it does not make any difference as to what \nparty has a person holding the office of President of the United \nStates, he should not be given a line-item veto. We ought to be on \nguard, always protecting the constitutional responsibilities and \nfunctions and prerogatives of this, the legislative branch.\n  Apparently some of our friends on the other side of the aisle have \nnow seen fit to delay acting on the conference report because they are \nconcerned that President Clinton might utilize the veto power to line \nitem certain matters out of the appropriations bills.\n  On our side of the aisle, there are those who say we should send it \nto him now, not hold back, because he is a Democratic President at a \ntime when the Republicans are in control of the House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, I might have a little sympathy for that approach if it \nwere not for the fact that the President on May 8 of this year wrote a \nletter to the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, in which \nthe President wrote as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I am writing to urge that Congress \n     quickly complete work on line-item veto legislation so I can \n     use it--this year--to curb wasteful tax and spending \n     provisions.\n       We must not let another year go by without the President \n     having authority to eliminate special interest provisions, \n     such as the tax benefits that were targeted to individual \n     businesses earlier this year in H.R. 831.\n       I am disappointed that six weeks after the Senate passed \n     its version of line-item veto legislation, neither body has \n     appointed conferees. As you may recall, I commended the House \n     and the Senate last month for passing line-item veto \n     legislation. However, the job is not complete until a bill is \n     sent to my desk that provides strong line-item veto authority \n     that can be used this year.\n       I have consistently urged the Congress to pass the \n     strongest possible line-item veto. While both the House and \n     Senate versions would provide authority to eliminate wasteful \n     spending and tax provisions, the House-passed bill is much \n     stronger--and more workable.\n       I appreciate your making passage of line-item veto \n     legislation a priority. I look forward to working with the \n     Congress to enact the line-item veto quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Just a few days later, on June 7, 1995, the President wrote another \nletter to the Honorable Robert Dole, majority leader of the Senate, in \nwhich the President stated:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am deeply alarmed by today's press \n     report that some Republicans in the House and Senate want to \n     continue to hold back the line-item veto so that I don't have \n     it during this year's budget process. The line-item veto is a \n     vital tool to cut pork from the budget. If this Congress is \n     serious about deficit reduction, it must pass the strongest \n     possible line-item veto immediately, and send it to my desk \n     so I can sign it right away.\n       This is not a partisan issue. Presidents Reagan and Bush \n     asked Congress for it time and again, and so have I. It was \n     part of the Republican Contract with America. It has strong \n     support from members of Congress in both parties and both \n     houses. No matter what party the President belongs to or what \n     party has a majority in Congress, the line-item veto would be \n     good for America.\n       If Congress will send me the line-item veto immediately, I \n     am willing to pledge that this year, I will use it only to \n     cut spending, not on tax expenditures in this year's budget. \n     I have already put you on notice that I will veto any budget \n     that is loaded with excessive tax breaks for the wealthy. But \n     I need the line-item veto now to hold the line against pork \n     in every bill the Congress sends me.\n       The American people have waited long enough. Congress \n     should give them and the Presidency the line-item veto \n     without further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  So what we have is a letter from the President to the Speaker of the \nHouse on May 8 saying, in essence, ``Give me the line-item veto.''\n  Now, again I quote from that letter:\n\n       We must not let another year go by without the President \n     having authority to eliminate special interest provisions, \n     such as the tax benefits that were targeted to individual \n     businesses earlier this year in H.R. 831.\n\n  And then lo and behold, 1 month later, lacking 1 day, the same \nPresident pledges--pledges--to the majority leader of the Senate that \nif Congress will send the President that line-item veto legislation, \nthe President will not--will not--use it on tax expenditures; he will \nonly use it ``to cut spending.''\n  Mr. President, I have difficulty following that line of reasoning. It \nis obvious that the President intended to use the line-item veto \nauthority to eliminate tax expenditures in the first letter. I was \ndismayed by the sudden reversal by the President in his June 7 letter. \nThat was a 180-degree turn by the White House on matters which are of \nthe utmost importance to the American people in terms of fairness \nrelating to how the deficit will be reduced. And it should leave all \nthinking Members of Congress and the American people wondering why this \nadministration would make such an outrageous pledge.\n  Why should we Democrats butt our heads against the wall urging that \nthe Speaker appoint conferees on a measure so that the President would \nhave the line-item veto authority, which the President has pledged not \nto use against tax expenditures? Since the President pledged to avoid \nlining out any new tax expenditures, that meant that any new goodies in \nthe form of tax writeoffs would be in place from now on, further \nexacerbating our deficit problem for years to come. \n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\n  So, this unwise pledge by the President is just one reason why this \nSenator is not in any hurry to see a line-item veto enacted this year. \nThe President says he will use the authority only on appropriations \nbills, not on tax expenditures. In other words, he will continue to cut \ndomestic discretionary programs--not defense. He is, to the contrary, \nrecommending that military spending go up. Apparently, he is going to \ncut nondefense discretionary programs, which are already being severely \ncut.\n  I note also that, in a statement made this morning in the briefing \nroom at the White House, the President says:\n\n       One of the most interesting things that has achieved not \n     too much notice in the last few days is that while Congress \n     has been taking care of the special interests, it's also \n     taking care of itself. It is way behind schedule on virtually \n     every budget bill, in the hope, apparently, of enforcing a \n     choice at the end of this fiscal year between shutting the \n     government down and adopting extreme budget cuts which will \n     be bad for our country, bad for our economy, and bad for our \n     future.\n\n  This may, indeed, confuse a lot of people. First the President says, \n``Give me a line-item veto with which I can cut.'' Then he says today \nthat Congress is making cuts that are bad for our country:\n\n       Apparently, they don't even plan on letting the American \n     people see their planned Medicare cuts until the last \n     possible minute. But one bill, wouldn't you know it, is right \n     on schedule--the bill that funds the Congress, its staff, and \n     its operations.\n       I don't think Congress should take care of its own business \n     before it takes care of the people's business. If the \n     congressional leadership follows through on its plan to send \n     me its own funding bill before it finishes work on the rest \n     of the budget, I will be compelled to veto it.\n\n  Mr. President, if I were in the leadership today I would say, ``Let \nus send it to him. Let him veto it. He can veto it; he can let it \nbecome law without his signature; or he can sign it.''\n  The reference is made to Congress ``taking care of its own \nbusiness.'' Mr. President, the Constitution, in article I, creates the \nlegislative branch. And in the very first sentence of article I it \nprovides for the making of laws and vests all power to make laws in the \nCongress. In article I, section 9, it vests the appropriations power in \nthe Congress. The Constitution created the legislative branch. We have \nto pass laws to appropriate moneys for the legislative branch. I do not \nsee that as ``taking care of its own business.'' The legislative branch \nhas to operate.\n  So I hope that the President will sign the legislative appropriation \nbill if it goes to him first. There is no design here on the part of \nthe Members or on the part of the leadership to send to the President \nthe legislative appropriations bill first. There was no design. That is \nnot by calculation or by intention. We have been marking other \nappropriations bills up in the Appropriations Committee. Another \nappropriations bill has been before the Senate today, the energy-water \nappropriations bill, and we hope to pass it today. So there are other \nappropriations bills that are being acted upon.\n But now we hear the threat that if the legislative appropriations bill \nis the first to be sent down to the White House, the President will be \ninclined to veto it, because those people up there take care of \nthemselves first.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note there is another thing the President said in \nthat letter that does not seem to me to be consistent with the way \nbusiness is done and has been done for a long time and done properly.\n  He says the appropriations bills are way behind schedule; all budget \nbills are behind schedule. It is my understanding we do not have to get \nthe appropriations bills passed until October 1. We started in August, \ndid we not? That is 2 months. I have been around here a while, not as \nlong as the Senator from West Virginia has, but the House has done a \npretty good job. They are through with all but two, and we have not yet \nreached August. They finished all but two before August arrived. I have \nbeen here many years, and we do not get all the appropriations done \nuntil 16, 17, 18 September. That is not unusual.\n  So I think the President is making a false argument even there about \nus being far behind.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, in many instances in past years, appropriations bills \nhave not been passed until or after the beginning of the next fiscal \nyear.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the Congress is doing very well. The beginning of \nthe next fiscal year is October 1, as the Senator has pointed out. We \nare well ahead of that. We have plenty of time before the beginning of \nthe fiscal year. I hope we will pass all appropriations bills and have \nthem on the President's desk by or before the beginning of the fiscal \nyear. But I also hope that if the President is going to veto \nappropriations bills, he will do so on the basis of the merits, not on \nthe basis of some grand strategy to veto appropriations bills for \npolitical purposes.\n  As one member of the Appropriations Committee, I take a bit of \numbrage at this statement that the legislative appropriations bill is \nbeing passed first because Congress is ``taking care of itself.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He did not mention, did he, that we also significantly \nreduced the cost of the legislative branch of Government in that bill?\n  Mr. BYRD. It has been significantly reduced, I believe.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten percent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not belabor the point any longer. I \nthink it is unwise to adopt amendments such as the Senate adopted today \ninstructing or urging the Speaker of the House to appoint his \nconferees, and so on. As I said, it does not make for good will, good \nfeeling, or good comity between the two bodies.\n  I would not have voted for the amendment if for no other reason than \nthat reason. I hope that we will slow down a little bit and not adopt \nsuch resolutions, or else we will meet such resolutions coming back \nfrom the other body, and they will not be entirely to our liking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Conclusion of later proceedings.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the Dorgan amendment stating the sense-\nof-the-Senate that the House should appoint conferees on the line-item \nveto bill and a conference should occur, I voted ``present.''\n  Although I have always opposed the line-item veto, because I believe \nit is an unwarranted transfer of power from the legislative branch to \nthe executive branch, I do agree with Senator Dorgan that the \nRepublican Congress should not refuse to conference the bill simply to \nembarrass the current President, who happens to be a Democrat.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my good friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain, and my friend from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold, we intend to offer a bipartisan amendment to the energy and \nwater appropriations bill, which would reduce funding for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, ARC, by $40 million.\n  First, I will explain some of our reasons for offering this \namendment.\n  In his inaugural address 35 years ago, President Kennedy challenged \nthe American people to ``ask not what your country can do for you, ask \nwhat you can do for your country.'' Just five years later, however, \nthose words seemed to have been forgotten with the establishment in \nCongress of the ARC, the ultimate expression of ``what can I get out of \nmy government?\"\n  The goal of Congress in creating the ARC was to bolster economic \ndevelopment in a 195,000 square-mile region which presently encompasses \n13 States. Over the course of the past 30 years, we have spent more \nthan $7 billion in the Appalachian region, much of it for pork-barrel \nprojects, trying to stimulate economic growth there.\n  Today, many of the ARC's programs duplicate activities funded by \nother Federal agencies. In fact, Appalachian corridor construction, \nunder which the Senate energy and water appropriations bill justifies \nthe $40 million increase in funding from the House, also falls under \nthe jurisdiction of the Transportation Department's Federal highway \nprogram.\n  Representative Scott Klug of Wisconsin put it this way:\n\n       What the Appalachian Regional Commission does is \n     essentially allow 13 states in this country to double dip \n     into infrastructure money, money to do economic development, \n     and money also to do highway and water construction and \n     projects like that.\n\n  Now, clearly, Mr. President, the Appalachian Regional Commission has \nbecome a vehicle to justify continued \n\n[[Page S11087]]\npork-barrel spending which duplicates the efforts of many other Federal \nprograms. That is hardly what President Kennedy had in mind 35 years \nago.\n  While the ARC allocates funds for the poor, rural communities of \nAppalachia, these areas are no worse off than rural communities in \nMinnesota, Arizona, or the 35 other States that do not benefit from the \nARC. In fact, in my home State of Minnesota, 12.8 percent of my \nconstituents live below the poverty level.\n  That is a troubling statistic for a state which considers itself not \na poor State, but a proud State. It is higher than many states which \nbenefit from ARC funding--such as Virginia at 9.4 percent, Maryland at \n11.6 percent, Pennsylvania at 11.7 percent, and Ohio at 12.6 percent.\n  Do Minnesotans have a Federal program designed just for them? Of \ncourse not. To pay for something like the ARC on a nationwide basis \nwould require billions of dollars, either from cutting more from other \nprograms, borrowing money from our children, increasing the deficit, or \nraising taxes. The first option is unlikely--the remaining three are \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  Already, for every dollar the taxpayers of my State contribute to the \nFederal Treasury, they receive only 82 centsworth of government \nservices. That is 82 cents on the dollar. The States which receive ARC \nfunding receive, on average, $1.21 for every tax dollar they \ncontribute.\n  Now, Minnesota has been a good neighbor and has contributed more than \nits fair share.\n  But when Minnesotans see $750,000 of ARC funds spent on a summer \npractice stadium for the National Football League's Carolina Panthers, \nthis is a slap in the face. Clearly, the ARC's priorities do not \nreflect the priorities of the taxpayers.\n  While there have been some improvements in the Appalachian region, \nthese have generally followed the health of the economy in general. In \nthe 1980's, there was strong growth in the area which mirrored the \neconomic growth of the country at large.\n  During this time, ARC funding was reduced by 40 percent, roughly the \nlevel appropriated by the House bill this year. Did the region suffer? \nOn the contrary. Taxes were cut and unemployment rates in the region \nfell by 38 percent.\n  That is how President Kennedy created jobs in the 1960's. That is how \nPresident Reagan created jobs in the 1980's. That is how we need to \ncreate jobs as we approach the year 2000.\n  The ARC is a classic example of how pork barrel projects are dished \nout in Washington. If ARC programs only benefitted two or three States, \nthe Commission probably would not have lasted as long as it has. But \nwhen you cobble together several hundred counties, in 13 different \nStates, with 26 Senators representing them, you have a built-in \npolitical constituency that will make sure funding is perpetuated \nforever and ever.\n  Mr. President, the ARC is a relic, a thing of the past. We need to \nlook toward the future, toward a balanced budget, tax cuts, and job \ncreation. These benefits would far outweigh the additional $40 million \nin taxpayers' money the Senate wants to appropriate.\n  Earlier this year, Congress agreed to phase out the ARC in the \nbalanced budget resolution which passed both chambers. Our amendment \ndoes not zero out funding for the ARC this year--it simply reduces the \nlevel of funding to that approved by the House, $142 million. That \nmeans $40 million that goes back to the taxpayers, either in the form \nof deficit reduction or tax cuts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Grams-McCain amendment and \nsupport us in this effort to cut government waste. Show the taxpayers \nthat we will keep our word and make the tough choices necessary to \nbalance the Federal budget and bring economic growth and prosperity to \nevery region across this Nation.\n  President Kennedy was right--Ask not what your country can do for \nyou. Ask what you can do for your country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that two of the poorest counties in \nthe nation are located on Indian reservations in South Dakota--Rosebud \nSioux and the Pine Ridge Sioux?\n  Mr. GRAMS. No, I did not know that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that South Dakota is not part of \nAppalachia or countless other areas of poverty on Indian reservations \nin urban areas and rural communities?\n  I wonder if my colleague is aware that as part of the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, $750,000 was spent for the Carolina Panthers \nfootball facility, money was spent for the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, \nmoney was spent for a program to attract German travelers to West \nVirginia,\n money for an access road to a Pennsylvania ski resort, money for a \nlimestone cave display in Georgia, $1.2 million for the National Track \nand Field Hall of Fame, money for the NASCAR Hall of Fame, funding for \na study on the migration of the elderly, funding for a grant to train \nworkers for a BMW plant in South Carolina.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota is aware of all of those uses \nthat the Appalachian Regional Commission has spent money on, and how \nfar the Appalachian Regional Commission--which, by the way, was a \ntemporary commission when it was set up in 1965--has gone. And is the \nSenator aware that the Federal Government has countless programs that \nprovide economic development assistance for everyone in America: \ncommunity development block grant programs, housing development block \ngrants, social service block grants, community service block grants, \nEconomic Development Agency grants, farmers home loans, small business \ndevelopment loans and grants, rural electrification loans, highway aid, \nand the list goes on and on.\n  In addition, as we know, the individual States have many similar \nprograms. The rest of the Nation that is outside of the Appalachia \nregion has to rely on those programs in order to achieve funding to \nhelp people who are poor and deprived.\n  I am very proud of the economic advancement that my State has made. I \nam very proud our standard of living is very high and that our economy \ncontinues to grow. I am also deeply distressed, as I know many of my \nfellow citizens are, that there are still extremely poor places in my \nState, places where Native Americans live in holes in the ground, \nplaces where there is no running water or sanitation. I believe, \nfrankly, these people, along with the people, the Rosebud Sioux and the \nPinewood Sioux, need help as much as anyone else.\n  For us to somehow perpetuate a commission that has spent, now--$5 \nbillion?\n  Mr. GRAMS. It is $7 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, $7 billion--that was originally set up as \na temporary commission, I think, is an argument, frankly, that it has \noutlived its original purpose.\n  Finally, I wonder if my colleague will respond to the following \nstatement. In 1994, the American people said they want us to reduce \nspending. In 1994, the American people said that they want us to do \nbusiness in a different way, that the tax dollars that they send to \nWashington, DC, they want wisely and efficiently spent.\n  If we cannot cut $40 million out of a commission that was recommended \nto be abolished by President Reagan and that the original House budget \nproposal was to do away with, if we cannot cut $40 million and cut it \ndown to only $142 million, I ask my colleague where he thinks we might \nreally be in the commitment that we made to the American people to \nbalance the budget and reduce this $5 trillion debt that we have laid \non future generations of Americans?\n  I suggest the answer is we are not going to go very far in that \ndirection if we cannot make this very modest reduction that my \ncolleague and friend from Minnesota is making.\n  So I ask my colleague if he believes that this amendment might be a \nstrong indicator of what is to come in our battles to reduce \nunnecessary spending on the part of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I would just like to say, I know this might sound like \njust a small step, only $40 million in a city where we talk in billions \nand trillions, but I think about how many taxpayers in Minnesota would \nI have to put in a line to put $40 million into the Treasury. There are \na lot of people in Minnesota to whom I would have to say, \n\n[[Page S11088]]\n``Your money is going to fund a music hall of fame in Alabama, a \npractice stadium for a professional football team in North Carolina, a \nNASCAR Hall of Fame.\n  I have to say, I am one of the biggest fans of NASCAR racing in the \ncountry, but I do not know if Minnesota taxpayers want to be asked to \nspend some of their tax money for that, when I know in Minnesota there \nare needs for $850,000 to keep flooding out of a town in Marshall, $3 \nmillion request for a highway, 610. But these are going by the wayside \nbecause there is not enough money to fund projects like this. But yet \nwe continue to ask for money that is being spent for such as the \nAppalachian Regional Commission.\n  I just wanted to mention one other thing. It is always great to say \nwe are going to help somebody. But we are always using somebody else's \nmoney to do it. We are asking the taxpayers of this country to pony up \nfor the money we want to spend on pet projects.\n  I want to recount a story of a lady back in Minnesota, Natalie \nWolstad, Coon Rapids. I have used this story before, but I would like \nto recount it again.\n  She wrote me a letter saying she had gone to the bank with a realtor \ntrying to buy their first home, a young couple. After they went through \nall the process, the bank said, ``I am sorry but you do not qualify for \na loan.''\n  She said she and her husband went home that night and went through \ntheir checkbook and all their bills because they wanted to see what \nwere they doing wrong with their money that they could not afford to \nbuy a home. After they figured up all the bills, they found out they \nwere not doing something wrong, but as they went through it they \nnoticed, really for the first time, how much money was coming out of \ntheir paycheck to go for taxes. So it was the tax bite that was keeping \nthem from qualifying for a loan.\n  Like I say, we always want to do something good for somebody else, \nbut we want to use somebody else's money. Those dollars come from \ntaxpayers. Those taxpayers have faces and names, like Natalie Wolstad. \nSo before we take more money out of their pockets to spend as we think \nwould be needed--and as my good friend from Arizona said, there are \nmany, many poor counties in this country that could use this type of \nfunding but they are not supplied with dollars from commissions like \nthe ARC. There is no MRC, there is no Minnesota Regional Commission \nthat will provide these types of dollars that would help Natalie \nWolstad and her family. So I think we should think twice about asking \nthe taxpayers whether they want to spend money for projects like this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2058\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the level of funding for the Appalachian Regional \n      Commission to that enacted by the House of Representatives)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment 2058 at the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, and Mr. Feingold proposes an amendment numbered 2058.\n       On page 32, line 13, strike ``$182,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$142,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Grams \namendment to reduce funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  During debate on the budget resolution, I supported the McConnell \namendment to ensure that the essential services provided by the \nAppalachian Regional Commission are continued for some of this Nation's \nmost destitute areas. The McConnell amendment was agreed to on the \nSenate floor by a vote of 51-49, and was included in the approved \nconference between the House and Senate.\n  Under the budget resolution, the Appalachian Regional Commission \nwould adjust spending levels to assume funding of $1.154 billion for \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission over fiscal years 1996-2002. The \nEnergy and Water bill that we have before us follows the budget \nresolution allocating $182 million for fiscal year 1996.\n  At a time when we are correctly terminating or scaling back outdated \nFederal programs, I believe the Appalachian Regional Commission is the \ntype of Federal initiative we should be encouraging. It is important to \nrecognize that the ARC uses its limited Federal dollars to leverage \nadditional State and local funds. This successful partnership enables \ncommunities in Virginia to have tailored programs which help them \nrespond to a variety of grass-roots needs.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, 21 counties rely heavily on the \nassistance they receive from the Appalachian Regional Commission. \nIncome levels for this region of Virginia further indicate that on \naverage my constituents who reside in this region have incomes which \nare $6,000 below the average per capita income for the rest of the \nNation.\n  In 1960, when the ARC was created, the poverty rate in Virginia's \nAppalachian region was 24.4. In 1990, the poverty rate statistics of \n17.6 show improvement which can be attributed to the effectiveness of \nthe ARC. However, we are still a long way from achieving the United \nStates average poverty level of 13.1 and also the regional poverty \nlevel of other ARC-member States of 15.2.\n  With these statistics in mind, I would like to offer some specific \npoints one should keep in mind regarding the effectiveness of ARC \nprograms, its relationship with the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the \ndirect impact that this relationship has on the private sector.\n  In recent years, a significant portion of ARC funds have been \ndedicated to local economic development efforts. Were it not for this \nassistance, the LENOWISCO Planning District and Wise County would not \nhave been able to complete construction of the water and sewage lines \nto provide utility services to the Wise County Industrial Park at \nBlackwood. These lines were financed by a $500,000 grant from the ARC \nand a $600,000 grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. \nThe construction of these utilities to serve a new industrial park has \nattracted a major wood products manufacturing facility which has \ncreated 175 new jobs for the community.\n  The Fifth Planning District serving the Alleghany Highlands of \nVirginia is a prominent example of leveraging other State and local \nfunds and stimulating economic development with partial funding from \nthe ARC. For fiscal year 1995 with $350,000 from the ARC, the Alleghany \nRegional Commerce Center in Clifton Forge, VA was established. This new \nindustrial center already has a commitment from two industries bringing \nnew employment opportunities for over 220 persons.\n  The ARC funds for this project has generated an additional $500,000 \nin State funds, $450,000 from the Virginia Department of \nTransportation, $145,000 from Alleghany County and $168,173 from the \nAlleghany Highlands Economic Development Authority. As a result of a \nlimited Federal commitment, there is almost a 4-to-1 ratio of non-\nFederal dollars compared to Federal funds.\n  In many cases these funds have been the sole source of funding for \nlocal planning efforts for appropriate community development. For \nexample, such funds have been used to prepare and update comprehensive \nplans which are required by Virginia State law to be updated every 5 \nyears in revise zoning, subdivision and other land use ordinances. In \naddition funds are used to prepare labor force studies or marketing \nplans in guide industrial development sites.\n  Mr. President, the mission of the Appalachian Regional Commission is \nas relevant today as it was when the program was created. This rural \nregion of our Nation remains beset with many geographic obstacles that \nhave kept it isolated from industrial expansion. It is a region that \nhas been attempting to diversify its economy from its dependency on one \nindustry--coal mining--to other stable employment opportunities. It is \na program that provides essential services and stimulates the \ncontributions of State and local funds.\n  I urge the Senate to follow the budget resolution and oppose the \nGrams amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nhostile \n\n[[Page S11089]]\namendment that tries to weaken and retreat from the important work of \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission. It is with great pride that I join \nthe senior Senator of West Virginia in explaining to my colleagues why \nthis amendment should be rejected.\n  Senators listening to this debate may think this is an amendment that \ndeserves the votes of every Senator representing a State other than the \n13 States which comprise the Appalachian region. I hope our case will \nbe heard so that this will not be the conclusion of our colleagues.\n  The people of every State have a stake in the economic strength of \nthe rest of the country. When floods ravage the Midwest or the gulf \nStates; when a major defense installation or space center is located in \na State like Texas or Alabama; when payments are made to farmers in \nMinnesota or Wisconsin for dairy support, for crop losses, and for \nbasic support; when billions are spent to shore up S institutions in \ncertain States; when special aid is given to cities or to California \nafter its riots or earthquakes; when research labs get special funds in \nNew Mexico or Massachusetts--when any of this support and assistance is \nextended, it is the country's way of investing in each region and in \nthe futures of Americans everywhere.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission is the Nation's effort to help a \npart of this country overcome tremendous barriers. In many parts of the \nregion, major progress has been achieved. But the ARC's job is not \nfinished, and the agency should not be abolished until it is.\n  Whenever the Senate considers appropriations bills or other budget \nmeasures, the question is whether the spending proposed is a sound \ninvestment in the Nation or another form of waste. In this case, the \nanswer is that the funding in this bill is a vital investment. The \nbill's architects already made the required cut so that the Appalachian \nStates are doing our share of deficit reduction. Digging deeper is \nmean-spirited, and it's a foolish way to abandon the progress made by \nARC over recent years that should be continued. If we can't finish the \nbasic links to economic development and growth, like water and road \nsystems, my State and the region cannot make the contributions we want \nto or build the life our people deserve.\n  The ARC's partnership with West Virginia and the Appalachian\n   region should not be severed. We need to finish the economic \ndevelopment being built on top of the foundation being laid by the \nARC--and that's essential in our States for more growth, more jobs, and \nmore hope for our people.\n\n  As a former Governor, an now as a U.S. Senator from West Virginia, I \nknow--vividly--the value of the ARC and how it improves the lives of \nmany hard-working citizens. Whether the funding is used for new water \nand sewer systems, physician recruitment, adult literacy programs, or \nthe Appalachian Corridor highways, it has made the difference in West \nVirginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and the other Appalachian States.\n  The highways are the most visible and best known investments made by \nthe ARC for the people of Appalachia. As of today, over two-thirds of \nthe ARC highway system have been completed. But if this amendment to \ncut ARC so severely prevails, the job will not be completed. What a \nwaste of taxpayers' money to pull out before a road system is finished.\n  At this very moment, some of these highways are called highways \nhalfway to nowhere, because they are just that--half built, and only \nhalfway to their destination. The job has to be completed, so these \nhighways become highways the whole way to somewhere. And that somewhere \nis called jobs and prosperity that will benefit the rest of the \ncountry, too. Appalachia simply wants to be connected to our national \ngrid of highways. Parts of the region weren't lucky enough to come out \nas flat land, so the job takes longer and costs more. But it is \nessential is giving the people and families in this part of the United \nStates of America a shot--a chance to be rewarded for a work ethic and \ncommitment with real economic opportunity and a decent quality of life.\n  I won't speak for my colleagues from other Appalachian States, but \nWest Virginia was not exactly the winner in the original Interstate \nHighway System. And Senators here represent many States that were. As a \nresult, areas of my State have suffered, economically and in human \nterms. Without roads, people are shut off from jobs. That's obvious. \nBut without roads, people also can't get decent health care. Dropping \nout of school is easier sometimes than taking a 2-hour bus ride because \nthe roads aren't there.\n  The structure of the ARC makes it more efficient and effective than \nmany other agencies. The ARC is a working, true partnership between \nFederal, State, and local governments. This structure expects \nresponsibility from citizens and local leaders, Federal funding is \ndesigned to leverage State and local money for any activity. According \nto the ARC, throughout its lifetime, it has contributed less than half \nof the total amount of project funds. Administrative costs have \naccounted for less than 4 percent of total costs over ARC's lifetime.\n  Long before it was fashionable, ARC used a from-the-bottom-up \napproach to addressing local needs rather than a top-down, one-size-\nfits-all mandate of the type that has become all too familiar to \ncitizens dealing with Federal agencies. It works, too.\n  I urge everyone in this body to keep a promise made to a region that \nhas been short-shrifted. Each region is unique. Solutions have to \ndiffer, depending on our circumstances. When it comes to Appalachia, a \nsmall agency called the Appalachian Regional Commission should finish \nits work. Slashing the support for such a targeted, effective \ncommitment to a region that was excluded from economic progress for so \nlong will only create more problems and more costs that should be \navoided. I urge my colleagues to vote against an amendment that asks \nthe Senate to give up on an investment that will benefit all Americans.\n                       cuts to arc appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague. This amendment targets the \nAppalachian Regional Commission [ARC] for an unfair and \ndisproportionate burden of budget cuts. I have worked with the \nofficials of ARC to pare back the budget and duties of the ARC. The \napproach we have crafted is balanced, fair, and meets the new budget \nparameters while continuing to provide essential assistance to the \npeople of Appalachia.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that the ARC budget proposal does not \npreserve the status quo. The funding level for the fiscal year 1996 \nbudget of $182 million is $100 million less than what was appropriated \nin 1995. This represents a 35-percent cut in overall funding.\n  It has been a mere 2 months since the Senate approved my amendment to \nreform the ARC. My amendment outlined a blueprint to reform the ARC and \nset it on a glide path of reduced spending that falls within the \nguidelines of a balanced budget by the year 2002. I would like to \nremind my colleagues that this amendment, which passed the Senate, \nestablished the fiscal year 1996 funding levels contained in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of that vote be included in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand why the Senator from \nMinnesota has offered this amendment. To him, the ARC is a program that \nbenefits only Appalachian States. I might share his views if I didn't \nsee first-hand the impact this program has had on an area that is \nburdened by high levels of unemployment and economic dislocation.\n  The ARC is very important not only to Kentucky, but also to a great \nnumber of other States. This program has proven to be effective in \nproviding targeted assistance to those who need it most without wasting \nmillions of dollars on administrative expenses.\n  Although the ARC has made a significant impact in improving the \neconomic opportunities and quality of life for people living in \nAppalachia, there continues to be a real need for assistance in this \nregion. Poverty, outmigration, and high levels of unemployment are \nespecially prevalent in central Appalachia, which includes some of the \npoorest counties in the Nation.\n  The ARC serves parts of 13 States, totaling 399 counties from New \nYork to \n\n[[Page S11090]]\nMississippi. This is a region that lags behind the Nation in most, if \nnot all, major economic measures. Chronically higher unemployment \nlevels, substantially lower income levels, and perniciously high \npoverty rates plague most of Appalachia. In eastern Kentucky, for \nexample, the poverty rate stood at 29 percent in 1990--16 percent \nhigher than the national average.\n  Of the 399 counties served by ARC, 115 of the counties are considered \ndistressed. This means that these counties suffer from unemployment \nlevels and poverty rates that are 150 percent of the national average \nand have per capita incomes that are only two-thirds the national \naverage.\n  The ARC was designed to specifically address the unique problems of \nthis region--which has been afflicted by over a century of \nexploitation, neglect, geographic barriers, and economic distress. \nThese are not problems born of cyclical economic fluctuation, but are \nthe result of years of unremitting underdevelopment, isolation, and \noutmigration.\n  The good news is that the ARC has worked hand-in-hand with each of \nthe 13 States in its jurisdiction to develop flexible and effective \nprograms, tailored to the specific needs of each community or region.\n  And there's more good news. The ARC is unusually lean, as Federal \nagencies go, with respect to administrative and personnel expenses. \nTotal overhead accounts for less than 4 percent of all expenditures. \nThis is largely achieved through close cooperation with the individual \nStates.\n  State Governors contribute 50 percent of the administrative costs as \nwell as the full cost of their own regional ARC offices. In fact, I \nwould urge my colleagues to look to the ARC as a model of efficiency, \ncost sharing, and State cooperation for other Federal programs.\n  The ARC is not a traditional poverty program, but an economic \ndevelopment program, with a lot of work still ahead of it. The fact is, \nthat Appalachia receives 14 percent less per capita spending from the \nFederal Government than the rest of the country--and that includes \nfunding received through ARC. While this may not seem like a lot, this \namounts to $12 billion less for the Appalachian region annually.\n  Like many of my colleagues, we are all taking a close look at each \nand every program to find areas where we can eliminate wasteful \nspending. I worked with the ARC to ensure that this program was reduced \nto its most essential function--economic development.\n  The best way we can achieve this is quite simple. First, we start \nwith a 35-percent reduction from the current funding level for ARC. \nThere's no question that this is a considerable cut, and it will have \nan impact on the ARC's ability to fully serve its target areas. But I \nthink it underscores how serious we are about preserving the vital \npurposes of this agency.\n  The 35-percent cut in the first year is just a start. If the reforms \nI have proposed are implemented, funding levels will continue to \ndecline through 2002. Overall, if we use, as a baseline, a hard freeze \nat 1995 funding levels, my proposal would achieve a 47-percent \nreduction in spending. This amounts to $925 million in savings over 7 \nyears.\n  With regard to my colleague's concerns regarding the difference \nbetween the House and Senate spending levels for ARC, I suggest that \nthe Senate has already spoken on this matter and endorsed this funding \nlevel on two occasions. Once as an amendment that passed the Senate on \nMay 24, and the second when this body approved the budget resolution. I \nwould also point out that this spending level was also included in the \nchairman's mark of the budget resolution for fiscal year 1996.\n  I might also point out to my colleague, that the reconciliation of \nthese spending differences should be worked out in conference.\n  Mr. President, I have worked hard to develop a reform plan that is \nresponsible both to the people of eastern Kentucky, and the taxpayers \nof this Nation. If my colleagues believe that eliminating the ARC will \nsave money, they are sadly mistaken. The poverty and economic distress \nof central Appalachia will only deepen, imposing higher cost on other \nFederal programs. On the other hand, if we keep ARC alive, we can help \nthis region to help itself, and save a lot more money in the long run.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and maintain this level \nof funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by \n     which the amendment was agreed to.\n       Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n       The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment which \nproposes to alter the Committee's recommendation regarding funding for \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission. The Committee recommendation is a \nresponsible one and should be supported. The ARC is funded just below \nthe President's request, and is well below last year's level. The \namendment by the Senator from Minnesota would reduce the Committee's \nrecommendation to the House level.\n  Mr. President, the ARC has already contributed to the deficit \nreduction occurring in this appropriations bill. The ARC is recommended \nat a level of $182,000,000, which is $100,000,000, or 35 percent, below \nthe fiscal year 1995 enacted level. Let me repeat--ARC is already \nfunded 35 percent below last year's level. We do not need to drain it \nany further. Given that the non-defense portion of the 602(b) \nallocation assigned to this appropriation bill is down just 13 percent \nbelow a freeze, I contend that the ARC is already bearing more than its \nfair share of the reductions in this bill. Cutting below the Committee \nrecommendation will impede upon the ability of ARC to address its core \nmission--maintaining an effective regional development program that \nwill create economic opportunity in distressed areas so that \ncommunities are better positioned to contribute to the national \neconomy.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, ARC has already been subjected to a \nsignificant reduction--35 percent--below the FY 1995 level. Can the \nsame be said for other accounts in this bill? Bureau of Reclamation \nfunding is down 7.3 percent; energy supply, research and development is \ndown 15.6 percent, which is less than half of the reduction imposed on \nARC. Atomic energy defense activities are up $1.3 billion, or 13 \npercent; the regional power marketing administrations are increased by \nnearly 15 percent. So if the concern is about funding, I suggest that \nSenators look closely at which programs are already bearing more than \ntheir fair share of the reductions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, the funding recommendation for ARC contained in this \nappropriations bill is absolutely consistent with the budget resolution \n\n\n[[Page S11091]]\napproved earlier this summer by the House and Senate. The budget \nresolution assumed that ARC would be reduced below the FY 1995 level, \nand this budget does exactly that. The recommendation in this \nappropriation bill is consistent with the position taken by 51 senators \nwhen they voted to fund the ARC during consideration of the budget \nresolution in the Senate initially. The budget resolution conference \nagreement adopted the Senate position on ARC. In its consideration of \nthis appropriations bill, the House sought to eliminate all funding for \nthe ARC and voted overwhelmingly, by a 3:1 margin (319-108), to support \ncontinued funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. So the \nCongress has been clear--the programs of ARC are important, and they \nshould be continued.\n  For those who contend that the Senate should not fund ARC at a level \ndifferent than the House, the 602(b) allocation for non-defense \nactivities in the energy and water development bill is above the House \nallocation. I will attempt to speak on behalf of the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, but I believe this allocation is consistent \nwith the long-standing commitment to the infrastructure development \nfunded in this bill. ARC is but a part of that infrastructure--just as \nthe investments in the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation \nprograms benefit economic activity, so too do the programs of the ARC. \nMr. President, this bill is in compliance with its allocation and is \nalready doing its part for deficit reduction.\n  The presumption behind this amendment is that the benefits of the ARC \nare limited to a particular geographic region. Mr. President, that can \nbe true of many programs throughout the government, which don't happen \nto have the name of their geographical region in the program name. For \nexample, in the Interior appropriations bill, we fund a program called \n``Payments in Lieu of Taxes''. There is nothing geographical in that \nname. However, it benefits primarily those western states where the \nFederal government happens to own land. In that program, we will spend \n$100 million in FY 1996, of which 67 percent benefits just 8 states. \nBut we don't propose to terminate that program in the Interior bill \nbecause it benefits a select few.\n  Mr. President, the tradition of this Congress is to come to the aid \nof regions of this country that are in need. We have responded to the \nearthquakes in California, the floods in the Midwest, hurricane \nrecovery in South Carolina and Florida, volcano eruptions in \nWashington, and winter storm damages in the Northeast. Some might say \n``well, those are in response to natural occurrences--events that were \ntotally unpredictable.'' To that, Mr. President, I would respond that \nthe geography that defines Appalachia was beyond the control of man, \nand that the programs of the ARC are designed to respond to those \nchallenges. The natural topography has created isolation in many parts \nof Appalachia--it is through programs such as ARC that communication \nand transportation links are enhanced so that access to markets, \ndiversity and opportunity can grow. And by investing in the human \ncomponent of Appalachia, through better education and health, the \nregion is able to provide the workforce necessary to meet these \nchallenges.\n  The programs of the ARC have contributed to improvements in the \nability of the region to address the disparity in poverty and income \nlevels between Appalachia and other parts of the country. Despite the \nprogress in recent years, the income level in Appalachia is 17 percent \nbelow the national average. The poverty rate in Appalachia is 16 \npercent above the national average. When it comes to U.S. expenditures \non a per capita basis, in fiscal year 1994, Appalachia had 8.2 percent \nof the U.S. population, but received just 7.5 percent of U.S. \nexpenditures. So even with the investments from ARC's programs, the \nfunding provided to this area is not out of proportion to the needs or \neconomic circumstances.\n  Mr. President, at a time when many people are demanding a leaner, \nmore efficient government that is closer to the people it serves, the \nARC should be held up as a model. ARC operates with a small staff--\nabout 50 people--and spends only about 4 percent of its budget on \noverhead. The decisions on the expenditure of its funds are made after \nconsulting with the governors of the region. This Congress has \nrepeatedly urged that more attention be paid to the input of the \ngovernors as we seek to make programs more responsive. This is exactly \nwhat ARC is all about.\n  Mr. President, the governors of the 13 states are represented on the \nCommission. This is not a Federally-run, top-down type of operation. It \nis very much driven by the local requirements, as represented by the \ngovernors. All 13 governors--8 Republicans and 5 Democrats--have \nsupported the continuation of the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge Senators to table this amendment. This \nagency is already funded 35 percent below the FY 1995 level. Cuts are \nalready being imposed on the ARC. Eliminating this agency will not \nsolve the problems of the Federal budget. The Senate has already voted \nearlier this year to sustain the ARC. The Senate should stand by its \nearlier vote and stand by the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the business of cutting budgets is a \nmatter of shared sacrifice. We want to be fair in the way we cut our \nbudgets. The Appalachian Regional Commission has suffered from last \nyear a $100 million cut, from $282 million to $182 million, a 35 \npercent cut, which is more than most programs in this country.\n  With any program you can point out little incidents that are less \nthan the best. And over a period of, what, 30 years or so, they have \npointed out very few with the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  The fact of the matter is that in the 13 States that comprise the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, they do very excellent work and needed \nwork, most of it in highways, which is ongoing, and to cut 35 percent \nfrom that budget I believe is enough. To cut $100 million off of what \nlast year was $282 million I believe is fair enough and more than, \nindeed, enough, more than a fair share for the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. This is not an important program in most States, certainly \nnot in mine. But in those States that comprise the heart of Appalachia, \nit is very important.\n  And suffice it to say, we should be prepared to stay here for a long \ntime if we do not table this amendment. I hope we do because I believe \nthat they have done enough, that we have done enough to cut the \nAppalachian Regional Commission.\n  So, Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I state to the Senate, at the \nrequest of the Republican leader, even though some other issues may be \nconcluded and votes may be asked for, we are going to try to stack \nvotes now until 8:30. So everybody should know that. We will try to do \nthat after this vote, I say to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the tabling motion of the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 349 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     \n[[Page S11092]]\n\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Exon\n     Gramm\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2058) was agreed \nto.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Harkin wants to speak a moment, \nand then we will have a colloquy with reference to a program he is very \ninterested in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for agreeing to a \nlittle colloquy. Before we do that, I would like to spend a few moments \ntalking about an issue dealing with energy that I care very deeply \nabout and which in one form has passed the other body with an \noverwhelming vote, and that is the issue of hydrogen energy.\n  Madam President, I would like you to imagine a future energy scenario \nbased on a totally sustainable energy system. Imagine a car that runs \nso clean that you could drink the effluent from the tailpipe because \nthe only output from this car would be pure, clean water. Imagine a \nsmall electrical power plant sitting next to all major buildings, \nfactories, shopping centers, apartment houses quietly, very quietly, \nproducing electrical power and heat or air-conditioning, with over \ntwice the efficiency of current power plants, but with absolutely no \npollution.\n  I know it sounds incredible. But it is possible and it is possible \ntoday using hydrogen and fuel cells.\n  Hydrogen is the ideal environmental fuel. Burning hydrogen produces \nno acid rain, no greenhouse gas emission, no smog, no ozone-depleting \nchemicals and no radioactive waste.\n  And if the hydrogen is made from renewable energy, that is solar, \nwind or biomass, then there is absolutely no pollution, no greenhouse \ngases, and no resource depletion, a totally sustainable energy system. \nOne key to the renewable hydrogen future is the fuel cell. A fuel cell \nis an electrochemical device with no moving parts, much like a car \nbattery. A fuel cell produces electricity when supplied with hydrogen \nand oxygen and when the hydrogen and oxygen combine, then the output \nis, of course, H2O, pure water. Now, we have experience with fuel \ncells because they provide the electrical power for our astronauts on \nthe space shuttle. Plus it also produces pure, clean water.\n  So hydrogen is the latest breakthrough. Unlike electricity which it \ncomplements, hydrogen can be stored and piped long distance with no \nenergy loss. So we think of hydrogen not so much as a source of energy, \nbut as a transmittal of energy. It is the carrier we can use.\n  One of the problems with solar energy is, of course, it is OK when \nthe Sun is shining but it is not too good when it is cloudy or raining \nor it is nighttime. The same is true of wind. Wind energy is fine, but \nit is not too good when the wind is not blowing. And so we can use \nthose forms of energy to electrolyze water. And this is the perfect \ncycle. You use biomass or you use wind or you use solar or you use \nhydropower, for example. To make electrolyzed water, you get the \nhydrogen and oxygen, and you then take that hydrogen and you combine it \nback with oxygen in fuel cells. You get the electricity. You get heat \nalso that can be used also for air-conditioning. And then what you get \nis water. So you start with water and you end with water. And it is a \nperfectly pure fuel cycle.\n  Hydrogen is not just a pipedream. It is already being used. These \nfuel cells that use hydrogen can efficiently convert the hydrogen back \nto electricity. In fact, buses right now are running on hydrogen-fed \nfuel cells in Vancouver and other cities. These buses have the pickup \nand the range of fossil fueled buses. But there is no pollution, and \nthey are as energy efficient.\n  Furthermore, there is no reason why the hydrogen buses should not \neventually cost any more than any other bus. And I believe this will be \ntrue for automobiles also. But much more work needs to be done to bring \nhydrogen energy to the point where it can be used on a wide-scale \nbasis.\n  A recent House measure just passed the other body that was sponsored \nby Congressman Bob Walker from Pennsylvania, who chairs the Science and \nTechnology Committee in the House. I have worked with Congressman \nWalker often in the past. I served on the committee with him when I was \na Member of the House. And I know of his long and deep commitment to \ngetting funds in for hydrogen energy research. And it comes out of his \nlong study, as I said, of science and of technology. As I said, he is \nnow the chair of that committee in the House. The bill that he \nintroduced, I have introduced with bipartisan sponsorship here in the \nSenate. It is now introduced. It has, as I said, sponsors from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  It calls for a $25 million authorization next year for hydrogen \nenergy research. I might point out that the House has already passed \nthat bill and the Appropriations Committee in the House added money to \nthis line to bring the total amount for hydrogen research to $15 \nmillion.\n  I am quite well aware that the administration only asked for $7.5 \nmillion. The Jeffords amendment, which was adopted earlier, provided, \nif I am not mistaken, another $1.5 million. That brings it up to $9 \nmillion total. That is still less than what we spent last year.\n  So for a very promising energy resource, for one that holds a great \ndeal of promise for cutting down on pollution and for providing a clean \nrenewable source of energy, both for electricity for buildings, for \nstationary uses, but also for use in transportation, this is the wrong \nway to go in cutting down the research.\n  As I said, the House upped it to $15 million. I had offered the \namendment in the full Committee on Appropriations to bring that up to \n$15 million. I must admit, I lost on an 11-to-10 vote. I think if all \nthe people had been there, maybe I would have won. I do not know. Not \neverybody was there. It was a very close vote. It was 11 to 10, and it \nwas bipartisan. There were people on the Republican side and people on \nthe Democratic side both voting for and against it. So it was a very \nclose vote.\n  I do not want to take a great deal of time of the Senate. I know \neverybody wants to get out of here this evening. I have spoken with the \nchairman about this. I am hopeful that when the committee goes to \nconference, they will look kindly upon the mark that the House put in. \nI want to assure the chairman that he will have my support. I can \nassure him of the support of the people who are cosponsors of the bill \nand I, again, would like to ask the chairman what his intentions might \nbe when they go to conference on this one item of hydrogen research.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, Senator Harkin's request has been \npartially granted by the Jeffords amendment which added $1.5 million to \nthis program as part of his larger amendment regarding solar energy and \nother things.\n  I want to make it clear to Senator Harkin that since the House has a \nhigher number--I think they have $15 million; we are going in with $9 \nmillion--we will do our very best to work with them so we do not return \nwith anything less than $12 million, and that is what the Senator \noriginally asked for. We will be there, or higher than that, when we \ncome out of conference.\n  I urge that the Senator consider that as a great victory. He has my \nword, and \n \n[[Page S11093]]\n\ncertainly he is going to come out of it fairly well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, when the Senator from New Mexico gives \nme his word, I take it to the bank. I appreciate his consideration of \nthis. He has been a strong supporter of research in new energy. I \ncompliment him for that.\n  This is another one of the elements, I think, that helps us to \nprovide the energy we are going to need in the future.\n  I thank the chairman for his consideration of this. I will give him \nwhatever support I can in getting this item up in conference. I thank \nthe chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am reviewing the list with the \nranking member. I will tell the Senate we are, believe it or not, \nperilously close to having this bill done. As a matter of fact, I ask \nif Senator Wellstone's and Senator Grams' offices would contact me. I \nthink it is the Wellstone amendment with reference to water reservoirs. \nIt is the only one still pending that needs to be discussed. So if we \ncan get some word on that. And then we have the managers' amendment \ncleaning up the bill and agreeing to a number of amendments that have \nbeen presented that we both agree on. Obviously, they are going to be \nin order, and we are going to adopt them. I say to Senator Wellstone, \nMr. President, that we need to know what his intentions are.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want my colleagues to know I am \nready to go forward with a discussion on this amendment. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico is waiting for my colleague from Minnesota. The reason \nfor this delay is we are waiting for my colleague from Minnesota, and I \nam reluctant to go forward. I think we will be ready to go in a few \nmoments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nVitiating Adoption of Committee Amendment on Page 12, Beginning on Line \n                                   17\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I have a group of cleared amendments \nnow.\n  I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the action of the Senate adopting \nthe committee amendment on page 12, beginning on line 17 through line \n18 on page 13, striking House text regarding Manistique Harbor, MI. The \nadoption of this request will restore the House language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased that the managers of the \nenergy and water development appropriations have agreed to keep the \nHouse language regarding a federally designated harbor of refuge in \nMichigan. The provision will allow the implementation of a U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency administrative order addressing \ncontaminated sediments in Manistique River and Harbor.\n  In early July, immediately after the House's favorable action on the \nStupak amendment, I requested that an identical provision be included \nin the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on energy and water \ndevelopment bill for fiscal year 1996. I understand that the \nEnvironment Committee has no objection to the substance of the language \nin question, particularly since it does not affect policy or require \nFederal funds.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the managers and the Environment \nCommittee. There are special time constraints at work in the Manistique \ncase. The EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the local community, and \nthe interested parties, would like to begin implementation of the \nremediation action this summer to prevent further contaminants from \nentering Lake Michigan. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nEPA Region V Administrator be included in the Record, following my \nstatement.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, winter comes early to the Upper \nPeninsula. Therefore, it is urgent that action occur during our limited \nconstruction season. If H.R. 1905 should become bogged down for some \nunlikely reason in the conference process or on the floor, I hope my \ncolleagues will bear with me as I seek to move this language on another \nvehicle or as an individual bill. This is not a controversial matter. \nWe should move it quickly.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I understand that the House has included \nlanguage in its report accompanying the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill which would have an impact on the Central Valley Project \nImprovement Act of 1992 (CVPIA). I am very concerned that an \nappropriations bill would be used for this purpose and I urge my \ncolleagues who will be conferees on this bill to reject these attacks \non the CVPIA.\n  The House report attempts to delay a study of the San Joaquin river \nthat was established in law through the CVPIA. As the author of that \nact, I am surprised by the action of the House. The study is \nspecifically ordered in the 1992 Act and, in fact, has a statutory \ndeadline for action by the Secretary. Clearly, this statute is \nunaffected by any Committee Report language and the law remains binding \non the Secretary.\n  The House also includes report language which bears on the repayment \nfor the Kesterson Reservoir Cleanup Program.\n  I understand that there is no Senate report or legislative language \nconcerning repayment responsibilities for the Kesterson Reservoir \nCleanup Program and the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I also understand that the taxpayers have spent tens of \nmillions of dollars for the cleanup of the Kesterson Reservoir which \nwas built to collect the drainage water from farms in the Bureau of \nReclamations' San Louis Unit within the Central Valley project.\n  The Kesterson facility is so contaminated with selenium and other \nchemicals that it was closed on March of 1985 by the Department of \nInterior. Many migratory birds using Kesterson Ponds were killed in \nviolation of the Migratory Bird Treaty and Congress has appropriated \ntens of millions of dollars to clean up Kesterson.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. It is my further understanding that absent legislative \nlanguage, the repayment for Kesterson cleanup is reimbursable and the \nSecretary of Interior is obligated by law to collect reimbursable \ncosts.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Now is not the time to be spending additional taxpayer \nfunds on cleanup which should be paid by water contractors whose \ndrainage caused such problems at Kesterson.\n  With regard to the San Joaquin River comprehensive plan, I understand \nthat the House committee report recommends that $1 million be moved out \nof the San Joaquin River Basin initiative and into the Shasta \ntemperature control device. This would have a devastating effect on the \nSan Joaquin River comprehensive plan, a study required under the 1992 \nstatute which is due for completion next year. Is there language on \nthese funds in the Senate bill or report?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I thank the Senator for these clarifications. Nothing in \nthe CVPIA required Friant water users to give up any water. The San \nJoaquin comprehensive plan is only a study.\n                    Amendments No. 2059 through 2065\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I send a group of amendments to the \ndesk and ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered and \nagreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. President, these amendments are as follows: An amendment by \nSenator Bingaman to reduce the energy costs of Federal facilities; an \namendment by Senators Bradley and Lautenberg, within available funds, \nto provide for the use of funds for the Tokamak fusion test reactor; an \namendment by Senator Daschle, within available \n\n[[Page S11094]]\nfunds, to provide $300,000 to complete a feasibility study of \nalternatives for meeting the drinking water needs on the Cheyenne River \nSioux Reservation under the Bureau of Reclamation; an amendment by \nSenator Baucus to provide $2 million, within available funds, for \nIndian energy resource projects, for Crow Indian projects; an amendment \nby Senator Byrd respecting Petersburg, WV, revising a cost ceiling on \nan authorized Corps of Engineers project; an amendment by Senator \nFeingold to provide spending limitations on the TVA Environmental \nResearch Center; an amendment by Senators Boxer and Baucus with respect \nto reporting requirements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], proposes \n     amendments No. 2059 through 2065.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  So the amendments (No. 2059 through 2065) were agreed to, en bloc, as \nfollows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENERGY SAVINGS AT FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Facilities Energy Costs.--The head of each \n     agency for which funds are made available under this Act \n     shall take all actions necessary to achieve during fiscal \n     year 1996 a 5 percent reduction, from fiscal year 1995 \n     levels, in the energy costs of the facilities used by the \n     agency.\n       (b) Use of Cost Savings.--An amount equal to the amount of \n     cost savings realized by an agency under subsection (a) shall \n     remain available for obligation through the end of fiscal \n     year 1997, without further authorization or appropriation, as \n     follows:\n       (1) Conservation measures.--Fifty percent of the amount \n     shall remain available for the implementation of additional \n     energy conservation measures and for water conservation \n     measures at such facilities used by the agency as are \n     designated by the head of the agency.\n       (2) Other purposes.--Fifty percent of the amount shall \n     remain available for use by the agency for such purposes as \n     are designated by the head of the agency, consistent with \n     applicable law.\n\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 1996, the head \n     of each agency described in subsection (a) shall submit a \n     report to Congress specifying the results of the actions \n     taken under subsection (a) and providing any recommendations \n     as to how to further reduce energy costs and energy \n     consumption in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--Each report shall--\n       (A) specify the total energy costs of the facilities used \n     by the agency;\n       (B) identify the reductions achieved; and\n       (C) specify the actions that resulted in the reductions.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, when it comes to controlling \nGovernment spending, nothing stands out in my mind more than the \nbillion dollars that the Federal agencies toss out the window every \nyear in energy waste.\n  The Federal Government is our Nation's largest energy waster. This \nyear agencies will spend almost $4 billion to heat, cool and power \ntheir 500,000 buildings.\n  Both the Office of Technology Assessment and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a nonprofit group that I chair with Senator Jeffords, have \nestimated that Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually.\n  To achieve these savings, agencies just need to buy the same energy \nsaving technologies--insulation, building controls, and energy \nefficient lighting, heating and air conditioning--that have been \ninstalled in many private sector offices and homes.\n  Why, because there are now businesses, known as energy service \ncompanies, that stand ready to upgrade Federal facilities at no up-\nfront cost to the Government--That's right, at no up-front cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  These companies offer what are called energy saving performance \ncontracts which provide private sector expertise to assess what energy \nsaving technologies are most cost effective, provide nongovernmental \nfinancing to make the improvements, install and maintain the equipment \nand guarantee the energy savings will be achieved.\n  Agencies pay for the service over time using the energy costs they \nhave saved--if they do not see the saving they do not pay for the \nservice--its that simple, that is the guarantee.\n  This type of contract is used every day in the private sector and \nState and local government facilities. For instance, Honeywell Corp. \nhas entered into these energy saving arrangements with over 1,000 local \nschool districts nationwide, allowing schools to reinvest $800 million \nin savings in critical education resources rather than continuing to \npay for energy waste.\n  Unfortunately, even though Congress first authorized Federal agencies \nto take advantage of this innovative business approach in 1986 agencies \nhave been dragging their heals.\n  To help get things moving, the Department of Energy recently prepared \nstreamlined procedures to encourage their use.\n  Now is the time for Congress to put the agencies feet to the fire on \nfinancial reform of Government energy waste. Agencies should enter into \nthese partnerships with the private sector.\n  That is why, today I am proposing an amendment calling for each \nFederal agency covered by this bill, to reduce Government energy costs \nby 5 percent in 1996. I am also asking that agencies report back to us \nby the end of 1996 to ensure that they have actually taken action to \nreduce their energy costs.\n  You know, we are often called upon up here to make really hard \ncontroversial decisions that please some and anger others. This is a \nwinner for everyone. If 1,000 local school boards have examined it and \nare reaping the savings, I say its time we got our Nation's biggest \nenergy waster on track, too.\n  With this one, simple reform, we will create thousands of job and \nbusiness opportunities in every one of our States, improve the \nenvironment by reducing air pollution and save ourselves hundreds of \nmillion of dollars every year, at no up-front cost to taxpayers. As my \nkid would say, ``Dad, its a no brainer''.\n                           amendment no. 2060\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the use of funds for the Tokamak Fusion Test \n                                Reactor)\n\n       On page 20, lines 22 and 23, after ``expended'' insert ``, \n     of which amount within available funds $56,000,000 may be \n     available to continue operation of the Tokamak Fusion Test \n     Reactor (for which purpose, the Secretary may use savings \n     from reducing general administrative expenses in accordance \n     with the Department of Energy's strategic alignment and \n     downsizing effort, but none of the savings used for this \n     purpose shall come from programmatic accounts within this \n     title)''.\n\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the pending amendment. This \namendment is a smart one because it makes use of existing Department of \nEnergy resources. It is also a no-cost amendment. It does not increase \nany account in this bill. And it does not take one cent from any other \nDepartment of Energy research program.\n  Last year's conference report on the energy and water bill contained \nlanguage calling for an expert commission to report to Congress on what \nthe future of the fusion program should be. This report was done by the \nPresident's Committee on Advisors on Science and Technology or more \ncommonly known as PCAST.\n  This report was written by energy research experts within Government, \nthe private sector, universities, and the national laboratories.\n  The PCAST report anticipated that the fusion program would have to \nlive with fewer resources in the next few years. Despite the dwindling \nresources envisioned by the PCAST, they strongly recommended that the \nexisting Tokamak fusion test reactor [TFTR] at Princeton University \noperate for another 3 years.\n  And the statement of administration policy accompanying this bill \nreiterates support for the PCAST report in general and TFTR \nspecifically.\n  However, the current language in the energy and water bill is \nambiguous about the TFTR machine. Therefore, this amendment seeks to \nclarify that the Secretary of Energy will have the authority to keep \nTFTR effectively operating for another 3 years. And it accomplishes \nexactly what the PCAST report called for with regard to TFTR.\n  Madam President, the fusion program has been a success for this \ncountry. The TFTR machine at Princeton University has broken world \nrecords of fusion power in the last 2 years. Furthermore, the TFTR at \nPrinceton is the only machine in the world that uses deuterium-tritium \nfuel, which is the type of fuel that might one day be used in a \ncommercial fusion machine.\n  Madam President, at this time I would like to tell my colleagues \nabout some of the potential advantages to developing fusion energy. \nFusion energy \n\n[[Page S11095]]\nholds the promise of an abundant, clean burning, inexpensive energy \nalternative for the next century.\n  The byproducts of fusion energy are thousands of times less dangerous \nthan fission. The byproducts also cannot be converted into nuclear \nweapons. Finally, fusion energy has no chemical combustion products and \ntherefore, would not contribute to acid rain or global warming.\n  It is clear that fusion energy is an environmentally sound energy \nsource worth the investment of Federal resources.\n  Despite all of the promise and success of the fusion program in the \nlast 2 years, its budget has been cut deeply this year. It has been cut \nby 40 percent which is much more than other energy research programs. \nFor example:\n  Nuclear energy was only cut by 6 percent.\n  Biological and environmental research was only cut by 4 percent.\n  General sciences was only cut by 1 percent.\n  Nuclear physics was only cut 8 percent.\n  And some part of the energy research budget actually received \nincreases in this bill:\n  High energy physics received a 2-percent increase; and\n  Basic energy science got a 6-percent increase.\n  Madam President, I understand that some of the cuts in the fusion \nprogram and in other programs in this bill are necessary. The \nallocation for this bill is less than it was last year. The managers of \nthis bill have had to make some tough decisions and I commend them for \ntheir hard work in putting this bill together.\n  However, I believe that adopting this amendment will improve this \nbill while not increasing its tight allocation.\n  This amendment simply allows the Secretary of Energy the flexibility \nto operate the TFTR machine to complete all the ongoing experiments at \nPrinceton. The Federal Government has already invested over $1 billion \nin the fusion facility at Princeton. It would be shortsighted to stop \nthese continuing research activities at Princeton, especially since the \nmachine will be ending its operations in 3 years.\n  This amendment does not cut the core fusion program or the \ninternational fusion activities funded in this bill. Nor does it cut \nany other energy research activities funded in this bill. It simply \nallows the fusion research on the TFTR machine at Princeton to \ncontinue.\n  Madam President, in 3 years the fusion program will be at a turning \npoint. At that time, we must decide whether or not we will make the \nlong-term investment in developing fusion energy. We may or may not \nhave the resources at that time to go forward. But we should move the \nfusion program forward until that day comes. We should make the best \nuse of the facilities and human resources that we have invested so much \ninto over the years.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this no-cost \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, today Senator Lautenberg and I are \noffering an amendment to insure the continuation of the tokamak fusion \ntest reactor, or TFTR, at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. \nWithout increasing any account in the bill or cutting any other \nDepartment of Energy research program, the amendment insures that the \nTFTR and its valuable research will proceed for another year.\n  I agree that we need to make significant appropriations cuts, \nhowever, we should not forget that some cuts hurt more than others. \nShutting down a major research lab like TFTR is doubly damaging. First, \nwe lost the important research it might have provided into cleaner, \nsafer sources of nuclear power. But even worse, we make it that much \nharder to restart research when times get better financially but \nscientists have moved on to other, more secure, fields of study.\n  The Princeton lab is the world leader in fusion research and the only \ntokamak in the world using deuterium-tritium fuel, the most likely fuel \nfor a future commercial fusion reactor. In December 1993, when this \nfuel was first injected into the machine, the TFTR began setting world \nfusion power records. Over the next few years, researchers plan to \ndouble the production of fusion power at TFTR. And as reported last \nweek in Science magazine, Princeton scientists have made a recent \nbreakthrough in fusion research which has great promise for removing \nsome of the biggest obstacles to power production.\n  TFTR was authorized by Congress in 1976 and began operations in 1982 \nat a time when fusion machines could produce only a 10th of a watt of \nfusion power. The device has now produced more than 10 million watts of \nfusion power--an increase of more than 100 million times. TFTR has \nachieved or surpassed its initial design objectives and has higher \nperformance standards and capabilities than any other existing device.\n  When power generation options for the next century and beyond are \nseverely limited, we cannot afford to waste precious resources by \nabandoning important research work like the TFTR.\n                           amendment no. 2061\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure the completion of the feasibility study of \nalternatives for meeting the drinking water needs on the Cheyenne River \n             Sioux Reservation and surrounding communities)\n\n       On page 15, line 17, add: ``Provided further, That within \n     available funds, $300,000 is for the completion of the \n     feasibility study of alternatives for meeting the drinking \n     water needs on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation and \n     surrounding communities.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2062\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that funds shall be made available to the Crow \n  tribe for energy resources programs under title XXVI of the Energy \n                          Policy Act of 1992)\n\n       On page 20, lines 22 and 23, after ``expended'' insert \n     ``Provided further, That within the amount for Indian Energy \n     Resource projects, $2,000,000 may be made available to fund \n     the Crow energy resources programs under title XXVI of the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2063\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill (suggest page 12, \n     after line 16) insert the following:\n       Sec. . The project for flood control for Petersburg, West \n     Virginia, authorized by section 101(a)(26) of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-640, 104 Stat. \n     4611) is modified to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \n     construct the project at a total cost not to exceed \n     $26,600,000, with an estimated first Federal cost of \n     $19,195,000 and an estimated first non-Federal cost of \n     $7,405,000.\n                           amendment no. 2064\n\n     (Purpose: To limit funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority \n                     Environmental Research Center)\n\n       On page 38, lines 1 and 2, after ``$110,339,000, to remain \n     available until expended'' and insert ``Of the funds \n     appropriated under this heading, not more than $25,000,000 \n     may be expended for the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     Environmental Research Center in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in \n     the event that the Center expends less than $25 million, such \n     amount not expended shall be returned to the U.S. Treasury \n     and the Tennessee Valley Authority appropriation reduced \n     accordingly and the Tennessee Valley Authority shall take \n     steps to obtain funding from other sources so as to reduce \n     appropriated funding in the future and, not later than \n     January 1, 1996, submit to Congress a preliminary plan \n     securing funding from other sources.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the manager's amendment includes an \namendment relating to funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority which \nI authored. I appreciate the willingness of Members concerned with the \nissue to work out an acceptable amendment. This amendment is simple, \nand structured in such a way to gain acceptance from the Senate, \nincluding those from the Tennessee Valley Region. It limits and targets \nfunds for the Tennessee Valley Authority and moves TVA forward on a \npath of becoming less reliant upon appropriated funds.\n  This amendment directs that no more than $25 million of the funds \nappropriated for TVA may be spent for TVA's Environmental Research \nCenter in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The House Energy and Water bill \nzeroes out funding for the Research Center. The Senate Report explains \nthat the Committee restores funding for the Center, but proposes to \nreduce the Center's funds by 22 percent, from its current \nappropriations of $32 million to $25 million. My amendment would \nexplicitly codify the Senate Report language and cap the amount that \nthe Research Center could receive at $25 million. It provides that if \nless than $25 million is expended on the Center, the amount shall be \nreturned to the Treasury and the TVA \n\n[[Page S11096]]\nappropriation reduced accordingly.\n Senate Committee Report recommendations relative to transitioning the \nEnvironmental Research Center to dependence upon funds other than \nappropriated funds for the conduct of its research program. I was \npleased to see that the Committee made such a recommendation, and I am \nmoving forward with this amendment to ensure that the TVA receives \nexplicit legislative direction to achieve such a transition.\n\n  Finally, my amendment adds a new requirement for the Environmental \nResearch Center. Consistent with the mandate to reduce dependence upon \nappropriated funds, the amendment directs TVA to report to Congress a \nplan for achieving a transition away from appropriated funds at the \nEnvironmental Research Center. That report should serve as a baseline \nfor next year's fiscal year 1997 appropriations process and I am \nhopeful that the recommendations will clarify the source and type of \nfunds that support the Environmental Research Center's program, and \nhelp TVA to plan for reductions in appropriated funds.\n  Madam President, I recently met with the Director of the TVA \nEnvironmental Research Center. Ongoing work in poultry litter \nutilization, ozone mitigation, and agricultural pollution prevention \nall are important areas of investigation--and all affect my home State \nof Wisconsin. After my meeting, I did feel that the work in which the \nCenter is engaged is valuable, but it raised two issues to me. First, I \nquestion, given the character of the Center's work, whether this work \nneeds to be done within the regional context, especially if it has \nnational implications. Second, was the question of whether the Center \nhas a proper institutional fit within TVA. Certainly, this Center, \ngiven its capable staff, has the ability to attract and complete \nresearch projects that are reimbursable.\n  Madam President, I understand the role that TVA has played in our \nhistory. I also know that we face an uncertain budget future. I believe \nthat TVA discretionary funds should be on the table, and that the \nfiscal year 1996 funds should be structured and targeted to achieve \nfurther reductions in the future. I believe my amendment is a \nreasonable approach to address these concerns, and makes a logical \ncompromise between the House and Senate approaches. I believe that the \noverall House level of funding for TVA, which amounts to a 25-percent \ncut in the TVA budget is appropriate in these tight budget times and I \nhope the conferees will accept that figure. However, I believe in \nmaking that cut, we should seek to direct an appropriate transition to \nnon-federal funds.\n  The amendment caps the Center's funds at $25 million, making the \nSenate Committee report suggestions hard numbers by codifying them. I \nbelieve that this is an amendment that can be supported by Senators \ninterested in reducing federal spending, including those within the TVA \narea.\n  Madam President, this amendment seeks to move TVA and its various \nprojects closer toward reduced dependence on federal funding. In this \ntime of severe pressure on the federal budget and the need to reduce \nthe federal deficit, it is essential that some programs, like TVA, \nwhich have served an important purpose in the past, begin to transition \naway from reliance on federal funding. This transition should be done \nin a careful, planned manner, but the process toward transition off of \nreliance on federal funding must begin now. This amendment takes us a \nstep further in that direction and I appreciate the support of the \nmanager and interested Senators in reaching an agreement in the \nlanguage of my amendment.\n                  tva's environmental research center\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nreject any amendments that would reduce or eliminate funding for the \nTennessee Valley Authority's Environmental Research Center.\n  TVA's Environmental Research Center was once the Nation's most \neffective laboratory for developing new fertilizer and nutrient \ntechnologies that fueled the legendary gains in food and fiber \nproduction in the United States and around the world. Because of this \nwork, TVA is largely responsible for the tremendous success of U.S. \nagriculture.\n  During the decades TVA conducted its fertilizer and agricultural \nresearch programs, it built a strong base of expertise in chemistry, \nchemical engineering, process engineering, agronomy, and other related \nagricultural and nutritional sciences. Now TVA is capitalizing on this \nexpertise in developing technologies to solve environmental waste \nproblems in the Tennessee Valley as well as across the Nation.\n  Today, TVA's Environmental Research Center is on the threshold of \ndiscovering new ways to prevent or reduce pollution of the air, land, \nand water from agricultural, municipal, and industrial operations. For \nour Nation to achieve agricultural and economic sustainability, we must \nhave innovative technologies to operate our farms, factories, \nutilities, and cities in environmentally acceptable ways.\n  The research and development underway at the Environmental Research \nCenter will help us avoid a crisis in disposing our agriculture, \nmunicipal, and industrial wastes. In fact, some of the Environmental \nResearch Center's technologies are already in use throughout the \ncountry in cleaning up contaminated sites, reducing pollution from \nagricultural, and converting wastes into value-added products.\n  Let me cite a few examples of the impact that the Center's \nenvironmental and waste conversion work is already having across the \ncountry. These will serve as examples of the potential the Center has \nto fulfill the Nation's substantial environmental technology needs in \nthe future:\n\n\n                  Pollution Prevention in Agriculture\n\n  The Environmental Research Center's scientists have already developed \npollution prevention technologies that are being used across the \ncountry. The Center is providing technical assistance in 70 \nagrichemical demonstration projects in 27 States.\n  It is a tribute to the Environmental Research Center's work that 15 \nof the Center's demonstrators have won State and regional awards for \nexcellence in environmental stewardship.\n  A spinoff of the pollution prevention demonstration work with \nagricultural chemical suppliers is the impact that these retailers are \nhaving on farmers. The Center's demonstration sites are providing agri-\ndealers with information that they are using in promoting environmental \nstewardship with their farmer customers. These retailers are providing \nenvironmental services to their customers--services which will go a \nlong way in helping solve the Nation's nonpoint source pollution \nproblem.\n\n\n                        Animal Waste Management\n\n  The technologies developed at the Environmental Research Center offer \npractical solutions to help manage the Nation's animal waste problems. \nThe Center conducts 37 animal waste management projects in 10 States \nincluding high-tech composting for poultry wastes and poultry by-\nproducts. Research at the Center's constructed wetlands complex also \ncontributes to solving severe pollution problems associated with the \npoultry and livestock industries. The animal and meat production\n industries are rapidly growing throughout the Nation to keep up with \nconsumer demands. More than 20 States list poultry and poultry products \nas one of their top four agricultural income generators. But the \ndownside of this $30 billion dollar a year industry is the tremendous \nvolume of poultry litter and other wastes that must be disposed of or \nused in the environmentally acceptable way. The poultry waste issue is \na serious problem for farmers and for the environment. The Center has \nresearch underway to develop technologies to convert poultry litter and \nother wastes into usable products.\n\n  The Center's compost research and development facility will \ndemonstrate innovative ways to use composting of poultry litter as an \nindustrial process. The process will generate products with \ncontrollable properties and designated uses.\n  The Center's researchers are making progress in investigating the use \nof nutrient-enhanced broiler litter as an organic-based plant food for \nturf. And poultry waste by-products are being evaluated as a feed \nsource for ruminant animals and as a substitute in potting mixes for \nhorticultural plants. Poultry litter also has potential for production \nof methane. The Center is exploring \n\n[[Page S11097]]\nthe commercial opportunities in this area.\n  Some cutting-edge research underway at the Center is determining the \npotential of mixing poultry litter with heat-loving microorganisms to \nremediate PCB contaminated soils. This development can benefit many \nregions of the country where cost-effective technologies are needed to \nclean up contaminated soils.\n  The Center has joined forces with USDA, EPA, and the poultry industry \nto establish a poultry water quality consortium. Together, these public \nand private organizations are promoting innovative ways to manage and \nconvert poultry wastes to assure that surface and groundwater quality \nare protected.\n  It is essential that this work continue. The Center has the expertise \nand research facilities to speed the development of needed technologies \nfor animal waste management practices throughout the country.\n                       Environmental Technologies\n\n  There is a national concern over reducing ozone concentrations in \nurban as well as rural areas of the country. America has spent billions \nof dollars on emissions reductions during the past decade. But we still \nhave serious problems. Ninety-six urban areas affecting 63 million \npeople were identified in 1990 as having ground-level ozone problems. \nOzone in the upper atmosphere is good, but at ground level it causes \nrespiratory problems, reduces agricultural crop production, and hinders \nbusiness growth.\n  The southeastern United States is especially susceptible to ozone \nexposure because of the region's warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, \nand high frequency of air stagnation, in addition, to the large \npercentage of forest land.\n  To address this concern, the Center helped establish the southern \noxidants study, a unique partnership of Federal agencies (TVA, EPA, \nNOAA, the National Park Service, NASA, and DOE), universities, \nindustry, and regulatory agencies. The research conducted by this group \nhas significantly improved our understanding of the factors that \ncontrol ozone formation. This public-private partnership is recognized \nas an excellent example of the efficient use of limited Federal \nresources. Research results from the southern oxidants study have \nsignificant application to many other parts of the country.\n  The Center has developed a genetically-engineered microbe that feeds \non PCBs. This is a low cost way to clean up\n PCB-contaminated soils and will save millions of dollars annually in \ncleanup costs. The Center's constructed wetlands research facility is \nshowing how to use this technology for more effective and low-cost \ncleanup of industrial, municipal, and animal wastes.\n\n  The Center is working on an economical way to filter and remove \nindustrial air pollutants from manufacturing plant emissions. For \nexample, the system is removing 99 percent of styrene, and industrial \npollutant, from the emissions of a boat manufacturing facility.\n  The Center is working with the Department of Defense to clean up \nhazardous waste sites on military bases. Many defense sites have \nhazardous materials containing elemental phosphorus. The Center has \nfound a way to clean up this problem economically.\n  Let me briefly highlight additional environmental technologies the \nEnvironmental Research Center is developing to benefit the Nation:\n  The Center is developing methods to predict environmental impacts of \nagricultural practices on nonpoint source pollution on a watershed \nscale.\n  The Center's scientists are seeking ways to use waste materials from \nfossil fuel-fired electricity producing plants in the United States. \nThese fossil fueled plants today generate 120 million tons annually of \ncoal combustion wastes. The Center is making progress in developing \nuses for these wastes, such as in soil amendments, plastics, paint \nfillers, and construction materials. These and other uses for such \nwastes will significantly reduce the amount of coal-combustion wastes \ngoing to landfills or other storage areas.\n  The Center is conducting research to detect, track, and remediate \nwastes and contaminants. These include organics and toxic metals in \nwaste water from industrial, power generation, and municipal \noperations; oily contaminants to surface water (ponds, streams, and \nrivers); organic and inorganic contaminants in soil and groundwater; \nand chemical emissions to the air.\n  The Center's scientists project that 40 percent of the remediation an \nrestoration needs of the Nation can be handled by bioremediation \ntechnologies. These technologies use living organisms to destroy \npollutants such as PCBs; and, these bioremediation technologies are \nmore cost-effective than many of today's cleanup methods. The Center's \nbiotechnical research technologies will help reduce the Nation's cost \nfor hazardous waste remediation and site restoration which is estimated \nto be $1.7 trillion over the next 30 years.\n  Mr. President, and my colleagues in the Senate, TVA's Environmental \nResearch Center is addressing many of the concerns of the Nation in the \nenvironmental and waste management areas. As this chart shows, the \nCenter is involved directly in environmental and waste management \nprojects in 41 States. And the technologies being developed have \nsignificance for all the States, and indeed, the whole world.\n  It makes no sense to cut funding for this effective, problem-solving \nresearch laboratory. Our Nation is at a crossroads. We have the unique \nresponsibility today to manage the fragile balance between sustainable \neconomic development and environmental protection. The Welfare of our \ngeneration and future generations will be affected by what we do today \nand in the early years of the 21st century.\n                           amendment no. 2065\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Army to submit the plan to \n    reduce the number of division offices within the Army Corps of \n   Engineers to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the \n Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the \n                       House of Representatives)\n\n       On page 9, line 24, insert ``(including the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives)'' after ``(Congress''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have a series of amendments that I \nwill offer, en bloc. I might state to the Senate that I think that the \nonly thing left after this is accomplished is the disposition of the \nWellstone amendment. I might say that Senator Wellstone is here \nwaiting. Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota is on his way. He thought we \nhad nothing going until 8:30 because that is what I had announced. But \nhe will be here shortly, and we will discuss the Senator's amendment \nand see what we can work out, if anything, then.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from New Mexico. We can wait and \nsee what we can work out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hutchison has an amendment on Cooper Lake, \nCorps of Engineers; Senators Grams and Wellstone have an amendment on \nMarshall, MI, Corps of Engineers; Senator Warner has an amendment on \nVirginia Beach hurricane protection; Senator Brown has two amendments \non Delaware Basin and Susquehanna River Basin Commissions; Senators \nCraig and Kempthorne have an amendment on Idaho Chemical Processing \nPlant at the Idaho Engineering Laboratory. They have a statement they \nwish to be included following this action. Senators Pressler and \nDaschle have an amendment on Lake Traverse, South Dakota and Minnesota, \nwhich has been cleared on both sides; Senators Dole and Kassebaum have \nan amendment on Arkansas City flood control project; Senator Hatfield \nhas an amendment on Coos Bay.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 2066 through 2075\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I send a group of amendments to the \ndesk and ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered and \nagreed to, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2066 through 2075.\n\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2066 through 2075) were agreed to, en bloc, as \nfollows:\n                           amendment no. 2066\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the donation of land to the Army Corps of \n   Engineers and the United States, the development of a recreation \n          center, and the designation of land for mitigation)\n\n       On page 13 insert the following new section after line 23:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Secretary of the Army is authorized to \n     accept from a non-Federal sponsor an amount of additional \n     lands not to exceed 300 acres which are contiguous to the \n     Cooper Lake and Channels Project, Texas, authorized by the \n     River and Harbor Act of 1965 and the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1986, and which provide habitat value at \n     least equal to that provided by the lands authorized to be \n     redesignated in subsection (b).\n       (b) Upon the completion of subsection (a), the Secretary is \n     further authorized to redesignate an amount of mitigation \n     land not to exceed 300 acres to recreation purposes.\n       (c) The cost of all work to be undertaken pursuant to this \n     section, including but not limited to real estate appraisals, \n     cultural and environmental surveys, and all development \n     necessary to avoid net mitigation losses, to the extent such \n     actions are required, shall be borne by the donating sponsor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2067\n\n       On page 6, after line 11, add: ``; For Marshall, Minnesota, \n     $850,000;''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2068\n\n       On page 6, between line 11 and line 12 insert the \n     following: ``Virginia Beach Erosion Control and Hurricane \n     Protection, Virginia, $1,100,000;''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2069\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for the Delaware River Basin \n                              Commission)\n\n       On page 33, strike line 5 and insert the following: \n     Commission, as authorized by law (75 Stat. 716), $440,000, \n     Provided: that the U.S. Commissioner (Alternate Federal \n     Member) shall not be compensated at a level higher than \n     General Schedule level 15.\n                           amendment no. 2070\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for the Susquehanna River Basin \n                              Commission)\n\n       On page 37, strike line 14 and insert the following: \n     $280,000, Provided: that the U.S. Commissioner (Alternate \n     Federal Member) shall not be compensated at a level higher \n     than General Schedule level 15.\n                           amendment no. 2071\n\n       Page 26, line 16, insert the following before the period: \n     ``: Provided, that within available funds, $4,952,000 is \n     provided for electrical and utility systems upgrade, Idaho \n     Chemical Processing Plant, Idaho National Engineering \n     Laboratory, project number 96-D-463''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I want to thank the bill managers for \nagreeing to my and Senator Kempthorne's amendment that provides $4.9 \nmillion for safety upgrades to the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. I \nstrongly support this proposal, the electrical and utility systems \nupgrade [EUSU] project, that will upgrade the Idaho Chemical Processing \nPlant utility systems.\n  This project will correct high risk environmental, health and life \nsafety deficiencies at the plant. As the Department of Energy has \nstated in their field budget request, ``Correction of these \ndeficiencies will reduce health and safety risks and provide safe and \nreliable utilities to support the ICPP mission.'' These facilities are \noutdated, overloaded and not in compliance with State regulations, DOE \norders or national codes and standards. This project includes upgrades \nto normal and standby power electrical systems, sanitary sewer systems \nand water systems.\n  Madam President, there are spent nuclear fuels stored at the Idaho \nChemical Processing Plant and it is essential they be stored safely. \nMadam President, this amendment will assure that goal is met.\n  I thank the managers.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Craig \nin cosponsoring this amendment.\n  Madam President, this amendment provides funding, as called for in \nthe President's budget request, for electrical and utility upgrades at \nthe Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering \nLaboratory. The funding, $4.9 million, would come from the $1.45 \nbillion provided for the nuclear materials and facilities stabilization \nprogram within the $5.9 billion provided for the Defense Environmental \nRestoration and Waste Management account.\n  This project was previously identified as a safety concern by the \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board. The Idaho Chemical Processing Plant is \none of the facilities at INEL that stores large volumes of highly \nradioactive spent nuclear fuel.\n  According to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board report of \nOctober 12, 1994, ``The electrical systems at ICPP, including CPP-603, \nare outdated and overloaded, and are not in compliance with state \nregulations, DOE orders, National Electric Codes and Standards and IEEE \nStandards.'' This report also states that these problems ``present \npotential health and safety risks during continued operation and \nmaintenance of these systems. Upgrades to these systems are required \nbut have been delayed for many years.''\n  Likewise, the fiscal year 1996 DOE budget submission states \n``Upgrades to the ICPP electrical and utility distribution system are \nessential to: First, provide safe operation of site facilities vital to \nthe ICPP mission, second, provide a safe work place for employees, \nthird, minimize risk of property damage as well as damage to the \nenvironment, and fourth, provide adequate capacity to support the DOE \nmission.''\n  I am sure the chairman and ranking member understand the importance \nof this project and I regret that I did not bring this project to their \nattention sooner. I want to thank Senator Domenici and Senator Johnston \nfor agreeing to accept this amendment.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senators Domenici and Johnston for this \noverall level of funding for the DOE clean up program provided by this \nbill. As the managers of the bill know, this is a very important \nprogram to the States and communities that host DOE facilities. In \nlight of our very difficult budgetary situation, I am pleased by the \nlevel of funding for defense environmental restoration and waste \nmanagement provided by this bill.\n  I want to once again thank the managers of the bill for their help \nand consideration.\n                           amendment no. 2072\n\n (Purpose: To require the Army Corps of Engineers to take such actions \n as are necessary to obtain and maintain a specified elevation in Lake \n                 Traverse, South Dakota and Minnesota)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . WATER LEVEL IN LAKE TRAVERSE, SOUTH DAKOTA AND \n                   MINNESOTA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), notwithstanding \n     any other law, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the \n     Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers and using \n     funds made available under this Act, shall, to the greater \n     extent practicable, take such actions as are necessary to \n     obtain and maintain an elevation of 977 feet above sea level \n     in Lake Traverse, South Dakota and Minnesota.\n       (b) Limitation.--No action taken under subsection (a) shall \n     result in flooding at Mud Lake, South Dakota and Minnesota.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, today I and Senator Daschle are \noffering an amendment to correct a problem in South Dakota that has \nresulted in severe flooding along the shores of Lake Traverse over the \nlast several years. Lake Traverse lies on the far northeast section of \nSouth Dakota and in parts of western Minnesota. In fact, the boundary \nline between South Dakota and Minnesota goes through the middle of the \nlake.\n  Two out of the last three years, Lake Traverse has faced a major \ndisaster due to high water levels. Shorelines were destroyed. Some \nsmall businesses lost money and proprietors were placed in financial \njeopardy. Farmland was damaged and homes, cottages and other structures \nwere damaged or destroyed. And if this is not enough, the environment \nand subsequent erosion wreaked havoc to the local land. Thousands of \ntrees are under water and are dead or dying. Something must be done.\n  According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Congressional approval \nis needed before they can take steps to correct the high water level \nand erosion problems. The Corps is managing the lake with arcane rules \nthat are half a century old. That is unacceptable. My amendment would \ngive the Corps the necessary authority to better manage water release \nat Lake Traverse and control erosion.\n  The amendment would direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the \nneeded authority to obtain and maintain an elevation of 977 feet above \nsea level at Lake Traverse. The amendment also assures that should the \nCorps take action, such action would not result in flooding at Mud \nLake. \n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\n  There is strong public support for this action. I have held two \nmeetings in South Dakota on this issue. At both of these meetings over \n250 citizens were in attendance. Such turnout clearly indicates that \nSouth Dakotans believe something needs to be done. This amendment \nachieves their goal.\n                           amendment no. 2073\n\n        (Purpose: To provide funds for a flood control project)\n\n       On page 5 insert the following between lines 16 and 17: \n     ``Arkansas City flood control project, Kansas, $700,000, \n     except that for the purposes of the project, section 902 of \n     Public Law 99-662 is waived;''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2074\n\n       On page 13, insert the following after line 23:\n       Sec.   .

WATER LEVEL IN LAKE TRAVERSE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), notwithstanding \n     any other law, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the \n     Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers and using \n     funds made available under this Act, shall, to the greatest \n     extent practicable, take such actions as are necessary to \n     obtain and maintain an elevation of 977 feet above sea level \n     in Lake Traverse, South Dakota and Minnesota.\n       (b) Limitation.--No action taken under subsection (a) shall \n     result in flooding at Mud Lake, South Dakota and Minnesota.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, we are down to one amendment on this bill. \nIt seems to me that rather than call everyone back for one vote, if \nthere is a vote on this, we could have that vote tomorrow morning. \nThere is no request for a vote for final passage, as long as we have \none on the conference report-- either one on the bill or one on the \nconference report.\n  If that is satisfactory with the Senator from Minnesota, then I am \nwilling to say--and the managers, of course--that there will be no more \nvotes tonight, but we would have opening statements on DOD \nauthorization yet tonight.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I think that is an excellent idea.\n  I wonder if we could get unanimous consent to close out all other \namendments other than the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to say to the majority leader \nthat anything I can do to accommodate colleagues is fine with me. I am \nhopeful my colleague and I can work this out. It would be fine to have \nthe vote tomorrow morning, if that is what we need.\n  Mr. DOLE. If it is all right with the Democratic whip, who is on the \nfloor, Senator Ford, I announce there are no more votes this evening. \nIf there is a vote required on the Wellstone amendment, maybe 9 o'clock \nin the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not, we might want to make sure, because I do not know what \nSenator Grams' desires are. He may want to amend the amendment. I think \nhe ought to be permitted to do that.\n  The only thing left is your amendment and the possible second-degree \namendment to it, if any.\n  Mr. DOLE. Whatever the disposition is----\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, would the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand the Senator is trying to move this along and \nget Members out. Did we get a unanimous-consent agreement that Senator \nWellstone's amendment would be the only remaining amendment, or a \nsecond-degree to that amendment, that has already been offered?\n  Mr. DOLE. That was in the original list. We could make that request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There were no others allowed anyway, Madam President.\n  Mr. FORD. I wanted to be sure. There will be amendments in the second \ndegree.\n  Mr. DOLE. I make that request, that the Wellstone amendment plus any \nsecond-degree amendments be the only amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the majority leader.\n  One further question: Should the Wellstone amendment be worked out \nand no final passage vote requested, that we could finish this bill \ntonight, and there would not be any left for tomorrow, could that be \nunderstood?\n  Mr. DOLE. That would be understood. Obviously, if we finish tonight \nwithout a vote, I am sure the managers would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Delighted.\n  Mr. FORD. One, no more votes this evening; and two, probably no votes \non this bill tomorrow. We will go to DOD authorization tonight with \nopening statements.\n  Mr. DOLE. In the event there is a vote, we request it be put over \nuntil tomorrow. In the event we complete action without it, obviously \nthat is desired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I just noticed on this list there are \ntwo Senators that I have not formally asked. I believe there will be no \namendment, but we must check with Senator Burns right now and Senator \nSpecter.\n  We have nothing else pending. We have to wait for Senator Grams now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very briefly, I wanted to thank my colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. The managers' amendment includes \nfunding for a flood control project in Marshall, MN, which was flooded \nthree times in 1993.\n  This has been a project that for some time now, is very, very \nimportant to the people in Marshall. I know that the elected leadership \nof the people will be very, very grateful for the action that we have \ntaken.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support. I yield the floor. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11081-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11099-S11101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WELFARE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I take this opportunity to raise \nimportant issues relating to a set of concerns which will be before the \nSenate next week, or perhaps even late this week.\n  I am talking about our responsibility to reform a welfare system, a \nwelfare system which has been a tragic failure. All too frequently, we \nspeak of this tragic failure as if it is a tragic failure in terms of \ndollars and cents. The tragedy of this failure is compounded. It is not \njust dollars and cents, or not even most importantly dollars and cents.\n  The tragedy of this failure is it is a failure in terms of human \nlives, the lives of children, the lives of families. It is a failure \nnot only in terms of a single generation, but it is a failure that \nextends to lives that will exist in the future.\n  I will talk a little bit about that story. I have been talking about \ndifferent stories in the welfare system, and the tragedies, the human \nface of this tragedy, for the last several days.\n  I might point out, you might think these are special cases I have \nsomehow gained access to. The cases which I am addressing are cases \nwhich have appeared in the mainstream media. The first case was \nrecorded in detail in the Chicago Tribune. Yesterday's case was \nreported in detail in the Boston Globe.\n  These cases are cases which have been a part of the mainstream \nreporting. A case which I will talk about today is the story of Rosie \nWatson and her successful 18-year endeavor to get welfare benefits for \nall seven members of her family. This is a story that is a vivid \nillustration of how the system entices people to try to game the \nsystem, even to be industrious in working the system, instead of \nworking in the productive arena of American culture.\n  The Baltimore Sun reported in January that Rosie Watson, her common-\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n  law husband, and their seven children live in Lake Providence, LA, and \nthey receive annually, $46,716 in tax-free income--$46,716 in tax-free \nincome. That is principally from a Federal supplemental security income \npayment.\n  Now, this woman, Ms. Watson, has an addiction to Federal welfare. \nThat addiction began when she was 23 years of age. She started \nreceiving Federal AFDC payment checks for herself and her two small \nchildren.\n  According to the Baltimore Sun, as the number of children in the \nfamily expanded, Ms. Watson soon discovered her family's income could \nbe significantly expanded by switching from ordinary welfare to SSI, \nthe supplemental security income. That is the Federal Government's \nwelfare program that distributes payments to a broad range of \nbeneficiaries that include disabled adults that cannot work and the \nfamilies of children with so-called mental and learning disabilities.\n Since 1974, Ms. Watson has submitted no fewer than 17 applications to \nSocial Security law judges. She submitted these applications on behalf \nof herself and members of her family in an attempt to receive the \nmaximum Federal welfare allotment possible.\n\n  She claimed that she was too stressed out to work, and Ms. Watson was \ncertified to receive Federal welfare benefits because of the \ndisability, because she was too stressed out to work.\n  Her common-law husband likewise was approved to receive welfare \npayments after he successfully argued that he was overweight and his \noverweight condition constituted a physical disability that made him \ntoo heavy to work.\n  Moreover, since there is no limit to the number of times that anyone \ncan ask for assistance, after even being turned down, Ms. Watson simply \ncontinued to file welfare petitions until she eventually secured \npayments of $458 each for all seven of her children.\n  According to a feature in the Baltimore Sun, all of Ms. Watson's \nchildren were ultimately awarded full SSI benefits because they \n``lagged behind in school and scored poorly on psychological tests, \nwhich, under Government rules, translates in a failure to \ndemonstrate''--and this is the term of art we use in the law--``age-\nappropriate behavior.''\n  Madam President, it is no surprise that across the land citizens are \nirate and they derisively refer to these monthly SSI checks that go to \nthese individuals who do not have age-appropriate behavior as ``crazy \nchecks,'' because if the children will act out aggressively, \nirrationally, will perform poorly, they can qualify themselves for $458 \na month.\n  But that is not all. Ms. Watson soon discovered that persistence pays \noff. In the case of our Federal welfare system, it pays off big. In the \ncase of the Watson family, $37,000 in tax-free, retroactive, lump-sum \npayments, because the lump sum was designed by our Federal system to \nsay, ``We probably should have granted you these payments earlier. Here \nis a check or here are checks totaling $37,000 because you have finally \nconvinced us that you are all incapable of functioning.''\n  Madam President, as I mentioned earlier, the issue here is not the \namount of money the Federal bureaucracy is sending to this family every \nmonth. The real issue, the real issue is the toll this cycle of \ndependency collects in terms of human lives. In this case, the real \nissue concerns Ms. Watson's children and the devastating impact that \nthis life style has on their lives.\n  Next to me is a picture of her 16-year-old daughter, Oleaner. She is \nnot encouraged to pursue any of the dreams normal to a 16-year-old \nchild. She is not doing well in school, in sports, or any extra \ncurricula activity. It seems that her main use to her mother is the \ncheck that she ensures will show up in the mailbox every month. At 13 \nyears of age, she was officially classified as unfit to work or to \nstudy or to do anything but collect checks.\n  Oleaner has become ensnared in a system which her mother manipulates \nfor financial gain at the expense of her children's futures. She brings \nthe family $458 per month and is paid $20 a month in allowance because \nof it. In order to qualify for these benefits, the children have \nforsaken their educations, their dreams, their futures, all sacrificed \nto the monthly check in the mailbox, which in a very strange way \nbecomes their representation of what they are worth. They are worth \nsomething in terms of welfare.\n  According to the principal of the children's former elementary \nschool, the abuse of these ``crazy checks'' is very widespread. Mr. \nWillie Lee Bell receives a questionnaire from the Social Security \nAdministration--he is the principal--every time a student applies for \nbenefits. He estimates that half of the students have applied for the \nbenefits. He believes that many of these students are encouraged or \neven coached by their parents in a manner that makes them eligible to \nreceive the so-called ``crazy checks.'' The children, he says, do not \nwant to fail. They are just doing what mama wants.\n  Mrs. Watson's youngest son, George, was suspected of having been so \ncoached. In 1991, the authorities alleged that he was not trying up to \nthe best of his ability on the IQ tests. Ms. Watson denies the charge, \nsaying she has never told any of her children to act crazy in order to \nget some money.\n  The effect on school performance is clear. Children must be \ndisruptive, they must be noisy, they must be slow. If not, their checks \nwill cease.\n  According to the Baltimore Sun, the message for this family and the \nmessage sent by this system is that it is not education that will \nprovide advancement, it is not achievement, but it is disruption. \nGovernment assistance checks follow this kind of counterproductive \nbehavior.\n  The message to her son George from Mrs. Watson is clearly evident by \na dispute last year in school. George's school books were taken from \nhis locker. The principal told him he had to pay for them. Ms. Watson \nrefused to pay. George then flunked all of his courses. George then \nwould have to repeat the seventh grade, and Ms. Watson bragged about \nthe additional year as a result and the ability to collect these kinds \nof payments.\n  Madam President, we are now days away from the welfare debate. There \nis a near unanimous consensus from Republicans that the tragedy of \ncases like these demands immediate reform. SSI must be reformed. But \nfrom President Clinton and from those on the other side of the aisle, \nwe hear: No proposal. There is silence. It is a silence which is \ndeafening.\n  The people of America have sent us to this Chamber to change the way \nbusiness is done.\n  Madam President, silence and apathy are the twin evils that have \nallowed this Washington-based, Washington-knows-all system to stifle \nthe poor, that have ensnared the poor. The answer from the Democrats is \nmore spending, more bureaucracy, more rhetoric, less reform, and on \nthis point, silence.\n  We cannot accept reforms that are little more than half measures \ndesigned to make the American people think they have done something \nabout welfare. We have been down that road before.\n  In 1988 we passed a so-called revolutionary welfare bill that did two \nthings. First, it ensnared more people in the web of dependency. \nSecond, it increased the costs of welfare. You can see this on the two \ncharts that are here behind me, a major welfare reform in 1988 and see \nthe spike in the costs.\n  Here is a percentage chart showing the number of children, or the \npercentage of children in poverty in our country. Notice that the war \non poverty began in the 1960's. We had a relatively low figure. But as \nwe have waged our so-called war on poverty, we found out we were waging \nwar on the future of our children, as larger and larger numbers of our \nchildren found their way into the despair of poverty, ensnared by a \nwelfare system which captured them rather than liberated them.\n  It is time for us to reform a system which has sought, perhaps, noble \nobjectives. But it has elicited the worst of behavior.\n  It is time, Madam President, for us to do real reform. No \nrearrangement of the deck chairs on the welfare Titanic will save us. \nWe have to repudiate the current system. We have to institute reforms. \nWe have to capitalize on the ingenuity and creativity and capacity of \nState and local governments, even governments like the District of \nColumbia which are addressing the \n\n[[Page S11101]]\ncentral problems of the absence of family and the absence of work in \nthe welfare system.\n  They know that Government cannot solve this problem, cannot solve it \nalone, cannot solve it just with more money. The more money we have \nspent, the greater the problem has grown.\n  The real cost in this entire operation is not just a cost in terms of \nfinancial resources. It has been a cost in lost lives. It has been from \nthose who have sought to use their families, to abuse the system. It \nhas been a cost of the future of children, and it will be the cost of \nthe future of America if we do not correct this.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11099-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11101-S11105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my custom on every appropriations \nbill, whether I am the floor manager or not, to state succinctly as I \ncan how it relates to the budget resolution and do some accounting for \nanybody that is interested in how the bill stacks up versus the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss the budget \nimpact of this bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  By CBO's scoring, this bill provides $20.2 billion in new budget \nauthority and $12 billion in new outlays for the Department of Energy, \nthe Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and for other \nselected independent agencies. With outlays from prior-year budget \nauthority and other completed actions, the Senate bill is within the \nsubcommittee's section 602(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, this year's budget resolution established separate \nbinding caps on defense and nondefense funding. This bill contains both \ndefense and nondefense funding and must meet separate allocations.\n  According to CBO, the Senate-reported bill is within the allocation \nof budget authority and outlays for the defense and nondefense funding \nin this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask, unanimous consent that a table printed in the \nRecord comparing the Senate-reported bill's budget authority and outlay \nlevels to the subcommittee's section 602(b) allocation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  ENERGY AND WATER SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL  \n                 [Fiscal year 1996, dollars in millions]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget               \n                                                 authority     Outlays  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY                                      \n                                                                        \nOutlays from prior-year BA and other actions                            \n completed....................................  ...........        4,039\nH.R. 1905, as reported to the Senate..........       11,446        6,868\nScorekeeping adjustment.......................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n    Subtotal defense discretionary............       11,446       10,907\n                                               =========================\n           NONDEFENSE DISCRETIONARY                                     \n                                                                        \nOutlays from prior-year BA and other actions                            \n completed....................................  ...........        4,171\nH.R. 1905, as reported to the Senate..........        8,716        5,100\nScorekeeping adjustment.......................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n    Subtotal defense discretionary............        8,716        9,271\n                                               =========================\n                   MANDATORY                                            \n                                                                        \nOutlays from prior-year BA and other actions                            \n completed....................................  ...........  ...........\nH.R. 1905, as reported to the Senate..........  ...........  ...........\nAdjustment to conform mandatory programs with                           \n Budget Resolution assumptions................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory........................  ...........  ...........\n                                               =========================\n        Adjusted bill total...................       20,162       20,178\n                                               =========================\n     SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE 602(b) ALLOCATION                              \n                                                                        \nDefense discretionary.........................       11,447       10,944\nNondefense discretionary......................        8,733        9,272\nViolent crime reduction trust fund............  ...........  ...........\nMandatory.....................................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total allocation..........................       20,180       20,216\n                                               =========================\n    ADJUSTED BILL TOTAL COMPARED TO SENATE                              \n        SUBCOMMITTEE 602(b) ALLOCATION                                  \n                                                                        \nDefense discretionary.........................           -1          -37\nNondefense discretionary......................          -17           -1\nViolent crime reduction trust fund............

Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the funding \ncontained in the bill under general investigations for Susquehanna \nRiver Basin water management.\n  First, I want to thank the chairman for including $290,000--the full \namount requested in fiscal year 1996--for the Army Corps of Engineers \nto continue the reconnaissance study investigation of the Susquehanna \nRiver Basin that was initiated last year. The Susquehanna River is the \nlargest river on the east coast of the United States and the largest \ntributary of the Chesapeake Bay. It is also one of the most flood prone \nriver basins in the Nation. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 \nreservoirs on the upper Susquehanna and regulates the low and high \nwater flow management. There are also three large hydroelectric \nprojects on the lower Susquehanna. Under normal conditions, these \nreservoirs and dams serve as traps for the harmful sediments which flow \ninto the river. During major storms however, they suddenly discharge \ntremendous amounts of built-up sediments, severely degrading the water \nquality of the Chesapeake Bay, destroying valuable habitat and killing \nfish and other living resources. Scientists estimate that Tropical \nStorm Agnes in 1982 aged the bay by more than a decade in a matter of \ndays because of the slug of sediments discharged from the Susquehanna \nRiver reservoirs. There is a real danger that another major storm in \nthe basin could scour the sediment that has been accumulating behind \nthese dams and present a major setback to our efforts to clean up the \nbay.\n  It was my understanding that it was the committee's intent in funding \nthe reconnaissance study of the Susquehanna River Basin last year and \nagain this year, that the corps was to investigate not only \nalternatives for managing water storage during high and low flow \nconditions and flood damage reduction needs in the basin, but also to \naddress sediment related issues for the study area. Is this correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Maryland is correct. It is the \ncommittee's intent that the Corps of Engineers conduct a basin-wide \nsedimentation assessment as part of this study, including a complete \nevaluation of potential sediment management strategies to reduce the \nimpact on Chesapeake Bay.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate these assurances and thank the chairman \nfor his support.\n           Committee Amendment beginning on page 12, line 17\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the bill, I have two \nhousekeeping measures that I would like to get behind us now.\n  On page 12, starting at lines 17, section 102, continuing through \npage 13 until section 103, I ask unanimous consent that that committee \namendment be tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Excepted Committee Amendment beginning on page 38, line 19\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on page 38 of the bill, lines 19 through \n25, that committee amendment remains not adopted because we just did \nnot ask that it be adopted. At this point, I ask unanimous consent that \ncommittee amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment has been agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. That is our error.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. As we consider the fiscal year 1996 energy and \nwater development appropriations bill, I would like to express my great \nconcern about the decision by the Senate to reduce funding for high-\nenergy physics research by $20 million for a total of $657 million. \nThis funding cut will impact the operating budgets of Fermi National \nAccelerator Laboratory in my State of Illinois, the Stanford Linear \nAccelerator Center in California, and the Brookhaven National \nLaboratory in New York.\n  I am aware that the deficit-driven decisions this Congress must make \nwill have a real impact on Federal energy priorities. I also appreciate \nthe support the committee has provided for high-energy physics \nresearch, and for Femilab, in previous years. Physicists commit decades \nof their lives, and, in many instances, their entire careers to \n\n[[Page S11102]]\nlong-term Government-sponsored research projects. And that means it is \ncritical that the Government also remain committed to orderly, stable \nresearch priorities.\n  This Federal commitment, however, can be jeopardized by insufficient \nfunding for the base budgets of the high-energy physics laboratories, \ncrating situations where research is pared back, trained personnel are \nlost from the field, and future productivity is endangered by \ndiscouraging students from these professions.\n  This is the situation faced by Fermilab. Budget cuts in previous \nyears have led to the loss of approximately 300 people at Fermilab. And \nonce again, the budget cuts proposed by the Senate will require further \nstaff reductions at Fermilab.\n  I greatly appreciate the decision by the committee to provide $52 \nmillion to continue the construction of the main injector. The main \ninjector will increase the power of the particle accelerator at \nFermilab by a factor of 5. Given that Fermilab was the site of one of \nthe most significant discoveries in modern physics--the discovery of \nthe subatomic particle known as the top quark--ensuring that the main \ninjector comes on line as quickly as possible will help us learn more \nabout the top quark and other critically important high-energy physics \nissues.\n  Unfortunately, the leaps in knowledge promised by the main injector \nwill be adversely countered by the cuts in the operating budget as \nproposed by the Senate, and that means less people who can use \nFermilab, and more delays in carrying out our research priorities.\n  The United States has great potential to lead the world in high-\nenergy physics--our community of scientists, facilities, and \npartnerships built up over the last 40 years is one of our Government's \ngreatest achievements. In order to exploit these superb resources and \nthe new major upgrades underway at these three national laboratories, \nhowever, increased base program funding is crucial.\n  Therefore, during conference of this bill, I strongly urge that $20 \nmillion be restored to the high-energy physics budget, bringing the \ntotal funding to $677 million, and ensuring that the high-energy \nphysics field in the United States remains strong in the years ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Illinois for her comments \nregarding Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the high-energy \nphysics budget. The committee has provided substantial funding for this \nbudget in previous years, but given the budget constraint that the \ncommittee was forced to confront, we were simply unable to include \nthese funds. I can assure the distinguished Senator that we will look \nfavorable upon her request in conference and do all that we can to \nassist her in including her recommendation.\n                     mccook reservoir construction\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to call attention to \nlanguage in the committee report to this bill that would jeopardize the \ncommencement of construction on a very important flood control project \nin my State of Illinois, the McCook and Thornton Reservoir project.\n  The McCook and Thornton Reservoir project is an integral part of the \nunderground tunnel system of the Chicago underflow plan [CUP] designed \nto control major flooding problems in Chicago and surrounding \ncommunities. Once construction in complete, the reservoirs will protect \nover 500,000 homes and over 3 million people, helping to protect an \nextremely vulnerable area which sustains over $150 million in damages \nevery year from floods. The project has been strongly supported over \nthe years by the Appropriations Committees of both Chambers of Congress \nand by the Illinois delegation.\n  The McCook and Thorton Reservoir project is fully authorized. Its \ndesign memorandum is based upon a plan that was carefully crafted by \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and, most importantly, with the full \ninput of the current landowner. Every effort was made to accommodate \nthe interests of all parties involved in the project. Due to \ncomplexities associated with the negotiations for the acquisition of \nthe project land, construction on the McCook and Thornton Reservoirs \nhave been greatly delayed. However, these negotiations are making \nsubstantial progress, and are nearing closure.\n  That is why I am greatly concerned by the committee report language \nwhich unfairly questions the 1986 design memorandum that was the basis \nfor the project authorization. The committee report language also \ndirects the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue their assessment \nof other siting options for the project.\n  If the committee report language is allowed to stand, the baseless \nquestions about the authorization will continue, construction will be \nfurther delayed, and the project will wither and die.\n  Chicago desperately needs these flood control reservoirs to come \nonline. In 1993, severe thunderstorms caused massive flooding southeast \nof Chicago. The capacity of the existing underground flood control \nsystem was only able to hold 1.5 billion of the 45 billion gallons of \nrainfall before being overwhelmed. The resulting excess floodwaters \ncaused severe disruptions of major traffic thoroughfares, including the \nclosing of Interstate 55, and the Dan Ryan and Stevenson expressways. \nRainwater and raw sewage backed up into the basements of half a million \nhomes, creating serious public health problems. The McCook and Thornton \nReservoirs, had they been complete, would have provided more than \nenough capacity to contain those excess waters, and would have \nprevented these types of disasters from occurring.\n  This project must be allowed to move forward without further delay. I \nurge the Chairman's assistance in clarifying the committee's intent \nregarding this project. I also ask that the committee include language \nin the committee report which directs the key parties to complete \nnegotiations for the acquisition of the McCook Reservoir immediately, \nand to direct the corps to proceed to construction with the project as \nauthorized, notwithstanding the language in the committee report. In \naddition, if further funding beyond the prior appropriated dollars is \nneeded to advance the project in fiscal year 1996, then the corps would \nhave the authority to reprogram funds to the project.\n  Mr. SIMON. I want to join my colleague from Illinois in her request. \nThe McCook Reservoir project is the linchpin to the successful flood \nprotection and water pollution control efforts we have developed in the \nChicago area. Unless this project is allowed to proceed with the \nfunding Congress has provided, the Chicago metropolitan area will \nremain vulnerable to floods and significant threats to health and \nsafety.\n  I urgently request the assistance of the chairman in including the \nconference report language referred to by Senator Moseley-Braun to \ncomplete negotiations for land for the project immediately, and to \ndirect the corps to proceed with the authorized project notwithstanding \nthe committee report language. Her assistance in including this and the \nreprogramming language is critical to the protection of the Chicago \narea, and I thank her for her efforts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Rod Grams is about \nready to come and help us complete this measure.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. FORD. I know he is doing everything he can. But any Senator who \nhas been on his way now for about 40 minutes--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is here, and he is going to be ready quickly.\n  Mr. FORD. We are holding a lot of things up, and I know the Senator \nfrom New Mexico wants to get through the bill and get it behind us so \nwe can move on to the defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am fully aware of that, and we are keeping the Senate \nopen. But Senator Grams is very desirous that I give him another 5 \nminutes, and I am going to accommodate him. He is in the Cloakroom. He \nwill be out shortly, and then we can complete this matter.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2076\n\n     (Purpose: To establish interim water levels for certain lakes)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2076.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WATER LEVELS IN RAINY LAKE AND NAMAKAN LAKE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Rainy Lake and Namakan Reservoir Water Level \n     International Steering Committee conducted a 2-year analysis \n     in which public comments on the water levels in Rainy Lake \n     and Namakan Lake revealed significant problems with the \n     current regulation of water levels and resulted in Steering \n     Committee recommendations in November 1993; and\n       (2) maintaining water levels closer to those recommended by \n     the Steering Committee will help ensure the enhancement of \n     water quality, fish and wildlife, and recreational resources \n     in Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Existing rule curve.--The term ``existing rule curve'' \n     means each of the rule curves promulgated by the \n     International Joint Commission to regulate water levels in \n     Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake in effect as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Proposed rule curve.--The term ``proposed rule curve'' \n     means each of the rule curves recommended by the Rainy Lake \n     and Namakan Reservoir International Steering Committee for \n     regulation of water levels in Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake in \n     the publication entitled ``Final Report and Recommendations'' \n     published in November 1993.\n       (c) Water Levels.--The dams at International Falls and \n     Kettle Falls, Minnesota, in Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake, \n     respectively, shall be operated so as to maintain water \n     levels as follows:\n       (1) Coincident rule curves.--In each instance in which an \n     existing rule curve coincides with a proposed rule curve, the \n     water level shall be maintained within the range of such \n     coincidence.\n       (2) Noncoincident rule curves.--In each instance in which \n     an existing rule curve does not coincide with a proposed rule \n     curve, the water level shall be maintained at the limit of \n     the existing rule curve that is closest to the proposed rule \n     curve.\n       (d) Enforcement.--\n       (1) In general.--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     shall enforce this section as though the provisions were \n     included in the license issued by the Commission on December \n     31, 1987, for Commission Project No. 5223-001.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to require the Commission to alter the license for \n     Commission Project No. 5223-001 in any way.\n       (e) Sunset.--This section shall remain in effect until the \n     International Joint Commission review of and decision on the \n     Steering Committee's recommendations are completed.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be brief. We have been waiting \nfor some time. I think this amendment is acceptable to both sides. I \nthank my colleagues for their support.\n  This amendment deals with really a critical problem of water levels \nin the Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake. It is a hugely important issue to \nmy State, especially to northern Minnesota.\n  The problem has been that the water level has been too low in the \nspring which, in turn, has created problems with spawning of fish and \nother wildlife habitat, but it also has been a problem for anglers. It \nhas been a problem for recreation. It has been a problem for our resort \nowners.\n  So what this amendment does is it takes the water curve rule and it \njust essentially says this is an agreement that ultimately has to be \nworked out, I say to my colleague from New Mexico and my colleague from \nMinnesota, with the Canadians, with the IJC, the International Joint \nCommission. But in the meantime, within the existing rule structure, \nwhat we say to FERC is to implement this in such a way within the \nexisting rules that we require that the water level in these lakes be \non the upper level of the curve in the spring.\n  This is hugely important to my State of Minnesota. I will just list \nsome of the beneficiaries. Above and beyond fish and wildlife and the \npark ecosystem, the sportfishing industry, the resort industry, the \nlocal economy; this amendment has the support of the International \nSteering Committee on Rainy Lake and Namakan Reservoir, the Citizens' \nCouncil on Voyageurs National Park, the Ash River Sportfishing \nAssociation, the Rainy Lake Sportfishing Association, and numerous \nother resorts, recreational, and business interests.\n  The amendment will not affect the IJC's current regulations. We \ncannot do that by law, nor are we trying to. This is an interim \nmeasure. It will not increase the flood risk. It will protect fish \nspawning grounds. It will improve dock access and decrease dock damage, \nalso extremely important to people in my State. It will protect the \npark ecosystem and it will help save the local economy an estimated \n$800,000 a year in lost business due to low water levels at the \nbeginning of the fishing season.\n  So it has taken some time for us to work this out, but this is an \namendment that I am really proud to bring to the Senate. I believe I \nhave the support of colleagues. I know it is extremely important to the \nInternational Falls community and really northeastern Minnesota.\n  I will say, since northeastern Minnesota is so important to \nMinnesota, it is very important to Minnesota.\n  I know that my colleague from Minnesota, whom I believe now is going \nto be supporting this, wants to speak on this as well.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota, and then I think I \nwill follow up with concluding remarks. I believe the amendment will be \nacceptable to both sides.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \namendment.\n  Clearly, there is a problem with the disputed water levels. It is a \nproblem that deserves a solution--one that is well thought out and \nfinal.\n  Today, my colleague from Minnesota has offered his proposal. And I am \nprepared to support it--not as a solution to the problems facing the \npeople of northern Minnesota, but as a message that we will not let \nthese problems go unresolved.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment, while sending a message, does not \nnecessarily pass the test of being a good solution. Hastily prepared \nideas rarely do.\n  It should come as no surprise that this amendment has a number of \nproblems and could have some unforeseen consequences of which we're not \naware today. And the Senate needs to be aware of that.\n  There is an orderly and regular process by a joint United States-\nCanadian commission to address this very matter--the International \nJoint Commission.\n  That process is already underway. It will result in water level \ndecisions based on scientific analysis.\n  Tonight the Senator's amendment would prejudge the outcome of that \nprocess.\n  It would put into effect a subcommittee report to the full \ninternational committee before the full committee has a chance to \nconsider the report and make a final decision.\n  We simply do not know what impact the subcommittee recommendation \nwould have on fish, wildlife, and the environment.\n  The amendment also does a very curious thing: It would require the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to enforce the international joint \ncommission subcommittee's water recommendations on dams and water \nimpoundments over which the FERC does not now have jurisdiction.\n  What we are doing here is codifying a decision by a subcommittee of a \nUnited States-Canadian body, the international joint commission with \nvirtually no input from the Canadian side.\n  But today, we will adopt this amendment--without adequate notice, \nwithout proper consultation. Because what we are giving the people of \nMinnesota is a message: and that is the Senate urges the IJC to act \nquickly to resolve this issue. The people of Minnesota deserve a \nsolution, not just a message. But a message is what we are giving them \ntonight.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague for his efforts and support. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is agreement. We will not go on \nwith the debate.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is not a hastily prepared idea. The \nsteering committee spent 2 years and had lots of public comments before \nthey reached their recommendations. \n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\n  This is not a solution, it is an interim solution. We wait for the \nIJC to make final ruling. We cannot wait in the meantime. We have this \nproblem to deal with now. This does not prejudice any final outcome. It \nis just a way of fixing a very important problem now.\n  There is no reason to go on with the debate. I am proud to have the \nsupport. I hope that we can voice vote this tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank both Senators for working this \namendment out. Obviously, we have no objection on our side, and I \nunderstand Senator Johnston has no objection on his side. With that, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2076) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank both Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the energy and water appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1996, despite some progress particularly on water \nreclamation projects, represents a serious setback for environmental \npreservation.\n  In addition, the committee, in my view, has strayed outside its \njurisdiction in directing the Secretary of the Army to develop a plan \nto consolidate the division offices of the Corps of Engineers. That \nissue is properly left with the authorizing committee, in this case the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  I appreciate the committee accepting an amendment by me and Senator \nMax Baucus, chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nthat specifies that the report on division consolidation shall be sent \nto the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve. \nI believe it is important that divisions which have a large workload \nand critical emergency response duties, such as the South Pacific \nDivision in San Francisco, should be located in close proximity to the \nwork requirements. The Environment and Public Works Committee will have \na chance to consider the corps consolidation plan before implementation \nbegins in August 1996.\n  Included in the House-passed bill, but omitted from the Senate \nAppropriations Committee version, were funds for the Spring Run \nRestoration Programs, the Coho Salmon Restoration Programs, the Winter \nRun Chinook Salmon Captive Breedstock Program, and certain fish \nscreening programs and habitat acquisition programs. These represent \nsolid investments in the health of the Pacific Salmon fishery.\n  I sincerely hope that the Senate conferees give these particular \nHouse-passed provisions careful consideration when they go to \nconference with the House.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes $11,367,000 for construction of \nthe Los Angeles County Drainage Area, an important flood control \nimprovement project that will restore an adequate level of flood \nprotection to one of the more densely populated areas of the country. \nWithout flood control improvements, the corps estimates that a 100-year \nflood event could inundate as much as 82 square miles of Los Angeles \nCounty, affecting more than 500,000 residents in 11 cities.\n  I appreciate Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, \nJohn Zirschky, meeting with me personally about the project and hearing \nmy concerns about the environmental impact of this project. Several \nenvironmental groups in Los Angeles County had raised concerns about \nthe effect both visually and environmentally of constructing parapet \nwalls along the top of the levees in place now and questioned whether \nthe corps had fully explored nonstructural alternatives.\n  I understand because of the urgent need to move on this project that \nwe could not afford to halt construction until such alternatives had \nbeen assessed. Therefore, I agreed to support the project after \nobtaining the corps support to pursue a feasibility study of the whole \nLos Angeles Basin watershed. Although some of the cities in the \nfloodplain recently refused to participate in a community task force to \nlook at project modifications while initial construction was under way, \nSecretary Zirschky has assured me that the corps will seek the county's \ncooperation in a 3-year feasibility study for ways to improve the river \nwatershed including a review and possible modifications of the river's \nflood control improvements.\n  Even without a formal task force, the Secretary is willing to work \nwith the county, affected cities, and the environmental groups to \nrecommend ways to restore the natural ecosystem, improve stormwater \nmanagement, and enhance water conservation and supply, and recreational \nopportunities. It is my hope that this study will serve as a \nspringboard to greater cooperation among the affected cities, the \ncountry, the corps, and the environmental community.\n  Secretary Zirschky should be commended for working with Los Angeles \nCounty in the flood control project cooperation agreement to require \nthe county to manage stormwater runoff to avoid any need for future \nexpansion of the flood control project.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Zirschky's July 21, 1995, \nletter to me about this project be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am pleased to inform you that I \n     recently sent to Congress a recommendation for construction \n     of the flood damage reduction project for the Los Angeles \n     County Drainage Area. My recommendation completes the \n     authorization required by Section 101(b) of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1990. A copy of my letter to \n     Congress and a press release on the project are enclosed.\n       In approving this project, I have required that the non-\n     Federal sponsor manage future stormwater runoff so that the \n     authorized level of flood protection is not diminished. In \n     addition, we have agreed to seek a non-Federal sponsor and \n     initiate a multi-objective feasibility study of the entire \n     Los Angeles River Watershed. This study will focus on \n     restoring the natural ecosystem along the river and \n     throughout the watershed, as well as providing opportunities \n     to improve stormwater management, water conservation and \n     water quality, recreation and the aesthetics in the watershed \n     area. The study could also result in further modifications to \n     the recently authorized project. In conducting this study, we \n     are committed to working with other Federal agencies--State \n     and local governments, as well as other non-governmental \n     environmental organizations. The study will be initiated with \n     available funds and will not delay construction of the \n     Drainage Area project.\n       I look forward to working with you in bringing this much \n     needed project to completion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John H. Zirschky,\n                                        Acting Assistant Secretary\n                                        of the Army (Civil Works).\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Am I correct in my understanding that the energy and \nwater development appropriations bill, as reported from the \nAppropriations Committee, includes an increase of over $140,000,000 for \nthe Department of Energy's stockpile management program?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My colleague from South Carolina, the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, is correct. As reported by the \nAppropriations Committee, the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 1996 includes a $143,800,000 \nincrease over the budget request for stockpile management.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I strongly support the increase in stockpile \nmanagement provided by the committee. There is a clear need for the \nDepartment to ensure that its capabilities that currently reside at the \nY-12 plant at Oak Ridge, TN; the Kansas City plant in Kansas City, MO; \nthe Pantex plant in Texas; and the Savannah River site in South \nCarolina, are modernized to meet the requirements of the enduring \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his support for stockpile management and the additional \nfunds \n\n[[Page S11105]]\nnecessary to make needed investments in the Department of Energy's \nproduction sites such as the Y-12 plant. We certainly expect the \nDepartment will make additional investments in the production \nfacilities to ensure those facilities meet future requirements.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the facilities funded by the Department of \nEnergy's stockpile management program represent essential elements in \nthe continuing DOE complex. By simply having the know-how at hand, we \ncannot guarantee the proper management of the stockpile over the long \nterm; we must also maintain the capabilities that exist in the \nfacilities that produced components of the enduring stockpile.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I also strongly support the increase \nin stockpile management provided by the committee. I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues to speak to the importance of maintaining a safe and \nreliable U.S. nuclear deterrent, and in particular, the need to make \nthe necessary and cost-effective investments in nuclear weapons \nstockpile activities. The Pantex plant, along with Savannah River, Y-\n12, and Kansas City plant, is one of the few remaining production sites \nwith existing infrastructure and capabilities that can meet the \nnational security needs identified in the Department of Defense's \nnuclear posture review.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready for third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall the bill pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 1905), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendments and request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes thereon and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gorton, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nKerrey, and Mrs. Murray conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to proceed to wrap up the \nSenate at the request of the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11101-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  Executive Order No. 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all \nproperty and interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including \nthe Central Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United \nStates or within the possession or control of a U.S. person. That order \nalso prohibited the importation into the United States of goods and \nservices of Iraqi origin as well as the exportation of goods, services, \nand technology from the United States to Iraq. The order prohibited \ntravel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the performance of any \ncontract in support of any industrial, commercial, or governmental \nproject in Iraq. United States persons were also prohibited from \ngranting or extending credit or loans to the Government of Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order No. 12724, which was issued in order to align the \nsanctions imposed by the United States with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  Executive Order No. 12817 was issued on October 21, 1992, to \nimplement in the United States measures adopted in United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 778 of October 2, 1992. Resolution 778 \nrequires U.N. Member States to transfer to a U.N. escrow account any \nfunds (up to $200 million apiece) representing Iraqi-oil sale proceeds \npaid by purchasers after the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Iraq, to \nfinance Iraq's obligations for U.N. activities with respect to Iraq, \nsuch as expenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction, and to provide \nhumanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis. A portion of \nthe escrowed funds also funds the activities of the U.N. Compensation \nCommission in Geneva, which handles claims from victims of the Iraqi \ninvasion and occupation of Kuwait. Member States also may make \nvoluntary contributions to the account. The funds placed in the escrow \naccount are to be returned, with interest, to the Member States that \ntransferred them to the United Nations, as funds are received from \nfuture sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the U.N. Security Council. No \nMember State is required to fund more than half of the total transfers \nor contributions to the escrow account.\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders Nos. 12724 and 12817 (the \n``Executive orders''). The report covers events from February 2, 1995, \nthrough August 1, 1995.\n  1. During the reporting period, there were no amendments to the Iraqi \nSanctions Regulations.\n  2. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(``FAC'') continues its involvement in lawsuits seeking to prevent the \nunauthorized transfer of blocked Iraqi assets. In Consarc Corporation \nv. Iraqi-ministry of Industry and Minerals, a briefing schedule has \nbeen set for disposition of FAC's December 16, 1994, appeal of the \ndistrict court's order of October 17, 1994, transferring blocked \nproperty.\n  Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions continue \nto be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. There are \ncurrently 43 enforcement actions pending, including nine cases referred \nby FAC to the U.S. Customs Service for joint investigation. Additional \nFAC civil penalty notices were prepared during the reporting period for \nviolations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Iraqi \nSanction Regulations with respect to transactions involving Iraq. Three \npenalties totaling $8,905 were collected from two banks for \n\n[[Page S11106]]\nfunds transfers in violation of the prohibitions against transactions \ninvolving Iraq.\n  3. Investigation also continues into the roles played by various \nindividuals and firms outside Iraq in the Iraqi government procurement \nnetwork. These investigations may lead to additions to FAC's listing of \nindividuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated \nNationals (``SDNs'') of the Government of Iraq.\n  4. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 12817 implementing United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 778, on October 26, 1992, FAC directed the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York to establish a blocked account for \nreceipt of certain post-August 6, 1990, Iraq-oil sales proceeds, and to \nhold, invest, and transfer these funds as required by the Order. On \nMarch 21, 1995, following payments by the Governments of Canada \n($1,780,749.14), the European Community ($399,695.21), \nKuwait ($2,500,000.00), Norway ($261,758.10), and Switzerland \n($40,000.00), respectively, to the special United Nations-controlled \naccount, entitled ``United Nations Security Council Resolution 778 \nEscrow Account,'' the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was directed to \ntransfer a corresponding amount of $4,982,202.45 from the blocked \naccount it holds to the United Nations-controlled account. Similarly, \non April 5, 1995, following the payment of $5,846,238.99 by the \nEuropean Community, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was directed \nto transfer a corresponding amount of $5,846,238.99 to the United \nNations-controlled account. Again, on May 23, 1995, following the \npayment of $3,337,941.75 by the European Community, $571,428.00 by the \nGovernment of the Netherlands and $1,200,519.05 by the Government of \nthe United Kingdom,\n the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was directed to transfer a \ncorresponding amount of $5,109,888.80 to the United Nations--controlled \naccount. Finally, on June 19, 1995, following the payment of \n$915,584.96 by the European Community and $736,923.12 by the Government \nof the United Kingdom, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was \ndirected to transfer a corresponding amount of $1,652,508.08 to the \nUnited Nations--controlled account. Cumulative transfers from the \nblocked Federal Reserve Bank of New York account since issuance of \nExecutive Order No. 12817 have amounted to $175,133,026.20 of the up to \n$200 million that the United States is obligated to match from blocked \nIraqi oil payments, pursuant to United Nations Security Council \nResolution 778.\n\n  5. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a total of 590 \nspecific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi \nassets since August 1990. Licenses have been issued for transactions \nsuch as the filing of legal actions against Iraqi governmental \nentities, legal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of \ndonated medicine, medical supplies, food intended for humanitarian \nrelief purposes, the execution of powers of attorney relating to the \nadministration of personal assets and decedents' estates in Iraq, the \nprotection of preexistent intellectual property rights in Iraq and \ntravel to Iraq for the purposes of visiting Americans detained there. \nSince my last report, 57 specific licenses have been issued.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6 month \nperiod from February 2, 1995, through August 1, 1995, which are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nIraq are reported to be about $4.9 million, most of which represents \nwage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Treasury (particularly in \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the \nOffice of the Under Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the \nGeneral Counsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of \nEconomic and Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the \nBureau of International Organization Affairs, the Bureau of Political-\nMilitary Affairs, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and the \nOffice of the Legal Adviser) and the Department of Transportation \n(particularly the U.S. Coast Guard).\n  7. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Security Council resolutions on Iraq call for the \nelimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi recognition of \nKuwait and the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release \nof Kuwaiti and other third-country nationals, compensation for victims \nof Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities, the return of Kuwaiti assets stolen during \nIraqi's illegal occupation of Kuwait, renunciation of terrorism, an end \nto internal Iraqi repression of its own civilian population, and the \nfacilitation of access of international relief organizations to all \nthose in need in all parts of Iraq. More than 5 years after the \ninvasion, a pattern of defiance persists: a refusal to account for \nmissing Kuwaiti detainees; failure to return Kuwaiti property worth \nmillions of dollars, including military equipment that was used by Iraq \nin its movement of troops to the Kuwaiti border in October 1994; \nsponsorship of assassinations in Lebanon and in northern Iraq; \nincomplete declarations to weapons inspectors; and ongoing widespread \nhuman rights violations. As a result, the U.N. sanctions remain in \nplace; the United States will continue to enforce those sanctions under \ndomestic authority.\n  Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its own \ncitizens through systematic repression of minorities and denial of \nhumanitarian assistance. The Government of Iraq has reportedly said it \nwill not be bound by United Nations Security Council Resolution 688. \nFor more than 4 years, Baghdad has maintained a blockade of food, \nmedicine, and other humanitarian supplies against northern Iraq. The \nIraqi military routinely harasses residents of both the north and has \nattempted to ``Arabize'' the Kurdish, Turcomen, and Assyrian areas of \nthe north. Iraq has not relented in its artillery attacks against \ncivilian population centers in the south or in its burning and draining \noperations in the southern marshes, which have forced thousands to flee \nto neighboring States. In April 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted \nresolution 986 authorizing Iraq to export limited quantities of oil (up \nto $1 billion per quarter) under U.N. supervision in order to finance \nthe purchase of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies. The \nresolution includes arrangements to ensure equitable distribution of \nsuch assistance to all the people of Iraq. The resolution also provides \nfor the payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression and for \nthe funding of other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. Resolution \n986 was carefully crafted to address the issues raised by Iraq to \njustify its refusal to implement similar humanitarian resolutions \nadopted in 1991 (Resolutions 706 and 712), such as oil export routes \nand questions of national sovereignty.

A bill to provide for a change in the exemption from the \nchild labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 for \nminors between 16 and 18 years of age who engage in the operation of \nautomobiles and trucks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources\n\n\n                        child labor legislation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, few experiences are more valuable to young \npeople than part-time and summer jobs. Jobs provide teenagers with both \nan income and an important lesson on what it's like to be in the work \nforce. It is unfortunate, then, that the Federal Government--ever eager \nto encroach upon the lives of Americans--is denying young people the \nopportunity to work in at least one sector of our economy, car \ndealership.\n  Let me explain. Last year, the U.S. Department of Labor started \ncracking down on dealerships that allowed their 16- and 17-year-old \nemployees to drive cars for short distances, say, from one lot to \nanother across the street, or to a nearby gas station. Why? Because of \na provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act that allows for only \nincidental and occasional driving by teenage employees under 18. As \ninterpreted by the Department of Labor, this provision effectively \nwipes out any teenage driving whatsoever.\n  This provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act was intended to \nprevent employers from over-working young people and using then to \ndrive heavy vehicles. But what we are talking about today, Mr. \nPresident, is not exploitation, but perfectly reasonable actions.\n  The Department of Labor, for reasons which I cannot fathom, has \nimposed almost $200,000 worth of fines on dealerships throughout \nWashington State, even thought the dealerships did not require their \n16- and 17-year-old employees to drive often, or for a long time, but \nonly in very limited circumstances. The result of these fines? Most car \ndealerships no longer hire people under 18 years of age, and hundreds \nof teenagers are prevented from getting good jobs.\n  Mr. President, I cannot help but point out the irony of the Labor \nDepartment acting as a job-destroying entity. Matthew Bergman, a then-\n17-year-old part-time dealership worker, said last year in the Seattle \nTimes,\n\n       I can have a legal state license that represents me in any \n     state in the country, but I can't drive three blocks in a \n     company car. It's a real bummer.\n\n  A bummer indeed, Mr. President. But it doesn't have to be that way. I \nbelieve we can reasonably modify the Fair Labor Standards Act so that \nteenagers can drive cars as long as it is not a primary part of their \njobs. The bill I introduce today will do just that. It will be better \nfor car dealerships, and better for kids who want to work. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of my \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY FOR MINORS TO OPERATE MOTOR VEHICLES.\n\n       In the administration of the child labor provisions of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Secretary of Labor \n     shall issue a final rule not later than 1 year from date of \n     enactment of this Act to amend the exemption from the child \n     labor restrictions of such Act under section 570.52(b)(1) of \n     title 29, Code of Federal Regulation, for minors between 16 \n     and 28 years of age who operate automobiles or trucks not \n     exceeding 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight to eliminate the \n     requirement that such operation be only occasional and \n     incidental to the employment of a minor and to add the \n     requirement that such operation not be the primary duty of \n     the employment of a minor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cochran, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Pryor, and \n        Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 1100. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the deduction of partnership investment expenses under the minimum \ntax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \neliminate a serious tax impediment to venture capital investments. It \nwould treat the investment expenses of individuals investing in \npartnerships the same for alternative minimum tax [AMT] purposes as \nthey are currently treated for regular tax purposes. No longer would \nindividuals who are subject to the AMT and invest in venture capital \nfunds set up as partnerships face taxation on their gross earnings, \nrather than their net income after deduction of expenses. This \nprovision was included in the Tax Fairness and Economic Growth Act of \n1992, H.R. 11, legislation that was passed by Congress but vetoed for \nreasons unrelated to this issue.\n \n[[Page S11108]]\n\n  Under current law, most investors are permitted to deduct the \nexpenses of earning investment income so that they pay tax on the net \nincome from an investment. Individual taxpayers not subject to the AMT \nare permitted to deduct investment expenses against investment income, \nto the extent that expenses exceed 2 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted \ngross income. Further, individuals who invest through mutual funds \neffectively get a deduction for all investment expenses without regard \nto the 2 percent floor applicable to direct investment. Corporate \ntaxpayers are also entitled to a tax deduction for all investment \nexpenses.\n  In contrast to the general rule, the AMT as it applies to individuals \ndenies them a deduction for any investment expenses, despite the fact \nthat such expenses are legitimate costs of earning investment income. \nDenying the deduction for investment expenses is especially harsh when \napplied to individual partners in a venture capital partnership, \nbecause all of the partnership's expenses--for example, salaries, rent, \nlegal and accounting services, and the costs of investigating and \nmanaging investment opportunities--are considered investment expenses \nthat cannot be deducted under the AMT.\n  The goal of the AMT is to properly measure a taxpayer's income, so \nthat the tax is paid on economic income. There is no policy \njustification for preventing the deduction of legitimate expenses of \nearning investment income.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would address the undesirable \nAMT policy in current law by treating individuals investing in \npartnerships and subject to the AMT the same as individuals under the \nregular income tax. Partners would be allowed to deduct partnership \ninvestment expenses against their partnership investment income, \nsubject to the same 2 percent floor applied to other individual \ninvestors under the regular income tax.\n  These proposed tax changes should increase the flow of funds to \npartnerships investing in new businesses by eliminating a substantial \ntax barrier that currently exists. The vast majority of venture capital \nfunds are organized as partnerships. Further, this proposed legislation \nshould improve the efficiency of capital markets by bringing the AMT \nrules for partnership investments into conformity with those applicable \nunder the regular income tax rules, and closer to those applicable to \ninvestors in mutual funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n                                S. 1100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT EXPENSES UNDER \n                   MINIMUM TAX.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subparagraph (A) of section 56(b)(1) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to limitation on \n     deductions) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) Disallowance of certain deductions.--\n       ``(i) In general.--No deduction shall be allowed--\n       ``(I) for any miscellaneous itemized deduction (as defined \n     in section 67(b)), or\n       ``(II) for any taxes described in paragraph (1), (2), or \n     (3) of section 164(a).\n       ``(ii) Treatment of partnership investment expenses.--\n     Subclause (I) of clause (i) shall not apply to the taxpayer's \n     distributive share of the expenses described in section 212 \n     of any partnership; except that the aggregate amount allowed \n     as a deduction by reason of this sentence shall not exceed \n     the lesser of (I) the aggregate adjusted investment income of \n     the taxpayer from partnerships, or (II) the excess of the \n     aggregate of the taxpayer's distributive shares of such \n     expenses over 2 percent of adjusted gross income. For \n     purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `adjusted \n     investment income' means investment income (as defined in \n     section 163(d)(4)(B) without regard to clause (ii)(II) or \n     clause (iii) reduced by investment interest (as defined in \n     section 163(d)(3)).\n       ``(iii) Treatment of certain taxes.--Subclause (II) of \n     clause (i) shall not apply to any amount allowable in \n     computing adjusted gross income.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 3, \n     1994.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, in introducing legislation to ease the \nburden of the alternative minimum tax [AMT] on investors. I commend \nSenator Moynihan and my other colleagues for the work they have done to \nhelp bring this bill to introduction in the Senate and to secure the \nstrong bipartisan support that it enjoys.\n  Mr. President, changes to this area of the tax law are long overdue. \nCongress has attempted to correct this problem several times within the \npast few years. In fact, this bill was passed in its exact present form \nby both houses of Congress in 1992 as part of H.R. 11. My colleagues \nwill recall that H.R. 11 was vetoed by President Bush for reasons \nunrelated to this provision.\n  Under current law, individuals who incur investment expenses may \ndeduct them for regular tax purposes, subject to a 2-percent gross \nincome floor. This includes expenses passed through to individuals from \npartnerships. While these legitimate investment expenses are deductible \nunder the regular tax system, the alternative minimum tax system \ncompletely disallows their deductibility.\n  In the case of venture capital partnerships, investment expenses are \noften quite substantial. These partnerships spend a great deal of time \nand resources exploring possibilities for new investments to make sure \nthat the products and companies will be successful before committing \nventure capital funding. The expenses required to explore and begin \nsuch investments include hiring support staff, renting office space, \nobtaining computers and other equipment, hooking up utilities, and \nlegal and accounting fees.\n  Partners in these partnerships are generally successful and active \nbusinesspeople. Activities such as running other businesses, serving on \nboards of other companies, and investing heavily in other areas of the \neconomy, often subjects their income to the alternative minimum tax. \nEven though their investment expenses from partnerships are completely \nlegitimate, if the partners are subject to the AMT, these investment \nexpenses are nondeductible and the partners, in effect, are punished \nfor daring to invest.\n  The fact that these men and women are successful business people in \nother areas of their lives is the only reasons that the AMT kicks in to \npunish their investment activity. Mr. President, don't we want \nsuccessful people to be the ones developing the products of tomorrow? \nIn our view, there is simply no justification for disallowing \nlegitimate expenses for reasons not even related to the venture capital \ninvestments.\n  Even the Treasury has acknowledged that the AMT's treatment of \ninvestment expenses is conceptually flawed. According to a recent \nreport, this disparity in treatment results in the incorrect \nmeasurement of the economic income of investors subject to the AMT. The \nproblem is not just conceptual. Real money, desperately needed by small \nbusinesses, is being diverted by a flawed tax policy.\n  Investors are often simply unwilling to make investments in emerging \nbusinesses that not only carry the highest risks in the investment \nworld, but also carry the highest possible tax rates.\n  Mr. President, our bill will help stop the flow of capital away from \nentrepreneurial investments by allowing a partner in an investment \npartnership, filing as an individual, to deduct certain investment \nexpenses for both regular tax and alternative minimum tax purposes. The \nstrong disincentive to invest that the AMT has imposed on such \npartnerships would thus be eliminated.\n  Mr. President, this bill is pro-economy and pro-jobs. Allowing the \ndeductibility of investment expenses will enhance the critical role \nthat private sector investment plays in advancing our Nation's growth \nand development goals. This bill will affect the economic growth and \nvitality of our Nation in such industries as health care, \nbiotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and high technology.\n  Small firms with venture capital support contribute significantly to \nthe overall job growth of our economy. Such firms contribute greatly to \nthe creation of jobs, and these are generally high quality jobs. In \nfact, 59 percent of the labor force in businesses created by venture \ncapital are high-skill, high-wage workers such as engineers, \nscientists, and managers.\n  With an average annual growth rate of 25 percent, venture capital \nfinanced firms outpace almost all other sectors of our economy. As we \nremove this burden of the AMT, millions of dollars in entrepreneurial \ncapital will be attracted that can provide a vital source \n\n[[Page S11109]]\nof funding for the jobs created by such start-up businesses.\n  In my home State of Utah, venture capital has contributed an \nestimated $100 million dollars to high growth industries. In fact, \nseveral of Utah's medical device and computer software companies owe \ntheir very existence to the capital that these partnerships provide.\n  Our bill would eliminate the AMT's financial impediment to the \ndevelopment of new, innovative products. Benefactors of this \nlegislation include companies like Anefta, a Utah company which \nrecently created the first pre-operating room anesthetic specifically \ndesigned for children. With the aid of a venture capital group, Anefta \ncreated an anesthetic in the form of a lollypop that hospitals across \nthe country now give to children going into surgery.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop punishing those willing to invest \nin America's future, in companies like Anefta. We need to remove the \nburden of the AMT on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Moynihan and myself in sponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Heflin) (by request):\n  S. 1101. A bill to make improvements in the operation and \nadministration of the Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the federal courts improvement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the request of the Administrative Office \nof the United States Courts, today I introduce the Federal Courts \nImprovement Act of 1995.\n  The Administrative Office prepared this legislation, and I am pleased \nto introduce it on that office's behalf. While I have reservations \nabout some provisions of the bill, I believe that, out of comity to the \njudicial branch, the Senate should have the judiciary's specific \nproposals on record so that we can give those suggestions a full and \nfair hearing.\n  As for content, the bill is lengthy and includes both technical and \nsubstantive changes in the law. Some of its substantive changes do \nraise concern. For example, section 201 of the bill provides \nauthorization for judicial branch reimbursement out of civil forfeiture \nfunds for expenses incurred in connection with asset forfeiture \nproceedings. This might have a harmful effect on law enforcement and \nrelated programs, which currently receive reimbursement from civil \nforfeiture funds, and on other recipients of residual forfeiture funds.\n  A number of provisions relax rules pertaining to senior judges. \nSection 401 of the bill, for instance, changes the service requirements \ngoverning when judges may take senior status. Under the current rule, \nthe earliest time a judge may take senior status is at 65 years of age, \nwith 15 or more years of service. Under the new provision, a judge \nwould be permitted to take senior status as early as age 60, so long as \nthat judge's combined age and years of service equal at least 80.\n  Section 402 loosens requirements for senior judges' work \ncertification to permit senior judges to obtain retroactive credit. \nUnder that provision, a senior judge's work could be credited toward a \nprior year in which the judge did not complete the minimum work \nrequirements. That would enable senior judges to remain eligible for \nsalary increases for which they otherwise would not be qualified.\n  I have some concern that those provisions would increase costs to the \nFederal Government. With judges taking senior status earlier, a greater \nnumber of active judges would have to be appointed to handle the heavy \nFederal court caseload. Enabling senior judges to maintain senior \nstatus without meeting the already reduced work requirements could \nincrease salary costs unnecessarily.\n  I mention these simply to highlight some concerns I have with this \ndetailed and broad-ranging bill. The bill contains many other \nprovisions that I hope to support. At this point, however, I must \nreserve my complete endorsement of it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am joining with my colleague Senator \nOrrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to introduce at the \nrequest of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts the Federal \nCourts Improvement Act of 1995.\n  This bill contains some proposals carried over from previous \nCongresses, but it also contains some new proposals which the Federal \njudiciary believes will enhance and improve its operation. Section 101 \nwould provide Federal authority for probation and pretrial service \nofficers to carry firearms under rules prescribed by the Director of \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts, if approved by the appropriate \ndistrict court.\n  Section 202 would increase the civil filing fee from $120 to $150.\n  Section 304 would eliminate in-State plaintiff diversity \njurisdiction.\n  Section 309 would raise the jurisdictional amount in diversity cases \nfrom $50,000 to $75,000 and index such amount for inflation to be \nadjusted at the end of each year evenly divisible by five.\n  Section 409 would authorize Federal judges to carry firearms for \npurposes of personal security.\n  Section 410 would change the date of temporary judgeships created in \nthe 101st Congress under Public Law 101-650. Under current law, the 5 \nyear term, after which new vacancies are not filled, began to run on \nthe date of enactment of the public law. Under the proposed revision, \nthe 5-year period would not begin until the confirmation date of the \njudge filling the temporary position.\n  Section 504 repeals a provision in a continuing appropriation \nresolution that bars annual cost-of-living adjustments in pay for \nFederal judges except as specifically authorized by Congress.\n  Section 603 would amend the Criminal Justice Act to delegate \nauthority to the Judicial Conference to establish compensation rates \nand case compensation maximum amounts which are paid to attorneys who \nprovide services under CJA.\n  The foregoing are just some of the provisions of the legislation we \nare introducing by request today. I do not agree with each and every \nproposal in the bill we are introducing, and I reserve the right to \nlook at each specific proposal on its merits. I am confident that the \nJudiciary Committee will give this bill careful consideration and look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the committee in the weeks \nahead.\n\n\n

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Europe would pose a security threat to the \n     United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist domination and that meet specific \n     criteria for NATO membership would contribute to \n     international peace and enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO, \n     and should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward \n     eventual NATO membership.\n       (17) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     countries emerging from communist domination should be based \n     on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO \n     transition assistance and evolving NATO criteria, which \n     require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of \n     all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4. REVISIONS TO PROGRAM TO FACILITATE TRANSITION TO NATO \n                   MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--Subsection (a) of section \n     203 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public \n     Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(a) Establishment of Program.--The President shall \n     provide expanded security assistance and other related \n     assistance to countries designated under subsection (d) to \n     facilitate their transition to full NATO membership.''.\n       (b) Eligible Countries.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--Subsection (d) of section 203 of such Act \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Designation of Eligible Countries.--\n       ``(1) Presidential review and report.--Within 60 days of \n     the enactment of the NATO Participation Act Amendments of \n     1995, the President shall transmit to the Congress an \n     evaluation of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and \n     Slovakia as well as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, \n     Bulgaria, Romania and Albania in accordance with the criteria \n     in paragraph (3) and specifically designate one or more of \n     these countries to be eligible to receive assistance under \n     the program established in subsection (a).

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Participation Act \n     Amendments of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or \n\n[[Page S11119]]\n     used, military force to expand the borders of its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Europe would pose a security threat to the \n     United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist domination and that meet specific \n     criteria for NATO membership would contribute to \n     international peace and enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO, \n     and should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward \n     eventual NATO membership.\n       (17) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     countries emerging from communist domination should be based \n     on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO \n     transition assistance and evolving NATO criteria, which \n     require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of \n     all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise today to present a poem, \n``Who Are the Veterans of World War II,'' that Dr. Jack Gren, a Fort \nWayne, IN, native, has written to pay tribute to the veterans of World \nWar II. It reflects his experiences during possibly the most historic \nwar of this century.\n  As a young man, Dr. Gren volunteered for the Air Force and flew the \nHump in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. He has since been \ninvolved with several speaking engagements and seminars detailing his \nlife experiences.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the poem be printed in the Record.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                 Who Are the Veterans of World War Two?\n\n     Who are the veterans of World War Two?\n       People proud of the red, white and blue.\n\n     When the war broke out we got right in\n       Knowing somehow we'd eventually win.\n\n     The average age was twenty-six\n       But there certainly was a full range mix.\n\n     Some were the old guys at thirty-five\n       Fighting to keep our country alive.\n\n     A few of us were kids, still in our teens\n       Sincere and eager and full of dreams.\n\n     Joined the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy too\n       There was an important job we had to do.\n\n     We took all the training and it was rough\n       But that's what taught us how to be tough.\n\n     Yes, we were tough when we had to be\n       But only out of necessity.\n\n     The rest of the time we were gentle and kind\n       Just winning the war was first in our mind.\n\n     We fought all over the world day by day\n       And every night found time to pray.\n\n     We fought in Europe with all our might\n       We knew that we had to make things right.\n\n     The battles were fierce in the Africa campaign\n       And even there we did sustain.\n\n     We fought throughout the Pacific Islands\n       From jungle swamps up to the highlands.\n\n     We fought in China, Burma and India as well\n       Now that was a real living hell.\n\n     We thought about our loved ones way back home\n       And sometimes felt so terribly alone.\n\n     We cared for our buddies quite a bit\n       And it tore us apart when they got hit.\n\n     Casualties occurred in many different ways\n       Sometimes it put us in kind of a daze.\n\n     It was difficult seeing wounded in terrible pain\n       And no way to help was hard to explain.\n\n     But worse was to see friends lie dying\n       It was all we could do to keep from crying.\n\n     Whether killed in a plane, a ship or tank\n       It was then we thought the whole world stank.\n\n     But that was the way it had to be\n       And we kept on fighting till the world was free.\n\n     Yes, we did our duty and did it with pride\n       Some of us lived while others died.\n\n     Then came the year of '45\n       The war was over and we were alive.\n\n     First Victory in Europe, then VJ Day\n       Thank You, God, we knelt to pray.\n\n     Then we came home to start once more\n       Hoping there'd not be another war.\n\n     We went to college or learned a skill\n       Thinking never again we'd have to kill.\n\n     We married, had children and that was nice\n       But like everything else we had paid a price.\n\n     We struggled as we tried to build a career\n       And many a night shed a silent tear.\n\n     Some attitudes changed it was hard to understand\n       Why certain people didn't appreciate this land.\n\n     When other wars started and some people fled\n       We remembered the ones who fought and bled.\n\n     Then along came those who defiled our flag\n       They spit on it burned it and called it a rag.\n\n     They called it ``free expression,'' That it was their right\n       Something given to them without struggle or fight.\n\n     They insulted the veterans who came home lame\n       For their outrageous actions they ought to feel shame.\n\n     And some people still try to get a free ride\n       It's through self achievement that we earn our pride.\n\n     Now our children are grown and out on there own\n       And once again we're alone.\n\n     If we're lucky we still have a loving wife\n       It's really been an interesting life.\n\n     We've seen the world change and its hard to explain\n       Why there are wars, turmoil and pain.\n\n     When will people heed the message from above\n       And learn to live in peace and love.\n\n     Yes, World War II was long ago\n       Will the veterans forget it, the answer is no.\n\n     For some old guys in the war, their journey is done\n       They lived a good life and the battles were won.\n\n     We who were kids, then still in our teens\n       Are now in our sixties and accomplished our dreams.\n\n     We attend military reunions, reminisce with the guys\n       And occasionally a thought brings tears to our eyes.\n\n     We look around, observe and it's easy to see\n       There aren't as many of us left as there used to be.\n\n     But if a terrible war came, heaven forbid\n       We'd probably do the same thing as we once did.\n\n     We'd join in the fray with all our might\n       And do what we could to make things right.\n\n     For we still love this country, the red white and blue\n       And that by God, is the best we can do.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto comment on the so-called Good ol' Boys' Roundup that was recently \nthe subject of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. During that \nhearing, I and other committee members heard testimony about \nreprehensible acts of racism that took place at the roundup.\n  In my view, incidents like the roundup paint all law enforcement \nofficials--not just the ATF and the FBI--with the coarse brush of \nracism and discrimination. I do remain confident that the attitudes and \nbiases displayed at the roundup are not, in fact, representative of the \nviews of law enforcement officials generally. But incidents like the \nroundup cannot help but erode citizens' confidence in what the 14th \namendment calls the equal protection of the laws.\n  When citizens have occasion to wonder whether the law is being \nenforced evenhandedly, they sometimes cannot help but look with \nsuspicion upon the actions of the officers involved in a particular \ncase. As a result, trials in criminal cases often focus more on the \nactions of the police than on those of the defendant. Adhering to the \nmaximum that the best defense is a good offense, defense attorneys in \ncriminal cases, in effect, put the police on trial, just as the \nprosecutor puts the defendant on trial. The upshot, then, is that \nracist events like the roundup erode the effectiveness not only of the \nagencies whose officers were involved, but also of police departments \nacross the country.\n  Mr. President, we must, therefore, redouble our efforts to ensure \nthat racism is not present in the law enforcement community. Officers \nwho engage in racist activities should be severely disciplined. \nMoreover, officers who do not themselves take part in racist activities \nmust understand that they cannot passively stand by while others engage \ninto racist behavior, without regard to whether they are on or off \nduty. The no-tolerance policy for racism must extend from the highest \nto the lowest ranks of our law enforcement community. Only by this kind \nof vigilance, Mr. President, can we ensure that the promise of the 14th \namendment is kept.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11123-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11123-S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              FRANCIS HIPP: SOUTH CAROLINA'S CIVIC LEADER\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a true \nfriend and South Carolina patriot--Francis M. Hipp. Last week at age \n84, my friend \n\n[[Page S11124]]\nand colleague passed away in Greenville.\n  Francis Hipp, a native of Newberry, and his brothers took over \nLiberty Life Insurance Co. from their father in 1943. Over the next \nthree decades, he pushed the company, now named Liberty Corp., to \nspectacular business heights as it blossomed into a major insurer and \nbroadcaster.\n  But the innovative and intelligent way that Francis ran his company \nis not what I most remember him for. That memory is reserved for the \nkind, caring way that he volunteered to help his State.\n  Francis Hipp was a civic leader extraordinare. He played a key role \nin moving South Carolina from a agricultural and textile State into a \ndiversified national and international business powerhouse. In 1959 \nwhen I became Governor, I appointed Francis to head the newly \nreorganized State Development Board. Under his leadership, Francis \njump-started economic growth in the Palmetto State.\n  Francis Hipp is the reason for today's prosperity in South Carolina. \nWhat we needed in the early 1960's was a successful businessman who \ncould talk to successful businessmen. Francis traveled tirelessly \ntelling the South Carolina story. He brought investment. He brought \nindustry. He brought the jobs.\n  Mr. President, without the devotion, hard work and caring of Francis \nHipp, South Carolina would not have today's successful business \nenvironment. It is with a profound sense of loss that we mourn his \npassing. With Francis' death, South Carolina has lost its greatest \ncivic leader.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11123-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN SUFFRAGE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this month, across our Nation, \nAmericans are coming together to celebrate the 75th anniversary of one \nof the most important events in our history--the passage of the 19th \namendment to the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to \nvote.\n  As we commemorate this momentous anniversary, we pay tribute to the \nremarkable women of the suffrage movement, whose determination and \ncourage have inspired and empowered countless Americans. These \nvisionary leaders--Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Julia Ward \nHowe, Lucy Stone, and so many more--endured discrimination and scorn as \nthey fought to extend a basic right to American women.\n  On August 26, 1920, the 19th amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States took effect. It is hard to imagine today that the passage \nof this amendment, with its modest declaration of equality, was so \nhard-fought and divisive. It reads simply:\n\n       The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall \n     not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state \n     on account of sex.\n\n  But to the women of America, these simple words represented profound \nchange and the culmination of a 72-year battle for the right to vote.\n  On this occasion, we are reminded of the tremendous strides made by \nwomen in the last century. Just 75 years ago, women could not vote. \nToday, women are actively involved in our political system, organizing \ncampaigns, running as candidates, and voting on policy in city councils \nand State legislatures across the country and in the U.S. Congress. \nIndeed, two women now represent California in the U.S. Senate. What \nremarkable change in such a short time. And in every other area of our \nsociety, women have proven themselves to be gifted and able leaders.\n  But at this special time, we are also reminded of the many challenges \nthat lie ahead. Currently, women earn only 76 cents for every dollar \nearned by men. A ``glass ceiling'' still prevents many women from \noccupying top management positions in the work force. And our elected \nGovernment still does not reflect the tremendous diversity of our \nsociety.\n  As we observe this anniversary, we must renew our commitment to \ncreating equality for women at every level of our society. And we must \nalways remember--every time we exercise our right to vote--the great \ngift bestowed on us by the brave and selfless women of the suffrage \nmovement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11124-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT H. McCABE\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. One of the foundations of our democracy is our \neducation system, which has the high calling of passing knowledge for \none generation to the next, of preparing our young people for the \nfuture and teaching us about the past.\n  Mr. President, in the United States, our great tradition of public \neducation is personified by Dr. Robert H. McCabe, president of Miami-\nDade Community College.\n  After more than three decades of service to the college, Bob McCabe \nwill retire, leaving a legacy that would inspire Socrates and \nJefferson. A fundamental principle of our education system is that \nknowledge shall not be bounded by race or class or religion, that in a \ntruly free society all people have access to learning.\n  For some, that principle is an academic precept. For Bob McCabe, it \nis a lifelong passion. He lives that principle every day.\n  Miami-Dade Community College is the latest of its kind in America, a \nnationally recognized institution which makes a consistent vital \ncontribution to our future.\n  Thousands of Floridians--productive, employed, having an immeasurable \npositive impact on America--got their start in higher education at \nMiami-Dade Community College. For them, the community college was a \ndoor to the future, and Bob McCabe made sure that door was open to \neveryone.\n  As a native of Florida, as a former member of the Florida \nLegislature, as a past Governor of Florida and now a U.S. Senator \nrepresenting Florida, I have a profound pride for our State's system of \ncommunity colleges. These schools. located throughout our State, give \nreal meaning to the sometimes fleeting goal of ``access to higher \neducation.'' Community colleges are close to the students they serve \nand affordable.\n  Community colleges are in the community and of the community. Bob \nMcCabe is a tribute to that inter-connection between education and \ncommunity, making multiple contributions to a greater south Florida. He \nhelped establish the New World School of Arts and the New World \nSymphony, and worked with Miami's ``We Will Rebuild'' after Hurricane \nAndrew in 1992.\n  Bob McCabe's dedication to higher education earned him the 1988 \nDistinguished Graduate Award from the University of Miami and a \nMacArthur Fellowship in 1992. This year, he received the prestigious \nAmerican Association of Community Colleges Leadership Award for his \noutstanding work on behalf of community colleges.\n  For an active person with a creative mind like Bob McCabe's, \nretirement is perhaps a misnomer. As we mark this milestone in his \ncareer, we salute his leadership knowing the our community and our \nNation will reap the benefits from his efforts into the next \ncentury.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11124-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11124-S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE ROUGH AND READY ENGINE CO., NO. 5\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to the Rough and Ready Engine Co., No. 5 of \nWarren, RI on the occasion of its 50th annual clambake, which will \noccur on August 6, 1995.\n  Declared ``Rough and Ready Clambake Day'' by the Warren Town Council, \nthis day commemorates both the professional and charitable work of the \nRoughs, as they have been fondly nicknamed by the town. Part of the \nfire company's charter ``* * * To assist in the extinguishing of fires, \nthe protection of life and property and to enhance the general welfare \nof the community * * *'' is also the Roughs' motto.\n  The Rough and Ready Clambake commemorates 50 years of charitable work \nwith the State of Rhode Island. In 1994 and 1995, over 10 organizations \nand charitable institutions within the community have benefited from \ndonations totaling over $3,000. The Roughs have sponsored a Little \nLeague baseball team and a youth soccer team. Three residents of Warren \nwere given the opportunity to attend Camp Stonetower, a camp for \nchildren with mental disabilities. During the Christmas season, the \nRoughs annually prepare dinner baskets for distribution through local \nchurches to those in need within the community.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join with me and all Rhode \nIslanders in commending the members of the Rough \n\n[[Page S11125]]\nand Ready Engine Co., No. 5 for their many acts of generosity and good \nwill within their community, and in wishing them continued health and \nprosperity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11124-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             AMENDMENT NO. 1854 TO THE RYAN WHITE CARE ACT.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act. The purpose of the act is to provide health care \nservices in a cost effective way to people with HIV and AIDS. The Ryan \nWhite CARE Act is working in my State and throughout the Nation. I am \nvery concerned about any amendment that would undermine the \neffectiveness of this program. Senate Helms' amendment 1854 would \nprohibit the use of Federal funding to ``promote or encourage, directly \nor indirectly, homosexual activities or injection drug use.'' Senator \nHelms' amendment could be broadly applied and therefore potentially \nundermine one of the most cost effective Federal programs we have.\n  Under the Helms amendment, it would be difficult to determine what \nservices provided by a clinic would be considered to ``promote or \nencourage homosexual activities or injection drug use.'' In particular, \nprevention programs that discuss sexual behaviors that contribute to \nthe spread of AIDS might be judged to promote homosexual activities. \nPrevention programs that discuss and advocate clean needles for drug \naddicts might be judged to promote injection drug use. Although the \nRyan White Act does not pay for preventive services, clinics that \ndeliver Ryan White-funded health services often have prevention \nprograms. If these clinics which provide comprehensive care to people \nwith AIDS are considered to indirectly promote homosexuality, then \nthese programs could lose funding. That means denying lifesaving \nmedical services for people with HIV and AIDS.\n  Mr. President, doctors, nurses and other health professionals cannot \ntalk about a sexually transmitted disease without also talking about \nthe sexual behaviors that will prevent its spread. It is unclear if \nthis amendment would allow professionals serving the HIV-infected \npopulation to talk about sexual behaviors. The ambiguous language of \nthis amendment could damage the protection of public health.\n  Again, let me remind my colleagues that the purpose of this bill is \nto provide health care to individuals suffering from a terrible, \nterminal disease. The bill reflects not a moral consensus about \nhomosexuality but a shared compassion for people with AIDS and a \ncommitment to the public's health.\n  Finally, the Ryan White CARE Act makes economic sense. Cost-effective \ndelivery of care keeps AIDS patients out of costly emergency rooms. The \npublic funds provided by Ryan White have been leveraged in my State \nwith private dollars to provide a network of cost-effective services to \nthe HIV-infected population. If we shut off Federal funds to community-\nbased providers because there is a question of whether or not the \nnature of their services indirectly promotes homosexuality, then we \nwill undermine efforts to limit the spread of AIDS and will shift the \nburden of caring for people with AIDS on to our already over-burdened \npublic hospitals.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11125-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATIONS TO RED RIVER ARMY DEPOT COMMUNITY\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to commend the efforts of the \npeople of northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas for the excellent job \nthey did making the case to save Red River Army Depot. As you know, in \neach of the last three base closure rounds, the Defense Department \nrecommendations have been approved by the Base Closure Commission 85 \npercent of the time. The fact that Red River Army Depot overcame those \nodds is a testament to the dedicated efforts of everyone in the \ncommunity, and particularly those members of the Red River Defense \nCommittee: Deldon Brewer, Judge James Carlow, Linda Crawford, Dr. \nPhillip Duvall, Hubert Easley, Bob Embrey, John Henson, Dr. K.C. \nHillis, Edward Holly, Bill Hubbard, Hoyt Johnson, R.E. ``Swede'' Lee, \nDennis Lewis, John ``Wimpy'' McCoy, Fred Milton, Robert Mountz, Dee \nReese, Eldridge Robertson, Don Ruggels, George Shackelford, Horace \nShipp, James Stokes, Scotty Taylor, and Steve Wiggs. Even in a \ncommunity as unified, dedicated, and active as theirs, these individual \nefforts stood out.\n  Mr. President, the Red River Defense Committee saved Red River \nbecause they had the facts on their side and they worked together as a \nteam. Each committee member volunteered countless hours to work on the \nRed River briefing, often traveling to Washington to gather information \nor meet with the Base Closure Commission. They organized massive public \ndemonstrations of support, raised money, and took precious time away \nfrom their families and jobs to dedicate themselves to saving the \ndepot. On this Saturday, August 5, 1995, they, their families, and as \nmany citizens as can fit in the Four States Fair Entertainment Center \nwill celebrate their well-deserved victory. As they do, I would once \nagain like to offer my congratulations on a job well done.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/01/senate-section/article/S11125-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    WAIVING PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1970\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
