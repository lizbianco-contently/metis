Mr. President, the House of Representatives is in the \n[[Page S3692]] midst of Legal Reform Week and on its way to passing \nthree bills which, if enacted, would dramatically overhaul and improve \nour civil justice system. So, Mr. President, the first thing I would \nlike to do is commend the House for its determination and its \ncommitment to change the legal system.\n  With the exception of the general aviation bill last year, no court \nreform legislation of any sort has ever gotten anywhere in the \nCongress.\n  So the House this week is about to do something truly historic. Over \nin the House and over here I hope we now realize the civil justice \nsystem is broken.\n  Injured parties wait too many years to have their cases heard. While \na few win big damage awards, many people suffering personal injuries do \nnot get adequately compensated for those injuries. We know that for \nevery dollar spent in America in these tort cases only 43 cents makes \nit to the injured party and 57 cents is taken up by the courts and the \nlawyers; 57 cents out of every dollar for transaction costs. That is \nnot civil justice. More than half the money goes to transaction costs--\nlawyers, and expert witness fees, as well as administration of the \ncourt system.\n  Not only do victims fare poorly in the current legal system, but \nscarce economic resources are drained from more productive uses. \nMunicipalities and nonprofit organizations must absorb spiralling \ninsurance costs, threatening the important public services they \nprovide. No small businessman can afford to be without a lawyer because \nof the liability maze. And, ultimately, the burden falls on the \nAmerican people--as taxpayers and consumers, paying more for Government \nservices and higher costs at the checkout counter.\n  In fact, enactment of legal reform would give the American people a \nmuch deserved tax break--a break from the litigation tax that is \nstrangling our economy. This tax break, unlike all others, will not \neven require a budgetary offset. And, even more significantly, it will \nnot impact the Social Security trust fund.\n  Perhaps if we add some specific language protecting Social Security \nto these bills, we will pick up a few Democrat votes. And, maybe then \nthe President could support legal reform. Because as we learned from \nAttorney General Reno this week, the administration is strongly opposed \nto the legal reform effort. Interestingly, the administration's \nunhappiness with these initiatives focuses on federalism--State's \nrights. I am quite amazed by this approach; after all this \nadministration has not met a problem that could not be solved without a \nnew or expanded Federal program. We only need to remind ourselves of \nthe health care debacle. It is only on this issue--legal reform--that \nthey have suddenly found the 10th amendment.\n  The fact is, the problem is a national one, and Congress has ample \npower to act, consistent with the commerce clause of the Constitution. \nFormer Judge Robert Bork has eloquently disposed of the federalism \nissue in a letter he recently wrote to the Speaker. I ask that Judge \nBork's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Office of the Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I understand that several provisions \n     either already in H.R. 956, the Contract With America's legal \n     reform provision, or proposed to be included in it, have been \n     criticized as unwarranted intrusions on the authority of the \n     States.\n       The provisions include virtually all the reform measures \n     that have been discussed over the previous several \n     Congresses, including limits on punitive or non-economic \n     damages and joint and several liability (whether applied to \n     product liability suits or broader categories of cases); \n     defenses relating to compliance with applicable federal \n     regulations; regulation of contingency fees and other aspects \n     of attorney conduct; and various statute of limitations \n     reforms.\n       There can be little question that these reforms are well \n     within the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce \n     Clause of the Constitution as it has been interpreted for \n     many years. Beginning in the 1930s, the courts have read this \n     Clause as a comprehensive grant of authority to Congress to \n     regulate virtually any type of activity affecting the \n     national economy. The measures under discussion indisputably \n     fall within this broad category of regulation.\n       As you know, I have long believed, like many scholars and \n     jurists (and many Members of Congress), that these broad \n     interpretations of the Commerce Clause are questionable, and \n     arguably out of keeping with the scheme of coordinate \n     sovereignty intended by the Framers of the Constitution. \n     Rather than simply resting on the federalism case law, \n     therefore, I believe those measures are justifiable and \n     necessary to protect the balance between State and Federal \n     authority contemplated by the Framers. They could not have \n     foreseen the spectacular growth, complexity, and unity of \n     today's economy. It cannot be said with any certainty that \n     they would not have passed a measure like H.R. 956 in today's \n     circumstances.\n       The problems addressed by H.R. 956 are national problems. \n     That is true not only because interstate commerce is \n     affected, and not only because products and services are made \n     more expensive as insurance costs rise, but also because the \n     plaintiffs' tort bar chooses to sue in jurisdictions where \n     awards of compensatory and punitive damages are highest. As a \n     consequence, a state like California or Texas can impose its \n     views of appropriate product design and the penalties for \n     falling short on manufacturers and distributors across the \n     nation. This is a perversion of federalism. Instead of \n     national standards being set by the national legislature, \n     national standards are set by the courts and juries of \n     particular states.\n       No problem more preoccupied the Constitutional Convention \n     than the necessity of protecting interstate commerce from \n     self-interested exploitation by the States. Madison observed \n     in Federalist No. 42 that no defect in the Articles of \n     Confederation was clearer than their inability to protect \n     interstate commerce. And in Federalist No. 11, Hamilton made \n     clear that one of the key purposes of the new Constitution \n     was to prevent interstate commerce from being ``fettered, \n     interrupted and narrowed'' by parochial state regulation.\n       The civil justice reforms under discussion are all designed \n     to vindicate this central constitutional purpose. It can no \n     longer be disputed that abusive litigation is having a \n     profoundly adverse impact on interstate commerce. Indeed, a \n     growing body of evidence suggests that the very purpose of \n     much of this litigation is to discriminate against interstate \n     commerce on behalf of local interests. Although \n     discrimination of this type was anticipated by the Framers, \n     the misuse of litigation to achieve this effect is a \n     relatively recent development. It is not surprising, \n     therefore, that Congress has not previously found it \n     necessary to regulate in this area.\n       It is thus neither inconsistent nor hypocritical for \n     Congress simultaneously to protect interstate commerce from \n     parochial discrimination and to protect States and localities \n     from unwarranted federal interference. Both steps are \n     essential to maintain the constitutional balance established \n     by the Framers. Clearly, over the last fifty years the \n     overwhelming trend has been towards the unwarranted expansion \n     of Federal authority at the expense both of the States and of \n     individual liberties, and Congress can and should reverse \n     that trend. But this fact should not blind us to the \n     continuing necessity of protecting interstate commerce from \n     parochial, discriminatory regulation by states and \n     localities. Federal intervention for this purpose is not \n     merely constitutionally permissible, it is important to \n     vindicate the Framers' constitutional design.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert H. Bork.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is only one objection to \nreforming the legal system. And it is the objection of the trial bar. \nThey may be getting beat in the House, but they have not really begun \nto fight. We will see them use their muscle in the Senate. They will \nthrow everything they have at us. They will wrap themselves in the \ntragic stories of real people who have suffered injuries. And they will \nlet Ralph Nader and his network of organizations which they--the trial \nlawyers--fund argue on their behalf.\n  Contrary to their assertions, our reforms will not hurt victims. We \nwant to help victims get fairly compensated without long, drawn-out \nlitigation. We want to encourage those responsible for injuries to \nsettle with injured parties early. And, the House bill moves in the \nright direction.\n  But as the debate shifts to the Senate, I want to encourage my \ncolleagues to look seriously at the McConnell-Abraham bill, S. 300. Our \nbill reverses the incentive structure of the legal system. We set up \nrewards for early settlement. We want to put more money in the hands of \nvictims. Our limitation on attorney contingent fees, as the Washington \nPost editorial page noted this week, will do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n        [[Page S3693]] [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 1995]\n\n                         Civil Justice Reforms\n\n       House Republicans are moving quickly to pass a series of \n     bills designed to reform the civil justice system. At least \n     three separate measures are expected to go to the Senate \n     before the weekend: a bill concerning the payment of \n     attorneys' fees, another making changes in securities fraud \n     law and a third setting new rules for the payment of punitive \n     damages and changes in product liability law.\n       Not every bill deserves support in its present form. But \n     there is no denying that the majority party has taken on a \n     problem that has been festering for some time. In their \n     favor, it should also be noted that some of the more \n     defective provisions of the ``Contract With America'' on this \n     subject have already been improved by compromise and will \n     probably be further fixed by the Senate.\n       The ``loser pays'' provisions of the first bill, which was \n     passed yesterday, would have required unsuccessful litigants \n     to pay winners' lawyers fees. It was always a bad idea. \n     Taking any case to court would have been extremely risky, \n     especially for those of modest means. As originally drafted, \n     the bill deserved to be defeated. But it has been modified so \n     that a loser must pay only if he has rejected a settlement \n     offer and after trial is awarded less than that offer. \n     Better, but still not perfect. The Senate should consider an \n     alternative offered by Sens. Mitch McConnell and Spencer \n     Abraham that would provide an incentive to litigants to \n     settle (immediate payment and hourly attorneys' fees) and a \n     penalty (reduced contingency fees in some cases) to attorneys \n     who don't. Both measures are designed to encourage early \n     settlement of disputes, but the McConnell-Abraham bill is \n     less Draconian.\n       Securities fraud provisions have also been softened to take \n     into account some of the suggestions offered by the chairman \n     of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt. The \n     problem here--frivolous class-action lawsuits against a \n     company as soon as its stock drops--is a real one. As \n     reported by the House Commerce Committee, this bill drew \n     support from almost half the Democrats. But additional \n     changes may be warranted to protect stockholders in \n     meritorious cases.\n       The most hotly contested bill will be considered last. It \n     would limit punitive damages in all civil cases to three \n     times compensatory damages including pain and suffering, or \n     $250,000, whichever is more. It would also narrow the risk of \n     manufacturers' and sellers' liability in certain cases \n     involving defective products. Many of the latter provisions \n     make sense. Why not limit damages if the user has altered or \n     misused the product, or if the accident was caused by drug or \n     alcohol abuse? As for punitive damages, reform is overdue. \n     Guidelines and limits must be set, whether caps are $250,000 \n     or $1 million or something higher. Juries are at sea and \n     sometimes come in with awards that are neither reasonable nor \n     justified.\n       Yes, the fear of high punitive damages may keep \n     manufacturers on their toes. But so would the fear of large \n     fines payable to the public treasury in case of egregious \n     misconduct. The system of providing unpredictable \n     multimillion-dollar awards to single plaintiffs in order to \n     deter corporate misconduct is unfair and inefficient. A shift \n     to fines would make sense. Barring that change, clear \n     guidelines on punitive damages are needed.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our early offer provision, which builds \nupon a bill introduced by House Minority Leader Gephardt 10 years ago, \nwill pay victims all of their losses, while taking many cases out of \nthe court system altogether.\n  Our Nation is suffering from, as one editorial cartoonist called it, \nlawsuitenitus. It is a contagious disease and it is raging at epidemic \nproportions. The cure is a strong dose of legal reform. The only ones \nwho will not like the medicine are those who thrive on the disease and \nprofit from the spread of lawsuitenitus by earning huge fees.\n  Mr. President, we will have a number of bills here in the Senate to \nconsider--the McConnell-Abraham Lawsuit Reform Act; the McConnell-\nLieberman-Kassebaum Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance \nAct; the Product Liability Fairness Act will be introduced next week, \nand there will be other initiatives. I look forward to comprehensive \nhearings on these bills, in the Judiciary, Commerce, and Labor \nCommittees.\n  I am genuinely excited about the possibility of something happening \non this issue. I remember being here 10 years ago as chairman of the \nCourts Subcommittee of Judiciary in 1985 and 1986, and we had numerous \nhearings on the subject of tort reform. But I knew we had no chance. We \nhave had no chance for years. One of the positive results of last \nyear's election, Mr. President, is that civil justice reform is now on \nthe front burner and that genuinely excites this Senator who has had a \ngreat interest in this issue for many, many years.\n  And, most importantly I am hopeful we will enact reforms which give \nthe American people a legal system that is fair, equitable, and \naccessible for the resolution of their disputes.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3691-6", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3693-S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     THE CONGRESS CAN BREAK THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY STALEMATE\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, for more than 10 years the Congress has \ndeferred to Federal courts on making and shaping telecommunications \npolicy. Antitrust law intended to remedy anticompetitive practices when \nAT dominated all facets of America's telecommunications services is \nthe basis of court controlled communications policy. The resulting \nbreakup of AT in 1983-84 under Judge Greene's modified final judgment \nis still the policy basis for keeping the brakes on the future \ndevelopment of this critical industry: Telecommunications is the engine \nof America's continuing race into the information age.\n  Technical complexities and the massive scale of economic returns for \npotential competitors in the industry have made it difficult to arrive \nat any industry-led agreement on fair and just terms for bringing full \ncompetition to reality. Certainly such an agreement would simplify \ncongressional efforts to unleash the industry from Federal court edicts \nso that the benefits of open competition will bring new and lower cost \nservices, increased employment, and a continually improved \ntelecommunications infrastructure.\n  Right now, Mr. President, between 50 and 65 percent of all U.S. jobs \ninvolve information processing, goods, or services; 90 percent of jobs \ncreated over the last 10 years were information related.\n  But there is more to come if we in the Congress can fashion \nreasonable legislation for evenhanded treatment of potential major \ncompetitors. Telecom giants are poised to spend billions over the \ncoming 10 years to restructure their networks. One estimate of capital \nspending by the Bell companies alone on the information highway for \nequipment and infrastructure between 1994 and 1998 is $25 to $50 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we can supercharge and sustain this \npotential growth if we fashion communications laws that will assure all \ntelecommunications competitors that each of them will have a fair \nchance to thrive in fully competitive markets. We have a situation now \nin which each competitor is fearful of a law that will give an unfair \nadvantage to equally powerful competitors.\n  As I see it, Mr. President, the key to establishing open competition \nin telecommunications is to deliver a fair process for freeing the grip \nthat Bell operating companies now have on the local exchange system. \nIdeally, Mr. President, if any telecom carrier can have interference-\nfree, open access to the local exchange to fully compete for the \ndelivery of telecommunications, video, and information services to \nhomes and businesses and at the same time allow for the regional Bells \nto have access to and the ability to provide long distance service for \ntheir customers, we would have created the stimulus for maximum growth \nin this industry.\n  But the Bell operating companies, Mr. President, are understandably \nreluctant about engaging in a process of enabling open access to the \nlocal exchange if it means tying their hands while equally strong \ncompetitors are raiding their customer bases. I am considering \nlegislation that would require the Bells to provide to competitors \ninterconnection to Bell company local exchange switches; provide access \nto network features on an itemized basis; provide technology that will \nallow consumers to move to a competitor and keep the same telephone \nnumber, and take other steps to assure State and Federal regulators \nthat their systems are open to full competition.\n  The Bells are concerned, Mr. President, that this process of opening \nup the local loop under some legislative proposals will not be \nsatisfied until \n[[Page S3694]] competitors: Long distance, cable television, electric \nutility companies with massive capital, and customer bases of their own \nwill have permanently eroded Bell Co. customer bases. This is not a \nsituation, Mr. President, of a world-dominant AT competition with and \nupstart, customer-poor MCI in the early 1980's. Major Bell company \ncompetitors are customer are customer rich, and they are capital rich. \nThey are more than capable, Mr. President, of competing on a level \nplaying field.\n  I have discussed these issues and my suggestions with the Long \nDistance Companies Coalition, with cable television representatives, \nand with Bell company executives, and they agree that my idea offers a \npossible compromise and is worth further discussion.\n  I believe that if we can assure each competitor, region by region, \nthat none of them is to have a headstart or an unfair advantage in the \nrace to acquire customers for new services, that we can reach an \naccommodation that will lead to the passage of important and far-\nreaching telecommunications legislation in 1995.\n  I believe that we can do this, and I believe it is urgent that the \nCongress direct our attention to this in this session. I urge my \ncolleagues to help and join me in crafting a workable telecommunication \nfair competition amendment. I think my suggestion is one that can be \nultimately agreed to by both the long distance carriers, the cable \ncompanies, as well as the regional Bells. It is an idea and a concept \nthat needs further discussion, further debate, and further exploration \nby the various interests that are going to be affected by it. I think \nit does provide us an opening which I think is significant and one that \nhopefully the companies and people affected will take advantage of.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as most know, I offered an amendment on \nSocial Security that led ultimately to the defeat of the balanced \nbudget amendment. I am glad that we had the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment. I think, No. 1, it indicated that we have a problem \nwith the deficit. No. 2, we need to do something about the deficit and \nNo. 3, we should not use Social Security as a method of trying to mask \nthe deficit.\n  Mr. President, while we are having all this talk about a balanced \nbudget, one of the areas we have not talked about and that we should \ntalk about is health care. Why should we talk about health care?\n  Mr. President, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwas quoted in the Washington Post on February 15 saying, ``Health care \nis not very bright on anybody's radar screen, if it shows up at all.''\n  Mr. President, it may not show up on the radar screen of some \nSenators in this body, but it shows up on the radar screen of the \npeople of America. Health care is still brightly flashing in the minds \nof the American public.\n  The Gallup Poll taken before the end of this year, completed December \n30, showed that almost 75 percent of the American people felt that \nreform of the country's health care system should be a top or a high \npriority for Congress within the first 100 days.\n  Mr. President, nobody is talking about health care. We should talk \nabout health care. A CNN poll showed that approximately 60 percent of \nthose surveyed say that if a major illness were to occur in their \nfamily, they could not handle the costs of that major illness at all. \nThere is a problem with health care. If we are wondering why the \ndeficit is being driven up, we need look no place else other than the \nhigh cost of health care. There are interesting phenomenons occurring \nin the country. We have some managed care operations that are ongoing.\n  We find that doctors are not being paid as much, hospitals are not \nbeing paid as much, but the consumer, the patient, is being charged \nmore. Where is that money going? Who is the great middleman that is \nmaking all this money? Who is that? And should we identify him? Health \ncare costs are increasing and we should do something about it.\n  Mr. President, I received a letter from a friend of mine in Las Vegas \nwho is a physician. He was complaining about a patient who was injured \nin a car accident in California, a Nevada resident. This patient was \ninjured and spent 31 days in the hospital.\n  Now, how much would a hospital bill be for a day? Would it be $1,000 \na day, $2,000 a day, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000, \n$9,000? Ten-thousand dollars a day is what it cost the patient before \nhe was allowed to come back to Nevada; $10,000 a day is what it cost \nthat patient in the hospital.\n  I think, by any standards, that is steep, and I think certainly, Mr. \nPresident, we should be concerned about that.\n  If we are wondering why we are having trouble balancing the budget, \nlet us look at health care. A man spends 31 days in the hospital and \nhis bill is $278,000 for the hospital and $33,000 for the physician.\n  Well, health care may not be on the screen of some Members of this \nbody, but health care costs should be on the screen of every one of us. \nHealth care costs are insurmountable for State and local governments \nand the Federal Government, even though we do not talk about it any \nmore.\n  We brought a health care reform bill on the floor last year. We \ndebated it at length. We lost the issue. Now I guess we are just not \ngoing to talk about it any more, even though health care cost is the \nNo. 1 cost driving up deficits all over this country.\n  Uninsureds--I am only talking about uninsureds, I am not talking \nabout underinsureds--uninsureds, Mr. President, have increased in the \nlast 2 years by 2 million people. Now it is up to 41 million Americans. \nEighteen percent of the people in the State of Nevada have no health \ninsurance.\n  We have introduced legislation through the minority leader, certainly \nnot nearly as comprehensive as last year--and that is an \nunderstatement--but we have introduced legislation to address these \nproblems. I direct this body's attention to S. 7, which deals with some \nof the big problems facing health care, including paperwork reduction, \nadministrative simplification, to help in rural areas. I see my friend \nfrom Illinois on the floor. He has been a leader in trying to provide \nhealth care for rural Americans.\n  Specifically, S. 7 will provide portability, limit preexisting \ncondition exclusions, prohibit companies from raising rates when \nconsumers get sick, and require that all insurers offer at least one \nplan with the same benefits available to Members of Congress.\n  The bill will also provide assistance for families and small \nbusinesses through tax incentives and modest subsidy programs. \nSpecifically, this bill will reinstate the self-employed tax deduction, \na proposal supported by 50 Members of this body in a letter to the \nmajority and minority leaders.\n  S. 7 will reduce paperwork and provide administrative simplification \nby implementing standard billing and claims forms. This legislation \nalso provides privacy protection for an individual's health records, \nstrengthens fraud and abuse efforts, and reforms our medical \nmalpractice system.\n  Two other elements in the bill which I particularly support are \nmeasures to provide cost and quality information to consumers and the \nprovisions to enhance rural health care delivery. By providing \nconsumers with accurate cost and quality information on health plans we \ncan put the buying power in the hands of the consumer.\n  S. 7 will help rural areas establish telemedicine networks and \nfinancially viable rural health plans. The Washington Post in its \nhealth section recently cited a University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill study which found that of the 50 million Americans living in \n[[Page S3695]] rural areas, more than 21 million are in locations that \ndon't have enough health care professionals to meet their needs. \nMoreover, the study found that 2,000 primary care doctors are needed in \nrural areas.\n  The elements of this bill were supported by both sides of the aisle \nin last year's debate and were contained in several health care \nproposals put forth by both Republicans and Democrats. Thirty-three \nDemocratic Senators have rallied around a sound set of principles for \nhealth care reform and invited our Republican colleagues to join us in \naddressing this important issue. These principles includes: Insurance \nmarket reform, 100 percent health insurance tax deductibility for the \nself-employed, affordable coverage for children, assistance for workers \nwho lose their jobs to keep their health coverage, and a wide range of \naccessible and affordable home, and community-based options for \nfamilies caring for a sick parent or a disabled child.\n  I believe these principles are ones we, as Members of the Senate, and \nrepresentative of our constituents, can support. S. 7 and the \nDemocratic principles for reform are a sound starting point. I remain \ncommitted to working for reform of our health care system, and I hope \nwe can work together to provide working American families with the \nquality health care they deserve, at a price they can afford.\n  I would only say, Mr. President, that if we ignore health care in \nthis body, we are ignoring the No. 1 cost issue facing people all \nacross America. And before we stop hearing the words ``balanced \nbudget'' and all the debates that took place in that regard, let us not \nforget about health care. If we are ever going to address the deficit \nthat accumulates yearly in this country, we must be concerned with \nhealth care or we will never handle the problem.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  If I may interrupt the Senator from Nebraska, under the previous \norder, morning business was to expire at 11:05.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that morning business be extended \nfor at least 5 minutes, for the purpose of brief remarks by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to extending morning \nbusiness by 5 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would just like to say a few words with \nregard to the bill that was introduced today.\n  As the body well knows,\n   I favored the constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget. I am sorry that it did not pass. But now that it has failed, we \nneed to press ahead to build what discipline we can into the budget \nprocess.\n\n  We are introducing today a statutory requirement that would have \nmost, if not all, of the teeth that the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget would have instituted.\n  The bill requires the Budget Committee to report out a resolution \nthat shows us when we will get to a balanced budget without using the \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  The practical effect of this requirement would be to require the \nGovernment to run surpluses in the unified budget, surpluses that would \nstart to reduce--and I emphasize, reduce--the debt held by the public \nand prepare us for the financial needs of the next century.\n  Our bill enforces this requirement with a 60-vote point of order \nagainst budget resolutions that do not show how we get to balance.\n  The bill allows for waiver in wartime and in recessions, using the \nsame mechanisms that Congress put in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.\n  As for the schedule, the Budget Act requires the Senate Budget \nCommittee to report a budget resolution by April 1.\n  The Budget Act requires the Congress to complete action on the budget \nresolution conference report by April 15. I hope we can meet that \ndeadline.\n  Last year, the Senate Budget Committee reported the budget resolution \non March 18.\n  The year before last, when Congress enacted the deficit reduction \nbill that has reduced the deficit by over $600 billion, the Senate \nBudget Committee reported the budget resolution on March 12, and \nCongress completed action on the conference report on April 1.\n  We look forward to working with the Republican majority to \nexpeditiously fashion a budget resolution that shows us how we will get \nto a balanced budget and get on with the obvious work in this area that \nwe must do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3694-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for about 3 years I have been making daily \nreports to the Senate regarding the exact Federal debt as of the \nprevious day.\n  We must pray that this year, Federal spending will begin to be \nreduced. Indeed, if we care about America's future, Congress must face \nup to its responsibility to balance the Federal budget.\n  As of the close of business yesterday, Wednesday, March 8, the \nFederal debt stood (down to the penny) at $4,848,281,758,236.20, \nmeaning that on a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica owes $18,404.16 as his or her share of the Federal debt.\n  It's important to note, Mr. President, that total Federal debt a \nlittle over 2 years ago (January 5, 1993) stood at \n$4,167,872,986,583.67--or averaged out, $15,986.56 for every American. \nDuring the past 2 years (that is, during the 103d Congress) the Federal \ndebt has escalated by more than $6 billion, which illustrates the point \nthat so many politicians talk a good game at home about bringing the \nFederal debt under control, but vote in support of bloated spending \nbills when they get back to Washington.\n  If the Republicans do not concentrate on getting a handle on this \nenormous debt, their constituents are not likely to overlook it 2 years \nhence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3695-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3695-S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ATTACKS IN PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday we learned of the attack on three \nAmericans on their way to work at the United States Consulate in \nKarachi, Pakistan. While they were stopped at a traffic light, gunmen \njumped out of a yellow taxi and opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles.\n  Two of the Americans were killed: Jackie van Landingham, a secretary; \nand Gary Durell, a communications technician. And I know I speak for \nevery Senator when I extend our deepest sympathy to the friends and \nfamilies of these two Americans who were killed in service to their \nNation in a changing and often dangerous world.\n  Mr. President, the third American, a young man from Framingham, MA, \nMark McCloy, who worked in the consulate's post office, was injured in \nthe attack and was taken to Agha Khan Hospital. He is now in stable \ncondition. Last evening I spoke with his mother, Muriel McCloy, in \nMassachusetts, and I have assured her that the United States is doing \neverything we can to bring those who are responsible for this terrorist \nact to justice; and I assured her that we would do everything we can to \nbring her son home safely.\n  Mr. President, this attack reminds us of the dangers that exist in \nthe world and the courage of those who choose to serve their country in \nspite of those dangers. We cannot underestimate the commitment of \nforeign service personnel who serve at a time when the post-cold-war \nworld realigns--and the national, regional, religious, and cultural \ninterests of peoples in every country are put to the test of \nsovereignty and self-determination. The courage and contribution of the \nmen and women of the foreign service in this new world deserve our \nadmiration and our respect.\n  So, Mr. President, though we are saddened by this tragedy, we are \nalso strengthened in our appreciation of the contribution of those who \nserve. To the thousands of Americans around the world who have suffered \nthe separation from families and home, from friends and loved ones, to \nembark on a great adventure to promote peace, understanding, and the \nprinciples of American foreign policy--in the name of those who have \npaid the ultimate price--we salute you.\n  Mr. President, for Jackie van Landingham and Gary Durell the \nadventure came to an end in a distant land, but for those of us at home \nwho reap the benefits of their sacrifice, their memory will never die.\n  [[Page S3696]] Mr. President, in light of this tragedy let us honor \nthe thousands of men and women in the foreign service who ask little \nfrom us, but contribute a lot. And let us pray for the speedy recovery \nof Mark McCloy, and for the friends and families of those who, \nyesterday, gave their lives in service to their country.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3695-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Pending is amendment No. 331, offered by the \nSenator from Kansas, to committee amendment beginning on page 1, line \n3.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may speak for a few moments. I \nspoke last night, when I offered my amendment, about what I regarded as \nan exceptionally important issue. I would like to go through some of \nthose same arguments again for those who might not have been in their \noffices or on the floor last night.\n  I offered an amendment that would prevent the President's Executive \norder on striker replacements from taking effect. I offered the \namendment because I am deeply troubled by the precedents that will be \nset by this Executive order.\n  This is not a debate about whether there should or should not be the \nopportunity to replace striking workers with permanent replacement \nworkers.\n  As we debate this amendment, Mr. President, we will hear a great deal \non both sides about the use of permanent replacements. In my view, a \nban on permanent replacements will upset the fundamental balance in \nmanagement-labor relations that has existed now for 60 years. We have \ndebated this issue for three Congresses now, and I know there are \nstrongly held views on both sides.\n  That is not the only issue that is at stake here. The central issue \nbefore Members this morning is whether our national labor policy should \nbe determined by executive fiat rather than by an act of Congress. I \nthink this is an enormously important question, Mr. President, because \nit really does set a precedent that we should consider carefully.\n  By limiting the rights of Federal contractors to hire permanent \nreplacements, the President has, in effect, overturned 60 years of \nFederal labor law with the stroke of a pen. I am not a constitutional \nscholar. But I do know that it is the President's role to enforce the \nlaws, not to make them. By issuing this Executive order, the President \nhas, in my view, overstepped his bounds.\n  For the first time, to my knowledge, the President has issued an \nExecutive order that contravenes current law. The order will \neffectively prohibit one group, Federal contractors, from taking action \nthat every other company is legally permitted to do under current law.\n  Regardless of what one thinks about the merits of the striker \nreplacement issue, we should all be concerned about the precedent that \nthis order will set. For example, what if a President decided to debar \nFederal contractors whose workers decided to go on strike?\n  Mr. President, the right to strike is legal, just as the right to \nhire permanent replacement workers for striking workers is legal. So it \ncould eventually affect both sides of the coin if indeed we are going \nto start down this slippery slope.\n  Supporters of the President's action should think twice about the \nprecedent this will set for future administrations that wish to alter \nlabor law through the Federal procurement process. We will hear in the \ncourse of this debate that this Executive order is nothing new, that \nsuch orders were issued by previous administrations. The fact is that \nnone of those Executive orders ran contrary to established labor law.\n  For example, President Bush issued an Executive order to enforce the \nSupreme Court's Beck decision. That order merely required employers to \npost a notice to employees informing them of the law. Its purpose was \nto enforce the law as set by Congress and interpreted by the courts.\n  No one's rights were infringed. No congressional policy was violated. \nNo new rights were established. No existing rights were taken away. By \ncontrast, this new Executive order overturns a legal right that has \nexisted for 60 years and undermines the existing framework of our \nFederal labor law which Congress, for decades, has declined to change.\n  Mr. President, we all have sympathy for the situations occurring in \nplants today where there have been long ongoing strikes. We have \nsympathy for the hardships striking workers face. But I am a strong \nsupporter of the collective bargaining process. If indeed we tie one \nhand behind our back, whether it is for strikers or for employers, we \nhave harmed the collective bargaining process.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the fine print of this Executive \norder. It sets out a new and unprecedented enforcement and regulatory \nscheme, all without the slightest input of Congress. The Executive \norder gives the Secretary of Labor the power to determine violations of \nthe order, a power which Congress in similar circumstances has \ndelegated to the National Labor Relations Board.\n  In addition, the Executive order gives the Secretary of Labor \nauthority to write new regulations on who will be subject to the order. \nNot only does the Executive order circumvent Congress by making a new \nlaw, it also creates more new regulations.\n  According to the Washington Post today, at least part of the \nadministration's motivation for issuing the Executive order stems from \nrecent strikes such as Bridgestone/Firestone Co. We can all appreciate \nthe emotions and upheavals that occur in any labor dispute. They are \ntroubling to each and every one of us whether it occurs in our State or \nnot. Just weeks ago the Senate overwhelmingly rejected a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution urging intervention in the Bridgestone dispute.\n  Here again, the administration has chosen to go around Congress by \nthis Executive order. Many on both sides feel quite strongly about the \nissue of striker replacements. I believe existing law provides an \nappropriate balance between the interests of management and labor. But \nwe will also hear from those who oppose this amendment because they \nbelieve that using striker replacements is inherently unfair.\n  That issue will be debated, I am sure, at another time. We have done \nso in the past. Mr. President, that misses the point. Regardless of \nwhat we believe about striker replacements, it is up to Congress and \nnot the President to set our national labor policy through legislation. \nWe should not relinquish that authority by permitting this Executive \norder to stand.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment being \noffered by the Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairwoman, Senator \nKassebaum, which would prohibit funding for the implementation of the \nPresident's Executive order which was signed yesterday.\n  What does that Executive order do? It bars Federal contractors from \nhiring permanent replacement workers during an economic strike. A \nsimilar prohibition has already been included in the FEMA supplemental \nappropriation bill which is pending in the House.\n  In the event of a finding that permanent replacement workers are used \nin \n[[Page S3697]] any Federal contract exceeding $100,000, which is about \n90 percent of the dollar value of all Federal contracts--in other \nwords, this in effect covers all Federal contracts--the Executive order \nauthorizes the Secretary of Labor to instruct affected agencies to \nterminate such contracts, if convenient.\n  While the Secretary may not compel agency compliance, he may then \nproceed to debar the contractor from receiving or performing any \nFederal contracts until the offending labor dispute is settled.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think it is regrettable that the President has \nchosen to circumvent the will of Congress on this issue. That is what \nis happening here. Legislation to prohibit businesses from hiring \npermanent replacement workers was the subject of a bipartisan \nfilibuster in 1992 and again in 1994. This matter has come before this \nbody twice in the last 3 years.\n  Senators feel very strongly that overturning this Supreme Court \ndecision of Mackay Radio, 1938--which was some 55 years ago--either \noverturning that by legislation or by Executive order, many Senators \nbelieve would undermine the very foundation of modern labor relations \npolicy. Namely, the collective bargaining process. In Mackay Radio the \nSupreme Court held that employers had the right to maintain business \noperations with the replacement workers in the event of an economic \nstrike. That is what the Court said. Just as affected employees have \nthe right to strike for better wages or benefits.\n  The change proposed would eliminate, in our judgment, any incentive \nfor good-faith negotiation and bargaining and create an unlevel playing \nfield to the detriment of the employers.\n  Now, the bottom line, Mr. President, is that the President's \nExecutive order would force Federal contractors hit with a strike to \naccept union economic demands or face the prospect of a prolonged \nshutdown that could prove fatal to these companies. Alternatively, such \nbusinesses could elect to abandon the Federal contractual marketplace \naltogether.\n  One, that is an unlikely option for some of our large contractors; \ntwo, it is bad for our country. We do not want to eliminate prospective \nbidders. We want to have more bidders, and hopefully that would be \nachieved. That is what we seek. Certainly not possible under this \nlegislation.\n  Now, Senators also feel strongly that this is a question of labor-\nmanagement policy. This is not a procurement issue. The President \nsomehow in order to achieve his goal put this in the terms of \nprocurement issue. It is a labor-management policy, a labor-management \nsituation.\n  The Congress, not the executive branch, must initiate any changes in \nour labor laws--that is where this matter belongs, in the Congress of \nthe United States--and a change of the kind the President has proposed \nis clearly ill-advised and unwarranted. For this reason, I am certain \nthat the President's decision to go forward with this Executive order \nwill be challenged in the Federal courts.\n  H.R. 889, which is the legislation before us--not the amendment, but \nthe basic bill we are debating today--provides urgently needed funding \nto the Department of Defense to shore up sagging readiness and to \nreimburse for services for unexpected contingencies in Haiti, in the \nPersian Gulf, and other hot spots of the world. It would be \nunfortunate, I believe, to delay this funding over the striker \nreplacement issue, but the President's decision has left the Senate no \nalternative but to rehash this issue again and to prohibit its \nimplementation, if possible.\n  The President's Executive order, in our judgment, for those of us who \noppose the ban on striker replacements, is a job-killing one which, if \nleft to stand, would harm our economy, would increase labor strife, \nwould reduce productivity, and weaken the competitiveness of U.S. \nindustry. Thus, I will vote for the Kassebaum amendment to prohibit its \nimplementation, and I urge my colleagues to support the Senator from \nKansas likewise. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kansas. We will have an opportunity to debate the \namendment, but I was interested in listening to the Senator from Kansas \ntalk about the procedure which is being followed by the President and \nhow this was, in effect, overriding existing law. I think that the \nexamples that were touched on briefly, last night regarding the \nissuance of Executive orders or other examples that have been mentioned \nthat were utilized by President Bush, for example, were of a different \nnature.\n  I take issue because prehiring agreements are basically legal and the \nExecutive order by President Bush effectively excluded prehiring \nagreements, any prehiring agreement under Federal contract. It was thus \nin complete conflict with the existing law. We know that, because the \ndefinitive case at issue involving a prehiring agreement involved all \nof the work being done on Boston Harbor. That agreement was entered \ninto and was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court. It is, at the \npresent time, working, and working extremely effectively, I might add. \nI will not take the time of the Senate right now to go into how \neffective that particular agreement has been in terms of the saving of \nresources and taxpayers' funds. But an effort to prevent prehire \nagreements certainly was an action that was taken by the previous \nadministration, and I did not hear the chorus rise up at the time and \ntalk about exceeding the authority and responsibility of the executive \nbranch in moving ahead to address that issue. To the contrary, there \nwas broad support for the President's action in that area.\n  But I would like to just take a few moments to put this amendment in \nsome perspective. I think all of us understand the urgency and the \nimportance of the underlying legislation and the importance of having \nit concluded at an early time. This legislation is important to our \nnational security and national defense, a matter which has been raised \nby the Senator from Kansas. The Senator raises an important public \npolicy matter with her amendment. I would have thought we would have \naddressed it in some other forum, although we will certainly welcome \nthe opportunity to debate this because it is an extremely important \nissue affecting workers' rights. It is more of an effort, I feel--I do \nnot want to draw conclusions in terms of the motivations of it--a real \nattempt to embarrass the President of the United States who has issued \nthis proclamation on behalf of working families.\n  I think if we look over the period of just recent times, both on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and also in our committee systems and also \nactions in the House, we find out, if we have a chance to go into it, \nthat this is just one more step that is being taken by the majority in \nthe House and Senate to undermine the very legitimate interests and \nrights of working families in this country. But I will have a chance to \naddress that issue in just a few moments.\n  But let me bring focus to the particular matter which is before us in \nthe form of the Senator's amendment. Our Republican colleagues have \nasserted that we need to act because the President has exceeded his \nauthority by acting on a labor relations issue without specific \ncongressional authority and that Congress has already rejected the \nPresident's action through last year's vote on S. 55, the Workplace \nFairness Act.\n  In fact, a majority, Mr. President, in both Houses of Congress, \nsupported making it unlawful for any employer to use permanent \nreplacements. The ban was not enacted because a minority of the Senate \nwas able to prevent the consideration of S. 55, but Congress never \nrejected the lesser step of prohibiting the use of permanent \nreplacements by Federal contractors. We never addressed that issue. \nThere was majority support to address this issue in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was bipartisan. There was majority support to \nreaddress the whole striker replacement issue in the Senate, but a \nsmall minority was able to defeat that action and defeat that policy \nquestion. No action was taken on the particular authority of the \nPresident to take the action which he did yesterday.\n  President Clinton's action, in issuing this order, is simply an \nexercise of his well-recognized authority over procurement and \ncontracting by the executive branch authorities, an authority that was \nexercised both by President \n[[Page S3698]] Reagan and President Bush, with no objections from those \nwho are now expressing such dismay.\n  In 1992, President Bush issued two Executive orders dealing with \nFederal contractor labor relations which are clear precedents for \nPresident Clinton's action, which many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle applauded rather than condemned.\n  The first of those two Executive orders required all unionized \nFederal contractors to post a notice in their workplace informing all \nemployees that they could not be required to join a union and that they \nhad a right to refuse to pay dues for any purpose unrelated to \ncollective bargaining.\n  Those requirements are not requirements of the National Labor \nRelations Act, and not only were they never enacted by Congress, but \nproposed legislation to establish such rules had so little support that \nit was never even reported from the committee. Indeed, when President \nBush issued that Executive order, his press secretary pointed to \nCongress' failure to act on the legislation as the President's reason \nfor acting.\n  That is in dramatic contrast to the current situation on the whole \nquestion of permanent replacement where a majority of the Members of \nthe House and even a majority of the Members of the Senate were \nprepared to act, wanted to act, and that action was foreclosed by a \nsmall group of Members in the Senate. In contrast to this situation, \nthey could not even get the support for that particular proposal to get \nthe measure out of committee.\n  So was there objection at that time either from the Senator from \nKansas or others? Were there any protests from my Republican \ncolleagues? There were not. It is clear that the objections that are \nnow being raised to President Clinton's action are not based on \nprinciple or a consistent view of the President's authority with \nrespect to labor relations in Federal procurement.\n  The second of the two Bush Executive orders on Federal contractor \nlabor relations issued in October 1992 dealt with prehiring agreements, \ncollective bargaining agreements that establish labor standards for \nconstruction work prior to the hiring of workers.\n  Prehire agreements are common in the construction industry and lawful \nunder the National Labor Relations Act, yet President Bush, without any \nspecific authorization by Congress, prohibited Federal contractors from \nentering into such agreements for work on Federal projects.\n  Did my Republican colleague object to the fact that President Bush \nwas prohibiting a labor relations practice that Congress had chosen to \npermit? She did not, and neither did any of the other Republican \nSenators.\n  What is this really all about? The truth is that this debate is a \ncontinuation of our debates in the past two Congresses on the Workplace \nFairness Act. Only now the shoe is on the other foot and it is clearly \npinching our Republican friends. They forced us to get 60 votes to pass \nthe act, which we were unable to do.\n  The basic principle behind the President's action has strong public \nsupport. In the latest poll from Fingerhut Associates, 64 percent of \nrespondents said that once a majority of workers have voted to strike, \ncompanies should not be allowed to hire permanent replacements to take \ntheir jobs. The American people understand that this is a question of \nsimple justice for workers.\n  That is what the issue is about, simple justice for workers.\n  It is unlawful for any employer to fire a worker for exercising the \nright to strike, and it should be equally unlawful for an employer to \nbe able to deprive a striking worker of his job by permanently \nreplacing that worker. It is as simple as that.\n  Repeatedly, when we are debating economic legislation and U.S. \ncompetitiveness in the world economy, Senators from both sides of the \naisle praise the high productivity of American workers, their excellent \nskills, and their pride in their work. Yet much of the legislation we \npass ignores the importance of treating American workers fairly. The \nExecutive order is for the American worker. It will restore the balance \nof power intended between management and labor under the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  Basically, the striker replacement legislation was to restore the \nbalance which had existed for years and contributed so mightily in \nterms of our whole economic progress and our industrial strength. That \nbalance has been shifted and changed in recent times with the strike \nreplacement activities of a number of employers, and that has \ndiminished the economic standing of American workers who continue to be \nthe backbone of the American economy.\n  That farsighted act, the National Labor Relations Act, signed into \nlaw by President Roosevelt in 1935 as the cornerstone of the New Deal, \nrecognized the inherent inequality between the ineffective bargaining \npower of a lone worker seeking to improve wages and working conditions \nand the overwhelming bargaining power of the employer.\n  As part of comprehensive legislation enacting the fundamental goals \nof national labor policy, the 1935 act guaranteed the rights of workers \nto form and join labor organizations and engage in collective \nbargaining with their employers. The act gave workers strength in \nnumbers. It gave them countervailing power, capable of matching the \npower of the employers.\n  As the Supreme Court said in 1935 in a landmark decision upholding \nthe constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act, long ago we \nstated the reason for labor organizations. We said they were organized \nout of the necessities of the situation, that a single employee was \nhelpless in dealing with an employer, and that he was dependent \nordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and his \nfamily; that if the employer refused to pay him the wages that he \nthought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employer's employ \nand resist arbitrary and unfair treatment; that the union was essential \nto give laborers an opportunity to deal on an equal basis with the \nemployer.\n  Today, as much as ever, the employees need the right to organize to \nimprove their wages, working conditions, and enter into a dialog with \ntheir employers about how work should be arranged so that the firm can \nachieve its productivity, its profitability goals, while at the same \ntime ensuring fair treatment for workers. But the right to organize and \nbargain collectively is only a hollow promise if management is allowed \nto use the tactic of permanently replacing the workers that go on \nstrike.\n  No one likes strikes, least of all the strikers who lose their wages \nduring any strike and risk the loss of health coverage and other \nbenefits. Because both workers and employers have a mutual interest in \navoiding economic losses, the overwhelming majority of collective \nbargaining disputes are settled without a strike, but the right to \nstrike helps to ensure that a fair economic bargain is reached between \nemployers and workers.\n  The labor laws give workers the right to join together to combine \ntheir strength, and the union movement has been responsible for many of \nthe gains that workers have achieved in the past half century. The \nprocess of collective bargaining works. It prevents workers from being \nexploited and has created a productive balance of power between \nmanagement and labor. And the cornerstone of collective bargaining is \nthe right to strike. That right is nullified by the practice of \npermanently replacing workers who go on strike. The entire process of \ncollective bargaining is undermined.\n  That is basically what is at issue here, as I described. That is the \nbasic and fundamental matter of principle that is before the Senate \ntoday. It is as old as the debate in terms of our whole industrial \ndevelopment and strength as a country, and it is basic and fundamental \nto the issues of economic justice and social progress in our country. \nThat is why it is such a principal issue that has to be addressed today \nand why it will need discussion and debate.\n  Both the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act \nexplicitly prohibited employers from firing employees who exercised \ntheir right to strike. As a result of a loophole created by the Supreme \nCourt half a century ago but seldom used until recent years, the \npractice of permanently replacing striker workers allows employers to \nachieve the same result. The ability to hire permanent replacements \ntilts the balance unfairly in favor of business in labor/management \nrelations, and it is \n[[Page S3699]] no surprise that business is lobbying hard to block this \nExecutive order.\n  Hiring permanent replacements encourages intransigence by management \nin negotiating with labor. It encourages employers to replace current \nworkers with new workers willing to settle for less and to accept \nsmaller pay checks and other benefits. The Executive order will help \nrestore the balance that has been distorted in recent years. It will \nreaffirm the original promise of the statutes and give workers the \nright to bargain collectively and participate in peaceful activity in \nfurtherance of their goals without fear of being fired.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in the Mackay Radio case in 1938 is a \nsource of the current problem, even though the issue is not squarely \nraised in the case itself. In Mackay, the Court ruled it was unlawful \nfor an employer to refuse to reinstate striking union leaders when the \nemployer had reinstated other striking union members. The Court refused \nto allow the employer to discriminate between strike leaders and other \nstrikers. It ordered the employer to put the permanently replaced \nstriking union leaders back to work. In fact, the Supreme Court did not \neven have before it the issue of the legality of permanently replacing \nstriking workers, but language in the decision condoning the employer's \nhiring of permanent replacements has been interpreted as permitting the \npractice as long as the employer does not use it in a discriminatory \nway.\n  This aspect of the Mackay decision had no significant impact on labor \nrelations for nearly half a century. Few employers resorted to \npermanent replacements or even threatened to use that tactic. Employers \nand workers had a mutual understanding that strikes are only temporary \ndisruptions in an ongoing satisfactory relationship. Businesses \nresponded to strikes in various ways, by having supervisors perform the \nwork, by hiring temporary replacements, and by shutting down \noperations. Employers acted on the belief that their work force was \nvaluable and not easily replaced and that once the temporary labor \ndispute was over, the two sides would resume the collective bargaining \nrelationship that brought the benefits and stability to each.\n  In fact, a survey by the Wharton Business School in 1982 revealed \nthat most employers found no need to hire any replacements during a \nstrike. Many believed that hiring even temporary replacements was \nundesirable because it would make the settlement of the strike and \nresumption of stable labor relations more difficult after the dispute, \nand under those circumstances there was no need to seek a change in the \nlaw.\n  But in the 1970's and 1980's, this de facto pattern began to change, \nand most observers feel that the strongest signal for change came in \n1981 when President Reagan summarily dismissed the PATCO, air traffic \ncontrollers who went on strike and permanent replacements were hired by \nthe FAA.\n  The increased use of permanent replacements in recent years has been \nconfirmed by a survey of the NLRB decisions and other reported cases. \nDuring the four decades from 1935 to 1973, the survey found an average \nof 6 strikes a year in which permanent replacements were used, but the \nnumber quadrupled to an average of 23 strikes per year for the period \n1974 through 1991.\n  Mr. President, I have other remarks but I see my friend from Illinois \nand also Wisconsin on the floor. I know other colleagues are here, so I \nwill yield in just a few moments and then come back and continue my \ndiscussion of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I am somewhat troubled by the whole pattern that has \nbeen developed in the period of these last several weeks and what it \nmeans for working families in this country. I cannot help but conclude \nthat the actions that we have before us in the proposal of my good \nfriend, the Senator from Kansas, is not unrelated to a whole stream of \nactivities and statements and comments that have been made about the \ncondition of working families in this Nation that are really the \nbackbone of our country.\n  I can think of the recent discussion and debate that we had on an \nissue which is as basic and fundamental as the increase in the minimum \nwage. The origins of this minimum wage go back in time to a similar \nperiod that we had discussed, with the development of the National \nLabor Relations Act, where it was generally understood in the United \nStates of America that if an individual member of the family was \nprepared to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, that member was \ngoing to have a sufficient income so they would not be in poverty, so \ntheir children would not be in poverty, so that their wife would not be \nin poverty or their husband would not be in poverty--that they would \nnot be in poverty. They would effectively be able to own their own \nhome--hopefully be able to pay a mortgage--provide for their children, \nlive with some sense of dignity and some sense of a future.\n  That was a part of the whole social compact that was basically \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats alike for a considerable period \nof time. It really lost its thrust in the period of the 1980's, when an \nincrease in the minimum wage was vetoed. Eventually a compromise was \nreached. We had an incremental addition of a 45-cent and a 45-cent \nincrease in the minimum wage, and we saw that increase go into effect. \nAnd all of the various suggestions and recommendations that had been \nmade about the loss of jobs failed to develop. What happened was that \nhard-working Americans--overwhelmingly women in our society; close to \n75 percent of the people who earn the minimum wage are women in our \nsociety--they were able, not really to make it but to at least continue \nto work and to try to provide for their children. Make no mistake, the \nissue of minimum wage is an issue for children in our society as well \nas for those individuals who are working to make the minimum wage.\n  So a number of us introduced legislation to just raise the minimum \nwage--we thought 50 cents, 50 cents, 50 cents--over the period of the \nnext 3 years to try to regain the concept that for a working family, \nwork was going to pay, and that people who were prepared to work would \nbe able to make sufficient income to provide for their families. Then \nwe cut that back to 45 cents and 45 cents. These are effectively the \nsame amounts that were accepted previously and supported by a President \nand supported in this body overwhelmingly, by Republicans and \nDemocrats, and signed into law by a Republican President. We thought if \nwe had that ability with a Republican President and a Democratic House \nand a Democratic Senate, that at least we would be able to do the same \nwith a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic \nPresident. We thought with a signing into law of 45 cents and 45 cents \nwe would get back effectively to where we were in terms of purchasing \npower, to the purchasing power that would be available to families that \nhad received the minimum wage a number of years ago, in the late \n1980's--1989, 1990--under a law signed by President Bush.\n  We had the Republican leadership condemn this measure, saying they \nwere unalterably opposed to the increase. Some even expressed \nopposition to any minimum wage. And we have been trying to see how we \nmight be able to make that a part of the real Contract With America--\nthe real Contract With America: Rewarding work. Rewarding work.\n  We do not need a great deal of hearings on that measure. I know I \nattended one, of the Joint Economic Committee, between the House and \nSenate. It was very interesting. The overwhelming number of independent \nstudies, of 11 independent studies that reviewed the history of the \nminimum wage increase, showed no effective loss of jobs. All we have to \ndo is look historically at the seven increases in the minimum wage \nsince the time it had been actually implemented, and we find the same \nresult. Nonetheless we have the harshness and the criticism of any \nincrease, in terms of the minimum wage. So we have that out there on \nthe deck for the working families.\n  If you had a little scorecard you could say, all right, now let us \nalso try and repeal what the President did for working families on this \nExecutive order: Opposition to that. You could write underneath it: \nOpposition to the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Then we come back to hearings in our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee about the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Program. All the Davis-\nBacon Program says is we are going to have a \n[[Page S3700]] prevailing wage in various Federal contracting so the \nGovernment will have a neutral role, in terms of wages, in terms of \nperformance of various work.\n  We have the assault on the Davis-Bacon Program. Who is affected by \nthe Davis-Bacon Program? The worker's average income is $26,000 a year. \nWhat have we done to workers that are making $26,000 a year, in some of \nthe most dangerous work in America? Outside of mining, construction is \none of the two or three most dangerous employments in our country. Mr. \nPresident, $26,000 a year, and we are declaring war on those families.\n  No, we are not going to give working families a minimum wage \nincrease. No, we are not even going to give the protections for a \nfamily earning $26,000 a year that wants to work in construction and \nbuild America--no, that is too much for those individuals.\n  So we say OK, we are not going to permit the President to protect \nworkers on Federal contracts that are being threatened with permanent \nstrike replacements, which have been part of our industrial tradition. \nWe are against the minimum wage. Now we are against those workers.\n  Not only are we against those workers but we have a new gimmick. We \nare having what we call 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, to \ntry to promote company unions. We are not satisfied that the working \nrelationship between employers and employees is a balance. We want \nsomething different. Sure, we had that matter discussed by \ndistinguished and thoughtful men and women on the Dunlop Commission, \nbut they did not recommend a unilateral action in terms of section \n8(a)(2). They did not recommend that particular measure. They \nunderstood what was at risk on this measure. We have those who are \ntrying to undermine even the heart and the soul of the concept of \nworkers being able to come together to at least exercise their rights \nfor economic gain. That is out there. So we have that on the table as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is look at what has happened to \nworkers' interests over the period of the last 12 or the last 15 years. \nOn the one hand you see the extraordinary rise in profits--and we are \nall thankful that we have American companies and corporations that are \nbeing successful and being able to compete internationally and are \nexperiencing some of the greatest profits in the history of this \ncountry. But it is virtually flat in terms of real wages and take-home \npay for working families. It is virtually flat, if not diminished, in \nterms of the entry-level jobs and jobs at the bottom, effectively, 65 \nor 70 percent of workers who are out there. It is effectively flat or \nbeing reduced.\n  Every day their financial interests are being assaulted out there. \nInstead of being out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate saying: Look, \nthey are the men and women who are the backbone of this country, what \ncan we do to try to make sure that they are going to be able to live in \nsome peace and dignity and respect? We cannot even wait a few hours in \norder to tag an amendment on something which is vital to our national \nsecurity and begin the debate to diminish them. That is what this \ndebate is all about: Do not let them get ahead a little bit, in spite \nof the fact that under the previous administration, under the Bush \nadministration, they issued Executive orders and those that are \nsupporting this particular proposal were then silent--for example with \nregard to the prehearing agreement.\n  The prehiring agreement was legal. He made it illegal. I do not want \nto hear talk about going beyond or exceeding the authority of the power \nof the President. I mean, give us a break, Mr. President, in terms of \nthis measure. We know what it is about. I think the American people \nought to understand it.\n  What is it about working families? Not only their interest, but what \nis it about their children? They are trying to raise the cost of their \nchildren going to college, raise the cost of the interest on those \nloans while those kids are going on to the universities and colleges \nacross this country, raise that $20 billion over a period of 10 years, \nraise that $20 billion so that every son and daughter of that working \nfamily that is hardly able to put it together is going to pay even \nmore. No; do not try to find ways to try to make it easier for the sons \nand daughters to continue on and get a higher education understanding \nthat what you learn is related to what you earn. Make it more \ndifficult.\n  This has been established as a matter of discussion and debate at the \nvarious Budget Committees and in the House Appropriations Committee. \nMake it more difficult. That is not bad enough. For their younger \nbrothers and sisters who are going to school, they take their school \nlunch away from them. What is it about, Mr. President? What is it about \nthis whole concept, whether it is the Contract With America or whatever \nit is, that is declaring war on working families? War on the children \nin terms of the kids and whether they are getting fed, or whether that \nkid may need a summer job. Eliminate all the summer jobs.\n  They eliminated 13,000 summer jobs in my State of Massachusetts. \nThose summer jobs came in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. I think we \nshould learn a lesson. We wanted to try to get young people at the time \nwhen they are not involved in school to try to get them starting to do \nsomething gainful such as employment. They eliminate those summer jobs.\n  So they take away something that those younger brothers and sisters \ncan eat and take away the employment in time of summer. Take that away. \nCut back on the education programs. Say to the mayors of the various \ncities that are trying to do something in various areas of working \nfamilies with their community development block grant programs, we are \ngoing to cut that as well. We are going to make it more difficult for \nyou to try to make life somewhat better in terms of the inner cities.\n  Sure, Mr. President, we have to get our handle on the costs of \nescalating Government expenditures. But my good friend from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, said it more wisely than I have heard here on the floor \nof U.S. Senate for some period of time. That is, you are never going to \ndo it until you reform the health care system. You are never going to \ndo it until you reform the health care system. Health care costs are \ngoing up at 10 or 11 percent, double the rate of inflation. It does not \nmake sense just to put a cap on those Medicare and Medicaid costs \nbecause all you will do is transfer it to the private sector with all \nits inefficiency and back to those communities in all those cities that \nhave those emergency rooms in inner cities. It is going to cause even \nmore distress and poor outcomes in terms of health results as well as \nthe cost of it. This is the serious matter of trying to do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I see my colleagues here on the floor. I hope that \nwe will have a chance to focus on precisely this amendment. I think it \nunderlines some basic kinds of protections which are not going to solve \nall of the problems that we are facing in terms of working families. \nBut it seems to me at some time we just have to say we have had enough. \nWe have had enough in terms of the continued assault on working \nfamilies in this country. It is only the beginning of March.\n  We have only just touched very briefly on some of the measures that \nare going to affect the children. Cut back on the day care programs; \nday care programs for working families. Only about 5 or 6 percent of \nthe needs are being met today, and we get a recommendation to cut back \non those programs as well. So you are a mother. You want to go out and \nwork. You are not going to be able to get any day care for your kids, \nas inadequate as it is today.\n  What is this common sense? What is it about the families that have \nchildren in our society that are the subject and the target of this \nkind of an attitude? It makes no sense.\n  This measure that we have now before us is related to that whole \nconcept. It is unwise in terms of policy. It is unwise in terms of the \ninterests of the workers that it is going to protect.\n  I will have more to say about it later in the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Kassebaum). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nthink it is not in the national interest.\n  [[Page S3701]] I simply remind my colleague from Kansas, who is the \nchief sponsor of the amendment, and all of my colleagues that \nconsistency is not necessarily the virtue of any of us in this body. \nBut I remind my colleague from Kansas, who is now the Presiding \nOfficer, that on January 6 of this year, 2 months and 3 days ago I \nintroduced a resolution, a sense of the Senate--nothing nearly as \nsweeping as the Kassebaum amendment--which simply said to the \nBridgestone/Firestone Co., a wholly owned Japanese subsidiary with \n4,200 workers, they ought to get together and have talks and not have \nthe permanent replacement.\n  At that point, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, who is my \nfriend, with whom I enjoy working on African issues and many other \nthings, said:\n\n       I know the Senator from Illinois is well-intentioned. But \n     this is neither the time nor the place for Congress to be \n     considering anything other than this very important bill \n     which is before us. The amendment offered by the Senator from \n     Illinois is completely extraneous from the matter at hand, \n     and for that reason alone I believe the Senate should table \n     his amendment.\n\n  If I may use the words of the Senator from Kansas, and just modify \nthem slightly, I would say the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKansas ``is completely extraneous from the matter at hand, and for that \nreason alone I believe the Senate should table her amendment.''\n  Her words were heeded by this body, and by a narrow margin that \namendment was defeated. I hope this amendment will be defeated. It is \npart of what Senator Kennedy was just talking about.\n  We have a very fundamental philosophical decision to make in \nGovernment--whether Government is going to help the wealthy and \npowerful, or whether it is going to help those who really struggle. My \nstrong belief is the wealthy and powerful do a pretty good job of \ntaking care of themselves, particularly with the system of campaign \nfinancing that we have in this country. And what we ought to be doing \nis trying to help people who struggle. This amendment goes in the \nopposite direction.\n  I point out that in the United States today only 16 percent of our \nwork force is organized by labor unions. No other Western \nindustrialized democracy has anywhere near that low a figure. If you \nexclude the governmental unions, that number drops down to 11.8 \npercent.\n  Not too long ago, George Shultz, the distinguished former Secretary \nof State and Secretary of Labor, made a speech that was quoted in the \nNew York Times in which he said things are out of balance in our \ncountry, that the fact that labor union membership is so low, so small \nin our country, is not a healthy thing for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I agree with him completely. I think we need greater balance. That is \nthe word that ought to be part of our dialog here.\n  The reality is that we had pretty good balance in labor-management \nrelations over the years, since the early 1930's. When a Democrat came \nin, the National Labor Relations Board shifted a little bit on the side \nof labor, and when the Republicans came in, it would shift a little \nmore on the side of management; but it was a pretty good balance. Then \nRonald Reagan became President, and all of a sudden it got way out of \nbalance. That has done real harm to labor-management relations in our \ncountry.\n  The minimum wage that Senator Kennedy talked about is one part of \nproviding a little balance. Real candidly, I think the minimum wage \nwould do more in terms of welfare reform than any of the bills that I \nsee before us that are labeled ``welfare reform'' right now.\n  But in terms of permanent striker replacement, I mentioned \nBridgestone/Firestone, a Japanese-owned corporation. Permanent striker \nreplacement is illegal in Japan; it is illegal in Italy, it is illegal \nin Germany; it is illegal in France; it is illegal in Denmark; it is \nillegal in Norway; it is illegal in Sweden. I do not know what \ncountries I have skipped now, but the only countries outside of the \nUnited States of America where it is legal--the only democracies where \nit is legal to fire permanent strikers are Great Britain, Hong Kong, \nand Singapore. In every other Western industrialized democracy, that \nkind of action is illegal. Traditionally, we just have not done that in \nour country. I do not think we ought to be moving down that line. I \nthink the President's action provides a little balance that is needed.\n  Let me add, Madam President, if this amendment is adopted, I am going \nto have a series of amendments on labor law reform. For example, if you \nhave a pattern and practice of violating the civil rights laws of this \ncountry, you cannot get a Federal contract. I think it ought to be the \nlaw in this country that if you had a pattern and practice of violating \nlabor laws, you should not be able to get a Federal contract. I think \nif you have a pattern and practice of violating worker safety laws, you \nshould not be able to get a Federal contract.\n  When you organize--in Canada, for example, if you want to organize a \nplant or site, you have 30 days in which a majority of people can--the \n30 days comes after you get the majority of people. You get a majority \nof people to sign cards and pay $1, and 30 days after that, that plant \nor site is organized. In the United States, it can draw out for 7 years \nbefore a plant is organized, and in the meantime, an employer, for all \npractical purposes, has the legal right to fire people for their union \nactivity.\n  There are a whole series of things that can be done. If this \namendment is adopted, we are going to have other amendments in this \narea. But I would get back to the fundamental point that my colleague \nfrom Kansas made to me when I proposed an amendment, which was just a \nsense of the Senate and had no permanent implication, as this one does, \nwhen she says, ``The amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois is \ncompletely extraneous from the matter at hand, and for that reason \nalone, I believe the Senate should table his amendment.''\n  The Senate listened to her then. I hope they will listen to her words \nnow and table the amendment of the Senator from Kansas.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I did not expect to spend much time on \nthe floor today discussing the subject of permanent striker \nreplacement. As we have seen, we have had eloquent speeches by Members \nof the minority who have set forth an issue for us which was led to by \naction of the President just recently and the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  I rise in favor of that amendment. Like many of my colleagues, I \nthought we had put this issue to bed last year when both the House and \nSenate considered S. 55 and it was rejected, or never even left the \ndesk in the Senate.\n  President Clinton made his support of this type of legislation clear \nduring the 1992 election campaign, and he and Secretary of Labor Reich \nhave reaffirmed their commitment to a striker replacement bill on \nnumerous occasions since. Clearly, the President would have signed a \ncongressional bill if it had been laid on his desk. However, as we \nknow, S. 55 never left the Senate desk.\n  The President certainly is free to attempt another legislative push \nfor a bill like S. 55. I would not welcome the attempt, but it would be \nwell within the normal flow of our governmental process for him to do \nso.\n  However, it is abnormal, unusual, and unprecedented for President \nClinton to address this issue through the Executive order he issued \nyesterday.\n  The legal arguments against the President's action are many and \ncompelling. Congress has spoken consistently on this subject in the \ncontext of the National Labor Relations Act for over half a century.\n  In 1938, the Supreme Court handed down the Mackay Radio decision \nauthorizing permanent replacement of economic strikers. Since then \nCongress has considered amendments to the act several times, but it has \nnever approved overturning Mackay.\n  So it is important to remember this, because as we go forward and \ntalk about Executive orders and the power of Executive orders, it must \nbe remembered that this present law is consistent with a U.S. Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  An Executive order that directly contravenes the express will of \nCongress \n[[Page S3702]] calls into question significant separation of powers \nissues under the Constitution. For the past several weeks, we have \nheard very powerful arguments on the importance of this separation of \npowers in the context of the balanced budget amendment, and I expect we \nwill hear more when we soon turn to consideration of the line-item \nveto.\n  These arguments, while perhaps valid, are speculative. In the case of \nthe Executive order in question, the challenge is clear and present. An \nExecutive, frustrated by legislative inaction, is seeking to accomplish \nby Executive order what has been explicitly denied him by the \nlegislatures and which is inconsistent with the U.S. Supreme Court \ndecision. I hope those of my colleagues who have been concerned about \nthe issue of the separation of powers will see fit to support the \nKassebaum amendment, regardless of their views on the merits of the \nlegislation banning permanent replacements.\n  This is not to say that the President cannot use Executive authority \nto attach conditions to parties entering into contracts with the \nFederal Government. But that power has generally been used to force or \nencourage contractors to do something that is consistent with existing \nlaw or policy.\n  By contrast, the present order would deny contractors the right to \ntake action which is authorized under the National Labor Relations Act, \nwhich has been upheld by the National Labor Relations Board and the \nSupreme Court, and which Congress has repeatedly refused to outlaw. \nThus, the President's order swims upstream against the current of \nexisting law and policy. In doing so, it is unprecedented and \nunsupportable.\n  Legal arguments aside, perhaps the most compelling evidence on the \nweakness of this policy comes from the administration itself. We \nwitnessed, or more accurately did not witness, a stealth signing \nceremony, where partisans were invited but the press was excluded.\n  In fact, the defense of the policy from the White House gives \n``weak'' a bad name. Ostensibly, the policy is designed to ensure the \nquality of products the Government procures. This is an extraordinary \nposition for at least two reasons.\n  First, it exhibits a total lack of faith in the Government \nprocurement process. Apparently, all the administration's efforts to \nretool the procurement process have produced and Edsel, as it \napparently will be unable to distinguish and reject faulty products in \nthe absence of this Executive order. This is a very sad commentary on \nGSA, the Department of Defense, and every contracting agency.\n  But even if we could believe this sad state of affairs, it belies a \nfundamental misunderstanding of the dynamics of a strike. The \nalternative to permanent replacement workers is not a happy stable of \nindustrious elves, but shutdowns, shorthanded shifts staffed by \nmanagers and supervisory staff, of temporary replacements. It is hard \nto see how these alternatives will result in the production of \nappreciably higher quality goods or services.\n  Back in the real world, the failure to meet standards would free the \nGovernment to contract with other providers. Future Federal contracts \nmight be jeopardized as a result of failure to live up to contract \nterms. Thus, it would be a self-defeating act of the highest order for \na contractor to put itself in this position.\n  If the administration were really worried about the impact of strikes \nand permanent replacement workers on the procurement process, then it \nwould condition the receipt of Federal contracts on the assurance that \nperformance of the contract would not be interrupted by a strike. That \nstep, and that step alone, would ensure that a trained and stable work \nforce would do the work throughout the contract.\n  Doing so, of course, would be a bad idea, because it would diminish \nthe rights of one party to a collective bargaining agreement, it would \nreduce the pool of potential bidders and would likely increase costs to \nthe Federal Government. But this description applies equally well to \nthe administration's policy.\n  Madam President, I think it is clear that the President's purpose is \nnot to aid the cause of public procurement, but that of partisan \npolitics. It is a bad idea whose time will never come.\n  His action is a clear affront to the separation of powers, is of \nquestionable legality, and will ill serve labor management relations \nand the taxpayers. Given all these considerations, I strongly support \nthe amendment offered by the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and hope that \nthe vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nagree that this step, putting aside all of the partisan politics, is \njust ill-advised from the perception of the separation of powers and \nfor good policy.\n  It seems that no traditional labor law issue so galvanizes the \nactions of the interested parties as does the legislative debate on \nstriker replacements. While all can agree that this issue cuts to the \nvery heart of the collective bargaining relationship, there is wide \ndisagreement on whether a ban of replacements would help or hurt the \ninstitution of collective bargaining.\n  At the outset, Madam President, we need to agree on whether there is \na problem requiring a solution before passing that solution into law or \nmandating it by Executive order. My difficulty with the President's \norder is that I am not convinced there is a problem with the hiring of \npermanent striker replacements that requires any solution, much less \nthe absolute ban advocated by this Executive order. Moreover, even the \ndata produced in support of similar legislation over the past several \nyears are at best inconclusive on whether use of permanent replacements \nis a growing trend in the business community or that it is any more \nprevalent now than it was in the past.\n  Madam President, the impetus for this Executive order is, to a large \nextent, driven by the celebrated cases where permanent replacements \nwere used. Thus we have heard over the years about Eastern Airlines, \nGreyhound, the New York Daily News, and now Bridgestone-Firestone to \nname just a few. However, these and other examples of the use of \npermanent replacements do not suggest models of successful corporate \nstrategies. To the contrary, many of these companies have suffered \ngrinding reversals of their business fortunes, up to and including \ntotal business collapse, following the use of replacements. I do not \nbelieve that many companies will want to adopt a pattern of behavior \nwhich leads to such results. And again, of course, the statistics do \nnot show that many have chosen to do so.\n  The Clinton administration has set in motion the process of taking a \nhard look at our system of labor laws. Toward that end, a blue ribbon \nDunlop Commission was established with the mission of studying \nworkplace cooperation and recommending ways of reforming worker-\nmanagement relations to ``create an environment within which American \nbusiness can prosper.'' That Commission has now issued its report and \nrecommendations. It is significant to note that the Commission did not \nrecommend the radical change in the law on replacements that the \nPresident's Executive order mandates.\n  From the beginning of the debate on this issue, I have suggested that \nwe need to open up a broad-based discussion on the way in which labor \nrelations disputes are resolved. I am a supporter of the American \nsystem of collective bargaining and I believe, for the most part, that \nit does a good job. However, the simple truth is that system works \nbetter for everyone in times of economic expansion than it does in \nconnection with the setbacks and retrenchment found during a recession. \nThis elementary fact probably has as more to do with any increase that \nmay have occurred in replacement situations than does some fanciful \nconclusion about changes in employer attitudes brought on by President \nReagan`s handling of the air traffic controllers strike.\n  I for one would be willing to explore the options which exist in the \narea of alternative dispute resolution. We do have some history on this \nissue. There are segments of the American work force where the right to \nbargain collectively does not include the right to strike. The majority \nof these are within the public sector. In those instances, various \nsystems have been devised for resolving disputes on which the parties \nthemselves cannot agree. Perhaps it is time to begin moving away from \nthe \n[[Page S3703]] ultimate labor warfare of strikes, lockouts, and \nreplacement workers and toward some alternative system of dispute \nresolution for more of the private sector.\n  Madam President, this is not a new exercise that we engage in today. \nElements found in the bill have been seen in legislative offerings at \nleast as far back as the last big labor law reform effort in the \n1970's. Further, significant legislative battles have been waged on the \nissue in each of the past two Congresses. The fact that there has been \nno evolution toward consensus in the terms of this debate is a sad \ntestament to our collective failure to address this issue \nrealistically.\n  Given the long history of the underlying issues, and the work of the \nDunlop Commission, there are many aspects of collective bargaining that \nwe might productively reexamine. For example, it troubles me that \nunfair labor practice strikers must wait so long for a resolution of \ntheir charges. Further, it might be profitable to examine stronger \nsanctions against those who engage in unfair labor practices. And as \none who supported labor law reform in the late 1970's, I am certainly \nopen to suggestions on ways to streamline the process of deciding \nwhether or not a group of workers wishes to organize.\n  With specific regard to permanent replacement of economic strikers, \nfor the past few years I have stated that we should look at the special \ncircumstances presented in concessionary bargaining situations and \nfirst contract negotiations. As I stated on the floor of the Senate \nduring the 1992 debate, the situation presented by an employer's demand \nfor contract give backs or concessionary bargaining demands may well be \none in which the use of permanent replacements is not justified. \nAdoption of a restriction on this practice would address most, if not \nall of the instances of abuse presented to Congress as demonstrating \nthe need for legislation on this issue.\n  Similarly, in first contract negotiations, where there is no \nestablished bargaining relationship, I believe a third party \nintermediary could serve a useful role. Neither the Senate nor the \nHouse Labor Committees have examined these ideas in their handling of \nthis issue. Rather, the limited amendments which the Democratic \nmajority permitted to be offered in the House were persistently \nrejected, while in the Senate S. 55 remained almost defiantly unchanged \neven in the face of fatal opposition. In the current Congress, this \nissue is very low on the priority list for the committees of \njurisdiction.\n  Perhaps the biggest revolution since the Mackay decision in 1938 has \nbeen the shrinking of our world. We were an insular power, one of many, \nand we emerged from World War II as the greatest economic power on the \nplanet. This was not surprising given that our country was spared from \ndamage during the war. Nor is it surprising that our preeminence has \neroded in the decades that followed the war as other countries have \nrebuilt and retooled.\n  In 1938, we could afford to consider labor-management relations in \nisolation. In 1994, we no longer have that luxury.\n  Enforcement of the present Executive order will change the face of \nlabor relations in this country. Clearly that is the intent, but is it \nin the best interest of the country? That is the question. I have yet \nto hear sufficiently compelling answers to prompt me to vote for \nlegislation doing what the order attempts to do. The fact that the \nPresident has opted to proceed by Executive order does not change my \nmind or prompt my support.\n  Accordingly, while I remain open to the possibility of passing \nmeaningful and wise legislation in this area, this Executive order is \nnot such legislation. Thus, I will vote to stop its implementation and \nenforcement.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas that would prohibit the U.S. Labor Department from \nexpending funds to enforce the President's recent Executive order \nbarring Federal contracts with contractors that use permanent \nreplacements.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to follow the Senator from Illinois \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, who were extremely eloquent in \npointing out how terribly unfair this practice of the use of permanent \nreplacements really is.\n  The President has issued the Executive order, in my view, simply to \nrestore a measure of equality to Federal labor law by guaranteeing the \nworkers the right to strike without the fear of being permanently \nreplaced. In this case, it relates particularly to those whose wages \nare being paid with Federal resources, being paid by Federal taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  I do not think Federal resources should be used to put people out of \nwork. These are people who are exercising their rights under the \nFederal labor law.\n  Unfortunately, the measure of the Senator from Kansas would block the \nPresident's ability to protect these workers and companies that are \nFederal contractors.\n  Mr. President, this would be the second time in less than a year that \nthe supporters of striker replacements have used what I consider to be \nsubterfuge to undermine striking workers. In the 103d Congress, the \nopposition used parliamentary tools to prevent a vote on S. 5.\n  The Senator who is occupying the chair right now spoke a few moments \nago and said he thought we had put this permanent replacement issue to \nbed. Well, in my view, we have not done that. We have not even given it \na nap. We did not give it a chance. In fact, the American people, \nalthough some people did not like the outcome, elected a President in \n1992--he did get a majority of the electoral votes--who was openly and \nclearly committed to passing and signing a ban on the use of permanent \nreplacement workers.\n  So, no, this issue has not been put to bed. This issue has not been \ngiven a fair vote on the floor of the Senate and this issue has not \ngone away, regardless of the hopes of the folks who did prevail on \nNovember 8.\n  I believe that this particular amendment does a great disservice to \nthe working men and women of America. In my State of Wisconsin, the \nabusive use of permanent replacement workers by a few--not most, but by \na few--employers during labor disputes has a pretty long history. And \nit is an issue that I have been pretty deeply concerned about for many \nyears. In fact, when I was serving in the Wisconsin State senate, I was \nthe author of the Wisconsin striker replacement bill and had the \nopportunity to testify before a committee of the other body here when I \nwas still serving in the State Senate, asking that there be a Federal \nlaw banning the use of permanent replacement workers.\n  But the issue has not even come close to resolution. These folks, \ntrying to exercise their right, their legitimate, lawful right to \nstrike, have still been harmed and undermined by the use of permanent \nreplacement workers.\n  Mr. President, I know that the use of permanent replacements is a \nmany faceted issue. But to me at its core, this is the question that it \nraises: should workers have the right to use the strike as an economic \ndevice during times when negotiations with their employers break down? \nThat is really the question. Because that is the issue when permanent \nreplacement workers are used.\n  It effectively destroys the lawful right to strike. The National \nLabor Relations Act of 1935 clearly guarantees the right of workers to \norganize and engage in concerted activities, and included in that \nseries of rights is the right to strike.\n  Workers and management have always shared relatively equally in the \nrisks and hardships of a strike. It is no picnic for either side. \nWorkers lose income and their families, and often whole communities, \nface economic insecurity and the threat of losing their homes and their \nsavings. At the same time, a clear incentive has existed for management \nto come to an agreement, as they struggle to maintain production and \nproductivity in their market share with a more limited work force.\n  That is the relative balance that has existed in the past, prior to \nthe early 1980's. Because of that balance, as a general rule, strikes \nwere to be avoided by both sides, if possible, and that was the driving \nforce behind the success of \n[[Page S3704]] collective bargaining and peaceful negotiations.\n  For many years, even during strikes, labor and management were able \nto cooperate and come to an agreement. That is what I observed growing \nup in a very strong General Motors-UAW hometown, Janesville, WI.\n  Management now often advertises--instead of negotiating, they \nadvertise for permanent replacements, the moment a strike begins, \nsometimes even in advance. I have seen advertisements preparing to hire \na nonunion force in anticipation and, in fact, in the effort to \nprecipitate the strike.\n  The threat of permanently lost jobs casts a pall over the entire \nbargaining process and breaks down that mutual incentive to come to a \npeaceful collective agreement. Mr. President, as the power of the \nstrike becomes more and more tenuous, the voice of the labor \nnegotiators over his or her employment weakens considerably.\n  I do not believe, at a bare minimum, that Federal resources, Federal \ntax dollars, should be used to do more of this, to erode the power of \nworking people. If the use of permanent replacements is allowed in \nfederally financed work, we then become directly involved in further \nweakening the voice of the working sector of this country, or even \nmaybe worse, maybe we are in the process here of silencing the voice of \nworking people for good.\n  It reminds me, Mr. President, of an act of kicking someone when they \nare down. I am not saying that is the intention of the Senator from \nKansas. In fact, she is the last person in this whole body that I would \naccuse of trying to kick someone when they are down.\n  I am afraid that the effect of this, the unwillingness to say the \nFederal tax dollars should not be used in order to assist the use of \npermanent replacement workers is, in fact, kicking working people when \nthey are down, when they have seen many rough years, many years of \nunfair advantage to employers in management relations, many years of \njobs being lost overseas, sometimes in the name of free trade, but \noften to the detriment of the people that have helped build this \ncountry.\n  During disputes between employers and employees, Government should at \nthe very least act to ensure that both sides are playing on a level \nplaying field. The Federal Government should not act to give an \nadvantage to one side or the other.\n  At times, such actions in the past have given that advantage in the \nform of police protection for strikers and nonstrikers. At other times, \nin the form of court proceedings.\n  I might add that employers still have many options in overcoming or \nsurviving a strike. There are many things they can do, apart from this \nvery harsh act of using permanent replacement workers. They can hire \ntemporary employees, they can stockpile inventory in advance of a \npotential strike, or assign supervisors to take over some aspects of \nproduction. I know this is not a first choice. But of course neither is \nstriking ever a first choice of the working people who feel compelled \nto go on strike. These options exist for the employers. They have \nalways been available to employers, and they are if no way limited by \nthe President's Executive order.\n  Mr. President, last year the Washington Post ran an excellent \neditorial called ``Women and the Right to Strike'' which pointed out \nthat as a class, women and minorities are the most in need of \nprotection against the use of permanent replacements. They are \noverrepresented in low-skill low-wage jobs where it is easy to find and \ntrain replacements, while they are also in need of those jobs simply to \nmeet the most basic necessities.\n  Mr. President, I find this attempt to prevent the Executive order in \nthis case to be very surprising in light of the emphasis on welfare \nreform that has come through as a very important part of the so-called \nRepublican contract. The notion of welfare reform, which I agree with, \nis that if somebody can work they should work.\n  If we are going to pass some important legislation this year to make \nthat much more likely, what is the message of this amendment to those \nwho are being encouraged to go to work? The message is, you will lose \nyour welfare benefits, you will leave your children and go to work, you \nwill not necessarily be guaranteed health care. As we know, we do not \nhave universal coverage. We have universal coverage for the people on \nwelfare, but not necessarily for those who work.\n  So this is the message that the new majority wants to give to people \non welfare who want to go to work. Go to work, for maybe the same \namount, maybe a little more, and you may have your jobs torn away from \nyou in a very short period of time by the use of permanent replacement \nworkers. No job security. No meaningful right to strike. It is the \nworst message we can possibly send to those people who are genuinely \nstriving to leave welfare.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I gather from what the Senator has just said that he \nis trying to make a connection between welfare reform and welfare \nrecipients--who are, in the main, women, single parents--being able to \nfind a job they can count on. With ``a job you can count on'' meaning a \ndecent wage with decent fringe benefits.\n  In the State of Wisconsin, has the Senator seen situations where \nworkers have been essentially forced out on the strike and permanently \nreplaced? Has the Senator actually seen that happen in Wisconsin? Can \nthe Senator give, so that people know what this debate is about, are \nthere some examples that come to mind, as a Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his question.\n  Mr. President, in response to the question, have we seen this happen \nin Wisconsin, the answer I am sorry to say is yes. Increasingly, \nthrough the 1980's and early 1990's, there were systematic efforts in \ncertain places to use permanent replacement workers.\n  Among the ones that stick out is what happened to people in De Pere, \nWI, when International Paper chose to use permanent replacement \nworkers. I held a hearing as a State senator, at the time, and heard \nsome of the most compelling and troubling testimony I have ever heard \nas an elected representative from families that were broken by the loss \nof that job security that the Senator has described. In fact, I am \nquite sure that some of those folks were forced from being workers to \nbeing on welfare, as a result.\n  I saw the same thing near Milwaukee, in Cudahy, WI, another very \ntense, and difficult, public hearing when the story of that situation \nwas laid out. Closer to my own home in Madison, WI, a lot of pain, a \nlot of hurt, and a lot of destruction of family--another value that the \nnew majority likes to talk about.\n  In the context of the Stoughton Trailer strike involving UAW workers, \nI always like to say my very first political encounter as a kid was \nwhen my father took me down to the UAW plants in Janesville to the \nWalter Reuther Hall. I remember that the gatherings there, there were a \nlot of Democrats there, there were Republicans there, too, in those \ndays. It was not necessarily a partisan issue. It was pretty good \nspirit there in the 1960's. But when I returned in 1988, to that same \nhall, it was not an upbeat spirit. It reminded me of a wake, because \npeople felt absolutely dejected and abandoned because of the use of \npermanent replacement workers. We have had it all over the place.\n  I want to reiterate to my friend from Minnesota, Mr. President, it is \na small percentage of the employers, but, unfortunately, sometimes it \nis some of the biggest employers. Sometimes it is some of the best \njobs. And it cuts at the heart of the feeling that we want to be able \nto give people that if they do a good job for a company and come to \nwork on time and produce a good product, they should be able to keep \nthat job, generally speaking.\n  That is something that has to be as much a part of the American dream \nas home ownership or little league baseball.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this Executive order really applies, as \nI understand it, to Government agencies that work with contractors with \ncontracts of $100,000, or more, and only in \n[[Page S3705]] cases where those contractors permanently replace \nstriking workers, not temporarily replace, then the Government would no \nlonger be willing to continue with the contract. Is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is my understanding. It is not as \nextensive as the kind of law I would like to see passed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And ultimately this would affect very, very, few \ncompanies because we have no reason to believe that most of the \ncontractors doing business with the Government would engage in such a \npractice.\n  So my question is as follows: This debate now on this amendment \nalmost becomes a debate about more than just this aim of the Senator \nwas talking about welfare and the reports of welfare reform with jobs \nbeing key.\n  Does the Senator, based upon your experience in Wisconsin, does the \nSenator feel that this whole issue of permanent replacement of striking \nworkers is key to the question of balance between labor and management \nso that people, working people in the country, whether they are in \nunions or not in unions, will have the ability to represent themselves \nand bargain and have a decent job at a decent wage for their family?\n  Has this amendment become really more of a debate about decent jobs \nfor people, more of a debate about families having an income that they \ncan live on, more of a debate about really working families and middle-\nclass families; is that the way the Senator sees this?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In response to the question of the Senator from \nMinnesota, it almost has to become a broader debate. I do not believe \nit was the intent of the Senator from Kansas to have it be. I do not \nknow how you can talk about just the narrow issue of particular \ncompanies, and I think the Senator from Minnesota is right that there \nmaybe is not going to be Federal money to do this. But it does bring up \nthe whole issue of what kind of consistency is there between this sort \nof amendment and the agenda that we have been talking about in this \nCongress and will talk about having to do with getting people to work.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin will yield to \nme for a moment for a question? Going back to a question between the \nSenator from Minnesota and the Senator from Wisconsin a minute ago.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. First, you implied this Executive order would not \naffect very many companies, that it will only touch on a few Federal \ncontractors. I notice there is some confusion about this that maybe you \ncan clarify.\n  There has been some question as to whether it would or would not \naffect the Bridgestone/Firestone strike for which, of course, there \nhave been permanent replacement workers. For all intents and purposes, \nit has been thought that this Executive order was only proactive, not \nreactive. It states:\n\n       The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply \n     to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced \n     lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this \n     order.\n\n  In section 3, there is some confusion. It says:\n\n       When the Secretary determines that a contractor has \n     permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the \n     Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the \n     contractor ineligible to receive Government contracts.\n\n  So I think it could be read that the Secretary of Labor could, as a \nmatter of fact, go back and say that if there were permanent \nreplacement workers, then the contractor could be debarred from Federal \ncontracts. This places us, of course, right in the middle of a major \nmanagement/labor dispute. One which, of course, is taking a real toll.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Wisconsin, who has the floor, if \nhe knows what the clarification may be? I think this could cause real \nconfusion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I defer to the Senator from Minnesota on that \nparticular aspect, except to say when the Senator from Minnesota asked \nme how many firms do I think this would apply to, my saying I did not \nthink it would apply to many firms was to the fact that I hope and \nbelieve most firms would not do this.\n  If this, in fact, does apply to the current situation you refer to, \nit would not trouble me. I am not going to represent what exactly that \nlanguage does. I am happy to take a look at it. My view is that use of \npermanent replacement workers in any context where Federal dollars are \ninvolved should not be permitted.\n  That is what I would want it to be, but I did not, of course, draft \nthe Executive order, and I would have to defer to the Senator from \nMinnesota if he knows the specific answer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for her \nquestion. The President's Executive order would cover them, but the \nexisting contract could not be terminated. It is my understanding that \nthey would be barred from future contracts, and that is the \ndistinction. I think that is the purpose of this Executive order.\n  I might also add that when I asked the question of the Senator from \nWisconsin, my working assumption--which I think is a correct one--is \nthat ultimately we are talking about what kind of companies might, in \nfact, engage in this practice, because the Senator from Wisconsin is \ncorrect; most companies are good corporate citizens and good businesses \nand do not engage in this practice. Probably we are talking about very \nfew cases.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer. I think it is \nstill very unclear, and I think it indicates why there would be a lot \nof uncertainty about this Executive order. I appreciate the answer.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may conclude, I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota wishes to speak.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts referred to the people who \nwould be affected by the use of permanent replacement workers as the \nbackbone of our country. That is exactly what they are. They are not \nthe people who so many people like to rail against who are not willing \nto work who can work; these are people who work, who have worked hard, \nwho report to work every day, many of whom have to have both parents \nworking to make ends meet. They are trying awfully hard to make it. All \nthey want is to know that this country, whether it be a Democrat \nmajority or a Republican majority, is committed to helping them get to \nwork and have a job and make an honest living.\n  I thought that is what this whole welfare debate is about; that \neverybody is better off if they are working and that if they are not \nworking, they are taking advantage of the rest of us. That is what I \nthought it was about. I thought that is why so many working people are \nfrustrated and irritated by our current welfare system.\n  What kind of a mixed message is it to kick people who are working and \nnot guarantee them the right to strike at the same time you tell them \nget back to work and help us out in this society by working and paying \nyour taxes and make our economy go? It does not add up.\n  This Republican agenda is contradictory. Are we for deficit \nreduction, or are we for tax cuts? Are we for getting people back to \nwork, or are we for driving people out of work by the use of permanent \nreplacement workers? Which one is it? Where is the sense of community? \nWhere is the sense of helping somebody when they are down? Where is the \nsense of making sure that if somebody is really trying to work, that we \nwill do whatever we can to make sure that that job has some stability, \nhas decent wages, some rights, some health insurance. Which is it?\n  I believe that every Member of this body is committed to those \nprinciples in their heart, but when you look at the agenda and the way \nthat it works at cross-purposes with an amendment like this, it is \nvery, very troubling; and it is hard for me to tell the hardworking \npeople in Wisconsin, those who are part of organized labor, in \nparticular, that you really mean it, that you really mean it when you \nsay you want people to work. If you want them to work, give them a fair \nchance to have a balance to keep those jobs when the management is \nbeing unfair.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Kassebaum amendment for the \nreasons I have outlined. I encourage my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  [[Page S3706]] Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin for his strong words on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I could read from my prepared statement. I think I \nwould rather not. I just would like to try to lay out, if you will, the \nbasis of my position and marshal evidence. I think that it is very \nimportant that the U.S. Government not be on the side of contractors \nwho have permanently replaced their workers who have gone out on \nstrike.\n  Let me say one more time, as I understand this Executive order, if \nthe Secretary of Labor issues such a ruling and it is clear that a \ncontractor with a $100,000-or-more contract has, in fact, permanently \nreplaced striking workers, then that company could be barred from \nfuture contracts after the careful, deliberative process set forth in \nthe order is exhausted. I think that is the key clarification.\n  I think that this Executive order is very important. I do not think \nit is very important so much because, in fact, it will end up covering \nthat many businesses.\n I think it will be rather narrow in scope, but I think it is important \nthat the Government be on the side of what I would call basic economic \njustice.\n\n  A word on the context, Mr. President. In the early 1980's, there was \nthe PATCO strike, and many striking air traffic controllers were \npermanently replaced. I think what has happened-- and I wish this was \nnot the case, and maybe it had something to do with the mergers that \ntook place in the 1980's, maybe it had something to do with different \nhard-nosed management approaches--but what happened really, with the \nPATCO strike I think being the triggering event, is that we moved into \na different era of labor/management relations wherein the implicit \ncontract between workers and management was torn up.\n  In addition, I would argue that in the international economic order--\nand the Senator from Illinois was quite correct when he said the United \nStates almost stands alone among advanced economies without having some \nprotection for a work force against being permanently replaced--I think \nthe key for our country is going to be a trained, literate, high-\nmorale, productive work force.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas agrees because I have seen her work \nand admire her work in promoting this.\n  I think the disagreement we have is that when people can essentially \nbe crushed--and I have seen too many people who have been crushed in my \nState of Minnesota--when they go out on strike because they feel they \nhave no other recourse but to do so, it leads to just the opposite of \nwhat we need when it comes to real labor/management cooperation.\n  The process is fairly simple, and I wish I did not have to identify \nthis process. It is not an invention on my part. Too often, companies--\nI am very pleased to say not most companies, not most businesses--\nprovoke strikes as part of a plan to replace striking workers and bust \nunions. And this is a relatively small number of rogue employers. I \nthink, in fact, many businesses would greatly benefit from this reform \nbecause they are not the real culprits here. But too often, certain \nemployers will force a unionized work force out on strike, permanently \nreplace them, then move to have the union decertified. That is union-\nbusting, plain and simple.\n  Now, Mr. President, it could very well be that part of this debate \nabout this amendment--although I think the Senator from Kansas can \nspeak for herself better than I ever could; I do not actually think \nthis is her framework--but as I see it, as I analyze the votes on this \namendment and this question, at least some of the votes, some of the \nvotes are going to really have to do with the larger question than this \namendment.\n  The larger question than this amendment is this Contract With \nAmerica--I think it is more a con than a contract--that we see being \npushed forward with a vengeance in the House of Representatives. The \nconnection I make is that I think what we see happening right now--and \nit is why I come to the floor feeling so strongly about this amendment, \nbecause of this larger context--is an effort on the part of some of the \nleadership in the House to overturn 60 years of people's history. I \nactually do not think that this ``Contract With America'' is an attack \non the 1960's. It is an attack on the basic reforms put in place in the \nthirties, which have served us well for decades.\n  Now, Mr. President, some of us, or some of our parents--in my case, I \nguess it was my grandparents--gave a lot of sweat and tears to make \nsure that in the 1930's we moved forward as a Nation with some \nprotection for people against strikebreaking, some protection against \nthe fear of being unemployed, some protection against jobs that paid \nwages on which people could not support their families. This is when we \nprotected in law the right to form or join a union. This is when we \ndeveloped some of our collective bargaining machinery. This is when we \npassed minimum wage legislation. This is when we passed Social \nSecurity. This is when, Mr. President, if we want to talk about \ncontracts, we actually built a contract in the United States of America \nthe purpose of which was a more just system of economic relationships \nfor people.\n  But, more importantly, I think it was a huge step toward greater \nstability in the workplace, and toward greater fairness. We no longer \nsaid if you own your own large corporation and you are powerful, then \nyou matter, but if you are a working family, you do not. This was an \nimportant contract.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I see a real effort in the Congress, \nespecially on the House side, to rip this contract up.\n  Mr. President, there are an estimated 14,000 workers that are covered \nby the NLRA that are permanently replaced each year by American \nemployers and thousands more under the Railway Labor Act.\n  Now, there was a report done by the General Accounting Office in \nJanuary 1991--and maybe there is a more recent report. I think all of \nus agree that GAO does very rigorous work, and in this report the GAO \nindicates that since 1985, employers have hired permanent replacements \nin one out of every six strikes and threatened to hire replacements in \none out of every three.\n  Mr. President, the right to strike has become the right to be fired. \nYou could, if you wanted to, just travel around the United States, and \nin State after State you could talk to priests, ministers, rabbis, \nmayors, small business people, union people, and others affected by \nlong and bitter strikes that divided communities all too often \nprecipitated by the use of outside replacements.\n  In my State of Minnesota, I could give many, many examples of men and \nwomen who essentially were forced out on strike. Nobody goes out on \nstrike on a lark. But they were faced with a package of concessions \nthat they could not make in terms of their own economic situation and \ntheir basic dignity. The companies knew they could do it to them. The \ncompanies wanted them out on strike. The companies then permanently \nreplaced them and then decertified them. That is union busting.\n  Now, I think this Executive order just simply says that the U.S. \nGovernment will not be on the side of union busting. This Executive \norder--and again, that is why I think it is such an important issue \nthat goes beyond this Executive order--says that the U.S. Government \nwill be on the side of working families, that the U.S. Government will \nbe on the side of collective bargaining rights, that the U.S. \nGovernment will be on the side of the right to strike, and that the \nU.S. Government takes the position that the right to strike should not \nbecome the right to be fired.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues--maybe many or maybe very \nfew--have actually visited with families who have essentially been \nwiped out because the husband or the wife or both were permanently \nreplaced. I have. And I do not say ``I have'' to suggest that I care \nmore about working people than anyone else. Many Senators do. We reach \ndifferent conclusions, sometimes, as to the best way to support \nfamilies.\n  But I have seen, and I will say this to my colleague from Kansas--I \nhave seen too many broken dreams and broken lives and broken families, \nall caused by permanently replacing men and women. It is just \nshattering.\n  [[Page S3707]] I will say this to my colleague from Kansas, I will, \nwith every ounce of strength I have as a U.S. Senator, fight to end \nthis practice. That is why this amendment assumes a larger importance \nthan this amendment. That is why this amendment assumes a larger \nimportance, and that is why this amendment must be stopped.\n  There were many of us--one is no longer here on the floor of the \nSenate because he retired, certainly he was one of my mentors, Senator \nMetzenbaum from Ohio--who fought and fought and fought for change. S. \n55 would have been the change. That would have prohibited employers--I \nam not talking about just contractors with the Government--from \npermanently replacing striking workers. It was filibustered. Let me \nrepeat that one more time. It was filibustered.\n  I remember meeting--I think Sheila came out with me--on a Sunday \nmorning in Minnesota with a group of workers who had been permanently \nreplaced. They were outside with their families. It was raining. \nCertainly there were as many women as men who worked for this company. \nI remember saying to them: I really have some hope that we will be able \nto pass this legislation.\n  I do not think they thought that meant they would get their jobs \nback. But it represented some real hope for them, because they had been \nvery courageous. What this company asked of these workers, I say to my \ncolleague from Kansas, was unacceptable. I do not think there is a \nSenator here who would have been able to have accepted those terms.\n  They went out on strike. They were scared to death. They knew they \nprobably were going to lose their jobs, but it was a matter of dignity. \nYou know, dignity is important to people.\n  I said: We have this piece of legislation and I believe the United \nStates of America is going to join the other advanced economies by \nproviding some protection for working people, working families. But we \ncould not get a vote on it. It was filibustered.\n  Mr. President, now we come to this amendment by my good friend from \nKansas, which is an attempt to effectively overturn the President's \nExecutive order. The Executive order, which sends I think a very, very \nimportant and positive message to people in this country, which is that \nthe Government is not going to be on the side of companies that \npermanently replace workers, companies that quite often force people \nout on strike, in keeping with a typical pattern--forcing people out on \nstrike when people cannot accept these concessions which are \nunreasonable; then bringing in permanent replacements; then \ndecertifying the union; and then busting the union. The U.S. Government \nwill not be on the side of union busting.\n  I think this amendment also brings into focus on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate a whole question of this Contract With America. I believe \nthat. I do not think that is the intent of the Senator from Kansas, but \nthat is why I feel so strongly about this debate, about this amendment.\n  I say to my colleague from Wisconsin, what is now going on--actually \nlegislation that is being passed on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives--is beyond the goodness of people in this country. It \nis mean-spirited, because it targets the citizens who are the most \npolitically vulnerable and who have the least political clout. That is \nwhy I have come out with this amendment on children over and over, \nwhich the Chair voted for and my colleague from Wisconsin voted for, to \nget the Senate on record in favor of ensuring that nothing we do this \nyear will create more hungry or homeless children.\n  When I first came out with this amendment at the beginning of the \nsession, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, there were some colleagues \nwho thought this is just symbolic. Some people said this is just \npolitics. But, my gosh, look at what has happened on the House side, \nand what is coming over here to the Senate. We can see what is \nhappening to the school lunch program, the school breakfast program, \nnutritional programs, the child care centers. Look at the headlines \nevery day. The other day on the floor of the Senate I observed: Here is \na front page Washington Post piece with a title, not ``Can Johnny \nRead?'' but ``Can Johnny eat?'' And you begin to wonder. This is not \nthe America we know.\n  I insist that this debate is all about families. I know my colleague \nhas a question and I will be pleased to yield, but if I can just make \nthis last point. I think, whether we are talking about nutrition \nprograms and children, whether we are talking about Pell grants, or \nlow-interest loans for higher education; whether we are talking about \naffordable health care or whether we are talking about minimum wage; or \nthe Small Business Administration--guaranteed loan programs, 8-A loan \nprograms and the like--or whether we are talking about jobs, jobs that \nfamilies can count on, jobs that pay a decent wage with decent fringe \nbenefits--that is the core question here.\n  On this question I think the administration is in the right. I think \nthis Executive order is extremely important and ultimately it gets down \nto the question, to quote an old song, ``Which Side Are You On?'' It \nhappens to be an old labor song sung by Florence Reece--``Which Side \nAre You On?'' Which side is the Government on? Is the Government on the \nside of companies that permanently replace workers, that crush workers? \nOr is the U.S. Government, the Government of the United States of \nAmerica, on the side of working people and working families?\n  I want to continue to speak but if the Senator has a question I will \nyield.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, no, I do not. I would simply, though, \nmake a statement. This is not about the Contract With America. This is \nnot about whose side one is on. I would say to the Senator from \nWisconsin, what this is about is the ability of the President, by an \nExecutive order, to change the labor law of the land which has existed \nfor 60 years.\n  The debate on whether to have a permanent replacement of workers can \ncome at a different time. I am sure it will. It has through the past \ntwo Congresses. But that is what troubles me--and I know the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has the floor. It is not a question so much as to state \nindeed what this debate is about.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Kansas that \nI respectfully disagree. The reason I say that is I do not believe that \nwe can decontextualize this amendment proposed by my colleague from the \nreality of the agenda that is being pushed by the Republican Party in \nthis 104th Congress. I believe all of the parts are interrelated. That \nis the way I view this amendment. I view this as being connected to all \nthese other questions. Is there going to be adequate nutrition for \nchildren? Whatever happened to affordable health care? Are people going \nto be able to afford higher education? How come the proposed cuts are \nso targeted, as Marian Wright Edelman and others have said over and \nover again, on the most vulnerable citizens? Why are we not willing to \nraise the minimum wage? And what are we doing, coming out with an \namendment that essentially tries to undo an Executive order that only \nsays the U.S. Government ought not to be supporting companies that \npermanently replace workers,\n given, I think, a rather bleak and shameful history of the last decade \nor so as to what has actually been happening to working people in this \ncountry?\n\n  So I say to my colleague, I respectfully disagree.\n  Does my colleague have a question?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No. I will respond when the Senator from Minnesota \nyields the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Iowa will be here in a moment. \nI will be pleased to yield the floor to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I would like to just quote from page 1 of a General \nAccounting Office report published a few years ago on striker \nreplacement in the last 20 years. It is a summary to give some context \nfor my remarks and my response to the Senator from Kansas.\n\n       The number of strikes in the United States during the \n     1980's was about one half what it was during the 1970's. More \n     specifically, strikes declined about 53 percent in the 1980's \n     compared with the 1970's. They estimate that in strikes \n     reported to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in \n     1985 and 1989, employers announced they would hire permanent \n     replacements in about one-third of the \n     [[Page S3708]] strikes in both years and hired them in about \n     17 percent of all strikes in each year. They generally found \n     little difference in the use of permanent replacements by \n     employers in large force strikes.\n\n  Mr. President, is this Executive order meeting a real need? Yes. Is \nthere a precedent for it? Yes--ample precedent.\n  One more time I say to my colleagues that I believe there is a larger \nsignificance to this amendment than may originally be apparent. This \namendment goes to the very question of workplace fairness. This \namendment goes to the very heart of the Contract on America's assault \non working families' ability to rely on jobs that pay decent wages with \ndecent fringe benefits. This amendment is an attempt to undo an \nExecutive order, I think, which is narrow in scope and which makes it \nclear that the Federal Government will not be on the side of companies \nwhich permanently replace striking workers. The Federal Government will \nnot be on the side of union busting. The Federal Government will not, \nthrough taxpayers' money, support unfairness in the workplace. The \nFederal Government will side with regular working people. The Federal \nGovernment will side with working families.\n  And while I believe that this Executive order represents a lawful \nexercise of Presidential authority, I think it also represents \nsomething more. It represents a commitment by the President of the \nUnited States of America to many, many, many working families in our \ncountry.\n  Please remember, when I say working families, I mean union and \nnonunion, I mean the vast majority of people in this country who in \nfact are employed.\n  At this point, Mr. President, if the Senator from Kansas does not \nhave a question for me, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to respond to several things \nthat have come up during the course of the debate this morning.\n  First, this amendment is not an effort to embarrass the President.\n  Second, I feel strongly that this Executive order sets a precedent \nthat we need to carefully examine.\n  Third, we all care about justice in the workplace and for the \nworkers. But it has been stated that this Executive order will actually \nrestore the balance. That through this Executive order there will be \nbalance that then will be maintained between management and labor. I \nargue that actually it will totally unbalance the labor/management \nrelationship which has existed over 60 years under our Federal labor \nlaws.\n  Sometimes it has been abused by management. Sometimes it has been \nabused by labor. It was stated that if management can hire permanent \nreplacement workers, then it would be very unfair to the strikers. Why \nwould, indeed, strikers not be able to have any voice at that point? \nStrikes have continued on, and at great loss to those who were \nstriking, where permanent replacement workers have been hired. However, \nif you were to forbid any permanent replacement workers, then strikes \ncould continue on forever and the workplace could be totally shut down. \nA business could be totally shut down. Leverage has to be equal on both \nsides.\n  I suggest that when discussing this Executive order it is very murky \nto talk about either Caterpillar or Bridgestone/Firestone because at \nsome point large companies, in fact many companies large or small, have \nFederal contracts. This would say, if indeed a strike is ongoing--which \nBridgestone/Firestone is--and there have been permanent workers hired, \nit does apply to them.\n  So I suggest the Executive order will not restore the balance between \nlabor and management. It actually undermines it. This is not a debate \nabout the minimum wage. This is not a debate about Davis-Bacon. This is \nnot a debate about school lunches or child care or welfare reform--all \nthe things that have come into play. It is indeed not about any of \nthese.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Minnesota, because he cares \npassionately about this, that there could be a time when a Republican \nPresident could issue an Executive order banning all strikes. If you \nstart down this slippery slope of totally disregarding labor law, the \nlegislative authority to enact law, this could happen. Where authority \nto shape labor law should be is in the halls of Congress where it is \ndetermined through legislation.\n  There has been much talk here about President Reagan and President \nBush by Executive order having done the same thing.\n  If I may, I will just go through this again. The Bush administration \ndid issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to post a \nnotice informing workers of their rights under Federal labor law. That \nis a given. That was not, in any way, changing labor law.\n  President Reagan, when air traffic controllers went on an illegal \nstrike, did replace those striking workers with permanent replacement \nworkers. There was legislation that followed in both the House and \nSenate wanting reinstatement of those fired air traffic controllers \nafter a certain period of time, but this legislation did not pass. And \nthat is why we get to the third one, Mr. President, which I suggest \nmight be a little murkier--and I listened to Senator Kennedy's \narguments regarding the prehire agreements.\n  There are some, in fact, who believe that President Bush's Executive \norder was illegal although it was never challenged in court. It could \nhave been challenged, just as I assume this Executive order will be \nchallenged. Unlike the case of the prehire agreement Executive order, \nwe are currently faced with a situation where Congress has declined to \nchange the law for more than 60 years. I argue that this striker \nreplacement Executive order has far broader implications. If we \ncontinue down what I have said is a slippery slope, I fear we may see \nfuture administrations that will then be trying to limit not only the \nrights of management but the rights of workers as well.\n  This is not the way we should determine major labor law--by an \nExecutive order. I share many of the sympathies that have been \nexpressed by either the Senator from Wisconsin or the Senator from \nMinnesota about the desire to see stability in the workplace, the \ndesire for good wages, the desire for those who are working today to \nknow they have a future in that workplace instead of uncertainty from \nmonth to month, if not year to year. But this is not the answer. And I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that it creates an imbalance that will cause \ngreater uncertainty in the workplace and greater instability in the \nworkplace, not less.\n  As we look to the future of trade, productivity, and competition, we \nwant to be able to be partners with both labor and management and try \nto realize a stable and productive workplace. But through this \nExecutive order, we have undermined, I think, and further eroded a \nsense of trust and a responsibility that should exist between labor and \nmanagement.\n  If we tie one hand behind management's back, or if someone finds a \nway to tie one hand behind labor's back, we have created imbalance. Who \nis to say what issue is fair or unfair? It cannot be done here. Many of \nus argue this about the baseball strike. We have said that Congress \nshould not intervene in these strikes. There must be some credence \ngiven to the bargaining table, where management and labor have to come \ntogether, I hope, for the best interests of both sides.\n  That is what this argument is about. It is not about the Contract \nWith America and all of these other extraneous issues. It is about an \nExecutive order that takes away the rights of Congress to, by \nlegislation, enact or reject legislation--in this case, affecting labor \nlaw, which has always been our prerogative.\n  We can have the debate once again on permanent replacement for \nstriking workers at another time and in another forum. But this debate \nis simply about an Executive order. The reason I add it as an amendment \nto the defense supplemental is that many of those who have worked with \ndefense contracts are the very workers and businesses that could well \nbe affected by this Executive order.\n  That is why it seems to me to fit on the defense supplemental \nlegislation before us today. I do not think there needs to be extended \ndebate because I believe we all know what the issue at hand is and how \nwe feel. I would be happy to enter into a time agreement. \n[[Page S3709]] I would be happy to have the vote in a limited amount of \ntime, and stand willing to do so, Mr. President, if that will be agreed \nto by the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I want to make it clear \nthat when it comes to time agreements--and I think this is a sort of \nfundamental difference we have. This is a central, central, central \nquestion. One more time, I say, with all due respect to my colleague \nfrom Kansas, first, I think the significance of this amendment goes \nbeyond the Executive order. I think it cannot be contextualized to what \nI consider to be really sort of assault on working families and middle-\nincome families in America.\n  Second, I choose to define the issue differently. Each Senator has to \nmake his or her own decision. But I believe this is a question of \nwhether or not the Federal Government will be on the side of a practice \nwhich, unfortunately, has become all too common during the decade of \nthe 1980's and early 1990's, which is essentially demanding concessions \nof a work force that you know they cannot make, forcing them out on \nstrike, hiring permanent replacements, decertifying the union, and \nbusting the union.\n  So the question is, is the Government of the United States of America \ngoing to use taxpayer dollars to encourage that practice, to be on the \nside of that kind of practice--the practice of union busting, of \nbreaking unions, of driving many, many honest, hardworking people \nessentially out of work because they are replaced? I do not think so. I \nthink it is a question of where the Government stands. This Executive \norder says we ought to have a Government that stands on the side of \nworkplace fairness.\n  Actually, I heard my colleague from Illinois say earlier that this is \nbut the beginning of what we should have done, which was S. 55, which \njoined all of the other advanced economies with legislation to prohibit \nthis egregious practice. We would be so much better off--I will not \nrepeat all of the arguments I made earlier--in terms of productivity \nand labor-management partnerships, and in terms of higher levels of \nmorale.\n  I ask my colleague from Illinois whether it is his intention to speak \non the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. No.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, let me finish my remarks. I am expecting the \nSenator from Iowa to be here in a moment.\n  Let me just clear up this interpretation on Bridgestone-Firestone. \nNegotiations between Bridgestone-Firestone and the United Rubber \nWorkers began in March of 1994, and the collective bargaining agreement \nexpired on April 24, 1994. The United Rubber Workers called the strike \nagainst Bridgestone-Firestone on July 12, 1994. If the Executive order \nhad been in effect, Secretary Reich would have intervened immediately \nby notifying the company that any effort to permanently replace its \nworkers could cause Bridgestone-Firestone to suffer immediate \ntermination of several million dollars worth of contracts it has with \nthe Federal Government. This action might have been enough to persuade \nBridgestone-Firestone not to permanently replace the strikers.\n  On January 4, 1995, Bridgestone-Firestone permanently replaced 2,300 \nstriking workers, without any warning, by sending letters to the \nstrikers at their home. If the Executive order had been in effect, \nSecretary Reich could have immediately investigated and made a finding \nthat the company violated the policy in the Executive order, that the \nexecutive branch will not contract with employers who permanently \nreplace striking workers, and notified all of the agencies that have \ncontracts with Bridgestone-Firestone that they should terminate their \ncontract. These agencies would have terminated the contracts, again \nputting pressure on Bridgestone-Firestone to attempt a reasonable \nsettlement of the strike--the same kind of pressure that the strikers \nwere under, I might add--at the time.\n  It also says, ``The Secretary of Labor may pursue a debarment action \nagainst Bridgestone/Firestone after the executive order takes effect. \nThe debarment would block Bridgestone/Firestone from getting any new \nFederal contracts''--any new Federal contracts-- ``until its labor \ndispute is settled.''\n  The language is very clear. The interpretation is very clear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I very strongly oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kansas. Instead of passing this amendment, \nwe should be saluting the leadership of President Clinton in providing \na good degree of protection for workers that Congress failed to protect \nlast year in the striker replacement bill.\n  American workers and companies doing business of over $100,000 with \nthe Federal Government can finally be assured that they will not be \npermanently replaced if they go out on a strike. While that represents \nonly 10 percent of all contracts, this order will affect 90 percent of \nFederal contract dollars.\n  Over the past decade, a worker's right to strike has too often been \nundermined by the destructive practice of hiring permanent replacement \nworkers. Workers deserve better. Workers are not disposable assets that \ncan be thrown away when labor disputes arise.\n  When we were considering the striker replacement bill last year, the \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources heard poignant testimony \nabout the emotional and financial hardships that are caused by the \nhiring of permanent replacement workers. We heard of workers losing \ntheir homes, going without health insurance due to the cost of COBRA \ncoverage, as well as the feelings of uselessness that workers often \nfeel when they are permanently replaced after years of loyal and \nefficient service.\n  The right to strike, as we all know, is an action taken as a last \nresort, for no worker takes the financial risks of a strike lightly. I \nhave never, in all my years, met one worker who would rather be on \nstrike than he would be in the plant working. The right to strike is, \nhowever, fundamental to preserving a worker's right to bargain for \nbetter wages and better working conditions.\n  I challenge those who say they support the Wagner Act, and the right \nof collective bargaining, and yet say that if workers go out on a legal \nstrike, that company can permanently replace them. In essence, that \nposition means that there really is no right to strike; there is only a \nright to go out and be replaced.\n  And if there is no right to strike, then there is no right to \ncollective bargaining. Because there is only one thing and one thing \nalone that the worker brings to the bargaining table and that is his or \nher labor. They do not have money to bring to the table. They do not \nhave contracts. If they cannot withhold that labor, then there is no \nreal effective bargaining position for labor. Then they are going to \nhave to take exactly what management wants. If they do not take what \nmanagement wants, then they can go out and strike, but then management \nsays, ``We will bring in permanent replacements: you are done and you \nare out the door.''\n  So what we have in America today is no right to collective \nbargaining. It is a sham, a phony right.\n  The kind of rights that workers enjoy in other capitalist societies, \nwhether it is Great Britain or France, all over Europe or even in \nJapan--and I will have more to say about Bridgestone--workers there do \nindeed have the right to strike, and they cannot be permanently \nreplaced.\n  So only in America, the bastion of free labor, the country that gave \nthe world the kind of laws under which labor can exert its legitimate \nrights and bargaining rights, this country has now taken a step \nbackward of saying, \n[[Page S3710]] ``No, there is no more right to collective bargaining in \nthis country.''\n  Recent studies have shown that the stagnation we have seen in middle-\nclass standards of living is closely correlated with the decline of \nunions and the loss of meaningful bargaining power. A Harvard \nUniversity study showed that blue-collar incomes have dropped in \nconstant dollars from $12.76 an hour in 1979, down to only $11.51, a \ndrop of almost 10 percent. If unions represented just 25 percent of the \nwork force, that wage would be nearly $12 per hour.\n  At the same time, workers are losing the benefits that unions were \nable to negotiate. Since 1981, fewer workers have health insurance, \npensions, paid vacations, paid rest time, paid holidays, and other \nbenefits. Without the bargaining power of a union, companies provide \nthese benefits only out of the goodness of their hearts. Without the \nright to strike, a right that is theoretically guaranteed by law but \nthat is in fact totally undermined by permanent replacements, workers \nhave virtually no bargaining power left.\n  The right to replace workers is insidious. If one employer in an \nindustry chooses to cut costs by breaking the union and cutting the \nworkers' salaries and benefits and dignity, then all the other \ncompanies in that industry are faced with having to compete against a \ncut-rate, cutthroat business, or they are going to have to follow suit.\n  A company has to respond to its shareholders. It cannot be beat by \nthe company that treated its workers shabbily. So, since it has to \nrespond to its board of directors and the shareholders, they follow \nsuit. It is insidious. It is like dominoes. One company starts it, \nother companies have to follow suit or they are going to lose market \nshare.\n  Workers faced with being replaced have to make the choice of staying \nwith the union and fighting for their jobs or crossing picket lines to \navoid losing the job they have had for 10 to 20 years. Is this a free \nchoice, as some of our colleagues would suggest, or is this not really \nblackmail? It takes away the rights and dignity of workers in this \ncountry.\n  What does it mean to tell workers you have the right to strike when \nexercising that right means that you will be summarily fired and \nreplaced by another worker?\n  This is not about whether a company has to close its doors in the \nface of a strike. This only concerns the permanent replacement \nstrikers. Permanent replacements are given special priorities in their \nnew jobs, placing new hires above people with seniority and experience. \nWe are not suggesting that replacement workers cannot compete for jobs. \nThey just should not get special rights over and above those of the \nworkers who have devoted their lives to the company.\n  As a nation, we have a choice: Continue down the path of lower wages, \nlower productivity, and fewer organized workers, or take the option \npursued by our major economic competitors of cooperation, high wages, \nhigh skills, and high productivity.\n  We want to pursue that high-skill path. We must do it with an \norganized work force. We cannot do it with the destructive management \npractices of the past decade such as the hiring of replacement workers.\n  Instead, we need new approaches to management that foster enhanced \nlabor-management relations and cooperative approaches that stimulate \nemployee productivity and enable management to get the most from its \nemployees' skills, brain power, and effort.\n  Our Nation cannot afford to limit our competitiveness through \npractices that promote distrust between our workers and our managers. \nInstead, we must work for the mutual interest of all parties. I believe \nthe President's Executive order is a positive step toward such goals.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of particular interest to my State of \nIowa. In January, Bridgestone/Firestone, a large employer in the Des \nMoines area and other Midwestern States, announced the permanent \nreplacement of nearly 3,000 workers involved in the strike against the \ncompany for better working conditions and fairer treatment by their \nemployers.\n  The bargaining sessions had broken down and the employees exercised \ntheir legal right to strike. This is Bridgestone/Firestone, and maybe \nnot too many people have heard of Bridgestone, but certainly everyone \nhas heard of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Firestone sold out to the \nBridgestone Corp., which is a wholly Japanese-based corporation based \nin Japan, which bought the Firestone Co. and now it is called \nBridgestone/Firestone.\n  Many of the workers at the Bridgestone/Firestone plant in Des Moines \nare folks I grew up with. I come from a small town of about 150 people. \nMost of the people in that town either worked at John Deere or they \nworked at Firestone.\n  So I know what these people are like. They are good people. They are \nhard-working people. They are churchgoing people. They support their \nschools. They have good, strong families.\n  What does this say to our working people of this country? Certainly \nwe have to understand we cannot just take people like that and throw \nthem out on the trash heap. There is something about dignity, something \nabout the fact that these people put in all these years for this \ncompany. And it is not as if they are asking for the sky and the Moon \nand the Sun and the stars in bargaining.\n  As a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, Bridgestone/Firestone \nasked the employees to do certain things, and they did. They asked them \nto increase their productivity at Bridgestone/Firestone. Let me read a \nletter from one of those employees sent to me in January of this year. \nThis is quite a long letter so I will not read the whole thing.\n  Sherrie Wallace is a Bridgestone tractor tiremaker:\n\n       I was raised to respect my peers, act responsibly to my \n     community, do the very best I could on whatever I did * * *.\n       When Bridgestone came to each of us asking for help because \n     we were not doing as well as the company needed to do, we all \n     did our best. They asked me for one more tire every day and \n     to stay out on the floor and forego my cleanup time. Not only \n     did I respond, so did each and every member of the URW. Not \n     only did I give them the one more tire per day, I gave them \n     three times what they asked for. Our production levels \n     soared. We threw ourselves into our company believing that we \n     all must succeed together in order to create a better way of \n     life for all. The membership joined committees and we became \n     involved, we gave them our hearts. We began to believe this \n     company was different. We gave them our input to create a \n     better working environment. To increase productivity we began \n     to meet our production levels. We were proud of our company \n     and our union. Together, we did make a difference. It is \n     these things that make me wonder why does Bridgestone now \n     demand such unreasonable demands?\n       This is not an issue of money. It is an issue of work \n     ethics, fairness to your employees, good working conditions, \n     reasonable working hours and benefits.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, let me talk about this a second. It is not about \nmoney. Let me give one of the things that Bridgestone was demanding of \nits workers in terms of negotiating agreement. Bridgestone, for as long \nas I can remember--Firestone since I was a kid growing up--they always \nhad three shifts a day.\n  I know the present occupant of the chair is from the State of Ohio, \nand I know they have a lot of industry there. I know that the three \nshifts, the 8-hour shifts, three shifts a day, has been pretty \ncommonplace in our history of this country. Three shifts a day, 8 hours \na day. And as a person goes up the seniority level--obviously, when you \nstart at a plant you get the graveyard shift. Stay there longer, you \nget the evening shift. And after a while you work up and you get the \nday shift.\n  That has been a well-accepted practice in our country for a long \ntime. At least with that kind of working condition, you knew when you \nwent to work, when you came home, you knew when you had time off to be \nwith your family.\n  Here is what Bridgestone wanted their employees to do; not three 8-\nhour shifts a day but two 12-hour shifts a day and there would be three \nshifts. So here is what it would do: You would be on 3 days working 12 \nhours and then you would be off 2 days; then you would be on 2 days \nworking 12 hours, and you would be off 2 days; then you would be on 3 \ndays 12 hours, and off 2 days; then you would be 3 days on and 2 days \noff. See what they are getting at?\n  How would you ever know when you will be home with your family? How \ncould you plan a Little League activity on Saturday or Sunday? You \nmight be home one Saturday, and then you \n[[Page S3711]] might not be home for a couple Saturdays after that. You \nmight be home in the middle of a week. When you work 12 hours a day, \nhow do you spend time with your kids and family?\n  I have to say, Mr. President, who knows as well as I do, that a lot \nof these people, now both husband and wife are working. Take one of \nthem working a 12-hour shift and the other might be working an 8-hour \nshift someplace else. They have precious little time together. This is \nwhat Bridgestone is demanding.\n  I said Bridgestone is a Japanese company. Do they do that in Japan? \nNo. They have three 8-hour shifts a day, with the seniority system. \nWould they ask their workers in Japan to go to a rotating 12-hour \nshift? Not on your life, because they have agreements with those \nworkers. If they tried to do something like that, they would have a \nstrike and in Japan they cannot permanently replace those workers. But \nthey can here.\n  Well, like Sherrie Wallace said, it is not even an issue about money. \nBut if we want to talk about money, we will talk about it a little bit. \nA person might think, however, that Bridgestone probably has better \nproductivity and lower wages in Japan. Not true. Productivity is higher \nhere per worker in America.\n  Mr. President, the average annual wage of a Bridgestone/Firestone \nemployee in Japan is $52,500 a year. The average wage for that same \nBridgestone/Firestone employee in the United States is $37,045.\n  But this issue is not about the money. That is not the point. The \npoint is, what kind of working conditions are they going to have? Are \nthey going to be able to spend time with their families? I might add as \na postscript, since the last time I gave this speech on the floor about \nthis--Senator Simon and I have worked very closely on this--Senator \nSimon got hold of the Bridgestone people at their headquarters in \nTennessee. They agreed to come back, sit down and talk. And I came out \non the floor and congratulated them. I said, ``I am glad to see that. \nMaybe we will get some movement here.''\n  What has happened since that time is the Bridgestone/Firestone people \nbasically came in and said, ``Here is our offer, take it or leave it.'' \nThat is not talking, that is not negotiating.\n  Since I last took the floor to talk about this, it looks like \nBridgestone/Firestone had no intentions to sit down and bargain in good \nfaith or negotiate at all. We thought they were; we hoped they were. \nThe workers even agreed--even agreed--to save their dignity and to save \ntheir jobs, they agreed to go to the 12-hour shift. I do not think they \never should have agreed to it, but they did. Guess what Bridgestone/\nFirestone said? That is not enough. They want further concessions.\n  I think it is absolutely clear that in the case of Bridgestone/\nFirestone they only want one thing: Bust the union, drive down the \nwages to the lowest possible unit they can get, squeeze them as much as \npossible.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I do not want to get into a debate about \nBridgestone's policies in this country, but wouldn't the Senator from \nIowa agree that labor law is very different in Japan? So I think that \nwhen you say that in Japan they could not do this, this is because they \nhave different labor laws in Japan and seldom have strikes. I do not \nthink it is an exact comparison about what they may be trying to do in \nthe United States versus the fact they would not do it in Japan. There \nare many reasons they cannot do it in Japan, is that not correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Senator saying--\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. They do not strike in Japan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But they have the right to strike and they can strike and \nthey cannot be permanently replaced. It is against labor law in Japan \nto have a striking worker permanently replaced.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. We can debate the differing interpretations of \nJapanese labor law, but I do think it is different. I just wanted to \nsay that I think it is unfair to compare the two. At some point, I will \ngo into it, but I wanted to make that point. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator. I will be glad to engage in \nmore dialog if my friend from Kansas would like to do that. I am not \nsuggesting the labor law in Japan is the same as in United States. I am \njust saying in regard to this one company, what they are doing here in \nthe United States of America they would not be allowed to do under \nJapanese labor law. That is all I am saying.\n  I know labor laws are different, but they would not be allowed to do \nin Japan what they are doing in this country. That is the point I am \nmaking.\n  I want to make a further point, too, that I do not want to be accused \nof Japanese bashing. The fact is, most Japanese companies that operate \nin America do not operate in this way. In fact, a lot of the Japanese \ncompanies that operate here have darn good working relationships with \ntheir workers, with organized labor. They have sat down at the \nbargaining table and have bargained in good faith. In fact, in many \nways, they have been better than some U.S. companies, as a matter of \nfact.\n  I am not saying this is endemic of all Japanese companies. In fact, \nthis is a rogue Japanese company, quite frankly. I think it is casting \na bad light over a lot of other Japanese companies. We said that to the \nAmbassador from Japan--and others said it to the Prime Minister when he \nwas here. If you get one bad apple in the barrel, like Bridgestone/\nFirestone, it can spoil the whole barrel.\n  I will be glad to engage in any further dialog with the Senator from \nKansas on this issue later on, if she so desires.\n  Again, my point was that Bridgestone/Firestone I do not believe now \nis acting in good faith. I thought before maybe these were bargaining \ntechniques, to hold out a little bit. We have been through this before. \nBut after the last instance in which they indicated they were going to \nsit down and bargain and talk and then they just basically said, ``Here \nis our offer, take it or leave it,'' it indicates to me that if they \never were bargaining in good faith, they certainly are not operating in \ngood faith right now.\n  I wanted to finish a little bit more of Sherrie Wallace's letter.\n\n       You can not know how betrayed we American workers feel. You \n     can not know the hours of fear and heartache we have endured. \n     You can not know how we fear for our safety when we are on \n     the picket lines. We are just average family people pursuing \n     a dream called the ``American dream.''\n       Many of us in the plants have injuries that we have \n     substained because of our employment at Bridgestone. Back \n     injuries, muscle tearing, joint replacement, arm injuries, \n     carpal tunnel, cancer and asbestosis these are just a few. \n     Many of our brothers and sisters have died because of \n     conditions at these types of companies. Many of us just can't \n     get another job. Who would hire half a man or woman. We can't \n     stand to lose our jobs. There is no place else to go. Many of \n     us are unfit to work anywhere else. Where do you go to work \n     when your arms hurt you so badly you finally have to have \n     surgery. Yet knowing full well you will never fully recover \n     from the physical and mental abuse you have endured. You know \n     that the pain will never fully go away. Your physical \n     abilities will never be the same. It is unconceivable that \n     this company would throw you aside like a piece of used up \n     machinery. But they did and they still do.\n       * * * You see, we are one of those families that both \n     husband and wife work at Bridgestone/Firestone * * *. We both \n     have lost our jobs, our benefits and our livelihood. We have \n     had days and nights of no sleep, wondering where our life is \n     heading. Trying to keep the ``American dream'' alive with \n     dignity, conviction to stand up for what you believe in and \n     hope * * *.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 8, 1995.\n     Senator Harkin.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: You have been on my mind since the day \n     I heard you speak in Des Moines, Iowa at our local 310 United \n     Rubber Workers rally in December. I was so proud of you. I \n     was proud that you represented me and my family. You gave me \n     hope for my future when at a time like this there seems to be \n     no bright future. You seem to know my frustrations, my pain \n     and my intense anger towards a foreign owned company who \n     truly treats their American Worker as a second class citizen. \n     In Japan it is illegal to practice those same work ethics \n     that they are attempting to establish in the American \n     Bridgestone Memberships.\n       I was raised to respect my piers, act responsibly to my \n     community and to do the \n     [[Page S3712]] very best I could on whatever I did. So it is \n     very hard for me to understand their lack of respect for \n     their American laborer.\n       When Bridegstone came to each of us asking for help because \n     we were not doing as well as the company needed to do. We all \n     did our best. They asked me for one more tire everyday and to \n     stay out on the floor and forego my clean-up time. Not only \n     did I respond, so did each and every member of the URW. Not \n     only did I give them the one more tire per day, I gave them \n     three times what they asked for. Our production levels \n     soared. We threw ourselves into our company believing that we \n     all must succeed together in order to create a better way of \n     life for all. The membership joined committees and we became \n     involved, we gave them our hearts. We began to believe this \n     company was different. We gave them our input to create a \n     better working environment. To increase productivity we began \n     to meet our production levels. We were proud of our company \n     and our union. Together we did make a difference. It is these \n     things that\n      make me wonder why does Bridgestone now demand such \n     unreasonable demands?\n       This is not an issue of money. It is an issue of work \n     ethics, fairness to your employees, good working conditions, \n     reasonable working hours and benefits.\n       You can not know how betrayed we American workers feel. You \n     can not know the hours of fear and heartache we have \n     indurred. You can not know how we fear for our safety when we \n     are on the pickit lines. We are just average family people \n     persuing a dream called the ``American Dream.''\n       Many of us in the plants have injuries that we have \n     substained because of our employment at Bridgestone. Back \n     injuries, muscle tearing, joint replacement, arm injuries, \n     carpal tunnel, cancer and asbestosis these are just a few. \n     Many of our brothers and sisters have died because of \n     conditions at these types of companies. Many of us just can't \n     get another job. Who would hire half a man or woman. We can't \n     stand to lose our jobs. There is no place else to go! Many of \n     us are unfit to work anywhere else. Where do you go to work \n     when your arms hurt you so badly you finally have to have \n     surgery. yet knowing full well you will never fully recover \n     from the physical and mental abuse you have indurred. You \n     know that the pain will never fully go away. Your physical \n     abilities will never be the same. It is unconceivable that \n     this company would throw you aside like a piece of used up \n     machinery. But they did and still do!\n       Please do not let forty-six years of continued bargaining \n     for better wages, vacations, working hours, working \n     conditions, health benefits and retirement, everything a \n     union stands for, be destroyed in one six month struggle with \n     one foreign owned company end. Because in reality the \n     Japanese owned Bridgestone tire manufacturer wants an \n     economical advantage over the other American tire \n     manufacturers that are doing fine with the same contracts we \n     are striving for. In the process they will undermine those \n     businesses causing a domino effect, which will undermine \n     American economics. If this is let to happen the process will \n     undermine those American businesses causing them to do the \n     same thing this Japanese company is doing which in turn will \n     undermine the American economy.\n       Where do you go to work when you have worked thirty-three \n     years at Bridgestone? You are to young to retire and no one \n     else wants you because you are too old for them. What do you \n     do? There is no money coming in, no job, and no hope of a \n     decent job. You lose your home, your car and sometimes \n     through all the tears and frustration you lose your wife, and \n     if your young enough, your children. What do you have left? \n     You have even lost your self respect.\n       What about if both parents work at Bridgestone. The entire \n     family becomes a disfunctional family. Even young children \n     feel the pain. These are not scenearious, they are true life \n     stories.\n       The Japanese tire companies in this country got together \n     and became the unholy alliance. Their goal was to try and \n     break the membership. They deliberately set out to undermine \n     our contracts, our work ethics and to destroy our integrity. \n     The other Japanese companies failed to accomplish their \n     entire goals because they are small companies and could not \n     economically continue to lose their cash flow. Bridgestone \n     has several tire manufacturing plants in foreign countries. \n     It is those plants that are supporting them now. The greatest \n     concern I have is knowing that we are not the first union \n     that will have this problem. There will be more union \n     brothers and sister that will fall.\n       I am so perplexed--why hasn't our government seen the \n     dangers and helped her people? Why doesn't our Congressman \n     help? Why do not our leaders that we elected into office see \n     that her American working middle class people need their \n     help? What is it we have to do to get your help? Violence has \n     already broken out. Have our congressmen forgotten why we \n     elected them? There is a great need for a change in our laws. \n     We need laws to protect our working citizens and to prohibit \n     replacement workers. We need our Congress, governors and \n     President to take off their blinders. Stop turning the other \n     cheek. We need you now!\n       Please please help this kind of thing to never happen \n     again. This is just a beginning of a big war with foreign \n     owned businesses to continue to strip American workers of \n     their dignity, their values and to undermine the American \n     family.\n       Please restore my faith in our American Government! Let me \n     see that our people still are important to you. Let me see \n     that the little guy is still in your hearts and minds. Please \n     help me keep the pride in my heart when I help my son study \n     his American history. When we read about the famous ride of \n     Paul Revere or of Ben Franklin the father of knowledge and \n     George Washington the father of our country that the tears of \n     pride and joy fall down my checks and when he sees them I can \n     smile and tell him this great nation and her great leadership \n     is still that strong, determined, fair and brave people they \n     were two-hundred years ago. Do not let him see the tears of \n     pain that I now cry and the dispair I feel show in my eyes. \n     You see, we are one of those families that both husband and \n     wife work at Bridgestone/Firestore in Des Moines, Iowa. We \n     both have lost our jobs, our benefits and our livelihood. We \n     have had days and nights of no sleep, wondering where our \n     life is heading. Trying to keep the ``American Dream'' alive \n     with dignity, conviction to stand up for what you believe in \n     and HOPE * * *.\n       Please hear our plead for help * * * Over 25,000 employees, \n     spouses and children will be effected by this one American-\n     Japanese incident. If this is not stopped, more heartache \n     will follow. Please don't let us down! May God be with you.\n           Sincerely in hope,\n                                                  Sherrie Wallace,\n                                 Bridgestone Tractor Tire Builder.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, that is a letter from the heart. This is \nnot a canned letter. That letter comes from the heart. I do not believe \nI know Sherrie Wallace personally, but I sure know a lot of people like \nher, and I know some of my cousins are in the same situation. It tears \nyour heart out when you see them and when you talk to them. These are \npeople who have given their lives--like I said, it is not as if they \nwere shirking, it is not as if they were cutting down on productivity. \nIn fact, the productivity at that Bridgestone/Firestone, as Sherrie \nWallace has said in her letter, has gone up in the last couple of \nyears.\n  The company they went to the State of Iowa in the 1980's and said, \n``We need some help, we need government help or we can't exist. We have \nall these workers here and, oh my gosh, we have to have government \nhelp.''\n  Here is what they asked for: They asked for grants of $1 million from \nthe State; $300,000 from Polk County; $100,000 from the city; $100,000 \nfrom Iowa Power; $50,000 from Midwest Gas. They asked for that in May \n1987, and in June 1987, they received all the grants.\n  In July 1987, they got their $1 million from the State of Iowa. That \nsame year, they went to the workers and said you have to take cuts or \nwe cannot exist. So the workers took another $4 an hour cut in wages \nand benefits in 1987. So they asked the workers to produce more. In \nOctober 1993, the Des Moines Bridgestone/Firestone plant profit was $5 \nmillion ahead of their budget schedule. In March--get this now--1994, \nthe workers reached a new high of 80.5 pounds per man-hour and set an \nall-time record for pounds that they had in the warehouse.\n  The company boasted that they did it with 600 fewer workers. So like \nSherrie said, they came and they said build me an extra tire a day. \nThey went out and built three extra tires a day. They asked them to \ntake wage cuts. They did. They took wage cuts, actually in the latter \npart of the 1980's, totaling over $7.43 an hour. So they increased \ntheir work productivity, took their wage cuts, and Bridgestone/\nFirestone gets almost $1.5 million in grants from State and local \ngovernments.\n  And in March--this is important--of 1994 they reached this record \nproduction level, an all-time record for pounds warehoused. And guess \nwhen it was that Bridgestone/Firestone said they would not negotiate \nfurther and forced the workers out on strike? You got it, the summer of \n1994. After they had pushed their workers, got the production up, got \nall this stuff warehoused, then they said: OK, now we are not going to \nbargain with you to reach an agreement.\n  I have said it before, and I will keep saying, I think Bridgestone/\nFirestone is perhaps the prime example of corporate irresponsibility \nand bad faith more than any company I have ever seen in this country.\n  Again, these are very hard-working people. Times are a little better. \nThe company is making a good profit. Workers just want fair treatment. \nThat is all they want.\n  What did President Clinton say in his Executive order? He said \nsomething very important to the workers at Bridgestone/Firestone. He \nsaid we are \n[[Page S3713]] not going to continue to take your tax dollars and then \nuse them in the Federal Government to buy from Bridgestone/Firestone \nthose tires since they will not even negotiate in good faith with you.\n  I think that is the right decision. I am proud of President Clinton \nfor making that decision. I think the workers who work at that plant \nought to have the assurance of knowing that their dollars are not going \nto buy those tires for the Federal Government.\n  The President's action is entirely lawful, fully within his \nauthority, and conforms with the practice of previous Republican \nPresidents in labor issues. President Bush issued Executive Order No. \n12818 in October 1992 that prohibited prehire agreements in Federal \ncontracting. These are collective bargaining agreements that set labor \nstandards for construction work prior to the hiring of workers. Yet, I \ndid not hear any of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncomplaining then that President Bush had exceeded his authority. That's \nbecause he issued an Executive order that came down on the side of \nbusiness, not on the side of workers.\n  President Bush also issued an Executive order to implement the Beck \ndecision concerning the use of union funds for political purposes \ndespite legislation that was then pending. At that time, Congressman \nDeLay, who is now the House Republican whip, said that Bush's action \nwas, and I quote, ``* * * * an effort by the President to do something \nthrough Executive order that he cannot get Congress to do.''\n  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. When the \nRepublicans controlled the White House and not the Congress, this kind \nof Presidential policy happened all the time. Back then, I did not hear \na peep from our friends on the other side of the aisle concerned about \na President stepping on the prerogatives of Congress. In fact, they \napplauded the action.\n  So, Mr. President, although I know it is allowed under the rules of \nthe Senate this amendment is not in the best interests of the workers \nof our country. It is not in the best interests of our economy. It is \nnot in the best interests of labor relations in this country. The \nPresident has the authority. He acted lawfully.\n  The fact is, we had the votes to pass the striker replacement bill \nlast year. It passed the House. President Clinton said he would sign \nit. It came to the Senate. We debated it. We voted. We got 53 votes on \na cloture motion, seven short of the number needed. But the majority of \nthe Members of this body voted to pass the anti-striker-replacement \nbill. So it is not as if the President did something that Congress was \ntotally opposed to. A majority of Congress supported that action.\n  This amendment is one I think we are going to have to talk about, and \nI do not think it is in the best interests of this country. I think we \nought to reject it.\n  There are those, Mr. President, who might say that the workers at \nBridgestone/Firestone have not been permanently replaced. I have a \nletter here from Gary Sullivan, and it is a copy of a letter that was \nsent to him by--I think the name is Lamar Edwards, labor relations \nmanager for Bridgestone/Firestone. Here is what the letter says:\n\n       On January [and then it is handwritten in] 19, 1995, you \n     did not report to work because you were on strike and you \n     were permanently replaced. Please address any questions you \n     have to the Labor Relations Office.\n\n  Not even ``Sincerely,'' just ``Lamar Edwards, Labor Relations \nManager.''\n  Gary Sullivan wrote me a note on this letter.\n\n       This is all I'm worth after 24 years of devoted and loyal \n     service. Please continue to hang in there. We need your help. \n     Gary Sullivan, Sr.\n\n  Not even so much as a thank you for 24 years. No thanks for \nincreasing productivity, no thanks for taking the wage cuts you did in \nthe 1970's to help get the company back on its feet. No thanks for your \ntax dollars that came from the State of Iowa or the county of Polk to \ngive us grants to help get us back. No, nothing like that. Just out the \ndoor.\n  There are those who are saying these people have not been permanently \nreplaced. Well, here is the letter. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       This is all I'm worth after 24 years of devoted and loyal \n     service. Please continue to hang in there, we need your help.\n       P.S. I'll help you all I can on election day.\n     Gary R. Sullivan, Sr.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     G.R. Sullivan,\n     Des Moines, IA:\n       On January 19, 1995 you did not report to work because you \n     were on strike and you were permanently replaced.\n       Please address any questions you have to the Labor \n     Relations Office.\n                                                    Lamar Edwards,\n                                          Labor Relations Manager.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator from \nIowa and I certainly hope my colleagues have paid attention to the last \nfew moments of the Senator's presentation. I hope they listen to the \nwhole presentation, but particularly the latter part of it highlights \nwhat this debate is really all about.\n  As I understand it--and I would appreciate the Senator correcting \nme--here was a person who had worked for a particular company over \nvirtually a lifetime. The company was successful, and reaped large \nprofits. This worker tried to enhance his own and his family's economic \ncondition--trying to at least participate in the growing success of his \ncompany--by using the accepted, standard practice in this Nation since \nit has been a great industrial power, of joining with his colleagues to \nadvance their economic interests and the interests of their children in \na company that had been very successful. And he was virtually fired--\nalthough technically that is illegal under the National Labor Relations \nAct. But effectively, that person was thrown out of that job, \nterminated and permanently replaced, in terms of any chance for the \nfuture.\n  We are talking about hard-working families, people who are playing by \nthe rules, people going to work, trying to educate their children, and \neffectively they are dismissed, put out on unemployment compensation \nand perhaps even onto the welfare rolls.\n  As I understand it, what this Executive order says is that we are not \ngoing to tolerate that. This President is not going to tolerate that \nkind of activity when it comes to Government contracting, where there \nis a Government contract which is effectively being paid for by the \npeople's taxes. Under the Executive order we are not going to \nperpetuate that kind of injustice to workers who are being treated like \nthat.\n  My understanding is, the order only applies if there is a legitimate \nstrike--we are not talking about the termination of the contract. My \nunderstanding is further that it is only in these circumstances, as in \nthe example the Senator from Iowa gave, where we have someone who has \nbeen a hard-working person, effectively replaced, thrown out of his \njob. And what this Executive order is saying is that we are not going \nto use American taxpayers' funds to encourage or support or perpetuate \nthat kind of activity in the United States of America. When it comes to \nthe taxpayers' funds, this President has a responsibility, and he is \nnot going to continue to support or encourage that activity; he is \nsaying: in those circumstances, we will not grant contracts to those \nkinds of companies.\n  Am I correct in understanding what the Senator's position on this is?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. He \nhas distilled it down to its essential points.\n  It really says something. I do not know if the Senator was here when \nI was reading the history of Bridgestone/Firestone. They went to the \nState of Iowa and they got all this money, taxpayers' money, to build \ntheir plant up. Then they asked the workers to take all the cuts in \nwages. Now they are out on strike and replacing them.\n  It is all right for them to get taxpayers' money, I guess, in order \nto get their plant up and working. Then they go ahead and fire the very \nworkers who paid those taxes. But it is not all right for us to say \nthat taxpayer dollars are not going to be used to buy products made by \na company that refused to \n[[Page S3714]] bargain reasonably, that treated their loyal workers \nlike used-up equipment.\n  Talk about a double standard. We are saying: Listen, Bridgestone/\nFirestone, you already had your hand in the till. You already took \nmoney before from the State government--I say, not the Federal, the \nState, county, and local government. Then you cannot be complaining now \nwhen we are saying we are not going to use taxpayers' dollars to \nenhance your position.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Iowa will \nyield for a moment, again?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts saying a family had worked a lifetime at Firestone, is it \nnot correct to say that Firestone was going broke when it was purchased \nby Bridgestone? So the future of the workers at the old Firestone Co. \nwas in some jeopardy at that time. Not to go into, again, a lengthy \ndebate on the practices of Bridgestone, but, at the time the whole \nissue was not wages so much as hours. The Senator from Iowa has already \ndiscussed that. But they said they needed to do the shift in hours to \ncover capital costs.\n  When you mentioned what Iowa chipped in and asked the taxpayers to \nspend in support of Bridgestone. Was that not something that was \ndebated, at least, in the Iowa Legislature? Or was it a decision made \nby the Governor, I suppose, on how much taxpayers' support would be \ngiven to Bridgestone at that time? It was not something that was done \nwithout some approval somewhere along the line, isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. I think the legislature, I think Polk County, \nall agreed to give them these dollars, these grants.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. So these very workers who were in jeopardy of losing \ntheir jobs because the company was going bankrupt now have at least had \nan opportunity, if they so chose to do so, to work for a company that \nis productive and is going strong.\n  Whether or not they should have done it by replacing striking \nworkers, I would argue, is not what we should be debating here. I \nsuggest to the Senator from Iowa, we can have this debate at another \ntime.\n  But what we should be debating here is something that follows on just \nthe past weeks and months of debate that we have had on the separation \nof powers regarding the Constitution. That is why I feel we ought to \ntake seriously this Executive order.\n  I do not mean to intrude on the time of the Senator from Iowa, but I \nthink that if you get into the particular situation of Bridgestone/\nFirestone it was not a question of long-time workers somehow being \nforced out in the cold. There was a great tragedy that Firestone was \nteetering on the edge of bankruptcy and was going under. But I would \nlike to go back to the fundamental issue here, which really is the \nseparation of powers.\n  I yield and thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would just respond by saying I do not know where the \ntruth lies in this. But I would say to the Senator from Kansas, there \nis some evidence that the Bridgestone Corp. overbought. They overpaid \nfor Firestone. As a result of that, they tried to get in a more \ncompetitive mode by doing the things that I mentioned.\n  For example, they asked the union members to take $7.43 an hour cuts, \nfrom 1985 to 1990.\n  They got their taxes reduced in the county in which they reside. They \ngot the grants to get going again. And, as Sherrie Wallace said in her \nletter: We were willing to do that to save our jobs. They asked me to \nproduce one more tire a day, I produced three more tires a day. As I \npointed out, in March of last year they reached an all-time high for \nproductivity.\n So the plant is making a lot more money. They are much more \nprofitable. Yet, they are not sharing some of these profits with the \nworkers. The workers took their cuts, I respond to my friend from \nKansas, in the 1970's; big cuts. The taxpayers coughed up a lot of \nmoney to get this plant going and to help Bridgestone make it. They \nhave now made it. No one--not even Bridgestone--is claiming that they \nare not making good money now. They are making a lot of money. They are \nvery profitable.\n\n  So instead of saying, OK, Mr. Sullivan. You have worked here for 24 \nyears. You took a lot of cuts in the seventies. We got our plant going \nagain. Instead of saying we are going to raise your wages a little bit, \ngive you a little bit better deal, no. Take more cuts. Instead of \nworking 8 hours a day, we will make you work 12 hours a day. That is \nwhat they are saying to them.\n  I again point out to my friend from Kansas that I have cousins \nworking all over the place in the tire industry. I have a cousin who is \none of the negotiators for Armstrong Tire, another tire company in Des \nMoines. They went out on strike. But they got back together and they \nsat down and negotiated. They reached an agreement. Goodyear did the \nsame thing. They reached an agreement.\n  But then what this company has come in and done--that is why I talk \nabout this kind of path the company is taking--is insidious \nbecause Bridgestone/Firestone is able to do this. They have put \nGoodyear and Armstrong and Dunlop at a competitive disadvantage. \nGoodyear acted in good faith. They went out and bargained. They reached \nagreements. They signed a contract. The Goodyear workers are happy. \nThey are organized, union, and everybody seems to be happy with them. \nAnd Goodyear is making money. But now Bridgestone comes in and \nundercuts them with this kind of depressing of wages and getting rid of \nlong-time workers. What is Goodyear going to do? What are they going to \ndo? They say, well, they have to answer to their shareholders, too. \nThat is what is so insidious about this.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa that I \ncannot disagree with what he is saying. But then, would you turn right \naround and say that the President of the United States should enter \ninto and completely change the dynamics by intervention? I think what \nwe are debating about is what authority the President has to tilt the \nbalance of what we really have felt was a balance. And I am sympathetic \nwith what the Senator from Iowa is pointing out; that Goodyear worked \nit out and they did not at Bridgestone. But I argue that through this \nExecutive order we now find the President completely intruding in a \nlabor-management relationship. If we find legislation to decide to do \nso and have that debate and vote, that is a different matter. But I \nthink the Senator from Iowa certainly recognizes that we have some \nquestion about what is in the Constitution and the separation of powers \nbetween the executive and the legislative branches.\n  As much as I am sympathetic with the argument that the Senator from \nIowa is pointing out, the argument I would want to make on this \namendment is the way we are trying to intrude on law that does exist. \nThat is my point. I think the case made is one that obviously \nresonates, but this is the wrong way to handle it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again the Senator was here in 1992 when \nPresident Bush issued Executive Order No. 12818, October 1992, that \nprohibits prehire agreements in Federal contracts. These are collective \nbargaining agreements that set labor standards for construction work \nprior to the hiring of workers. Again, this is labor-management. Yet, \nwe interfered. Maybe the Senator did speak out against that at that \ntime. I do not remember.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, did the Senator from Iowa speak out \nagainst it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. Because there are times when a President can, in \nfact, issue Executive orders. I am not speaking out against this one \neither.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, let me suggest to the Senator from \nIowa, that there were those who questioned the legality of the prehire \nExecutive order, but never challenged it in the courts. While it was a \nbit questionable in my mind, I did not challenge it.\n  But I think in this case we have a situation where Congress has \naddressed striker replacements the past two Congresses, and labor law \nmatters generally for over 60 years. We can argue whether President \nBush's prehire contract Executive order should have been challenged. \nThat is debatable. As the Senator says, he did not challenge it because \nhe agreed with it. I would suggest President Bush's prehire contract \n[[Page S3715]] Executive order has worked successfully. In all honesty, \nMr. President, I probably did not think about it much at the time. But \nI suggest that this Executive order goes even further. That is my \nconcern.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I appreciate the frankness of the Senator from \nKansas. To be honest, I did not know about it myself. I am saying that \nthese things take place by a President. Quite frankly, they have a \nright to do so in these kinds of situations.\n  It just seems to me that President Bush issued this Executive order, \nthe one on the Beck decision, and the whip on the House side said that \na President will do something by Executive order that he cannot get \nCongress to do. This is the same thing here, although in another way \nCongress wants to do something about striker replacement. The House \npassed it last year. The Senate voted 57 votes. It is only because of \nthe filibuster rule that we were unable to pass it and get it down to \nthe President for his signature.\n  So again, I say to the Senator from Kansas that I think we have every \nright for the President to do this. It is perfectly lawful. But this is \nnot really the place for this amendment. We are on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. This is not the place for this kind of an \namendment.\n  Again, Mr. President, I close my remarks by saying that we just \ncannot continue to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize--that is exactly \nwhat it is any way you cut it--companies that say to those same \ntaxpayers I do not care how long you have worked here, and I do not \ncare if you are exercising your legal rights, we do not care. We are \ngoing to permanently replace you. Well, I think it is time for us to \nsay that we are not going to subsidize them anymore. That is exactly \nwhat we have been doing. That is what President Clinton's Executive \norder does. I wholeheartedly support it. I think it is a step in the \nright direction and a courageous decision by the President.\n  I am going to do everything in my power as a U.S. Senator, regardless \nof how long I have to stand here, how many days it takes, to make sure \nthat Executive order can go forward and this amendment is defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague for his \nexcellent presentation on this issue and for the focus that he has \nbrought to this issue. The fact of the matter is that the President is \nentitled to make these judgments. In terms of his contracting \nauthority, the President is charged with oversight of billions and \nbillions of dollars. The President has the responsibility to be sure \nthat we are going to get a dollar's worth for the dollar expended.\n  What basically is at risk here is quality. The fact is, that when you \nhave replacement workers, and you have individuals who do not have the \nappropriate training, who do not have the necessary skills, who do not \nhave the ability, you are putting at serious risk the results and the \nquality of the purchases. We have seen that time in and time out. One \nof the great authorities on this is a fellow named John Dunlop, who is \nnot a Democrat, he is a Republican. But when the issue comes down to \nbeing sure that we are going to have decent wages for skilled workers, \nhe comes down against the permanent replacement of strikers\n because he knows that it is not just the dollars and cents of a \nparticular wage, but about the competency of the individual, the skills \nthey have, and the oversight of their performances. The President has \nthe responsibility and he is exercising it. He is making a judgment \nthat these replacement workers may be individuals who do not have the \nskills or the background to do the job, and as a result the Federal \nGovernment's investment is threatened.\n\n  So I believe that the President has taken wise, sound action. I must \nsay, as I was listening to the Senator from Iowa make his presentation, \nI was thinking back on the testimony of Cynthia Zavala, who testified \nin March 1993 before our committee. It is a similar story to the story \nrecounted by the Senator from Iowa. Here is what she said:\n\n       I live in Stockton, CA. I am 52 years old and I have four \n     children, 11 grandchildren, and 1 great grandchild. I have \n     been employed at Diamond Walnut Processing Plant in Stockton \n     for 24 years, starting in 1961, with several breaks when I \n     had my children. During my years with the company, I worked \n     my way up to cannery supervisor. My husband also worked for \n     Diamond for 33 years.\n\n  So they have 57 years between them.\n\n       I have always worked hard for the company. They called me \n     ``Roadrunner'' because I always moved so fast. Everybody in \n     the plant always worked hard. We felt a lot of pride in our \n     work. We took a personal interest in the products. That is \n     why, in 1985, when the managers came to us and said the \n     company was in trouble, we agreed to cut our own pay to help \n     save our company. It was hard for us. People who had been \n     with the company for 20, 30 years would have to go back to \n     what they earned maybe 10 years ago. Most of us only got \n     between $5 and $10 an hour. We had responsibilities and \n     families to think about.\n       Well, we felt that Diamond Walnut was our family, too. The \n     managers said if we stuck by them, they would stick by us. \n     Some people ended up taking pay cuts as high as 40 percent. \n     After those cuts, we worked even harder; production levels \n     were up. This allowed us to double our productivity and cut \n     the work force in half, from 1,200 to 600, at the same time.\n       In 1990, I was picked to be employee of the year, along \n     with another supervisor. I felt like the award was really for \n     the whole department. We broke the production record on the \n     line that year. Our hard work paid off for Diamond Walnut. \n     The next year, the net sales reached an all-time high, $171 \n     million. The growers' return on their investment was 30 \n     percent.\n       Our contract was up for renegotiation, and we felt sure the \n     company would be ready to repay us for our sacrifices and \n     hard work. Instead, the company wanted to cut our pay even \n     more. They offered a small hourly increase of 10 cents, but \n     they were going to turn right around and take twice that away \n     by making us pay $30 a month for our health coverage. The \n     managers started coming to the production line and brought \n     young men from the outside with them. They wanted to know how \n     we did our work, how they could watch, but they weren't \n     allowed to touch the machines.\n       We knew they were getting ready to replace us. We would go \n     home sometimes at the end of the day and cry because they \n     were forcing us to train the people who were going to take \n     away our jobs. We tried to get the company to be fair. We \n     knew our lower-paid people were just getting by. We were down \n     to $5, $6 for full time. Seasonal workers were getting $4.25 \n     an hour with no health benefits. We knew we could not take \n     another pay cut, but the company said, ``Take it or leave \n     it.''\n       We had never gone on strike before and we had been in the \n     union almost 40 years. We felt the company gave us no other \n     choice, so we went out. The next year, the company put the \n     scabs to work on the line. The long-time, loyal workers--75 \n     percent of us women and minorities--ended up on the picket \n     line fighting for our jobs. That was September 4, 1991, 18\\1/\n     2\\ months ago. We are still trying to get our jobs back. They \n     told us we were not wanted. Their loyalty is to the \n     replacement workers.\n       We still can't believe this happened to us. We thought we \n     had the right to strike to defend ourselves from being \n     exploited by the company. As the months go by, many strikers \n     are losing their homes, their cars, and are getting behind in \n     their bills. Some of us could not afford to pay for \n     insurance, so we have had to skip going to the doctor and \n     hope we wouldn't get sick. Two weeks ago, one of our workers \n     died, without health insurance. We try to cheer each other \n     up. We work toward the day we get our jobs back. We hold \n     prayer meetings on the picket line every Tuesday.\n       While we are struggling to get the jobs back, the U.S. \n     Agriculture Department has given Diamond millions of dollars \n     in subsidies to help the company sell more of its product in \n     Europe. Diamond now sells 40 percent of its walnuts in \n     Europe. The people I talked to were shocked about what \n     Diamond Walnut has done. When I told them the U.S. Government \n     has allowed the company to hire permanent replacements, they \n     didn't believe me and made me repeat the whole story.\n       The union has been working very hard to help us but we need \n     our Government to help us, too. If the law says we have the \n     right to strike without being punished, then how can Diamond \n     Walnut get away with replacing us? I have dedicated 24 years \n     of my life to Diamond Walnut. I will work hard for the \n     company when I get my job back. I believe in our country, in \n     justice and, most of all, I believe in God. I believe that \n     Congress and President Clinton will do the right thing this \n     year.\n\n  By God, he has done the right thing this year. He has done the right \nthing. He is saying that we are not going to provide those additional \nfunds for Diamond to go ahead and expand their product overseas, while \nat the same time holding these hardworking Americans by their necks and \ndenying them the opportunity to even be able to go into negotiations \nand collective bargaining. That is what we are talking about here.\n  [[Page S3716]] That is why I am amazed that this is the first issue \nto come before the Senate in this Congress that concerns working \nfamilies. Instead of trying to help them, we are talking about further \ndisadvantaging people making $5 or $10 an hour. We are talking about \nthe ``Cynthia Zavalas.''\n  Why are we having this debate now? Why are we delaying the important \nappropriations necessary for our national security in order to \nshortchange Cynthia Zavala? That is what I am wondering. That is what I \nam wondering. It is wrong. We are just talking about the condition of \nworking families.\n  I will be participating in a forum tomorrow morning on the proposed \nincrease in the minimum wage. We are not out here this afternoon \noffering an amendment to increase the minimum wage. But tomorrow, we \nare going to provide an opportunity for some individuals to speak to us \nabout the needs of people like Cynthia Zavala, whom I just talked about \nhere.\n  We are going to hear from Barbara and Bill Malinowski, owners of the \nYum-Yum Donut Shop in Waynesburg, PA. A former mineworker who lost his \njob when U.S. Steel closed down the mine, Bill and his wife Barbara \nbought a doughnut shop which now employs 14 people. As small-business \nemployers, they support an increase in the minimum wage.\n  We are going to hear from a small businessman and woman who lost \ntheir jobs. They lost their jobs. We are talking about people trying to \nmake it in America, who are playing by the rules, and they want to \nwork. This issue is about working. We are talking about protection of \nworkers' rights--not about people who don't want to work. When we talk \ntoday about workers' rights, I am reminded that we are not even talking \nabout giving working families in America a livable wage. That is not \nthe issue before the Senate. That is not the issue in the Contract With \nAmerica. That is not here. We are talking about taking away protections \nfor workers\n like Cynthia Zavala.\n\n  The Executive order does not promise Cynthia Zavala her job back, but \nit says that we are not going to see the Department of Agriculture use \nmillions of dollars of taxpayers' funds that come from my State that \nrepresent the toil of workers in my State to go out and help this \ncompany shortchange Cynthia, slam the door on Cynthia. Fifty-seven \nyears your family has given to that company and they have slammed the \ndoor on you. All we are saying is they are not going to get another \nbonus. But now we have an amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nstop that simple act of justice.\n  At tomorrow's forum, Americans will also have a chance to hear from \nBarbara and Bill Malinowski. Bill is a former mineworker who lost his \njob, but now he employs 14 others and, as a small employer, supports \nincreasing in the minimum wage.\n  We'll hear from Nancy Carter, from Monaco, PA, in Beaver County, near \nPittsburgh. Mrs. Carter's husband has had little success finding work \nafter losing his job of 27 years in 1979, when the St. Joseph's Mineral \nCo. shut down. The family has been on and off unemployment and welfare \nas they struggle to find work. Their adult children help support the \nfamily at jobs at $4.50, $5, and $5.50 an hour.\n  These are the kind of working Americans we are talking about. With \nall the other kinds of problems and challenges that we face in this \ncountry, our friends across the aisle want to pass legislation to \ndiminish the rights of workers.\n  David Dow, a pizza shop worker and parent, from Southfork, PA, near \nJohnstown. David and his wife work at low-wage jobs, staggering shifts \nto accommodate child care needs of their two children. They are trying \nto make it, working at low-wage jobs, staggering their shifts to \naccommodate child care. And now in furtherance of the Contract With \nAmerica, the House has voted to diminish child care support.\n  We will have a chance to hear David Dow tell us how he is going to \nhave to look harder for child care if this budget goes through. And if \nyou strike to increase your wages, you are going to get replaced and \nyou may lose your job.\n  We will hear from Tonya Outlaw, a child care center worker at Kiddie \nWorld Day Care, Windsor, NC. Ms. Outlaw is a single mother of two who \nquit an above-minimum-wage job because she could not afford child care. \nShe is allowed to bring her children with her to her current minimum \nwage job as a child care center worker.\n  This is what is really happening in America.\n  We will hear from Alice Ballance, the owner of Kiddie World Child \nDevelopment Center, Windsor, NC. Ms. Ballance owns licensed day care \ncenters in rural North Carolina, primarily serving low-income working \nfamilies. She pays minimum wage but supports an increase.\n  We will hear from Keith Mahone, a contracted custodial worker from \nBaltimore, MD. Mr. Mahone, a single father with joint custody of his \ndaughter, is employed at minimum wage cleaning school buildings for a \nBaltimore city contractor. He is a founding member of an organization \nwhich lobbied for the Baltimore living wage law. Effective July 1995, \nemployers under contract with the city must pay their employees a \nlivable wage.\n  And we will hear from Robert Curry, a small business owner, from \nBraintree, MA. Mr. Curry employs 60 workers at several hardware stores \nin the South Shore area of Massachusetts. He supports an increase.\n  These are examples, Mr. President, of what is happening out there in \nthe work force. We are in the Senate talking about the technicalities \nof an Executive order, whether the President has the power to issue an \nExecutive order. Well, I believe he absolutely does. That can be \ncontested and it will be contested. I am sure there are many political \nleaders who would like to contest it and embarrass a President who is \ntrying to provide some degree of protection to working Americans.\n  And, my God, they need that protection. They need that protection, as \nthey have seen the minimum wage effectively disappear in value over the \nlast several years. These are real families, real workers, people \ntrying to play by the rules, people who want to work to provide for \ntheir families, who want to make sure their kids can get a hot lunch at \nthe school; or maybe that their teenage child can get a summer job \nbecause it is so difficult to find employment; or maybe their older \nchild, who has been able to make it as a gifted, talented, motivated \nyoung person, can attend a good State college.\n  Is that difficult? Increasingly so. In my own State of Massachusetts, \nit is more and more difficult for students to attend college.\n  Mr. President, the larger issue we face, an issue clearly illustrated \nby this debate, is the issue of whether we in Congress are on the side \nof the working families across the country, or on the side of the \nwealthy and powerful.\n  The amendment before us would put the Senate squarely on the side of \nthe wealthy and powerful corporations and against working men and women \nexercising their legal right to strike. This is a clear example of the \nbrazen Republican attempts to tilt the balance of labor-management \nrelations in favor of business and against the workers of America.\n  But this amendment is far from the only example of that kind of bias \nagainst working families. In fact, as the Republican Contract With \nAmerica comes into sharper focus, it is becoming increasingly clear \nthat the first 100 days of this Congress are turning into a 100-day \nRepublican reign of terror against working men and women, against the \nelderly, and against children in need.\n  I would like to take just a few moments to cite some of the examples \nof the harsh approach that our Republican colleagues seem bent on \ntaking.\n  The House Republicans are not only intent on slashing funds for low-\nincome Americans, they also want to rob them of any opportunity to \nimprove their lives. The rescission package eliminates the funding for \nthe summer jobs program for 1995 and for 1996, too; 1.2 million young \nAmericans from the Nation's neediest areas will be without jobs this \nsummer because of those Republican cuts. In Massachusetts, 30,000 young \nmen and women who were to participate in the summer jobs program over \nthe next two summers will have to look elsewhere for employment.\n  The summer jobs program is more than just a paycheck. It offers an \nopportunity to learn the work ethic, acquire real job skills and \ntraining, and \n[[Page S3717]] gain a sense of accomplishment. Why would anyone deny \nyoung people that opportunity?\n  Republicans are not only attacking the poor, they are also assaulting \nthe Nation's cities. The Democratic and Republican mayors of America's \nlargest cities have come out strongly against the elimination of the \nsummer jobs program. They know firsthand how important it is to their \nlocal economy because it provides a practical way for private-sector \nfirms to create jobs for low-income men and women.\n  In my own city of Boston, private sector companies meld their \nprograms with the public service and the summer jobs program. They take \nyoung people the first year they work in a summer jobs program, and \nthey bring them under programs developed by the mayor in conjunction \nwith the private sector. Then they search out promising young people in \nthe second or third year of the program and put them in line for a good \njob with one of several corporations in the Greater Boston area.\n  This is one of the extraordinary examples of the public and private \nsectors working together in an effective and efficient summer jobs \nprogram. And there are other cities in my Commonwealth that have \nsimilar efforts.\n  Victor Ashe, the Republican mayor of Knoxville and president of the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, recently contacted Speaker Newt Gingrich and \nurged him to restore funding for the summer jobs program. Republican \nMayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh has emphasized that this program would \nemploy 8,000 young men and women this summer in his city to tutor \nyoungsters, assist in food pantries and soup kitchens, rehabilitate \nhousing, and learn the value of community service programs.\n  Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago said, ``The summer jobs program truly \nmakes a difference in our lives, and without these jobs, more young \npeople will fall prey to drugs, costing society even more down the \nroad.''\n  Ask any prosecutor in any major urban area about the value of a \nsummer jobs program as crime prevention. Ask any police officer working \non the problems of gangs and violence in local communities and they \nwill talk about the value of the summer jobs program.\n  This program was developed in the wake of the riots in California. \nNow perhaps we must relearn the lessons of our time with the \ncancellation of these programs.\n  Boston Mayor Tom Menino declared the Republicans' misplaced budget \npriorities will be billions for prisons, zero for summer jobs, and \nopportunities. If the Republicans are serious about work, they should \nbegin by restoring funding for the summer jobs program. Perhaps they \nintend to put these young Americans to work in the orphanages or the \nprisons they are planning to build.\n  The House Republican plan also includes drastic cuts in the School \nLunch Program, and in nutrition programs for women, infants, and \nchildren. As many of my colleagues have stated, the famous cry of \n``women and children first,'' is gaining a new, more sinister meaning. \nWomen and children are the first to go hungry, the first to suffer, and \nthe programs that serve them are the first to be cut.\n  Among the programs under attack are the School Lunch Program, which \nfeeds 25 million children every day with a hot meal; the School \nBreakfast Program which feeds 6 million children a day; the WIC \nProgram, which provides food to 5 million women, infants, and children \nevery year, more than 3 million of them children under the age of 5, \nincluding about 2 million infants; and the Child Care Feeding Program \nwhich provides food to millions of children in child care every day.\n  These are programs being cut. These are the sons and daughters of the \nworking parents who need the protection that this Executive order \nprovides. Even worse, the Republican plan also lumps into the same \nblock grant program the programs that feed senior citizens, to provide \nsummer meals for schoolchildren, and special supplement nutrition \nprograms for women and infants.\n  One of the principal criticisms of the feeding programs, the school-\nbased programs, is that they stop in the summer. We have seen efforts \nto provide continuing services through the summer, so that we can try \nto make sure that we can adequately support these children. But now we \nmove backward.\n  This is all against the background of a Carnegie Commission report \njust a few months ago that talked about the permanent effects in terms \nof brain development and behavioral patterns of children, over 1 year \nand under 3 years of age who do not have adequate nutrition.\n  We talk about the challenges that exist for children in schools \ntoday. If we do not provide adequate nutrition for children between 1 \nand 3, we are permanently damaging the ability of those children to \ndevelop their cognitive skills and social skills to survive in a \ncomplex, difficult, challenging place called school.\n  With the Carnegie report, we have just had that evidence presented \nagain by thoughtful men and women, Republicans and Democrats, people \nwho have spent the last 2 years studying this problem. Nonetheless, we \nsee not an expansion of programs targeted toward those children; we see \na cutback.\n  We will hear the answer, ``We are consolidating these programs.'' \nEveryone is for consolidation. Many are for consolidation. We were \nhearing testimony just the other day about what consolidation is going \nto mean.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, we are talking about at \nmost 5 percent. Maybe 5 percent. We are expecting the States to pick up \nthat 5 percent. Come to Massachusetts. Come to Massachusetts, and I \nwill show you where it is not being picked up.\n  My colleagues say on the floor of the Senate that those Governors \nwill pick up the slack. But they are not doing it. They are not doing \nit. And the cutbacks in work-study programs, for example, affect 70,000 \nsons and daughters of working families in my State of Massachusetts. \nThe State is not helping these sons and daughters of working families. \nInstead, working families are paying higher fees and tuition to go to \nschool in my State. That is the rule, not the exception.\n  The health needs of the elderly and the poor will be severely cut \nback as well. I noticed the other day that as we talk about these \nworking families and their children, we have not even begun to talk \nabout cutbacks in chapter 1, which is the program directed toward the \nneediest children.\n  We also ought to talk a little bit about what will happen to the \nparents of these working families. Child care is being cut back, food \nprograms are being cut back, job opportunities are being cut back.\n  If these families live in a colder climate, they face cutbacks in \nenergy assistance. This program helps needy, primarily elderly, seniors \nwho would like to retain the dignity of living in their own homes \nrather than being dependent upon other members of the family, or \nselling their homes and going to a nursing home, but need some help and \nassistance with the fuel oil. That program is being cut.\n  Then we have the chairman of the Finance Committee who has talked \nabout $400 billion in cuts in Medicare and Medicaid over the next 7 \nyears. Cuts of that magnitude will threaten the various academic health \ncenters, the hospitals serving the poor, the other health facilities \nthat are dependent on Medicare and Medicaid. We had the opportunity \njust a few years ago on the Nunn-Domenici amendment to cap Medicare-\nMedicaid. It only failed by five or six votes at that time. We almost \npassed that. It sounded like a pretty good way to cut Government \nspending. But we know what would happen. We would shift it right back \nto the States, they would shift it right to the private sector, and \nthey would shift it back to working families who cannot afford it. And \nwe move further away from any sensible health care policy.\n  So we are talking about our seniors. Our Republican friends propose \nto block grant health funds in a way that would eliminate the Federal \ncommitment to early detection and screening of breast and cervical \ncancer. That is an issue that our committee has been working on.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just advise seniors and others who have \nincurred higher and higher out-of-pocket medical expenses to keep a \nvery close eye on what happens here in terms of Medicare.\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\n  They should also keep an eye on how any Medicare savings are spent. \nAre they going to finance a cut in the capital gains tax.\n  We have already heard discussed in our budget committees the path \nthat will lead to significant cuts for the Medicare. I supported the \nPresident's program last year that would have included some tightening \nin terms of Medicare, targeted not just on recipients but also on \nproviders. But those cuts financed important benefits: prescription \ndrug benefits for our seniors, community-based care, home care for our \nsenior citizens. That plan was an effort to take scarce resources in \nour health care system to make sure they are going to be utilized more \nefficiently, more effectively, more humanely, and more sensibly.\n  I listened to my good friend, Harry Reid, today talk about health \ncare. I want to assure him that just because we have not been debating \nit on the floor of the Senate yet does not mean we are not going to \nhave an opportunity to do so later in this session.\n  It is not my purpose this afternoon to get back into the reasons for \nthe failure of the health care bill. But hopefully that process can \nlead to a new bipartisan effort. On the first day of this Congress, \nSenator Daschle introduced S. 7 as a vehicle to explore common ground. \nIt begins to identify the areas where there has been broad bipartisan \nsupport for health care reform.\n  Health care is not even a part of the Contract With America, not even \nmentioned in the Contract With America, not even referenced in there. \nBut the problem has not disappeared. More and more people are not \ncovered, more and more people are being squeezed, more and more \nchildren are failing to get the care they need. The problem is not \ndiminishing, the problem is growing. We need to focus on that issue. We \ncannot afford to put that matter to the side.\n  Mr. President, I will come back later to some of the other examples \nof callous policies being pursued by the new Republican majority. I see \nmy colleague and friend from Illinois here. I just want to say in \nsummation that I am just amazed as we gather here in the early part of \nMarch that this is the issue before us. After spending a number of \nweeks on the issue of the unfunded mandates, which is an enormously \nimportant issue, and after several weeks on the enormously important \nquestion of amending our Constitution, now we have an emergency measure \nbefore the Congress which the Secretary of Defense says we need in a \ntimely way, and yet the matter we are now debating is an amendment to \ndiminish the protections for working families in this country.\n  It is important as we are having this debate to ask: What has the \nCongress been doing with regard to working families during the period \nof the past weeks? What have they been doing? It is important for \nAmerican families to understand what Congress has been doing. Sure, it \nis reported this way or that way that we are trying to cut this kind of \nprogram to squeeze out administrative costs. Most families are too busy \ntrying to make a nickel to really follow in great detail the path that \nis being followed in the House of Representatives and in the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  I have tried in a brief manner, and will continue to do so, to give \nthem some idea of what is happening. Is the measure before us this \nafternoon going to enhance working families, the families that are hard \npressed, the families that are being held back, held down, whose \nincomes are static, who do not participate in the expanding profits of \nmajor companies? Is that the matter we are talking about in this new \nCongress, how we are going to do something for those families and give \nthem more help, give them more hope, give them a greater future, give \ntheir children a greater future? Is that what we are talking about here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate this afternoon? Of course not. \nTragically we are not. I should not say ``of course not,'' but we are \nnot. We are not. The echo of the proposal that is before the U.S. \nSenate is not one that is going to resonate in families tonight and \nlead parents to say, ``All right, it might not help me, but at least it \nis going to help my children.''\n  ``It might not help me, but it is going to help one of my children \nget a job this summer.''\n  ``It is not going to help me, but maybe it is going to help my \ndaughter get a better education.''\n  That is not the message. It is not a message that says, ``It is not \ngoing to do much for me and my family, but for my parents, who worked \nhard over their lifetime, it is going to mean a little greater hope for \nthem.'' That is not the message.\n  What is it saying to all those I mentioned earlier, what it is saying \nto Cynthia Zavalas, a person just about making minimum wage as part of \na family that has worked 57 years in a company? It is saying: You have \nbeen permanently replaced, effectively fired, and we are not going to \nhelp.\n  The Executive order will not get her job back, but it says that we \nare not going to give an additional financial reward to the company \nthat has treated her poorly. That is what we are saying. And it is just \nbecause of that simple concept that this measure involving our national \nsecurity is being delayed.\n  I am always amazed around here about how we spend our time and what \nwe spend our time fighting for or fighting against. This is one of the \nexamples that really takes the cake.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend, and others, on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have come over here to the floor this \nafternoon believing that the subject was the President's almost \ncertainly unlawful Executive order with respect to striking \nreplacements. I have not understood the debate was going to be on the \nentire panoply of social programs piled up over the course of the last \n20 or 30 or 40 years on the backs of the people of the United States. \nBut I think comments on those programs do deserve at least a certain \ndegree of response.\n  Last week, many of the most eloquent proponents of a wide range of \nsocial and cultural programs voted to reject the constitutional \namendment requiring a balanced budget. Many of them, at least, on the \ngrounds that it should be the Congress itself which provides the \nnecessary discipline to protect future generations from the \nconsequences of our propensity to run up huge unpaid debts.\n And yet when it comes to any criticism, any reduction in even the \ngrowth rate of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of those programs, the \nproponents of fiscal responsibility are denounced as uncaring and \nindifferent to the needs of the American people.\n\n  Perhaps that argument would carry some weight if the growth of those \nprograms had been accompanied by greater opportunities, a higher degree \nof family stability, more unity--in other words, had been accompanied \nby some demonstrable success as a result of all of those spending \nprograms.\n  Of course, the contrary is true. During exactly the period of time \nduring which there have been growing social and economic challenges to \nthis country, deterioration of the society of this country has \naccompanied the growth of those programs hand in hand.\n  That does not prove in and of itself a cause and effect relationship, \nMr. President, but it certainly makes dubious the proposition so \neloquently presented here by the Senator from Massachusetts. The real \nburden which we have imposed on the people of the United States is the \nburden of debt, a burden which day after day, week after week, month \nafter month, constricts our ability to provide jobs and opportunities \nfor the people of this country.\n  We need a change in direction, and the debate here today, as it was \nlast week and the week before, is paradoxically between those who over \nthe years have been known as conservatives but who now believe that \nradical changes are necessary for this country, and those who have led \nthe drive for all of these social programs, these spending programs, \none piled on top of another, who are now so intensely conservative that \nwe hear from them no desire for any change whatsoever, save perhaps to \nspend more money on programs which have not worked in the past.\n  The true proponents of the status quo are those who constantly fight \nagainst any change in our spending priorities whatsoever, who ask for \nmore of the \n[[Page S3719]] very programs which have been associated with a decline \nnot just in our society and our economy but even our civility.\n  I am firmly convinced, Mr. President, that we need a new way, a new \ndirection. The failure to take that new direction, that new road last \nweek has been accompanied in the last week by a substantial loss in the \nvalue of our currency, the dollar, a substantial loss in confidence in \nnations and among people overseas in our seriousness in the retention \nof our leadership. If we cannot pass a constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget, at least we have to be willing to do something about \nout-of-control spending programs even though we are almost certain to \nbe criticized, no matter how small the changes in our priorities, as \nbeing somehow or another unfeeling. We are not unfeeling, Mr. \nPresident. It is our set of policies that will provide true opportunity \nfor the people of the country in the future.\n  And now to the amendment proposed by my distinguished colleague and \nseatmate, the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum].\n  I believe that, as important as the issue of striker replacement is, \nthe issue of who can make such rules under our constitutional system is \neven more important. This debate is not so much over the merits or lack \nof merits of striker replacement as it is over the wrong, and I believe \nalmost certainly unlawful, action of the President of the United States \nto attempt to impose by fiat, by dictate, a policy which has been \nrejected explicitly in a long series of debates by the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  This action, Mr. President, is without precedent. This action is \nclearly in defiance of laws relating to labor/management relationships \ndating back some 60 years, expressly interpreted and approved by the \nSupreme Court of the United States, and debated in each of the last \nseveral Congresses without change. And yet, in spite of this statutory \nhistory, in spite of this judicial history, in spite of this political \nhistory, the President of the United States purports to change those \nrules. When his action is challenged, Mr. President, I am convinced \nthat it will be overturned by the courts as entirely unlawful and \nbeyond his authority.\n  However, we should not wait passively, without reaction, to have the \nconstitutional separation of powers be upheld by the courts of the \nUnited States. We should take that action ourselves. We should take \nthat action ourselves, whatever our views on the merits of striker \nreplacement, but simply to protect the rights and the duties of the \nelected representatives of the people of the United States to make \nfundamental determinations about statutory policies with respect to \nlabor-management relations.\n  That is the issue, Mr. President, with respect to the Kassebaum \namendment. And it is for that reason that all Members of this body who \ncare about the Constitution and the laws and about the separation of \npowers should vote for this amendment, whatever their views on the \nmerits of the underlying policy itself.\n  I am convinced that the Senator from Kansas should be commended. She \nhas a special responsibility as the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nLabor. She is carrying out her duties under difficult circumstances, \nknowing that the issue itself is a contentious one, but she by this \naction has reminded us of our duties which we should now undertake to \nperform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate and compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Kassebaum, from Kansas, for her amendment. I think \nit is regrettable that her amendment is necessary.\n  I heard one of my colleagues say is this not terrible that here the \nRepublicans are and they have this amendment--this is an antiworker \namendment. I totally disagree. This amendment is necessary because of \nan Executive order by the President of the United States to circumvent \nCongress and circumvent the U.S. Supreme Court. Congress has clearly \nstated its will or its desire to keep the law to where employers have \nthe right to hire replacement workers. This President--and the Vice \nPresident, I might mention, because I caught part of his speech that he \nmade to the leadership of the AFL-CIO in a speech in Florida--wants to \noverturn that by Executive order. They want to change law by Executive \norder.\n  The President of the United States is President, but he is not king, \nand he cannot pass law by Executive order. I totally agree with my \nfriend, Senator Gorton, from Washington, who said this Executive order \nwill be determined unconstitutional. It clearly will. It is not a valid \nExecutive order. It will not stand the test of time. It will not stand \nup in a test in court. Clearly it is the President exceeding his \nPresidential authority and power, and it is a flagrant abuse of power.\n  I am reading this Executive order. If my colleagues have not seen it, \nI would encourage them to read it. Just looking at the Executive \norder--this is dated March 8--it talks about, in the first paragraph:\n\n       The * * * Government must assist the entities with which it \n     has contractual relations to develop stable relationships \n     with their employees.\n\n  Why is that a Federal Government responsibility? It says the Federal \nGovernment ``must.'' According to the President's Executive order, they \nwill be forced to.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       All discretion under this Executive order shall be \n     exercised consistent with this policy.\n\n  ``All discretion.''\n\n       The Secretary of Labor may investigate an organizational \n     unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit \n     has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such \n     investigation shall be conducted in accordance with \n     procedures established by the Secretary.\n\n  We are going to give the Secretary of Labor great latitude to \ninvestigate something that he might determine is illegal and, if he so \ndetermines, then he can bar them from any Federal contracts.\n  Let us just take as an example, let us say, a defense contractor. \nMaybe they are working on building a nuclear aircraft carrier or \nfighter aircraft planes, the F-16 or F-14 or something along that line. \nMaybe there is a division within their unit that is having a strike, \nand that employer has a contract with the U.S. Government to produce \nthose planes on time or to make this part on time so they can stay on \ntime and on schedule and not be overpriced.\n  You could have the Secretary of Labor determine: Wait a minute, this \nis a violation. Therefore, you are going to lose this contract.\n  What if they are 70 percent through with the contract? We are going \nto get a new contractor to come in and finish the aircraft carrier? We \nare going to have a new contractor come in and try to pick up with the \ndelivery on the F-16? I do not think so.\n  Talk about discretion for the Secretary. I was wondering how this \nsection 11 of this Executive order--it says:\n\n       The meaning of the term ``organizational unit of a Federal \n     contractor'' as used in this order shall be defined in \n     regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, \n     in consultation with the affected agencies. This order shall \n     apply only to contracts--\n\n  And on and on. So they are going to give the Secretary of Labor total \ndiscretion to determine whatever organizational unit might apply. If \nthey have a strike and they hire permanent replacement workers, then \nthey are totally banned or barred from Federal work.\n  How much would that cost the Federal Government, if you disrupt a \ncontract right in the middle of procuring a particular product or \ncompleting a contract? It could cost a lot of money.\n  Talk about caving in to a special interest group--and I do not say \ncaving in to organized labor, I say caving in to leadership of \norganized labor. This is not a benefit to benefit labor. This is a \nbenefit to say the Federal Government, under this administration, \nthinks they should be involved in labor-management disputes.\n  I heard my colleague say this is not about the underlying issue. One \nshould vote for the Kassebaum amendment regardless of how they feel \nabout striker replacement. I agree with that statement, because clearly \nthe President has exceeded his authority, both against the will of \nCongress and against previous court rulings.\n  [[Page S3720]] On the underlying issue the President is wrong as \nwell. Individuals certainly should have the right to organize. They \nhave the right to strike. If they do not want to work, they should not \nhave to work. But, likewise, an employer has to have the right to hire \npermanent replacement workers to keep the doors open, to keep the plant \nrunning, to make the contracts, to meet the schedules, to be on budget \nor under budget.\n  Then this President's Executive order says: No, if you hire permanent \nreplacement workers, you are going to lose any Federal contracts, you \nare going to be debarred, you will not be able to do Federal \ncontracting.\n  This is an outrageous power grab, and it will not stand the test of \ntime. It should not stand. I hope my friends and colleagues will \nsupport Senator Kassebaum in her amendment. She happens to be right. I \nwish it was not necessary.\n  I might mention, after the President made mention of his Executive \norder, we wrote the President a letter and said by what authority do \nyou do this? The President does not have the authority to do this. The \nPresident does not have the authority to do by Executive order a \nstatutory change, to change the law. Yet that is exactly what he is \ntrying to do. His efforts will not succeed. They should not succeed.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Senator from Kansas in this \namendment, and I hope it will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask for unanimous \nconsent to speak for 5 minutes as though in morning business so as not \nto interrupt this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3696-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE DUCK HUNTING SEASON IN MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is an announcement I want to make \non the floor of the Senate that is certainly important to my State of \nMinnesota. Today, the Governmental Affairs Committee, consistent with a \nrequest that I made 2 weeks ago, corrected an error in the regulatory \nmoratorium bill, that is S. 219, in order to protect the 1995 migratory \nbird hunting season. I am delighted that my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, responded to the concerns of thousands and thousands \nof people who participate in the bird hunting season in Minnesota.\n  When I learned that a provision in the regulatory moratorium bill \nthreatened the 1995 bird hunting season, I asked my colleagues on the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee to correct the bill. I also \nintroduced a piece of legislation to protect the 1995 hunting season \nfrom the moratorium provision. I am delighted to report to the people \nof Minnesota that the committee took the time to remedy the problem so \nthat Minnesotans can enjoy this cherished annual event. I owe a special \ndebt of gratitude to Senator Glenn and Senator Pryor for their work on \nthe committee.\n  Mr. President, in our rush to reform the regulatory process we almost \ncanceled a tradition for this year. Some of my colleagues criticized my \nefforts to correct the language in the bill. They claimed I was using \nscare tactics, that this was some kind of political magic show. But \nnow, by correcting this legislation, the committee has made clear that \nthere was an error in the original bill, an error that was overlooked \nand then vehemently denied for the sake of trying to rush through the \nContract With America. Sometimes haste makes waste.\n  Last week one of my colleagues, a cosponsor of the bill, said that \nthe language in S. 219 exempted the annual bird hunting rulemaking from \nthe moratorium. Perhaps we should note that my colleague was from a \nSouthern State--which from my point of view is fine because I love the \nSouth and grew up, part of my early years, in North Carolina. But the \nnormal duck hunting season opens later in the South--I know my \ncolleague from Oklahoma knows this --than it does in Minnesota.\n  And if the Fish and Wildlife Services' estimated best case scenario \nproved correct, the original S. 219 would have served to delay the \nnecessary rulemaking, and thus opening the season in Minnesota would \nhave been postponed by no less than 30 days.\n  Since Minnesotans do the majority of their hunting at the local shoot \nin early October--our season begins in early October, before the local \nducks fly south--such a delay would have effectively canceled a major \npart of our season. But in my colleague's State, duck hunting season \nwas mid to late November, and therefore might not have been as \nseriously affected by the delay.\n  It has always been clear to me that the bill as originally introduced \ndid not protect the 1995 bird hunting season. Despite strong statements \nthat it was never the intent of the bill's sponsors to put the season \nat risk--and, by the way, I agree that it never was the intent--the \nlanguage of the bill is what matters most. And now, because of the \naction of the Governmental Affairs Committee, we have the protection \nthat we need, the rulemaking goes on, and I am very proud of the fact \nthat the men and women in the State of Minnesota and their children can \nrest assured that we will have no delay or cancellation and that we \nwill have our season.\n  So this is a sort of thank you to my colleagues and a delivery of a \nvery positive message to Minnesotans.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for the Senator's clarification, as original \nsponsor of S. 219, I would like to inform my colleague that we did have \nin the original bill an exception for administrative actions. When \nSenator Roth introduced the bill for markup, we had an exception for \nroutine administrative actions. Also we have always had exceptions for \nlicensing.\n  So the arguments that were made by many people--including President \nClinton--who said that duck hunting licenses and burials at Arlington \ncemetery were jeopardized by the moratorium, were totally incorrect. \nThe bill did state--just so my colleague will know--\n the bill stated and exempted from routine administrative actions--and \nit exempted agencies in their licensing process--which happens to \ninclude hunting and fishing licenses. So they were never in jeopardy. \nBut I know that an amendment was clarified just to make absolutely sure \nthat people in Minnesota would be able to hunt ducks and people would \nbe able to go fishing without any prohibition whatsoever by this \nmoratorium on rulemaking.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague. I want to say to him that I have, of course, heard this \nbefore. The key distinction was that the hunting season is not covered \nby the administrative exemption nor are we talking about licensing. We \nwere talking about the rulemaking the Fish and Wildlife Service \nundergoes every year to open the migratory bird hunting season. The \nproblem was that the moratorium on rulemaking would affect this hunting \nrule. That is what I said. The legislators have to be careful with the \nlanguage. The fact is that the change was made today in Governmental \nAffairs to make sure that Fish and Wildlife could go forward with that \nrulemaking and we will have our season. The proof is in the pudding. I \nam delighted the change took place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3720-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3720-S3730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to respond for a moment, \nand then defer to my colleagues from Massachusetts and Illinois because \nI had an ample amount of time to speak this mornings. I will not take \nmore than 5 minutes.\n  I want to make two points. I made them this morning. I would like to \nbe as concise as possible.\n  The first point is I think the issue is very clear. Senators can vote \ndifferent ways on this question. The President's Executive order says \nthat when the U.S. Government has a contract with a company, a \ncontractor which in turn permanently replaces its workers during a \nstrike, then our Government will \n[[Page S3721]] not be using taxpayer dollars to support future \ncontracts with such a company. It is a simple proposition. Which side \nis the Government on?\n  What we are saying is that our Government is on the side of workers, \nof middle-class people, of working families. It is very simple. One \nmore time it is a shame that our country has not joined many other \nadvanced economies with legislation that would prohibit this permanent \nreplacement of workers. I think we would have passed that bill if not \nfor a filibuster in the last session. That is in fact what happened.\n  The second point. I think it is extremely important that--as much as \nI respect the Senator from Kansas, I think she is one of the finest \nSenators--I believe that her amendment is profoundly mistaken because I \nthink this Executive order is extremely important.\n  The second point is that I do not think that you can separate this \namendment that we are speaking against from the overall Contract With \nAmerica which has just represented an attack on men and women who are \ntrying to work for decent wages, on children, on the whole question of \nhigher education being affordable for families, on the question of \nwhether or not people are going to be able to afford health care. These \nissues become very interrelated.\n  In that sense, this debate and this vote is about more than this \namendment. To be able to be work at a job that pays a decent wage so \nthat you can support your family is very closely tied to whether or not \nyou have collective bargaining rights, very closely tied to whether or \nnot you have some assurance that if a company forces you out on strike, \nif nobody wants to go out on strike, what will then happen is that you \nwill essentially not be permanently replaced and crushed. That is what \nthis is all about, protection for many workers, many employees, and \nmany of their families. That is what this is all about.\n  For the life of me, Mr. President--I conclude on this because I spoke \nthis morning--I simply do not understand why some of my colleagues make \nsuch serious objection to this proposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today in opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Kansas.\n  I would like to point out a couple of things. I mentioned this \nmorning that permanent striker replacement is against the law in a \nnumber of countries, and someone apparently has since questioned \nwhether that is true in Japan because I list Japan as one of the \ncountries where it is illegal.\n  Let me quote article 7, section 1 of the labor union law of Japan.\n\n       The employer shall not engage in the following practices: \n     (1) discharge or show discriminatory treatment towards a \n     worker by reason of his being a member of a labor union or \n     having tried to join or organize a labor union or having \n     performed an appropriate act of a labor union * * *\n\n  Now I would like to quote from the Congressional Research Service.\n\n       The words ``an appropriate act of a labor union'' are \n     construed to include acts arising from collective bargaining \n     with the employer, such as strikes, picketing, and so on. \n     Therefore, under Japanese law it is unlawful for an employer \n     to discharge a striking employee.\n\n  In other words, what President Clinton has done is to give through \nExecutive order workers in the United States the same protection that \nworkers in Japan, Italy, the Western European nations have, with the \nexception of Great Britain. The only Western industrialized nations \nthat do not offer this protection are Great Britain, Hong Kong, \nSingapore, and the United States of America. This morning someone \npointed out to me that I failed to mention Greece as one of the nations \nthat has this particular stipulation.\n  When my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, mentioned that the \naction is unprecedented and invalid, the courts would find it invalid. \nLet the courts decide--not the Senate of the United States on an \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I notice that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhad been talking about the amendment of the Senator from Kansas and \nraising questions about what would happen to the Defense Department \nshould they have a contract, for example, on the F-16 or F-18. I take \npride that most of the engines for the military are manufactured at a \nGeneral Electric plant in Lynn, MA. There are some Pratt & Whitney \nengines by our good neighbors in Connecticut--but for the most part the \nengine parts are manufactured in my State. The company does absolutely \nspectacular work on the new advanced fighters and beyond that.\n  The question was raised by the Senator from Oklahoma, what would \nhappen to these engines should this major contractor go out and have \nthese striker replacements. Well I was watching the sports program last \nnight where we saw those replacement players trying out for the major \nleagues. And I think it is every young boy's goal to play in the \nmajors.\n  But I sure would not want our pilots, our servicemen and women, if \nthey had to be called back to the Persian Gulf or elsewhere to have to \nbe flying planes manufactured by replacement workers, or those engines \nbeing made by replacement workers, or those weapons systems, which \ncould be the difference between life and death. Does the Senator agree \nwith me that one of the principal reasons for this kind of Executive \norder is to make sure that we are going to have thorough, professional, \ncompetent, highly skilled, highly trained, and highly disciplined \nworkers doing a job for America? I am just wondering whether the \nSenator reaches a similar conclusion.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have the floor, and I would like to respond to his \nquestion, and then I will be happy to yield to the Senator for a \nquestion. I think the point made by the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely valid. You can be a good, sincere person, but just not be a \ngood replacement baseball player or person working in an airplane \nfactory. I am going to be leaving the U.S. Senate after 1996. The \nChicago White Sox are not interested in me. I cannot understand it, but \nthat is the reality. Michael Jordan was a great basketball player, but \nhe did not do very well on the baseball field.\n  I think the point made by my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, is extremely important. We find, even where you do not have \npermanent replacements, sometimes factories try to keep going and the \nresults have not been quality products. When we are talking about the \ndefense industry, we want quality production. I point out also to \nSenator Kennedy that France makes military equipment. They sell planes, \nand they prohibit permanent striker replacement. Germany makes weapons; \nthey prohibit permanent striker replacement. Italy manufactures \nmilitary equipment; they prohibit permanent striker replacements. I \nhave not heard from anyone that has said that, in any way, inhibited \nthem from moving ahead. My colleague from Kansas wishes to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thought I heard the Senator from Massachusetts \nsuggest that permanent replacement workers would not be able to offer \nthe same type and quality of work. Would you feel any safer with \ntemporary replacement workers, because this Executive order permits \ntemporary replacements? So I think, if the question was what type and \nquality of work will be done by the permanent replacements, I suggest \nit could be far more risky with temporary workers.\n  Mr. SIMON. I say to my friend from Kansas that if she wants to go \nfurther and prohibit temporary striker replacement, I will support that \nendeavor. As a matter of fact, Quebec does that right now. Canada, as a \nwhole, prohibits permanent striker replacements. In Quebec, you cannot \neven have temporary striker replacement. But whether they are temporary \nor permanent, there is no question that striker replacement results in \na diminution of quality of the end product. The point made by Senator \nKennedy is an absolutely valid point.\n  Let me make a couple of other points while I have the floor, Mr. \nPresident. When the Senator from Oklahoma says Congress has clearly \nstated its opinion \n[[Page S3722]] on striker replacement, that is true, only it is not \nquite the way it was implied by my friend, Senator Nickles. The reality \nis that the House of Representatives passed a bill to prohibit striker \nreplacement, and in the U.S. Senate, 53 Members went on record for \nthis, a majority in the U.S. Senate--53-47. But because of our \nfilibuster rule, we did not pass a law.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma says Congress has clearly stated its \nopinion, he is correct. But contrary to the situation when in 1991, a \nnumber of people, including the present Speaker and present majority \nleader of the House, introduced legislation that would have required \nemployees to be notified in writing that they could not be required to \njoin a union, that did not pass either body. But George Bush issued an \nExecutive order requiring that notices be put up in all workplaces \ntelling employees that they are not required to join a union.\n  To my knowledge, no one tried to reverse that. We recognize the \nauthority of the President to issue that kind of a statement.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I see my friend from Texas anxiously waiting \na chance to get the floor. Because we have had a discussion of social \nissues, and the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, said that \nthere has been no demonstrable success in our social programs, the \nreality is, as we have pared down the appropriations for our social \nprograms, more and more of our children are living in poverty. We, \ntoday, have 23 percent of the children of the United States living in \npoverty--far more than any other Western industrialized nation. That is \nnot, as I have said on the floor of this Senate before, an act of God; \nthat is a result of flawed policies. We have to show greater sympathy \nand concern and we need to have programs to help people.\n  We are on one of these basic philosophical arguments here: Should \nGovernment tilt against working men and women, or should it not? I \nthink Government should not tilt against working men and women. I think \nthat is the fundamental issue here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Texas, and I \nam sure he will agree with every word I have said here.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know it does not have anything to do with \nthe debate we are having, but I want to answer two questions that were \nposed by our colleagues.\n  Let me go back to the Executive order issued by President Bush, \nbecause the Executive order issued by President Bush was to enforce a \nSupreme Court decision called the Beck decision. I am not terribly \nproud of the fact that Executive order was delayed for 2 years before \nit was finally issued. The Beck decision came about when a man named \nBeck, who was working in a State that permitted mandatory unionism, \nsaid that part of his dues were being used for political purposes and \nthat he did not support the political aim of organized labor. So Mr. \nBeck, through long court battles that ultimately reached the Supreme \nCourt, argued that his constitutional rights were being violated, \nbecause he was being forced to provide money for political purposes \nthat he did not support.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Beck was right and ordered that he \nand every other worker be told how much of their union dues went for \npurposes other than to fund collective bargaining. President Bush and \nthe Bush administration, after delaying the implementation of that \nruling, finally issued an Executive order to implement it.\n  So the Beck decision was based on a Supreme Court ruling having to do \nwith the constitutional rights of a worker.\n  It is hardly worth arguing the point raised by our dear colleague \nfrom Massachusetts when he asked if our men in combat want spare parts \nproduced by replacement workers? Well, if the alternative is no spare \nparts, the answer is clearly, yes.\n  None of this, however, has anything to do with this issue. People \nwant to cloak this issue in the union-management cloak. And since there \nare more people who work than people who hire workers, it is a good \ncloak in which to try to hide that which is a legitimate issue of \nfreedom. But the issue involved here could not be clearer, no matter \nhow you define it, when looking at the rights of a free people.\n  If I do not want to work for you, I have the right to quit, and no \none can deny me that right as a free person. But if I do not want to \nwork for you, I do not have a right to keep you from hiring somebody \nelse.\n  What is being proposed here is that the Government step in and say, \noh, it is all right, if I decide not to work for you, for me to quit; \nbut if I decide to quit through a strike--even though it may put you \nout of business, even though it may decimate the city in which your \ncompany is located--you cannot hire people to take my place. Now, you \ncan hire temporary workers, who have to be fired the minute I want to \ncome back, which means in reality that the company has almost an \nimpossible time finding people to work for it. So what you are doing, \nin essence, is giving one party to a labor contract the right to put \nthe other party out of business.\n  We have debated this issue. It has been debated many times in \nCongress. It was debated in the last Congress when the Democratic Party \nhad a majority in both Houses of Congress. And under the rules that we \noperate under, as a free society and as the greatest deliberative body \nin history, it was rejected. Those who supported taking away the rights \nof an employer to hire another worker when a worker refused to work for \nthat employer were defeated in the U.S. Senate.\n  Now President Clinton has come in and said that what he could not do \nthrough the legislative process, he is going to do through Executive \norder; that by Executive order, he is going to say to any company that \nhas a contract with the Federal Government of over $100,000, that the \nSecretary of Labor will be empowered to say to those companies that if \nyou have a strike and the strikers will not come back to work, you \ncannot hire permanent replacement workers who want to work to keep your \ncompany in business. And if you do hire permanent replacement workers, \nwe have the right to take away and break any Government contract you \nhave and bar you from getting any contracts with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There are a lot of gray areas here, but as I read this, if General \nDynamics--of course now Lockheed of Fort Worth--had a sand and gravel \noperation, in addition building F-16's, and they had a strike in their \nsand and gravel operation that shut them down as the major employer in \na small town in North Carolina, and that small town had lots of \nunemployment and many people who were willing to come to work in sand \nand gravel extraction, those people could not come on as permanent \nemployees because General Dynamics would have its contracts in Fort \nWorth with the Federal Government abrogated.\n  Mr. President, why, in a free society, should we want to do this? \nWhy, in a free society, should we say to someone who, after all, has \nput up their capital, saved all their lives to start a business, \ncreated jobs--which people voluntarily took and voluntarily decide \nleave--that they are prohibited from hiring somebody else who wants to \ndo the work? Why should we do that?\n  Well, there is no argument for doing that other than greedy special \ninterests.\n  A President who says that he is some new kind of Democrat, whatever \nthat means, a President who says that he was coming to Washington to \nend the cozy special-interest way of doing business, comes to \nWashington, and by Executive order, gives one of the largest and most \npowerful special-interest groups in America the right to intimidate and \nthe right to destroy people's businesses. It is not right.\n  This ought to be stopped, not because of labor and management rights; \nit ought to be stopped for the very simple reason that it is \nfundamentally and profoundly wrong to do this.\n  What the President is doing is using the contract power of the \nFederal Government to deny people their rights. What he is doing is \ndenying the rights of the people who have put up their life savings, \nwho have started businesses, and who want to provide jobs when there is \na strike. The people who had the jobs do not want to do the work.\n  Under our existing laws, under our legal system, if other people are \nwilling to come in--and often subject \n[[Page S3723]] themselves to all kinds of intimidation, both physical \nand verbal--and take a job and work because they want the job, they \nhave that right. The Congress voted on this issue and the President was \nunable to prevail. He certainly could not prevail in this Congress, \nbecause Americans, based on the areas where he did prevail, said no to \nexactly this kind of special-interest deal.\n  Now the President is trying to do this by Executive order. What we \nare trying to do is to stop the President. This is within the \nprerogative of Congress to make the law of the land. And I do not think \nanybody here who looks at this will see this as anything more than a \npayoff to special interest.\n  I do not know what is going to happen on this amendment. I understand \nthere is going to be a motion to table. There may be a point of order. \nI, for one, am going to vote to overrule the Chair on this issue.\n  And I want to promise my colleagues this issue is not going to go \naway. I do not know how many times we are going to debate it, but I am \ndetermined that the President is not going to win on this issue, \nbecause it is not right. I can assure you that, in good time, when the \nAmerican people finish the job they started in 1994, if this Executive \norder is still standing, it will not be standing much longer after \n1996.\n  But this is a very important issue. This is a freedom issue. This \ndoes not have anything to do with unions. This does not have anything \nto do with employers. It has to do with the right of a free people to \nwithhold their labor and the right of the employer to hire somebody \nelse who is willing to work.\n  To get into all of this jargon about collective bargaining confuses \nthe issue and is an attempt to cloak the fact that we are really \ntalking about the rights of a free people.\n  I am going to do everything I can, as one Member of the Senate, to \nstop the President from limiting the freedom of employers, people who \nput up their capital, to hire replacement workers when the people who \nare currently working refuse to work. And I am going to do it not \nbecause of labor versus management, or management versus labor, but \nbecause you either believe in freedom or you do not, and I do. I think \nthis is a fundamental issue.\n  I congratulate our colleague for bringing this issue up. I want to \nurge her to stand by this issue. I would rather lose on a technicality \nand continue to fight this issue than to pull this down and allow the \nPresident to do this. He may be successful. But I think people ought to \nknow where our party stands and where our Members stand. We are opposed \nto this kind of special-interest power grab and political payoff, \nbecause it is fundamentally wrong and it is fundamentally rotten, and \nit ought to be stopped.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, whether we vote on \na motion to table or whether we vote on the germaneness rule--we have \noverruled germaneness on many occasions, and it takes simply a \nmajority. I think that we ought to do it in this case. If we cannot do \nit this time, we will have a lot more bills that this President is \ngoing to want to pass. He will face this issue on each and every one of \nthem until finally we prevent this outrage from occurring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas with great interest. Let me say to begin with that I am not \na strong apostle of Executive orders. I suppose they number into the \nthousands. There have been Executive orders going back over many, many \ndecades.\n  Some things that the distinguished senior Senator from Texas said \nhave caught me with a strong sense of fascination. He talked about this \nExecutive order's being a ``political payoff'' by the President. It \nseems to me that we allow ourselves sometimes to make some very extreme \nstatements. I do not know that that statement by the Senator from Texas \ncan be documented. I do not know that it can be proved. I think it is a \nrather reckless charge. I would assume that those Members, like myself, \nwho oppose this amendment might likewise be charged with political \npayoffs, if that theory is carried to its ultimate conclusion.\n  Let me say to the distinguished Senator that he has no monopoly on \nstanding up for freedom--freedom of conscience, freedom of the \nindividual to work. When God drove Adam and Eve from the garden, he \nissued an edict that has followed man through the course of the dusty \ncenturies and will accompany man to the end of his days: ``In the sweat \nof thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for \nout of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou \nreturn.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas speaks of ``intimidation.'' I \ncan remember the days when the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency was \nbrought into West Virginia.\n  The Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency was headquartered in Roanoke, \nVirginia and Bluefield, West Virginia.\n  The Roanoke office operated primarily as railroad detectives.\n  The Bluefield office, headed by Tom Felts, operated primarily as mine \nguards. They were originally employed by the coal companies to police \nthe unincorporated coal company towns. As the union movement began to \ngrow, they began to serve more and more as union busters. The miners \nwould call them ``thugs.''\n  It became their primary job to keep union organizers out of the \ncompany towns. If the miners went on strike, they evicted the miners \nfrom the company houses, and used whatever means necessary to break the \nstrike, from bullying the miners, to beating, and even murdering.\n  The Baldwin-Felts operated throughout southern West Virginia with the \nexception of Logan County. In that county, Sheriff Don Chafin \nmaintained a 200-man deputy sheriff force, allegedly in the pay of the \ncoal companies in Logan County, and it was their job to keep the union \norganizers out of the county.\n  I mentioned that Tom Felts headed the Bluefield office. His brothers, \nLee and Albert, both Baldwin-Felts mine guards, were two of the eight \nguards who were killed in the Matewan Massacre.\n  The coal miners of West Virginia have seen intimidation. I grew up in \na coal miner's home. I can remember when there was no union. The man \nwho raised me, who was kind enough to take me as an orphan--I was 1 \nyear old--and brought me up in his home, was a coal miner. I can \nremember the days when he worked from daylight until after dark to \n``clean up his place.''\n  That meant that a coal miner, if he did not clean up his working \nplace, if he did not remove all the slate, the coal, and the rock, that \nhad been shot down with dynamite, if he did not clean it up before he \nleft that night, was told that there was always someone else who would \nbe glad to take his place. There was no union to protect his job.\n  The coal miners took what they were given. They had no weapon with \nwhich to fight back. Many times as a boy I recall going down to the \ncompany store at Stotesbury, in Raleigh County where I lived, and \nreading on the bulletin board a notice that, come the beginning of the \nnext month, the miners would suffer a cut in their wages. The price per \nton of slate, the price per ton of coal, would be reduced from 50 cents \nto 45 cents, or to 30 cents or to 25 cents.\n  In those days coal miners wore their carbide lamps on cloth caps. \nThey had no way of demanding that safety be enforced in the workplace. \nThey bought their own dynamite, they bought their augur, their pick, \ntheir ax, their shovel. I have been in the mines, and I have seen where \nmy dad worked. I could hear the timbers cracking to the right, the \ntimbers cracking to the left.\n  I saw the water holes through which those men had to make their way \non their knees. The roof was not high enough for them to walk upright. \nThey had to walk on their knees. They had to shovel that coal, shovel \nthe rock and heap those cars with the loads of slack or lump coal or \nslate or rock or whatever it was, while on their knees.\n  They had no way of demanding that their pay be increased. They just \nhad to take whatever the company decided at a given time to pay them. \nThere was no union. I was there when the coal miners union came to West \nVirginia, the coal miners union. I can remember the coal miners having \nto meet, in \n[[Page S3724]] barns, in empty buildings, clandestinely, in order to \norganize a union.\n  Many times I have seen my dad overdrafted on payday. He had worked \nthe full 2 weeks, and on payday was in debt to the coal company. Then \nwhen the union came, I saw the faces of those coal miners. The faces \nwould light up. At last, the coal miners had a weapon with which they \ncould bargain collectively concerning their wages and their working \nconditions. They could strike, if need be, to force the company to \nimprove health and safety conditions, and to enforce safety in the \nworkplace.\n  Many times I walked into the miners' bathhouse at Stotesbury--not \nmany times, but several times I walked into the bathhouse at \nStotesbury--as a boy and as a young man and I saw stretched out on the \nbathhouse floor a dead coal miner who had been electrocuted or run over \nby a mine motor. One of my friends, Walter Lovell, had both legs--both \nlegs--cut off one night by a runaway motor. In this day and time, his \nlife might have been saved.\n But he died of loss of blood and gangrene. My own dad mashed his \nfingernail. He lost his finger. If it had been 2 or 3 days later before \ngoing to the hospital, he would have lost a hand. Another week, he may \nhave lost his life.\n\n  I can remember seeing a man in the coal mining company's doctor's \noffice at Stotesbury, waiting in great pain because he had mashed his \nfinger and gangrene had set in. Within a few days, he was dead.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas used the phrase ``they don't \nwant to work,'' ``don't want to work.'' Perhaps they do not want to \nwork because they want certain safety conditions improved. It is not \nlaziness always. Now, I have not always agreed with the unions, and on \nsome occasions, I have not sympathized with strikes. There have been \nsome strikes that I thought were not called for. But because miners or \nother workers seek to improve their safety conditions, their working \nconditions, their wages is not a matter of their not wanting to work.\n  When I ran for the U.S. Senate, I was initially opposed by John L. \nLewis, the coal miner's chieftain. He eventually came around to support \nme, but the thing that made my decision to run for the U.S. Senate, may \nI say to the Senator from Texas, the thing that made the decision for \nme to run for the U.S. Senate was the very fact that Mr. John L. Lewis, \nthe president of the United Mine Workers, sent word to me in West \nVirginia not to run for the Senate, but instead to run again for the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I had been elected to the House three times, and I decided I would \nlike to get around the State during a break between the sessions and \ndetermine what kind of support I would have for a Senate race. While I \nwas in Wheeling, West Virginia, one night, I got word from a man by the \nname of Bob Howe, representing the United Mine Workers of America--John \nL. Lewis' liaison man working on the House side.\n  While I was in West Virginia, Mr. Howe called me on the telephone and \nsaid, ``I'd like to talk with you. When will you be back in \nWashington?''\n  I said, ``I don't know when I'll be back. What do you want to talk \nabout?''\n  He said, ``Well, `the boss'''--the boss--``wants me to get a message \nto you.''\n  I said, ``Well, the closest I will be to Washington for several weeks \nwill be when I go to Romney next Thursday night to speak to a Lion's \nClub,'' or whatever it was, a civic organization.\n  He said, ``Fine, I will come over there and meet you.''\n  So he drove over to Romney, West Virginia. We met. The message was \nfrom Mr. John L. Lewis, who sent word that he did not want me to run \nfor the Senate; Mr. Lewis wanted me to run for reelection to the House.\n  He said, ``You have a good labor record. We will be glad to support \nyou for the House, but if you run for the Senate, Mr. Lewis will come \ninto West Virginia and campaign against you. He will campaign for \nWilliam Marland,'' who was a former Governor of West Virginia. So I \nsaid to Mr. Howe, ``I'll be in touch with you.''\n  That very night, I drove south into Beckley, WV. Those were the days \nwhen we had nothing better than a two-lane road in West Virginia. We \ndid not have four-lane roads in West Virginia. I can remember the days \nwhen we did not have two-lane roads in West Virginia and when we even \nhad to blow the horn on the car when we went around a curve.\n  In any event, I drove to southern West Virginia that night, and on \nthe way, I stopped at a telephone booth in Petersburg, Grant County, \nwhich, by the way, is a strong Republican county, about 4-to-1 \nRepublican, and goes for Robert C. Byrd.\n  Snow was up around my ankles when I went into that telephone booth. I \ncalled my wife and I said, ``Erma, I've reached my decision.''\n  She asked, ``Concerning what?''\n  I said, ``Running for the Senate.'' I said, ``I've made up my mind.''\n  ``What made your mind up?''\n  I said, ``John L. Lewis. When he threatened to come into West \nVirginia and campaign against me, that made my decision.''\n  She was back here in Arlington in our little five-room house at that \ntime, taking care of our young daughters and the dog. We had a dog \nnamed Billy. That was Billy Byrd I. We now have Billy Byrd II.\n  I drove south and got into Beckley in the early morning, called a few \npeople in southern West Virginia, called in the press, and I said, \n``I'm going to be a candidate for the Senate. William C. Marland is \ngoing to be my opponent, and John L. Lewis is going to come into the \nState and support Mr. Marland.''\n  Not long thereafter, Senator Matthew M. Neely, a Senator from the \nState of West Virginia, died. Instead of Mr. Marland's running against \nme, he filed for the unexpired seat of Mr. Neely. It was then that Mr. \nLewis asked me to come downtown and see him at his office. The coal \nminers in West Virginia had been upset at the prospect that Mr. Lewis \nhad planned to support Mr. Marland against Robert Byrd.\n  So I went downtown to meet with Mr. Lewis at his office. Mr. Lewis \nlooked at me with those twinkling blue eyes that seemed to pierce right \nthrough me, and said, ``Young man, I resented your announcing that I \nwould come into West Virginia and support Bill Marland against you. I'm \nin the habit of making my own press announcements.''\n  And I said, ``Well, Mr. Lewis, you are a great labor leader. My dad \nwas a coal miner. I can remember when there weren't any unions and \ntoday there are 125,000 coal miners in West Virginia, and they are in \nyour union.\n You have been a good labor leader. And the union has been good for the \ncoal miners. But when you sent Mr. Howe into West Virginia to tell me \nto run for the House again, not run for the Senate, and that you would \ncome into West Virginia and campaign for Marland against me, I resented \nthat. And that made up my mind. That made my decision to run for the \nSenate. Mr. Lewis became a strong supporter, and we were friends until \nhis death.\n\n  I say this just to say to my friend from Texas that some of us who \noppose this amendment today do not feel that we are paying off any debt \nto any special-interest group.\n  I was opposed by Mr. George Titler, the president of the United Mine \nWorkers, district 29, when I ran for the West Virginia State Senate in \n1950. Why? He called me into his office after I was elected to the \nHouse of Delegates in 1946, before the first meeting of the House of \nDelegates in the session of 1947, and told me he wanted me to vote for \na certain individual for Speaker of the House of Delegates. I said, I \ncan't do it. I'm going to vote for his opponent.\n  I told him why. I said, ``In the first place, I have assured this man \nI would vote for him. In the second place, I have been told by those \nwho serve in the legislature that he is the better man. I am going to \nvote for him as I promised.'' Whereupon Mr. Titler said, ``When you run \nfor reelection, we will remember you.'' Consequently, in 1948, when \nHarry Truman ran for reelection, the leadership of the United Mine \nWorkers in that district was opposed to my reelection.\n  Here I was, a little old Member of the House of Delegates, running \nfor reelection to the House of Delegates in a big election. There were \nmany other offices at stake. Yet, the headquarters of the UMWA District \noffice concentrated on that poor little old coal miner's son's run for \nreelection to the House of \n[[Page S3725]] Delegates. I won the election. Do you know how I did it? \nI went right down into the local union meetings with my campaign.\n  George Titler even visited the Stotesbury local union--of which my \ndad was a member--and urged those miners to vote against me. I sat in \non the meeting, and when Mr. Titler completed his speech, I spoke to \nthe coal miners; I spoke their language. And they gave me their \noverwhelming support.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas speaks of those who invest \ncapital. We have to have investors of capital. They have helped to make \nthis country a great country. But what is the working man's capital? \nThe working man's capital, my old coal miner dad's capital, his only \ncapital was his hands and the sweat of his face. God had laid that \npenalty upon man: ``In the sweat of Thy face shalt thou eat bread.''\n  There is nothing more noble than honest toil. And so it is, that I \nstand today against this amendment. Intimidation works two ways. No \nlonger is the coal miner intimidated. No longer is he driven as with a \nlash. ``Clean up your place; if you don't, there is somebody else \nwaiting for your job.'' No longer does the coal miner have to buy at \nthe company store.\n  Something can be said, of course, pro and con, about almost \neverything. I have never been ruled by any union. They know that. I \nhave never worn any man's collar but my own--none. The Governor of West \nVirginia once asked me to get off the Democratic ticket. I said no.\n  I could tell the Senator from Texas many stories, I think, which \nwould perhaps delight him because I stood up against the top leadership \nin the union, but the rank and file coal miner stood with Robert C. \nByrd. They knew I was their friend. I was their friend then. I will \nalways be their friend.\n    \n    \n  The Senator may very well remember an occasion when I offered an \namendment here to help the coal miners and fought hard for it. I went \nto the offices of Republicans and Democrats in the interest of my coal \nminers amendment. The then majority leader, Mr. Mitchell, was against \nme. The then minority leader, Mr. Dole, was against me. The President, \nMr. Bush, was against me. I had the battle won until right there in the \nwell of the Senate, the joint leadership peeled off three votes that \nhad looked me in the eye and said they would vote for my amendment.\n  Well, that was pretty tough to lose, but I got up off the carpet, \ndusted myself off and, magnanimous in defeat, said, ``I lost. Let's go \non to the next one.''\n  I say to my friend from Texas that I have faced intimidation \npersonally, and I have seen the coal miners and other workers of this \ncountry face intimidation when the only weapon that they had was the \nunion--the only weapon they had with which to protect their rights. And \nso I stand against the amendment.\n  I do not speak evil of those who support the amendment. We have \ndifferent viewpoints around here. But these are not ``greedy special \ninterests,'' not the people I represent. They are not greedy special \ninterests, the workers in West Virginia.\n  The Senator may wish to comment while I have the floor. I will be \nglad to hear what he has to say.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I am always educated when I \nlisten to the great former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand I think he has given us a great lecture this afternoon.\n  I appreciate him yielding because I have to go back for an \nappointment, but I wanted to make a point. Everything that the Senator \nhas said today I agree with. There was a time in this country where \npower was vested too greatly in the hands of business, and it created a \ndistortion in the marketplace. That needed to change, and we changed \nit. Now, some people did escape it. I am looking at one of those \npeople, a great testament to the fact that America works. Robert C. \nByrd is a great testament to the fact that America is a great country \nand a land of opportunity.\n  My point, Mr. President, is that you can go beyond the point of \nhaving a fair balance. It is one thing to guarantee the rights of \npeople to strike, to be a member of a union and give them the ability \nto go to the employer and say these are things we demand or we will \nwithhold our labor. But once you reach the point where you can say to \nthe employer, not only will we withhold our labor but we will have \nCongress, or in this case the President using Executive power, prevent \nyou from hiring anybody else, that puts us in a similar position today \nthat we were in during the era of which the Senator speaks--only this \ntime it is those who provide the jobs having their rights denied.\n  I am concerned that we are going too far in strengthening the rights \nof labor as compared to the rights of people who invest their money.\n  I am concerned that we are going to have a rash of strikes, and we \nare going to initiate labor unrest. Since the short period after World \nWar II, where we had labor unrest for good reason--we had held wages \nback; prices had risen in the war--we have had relative stability.\n  I am concerned that if we take away the rights of the employer to \nhire a replacement worker or replacement workers when the union will \nnot come back to work, that we will go to the opposite extreme from \nthat the Senator spoke of. And I simply say that you can go too far in \nthe direction of management, as the law did in the 1930's, but I think \nyou can go too far in the direction of labor, as I believe this \nExecutive order does.\n  So, with profound respect for everything that the Senator is saying, \nI think the President's Executive order was wrong.\n  Obviously this is a free society. This is the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. And one of the reasons it is, is because the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is a Member. But this is an \nissue where I think the President is wrong and I believe that this is a \ncase of promoting the interests of one special interest--and it is a \nspecial interest. Just as business is a special interest, so is labor. \nI think the President is going too far. I think it hurts the country. \nThat is why I am in support of the amendment.\n  It is not to say that I would ever go back; and I hope, had I served \nwhen the Senator served, that on many of those issues we might have \nbeen on the same side. But today I do not think anybody can argue that \nlabor lacks rights. It is a question of what are the legitimate rights \nof the people who invest their own money, who create jobs.\n  It is the balance of the two that I seek, and I believe this goes \nbeyond that delicate balance.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding. I am not opposing the question, \nand it is very generous of him, as he always is.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respect the Senator's viewpoint. I respect \nevery Senator's viewpoint, here.\n  I, too, seek a balancing of the interests. And I think that is what \nwe are doing in opposing this amendment. As I understand the amendment, \nit speaks of lawful--lawful strikes. I think the strikes we are talking \nabout are those that are lawful strikes. I think we are just going in \nthe opposite direction if we support this amendment.\n  This amendment prevents any funds appropriated in fiscal year 1995 \nfrom being used to ``implement, administer, or enforce any Executive \norder, or other rule, regulation, or order, that limits, restricts, or \notherwise affects the ability of any existing or potential Federal \ncontractor, subcontractor, or vendor to hire permanent replacements for \nlawfully striking workers.'' Obviously, if it is unlawful that puts a \ndifferent color on it, a different face on it. Mr. President, the \nultimate tool and the legal right of an American worker under \ncollective bargaining, the right to strike, should not become the right \nto be fired. It should not become the right to be fired.\n  President Clinton signed an Executive order that allows the Secretary \nof Labor to terminate for convenience any Federal contract with a firm \nthat permanently replaces lawfully striking workers. So I emphasize \nagain the word ``lawfully.'' President Clinton's order also allows the \nSecretary of Labor to debar contractors that have permanently replaced \nlawfully striking workers, thereby making the contractor ineligible to \nreceive Government contracts until the labor dispute that sparked the \nstrike is resolved. This order will affect some 28,000 companies that \nreceive 90 percent of Federal contract dollars. In signing this order, \nthe \n[[Page S3726]] President has thrown his support, and the protection of \nthe Federal Government, behind the principle that American workers can \nemploy every facet of collective bargaining, including the right to \nstrike, in their efforts to resolve labor disputes. The amendment we \nare considering today in my judgment would destroy that protection.\n  In recent years, the right to lawfully strike has more and more \nbecome the reason to be fired, or to be displaced by permanent \nreplacement workers. Being replaced by temporary replacement workers is \none thing. But being replaced by permanent replacement workers is quite \nanother.\n The ability of companies to easily hire permanent replacement workers \nfor employees lawfully engaged in a strike over proposed changes in the \nterms of their employment undermines the incentive of companies to \nnegotiate the speedy resolution of labor-management conflicts. I note \nthat, in recent years, changes in the terms of employment are just as \nlikely to be decreases in compensation levels or health benefits to \nworkers, rather than increases. American workers are being asked to do \nmore and more for less and less, or with fewer and fewer workers, than \never before. In a hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources in the last Congress, Mr. Jerry Jasinowski, \npresident of the National Association of Manufacturers, testified that \nas a result of increased global competition, additional costs must \noften be passed back to workers in the form of ``lower compensation or \nlower employment.'' Strikes may often be the last resort for employee \ngroups that have been squeezed hard by this process.\n\n  Proponents of this amendment have suggested in the past that \nlegislation that would protect the return to work of American workers \nengaged in a lawful strike would drive jobs out of America and dampen \neconomic growth. This is a scare tactic, plain and simple. American \njobs have already been moving out of the United States. They are \nleaving our shores for a variety of reasons--lower production costs due \nto cheaper labor, greater international use of child labor, lax \nenvironmental and worker safety standards, Government subsidies, and \neasy or even preferential access to the U.S. market from abroad. In \nsome overseas locations, workers have no collective bargaining rights--\nnone. Just like the situations that were prevalent back in the coal \nfields when I was a boy, when miners could be intimidated or cowed into \naccepting wages and working conditions which would be unthinkable \ntoday. And those conditions are prevalent overseas in may countries. \nThese would be unthinkable today in these United States. Just as those \nconditions back in the hollows and hills of West Virginia today would \nbe unthinkable. They were unthinkable then, but who was there to \nchampion the rights of the hard-working people who had to go down into \nthe bowels of the Earth and labor with their hands and in the sweat of \ntheir face earn a crust of bread for their children?\n  All of these factors reduce costs for companies moving off of U.S. \nshores, and increase their profits. But what is good for profits is not \nalways good for the human beings who do the work.\n Millions of men and women in this country have only the capital of \ntheir bare hands, a strong back, a strong neck. They will not go back \nto the days when that strong back felt the lash of intimidation and the \nthreat: ``Clean up your place before you leave. There is someone else \nwaiting for your job.''\n\n  I do not believe that the United States should lower its safety and \nenvironmental standards, or promulgate Third-World working conditions, \nin order to compete on this kind of a playing field. Historically, \nunions and collective bargaining have served to contain the abuses of \nowners and management. Unions and collective bargaining have also \nworked historically to improve conditions for large numbers of working \npeople previously employed in the sweatshops, in the shipyards.\n  Try riveting. Try welding. Try the job of being a shipfitter in the \nshipyards in Baltimore when the cold winds whip across the bay and \nfreeze the vapor of your breath when it hits your eyelashes. I can hear \nthose rivets in my dreams. I know what it is to be a worker, to have to \nwork with my hands. There is nothing dishonorable about it. The Bible \nsays, ``The laborer is worthy of his hire.''\n  Throughout the years, unions have helped to ensure fair and equitable \ntreatment for employees, and these standards have carried through to \nnonunion workers as well. They have benefited likewise. Now, unions \nmust strive to protect the jobs, the health benefits, the retirement \npackages, and compensation levels of employees from excessive \ndevaluation in the name of competitiveness, downsizing, or \nrestructuring.\n  While I agree that the United States must work to compete more \neffectively in global markets, and that restructuring the economic \nrelations among the United States and her trading partners may be \nessential to improving and expanding trade, I do not believe that we \nshould enter into any agreement, or support any action, that does not \nbenefit both the American industries and American workers.\n  I voted against the North American Free-Trade Agreement. I voted \nagainst the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \nin part because these agreements will likely lead, in this Senator's \njudgment, to the displacement of many American workers--workers \nunlikely to have the skills required to easily secure other employment. \nSuch displaced workers only add to burdens we already face in terms of \nmeeting the challenges of an increasingly competitive international \neconomy, and also mean a continued decline in the basic standard of \nliving for millions of Americans and their children.\n  Undermining whatever support exists for striking workers to return to \ntheir jobs upon the successful conclusion of negotiations further \nencourages companies to hire permanent replacement workers at the \nlowest wage that the market will bear. Strikes, it is important to \nnote, are the absolute last resort of working men and women in some \nsituations. A strike is not a desirable consequence for labor or \nmanagement. Striking workers are faced with a considerable loss of \nincome for an undetermined period of time.\n  I know. I once was a small businessman; a small, small businessman; \nvery small; very small. I had a little grocery store in Sophia, WV. \nThere was a big coal mining strike in West Virginia in the beginning of \nthe 1950's. The strike lasted several months. Some of the coal miners \ncould not get food for their children. They could not get credit at the \ncompany store. So they came to Robert Byrd's little jot'em down store.\n  They came to the little jot'em down store, the Robert C. Byrd grocery \nstore in Sophia. I let them have food on credit. They were on strike. \nIt was a long strike. But I let them have whatever I had in the \nshelves. I did not have a lot. But it saw some of them through--the \ncoal miners in Raleigh County.\n  In 1952, I ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. I attended a \nDemocratic rally one night. And the president of the United Mine \nWorkers District, headquartered in Charleston, the State capital, was \nspeaking at the rally.\n  There were three candidates for Governor. And, of course, that meant \nthree factions. And I did not want to align myself with any faction. I \nwanted to be liked by everybody. I wanted everybody to be for me. I \nwanted the votes of all.\n  UMWA District President Bill Blizzard, one of those fire-eating, \nunion leaders in the old days, was speaking when I arrived at the rally \na bit late. He pointed his finger at me and said, ``Whether they are a \ncandidate for constable or for Congress''--he pointed his finger right \nat me. I was a candidate for Congress--``if they do not vote for our \ncandidate for Governor, don't you coal miners vote for them.''\n  I was not welcome at the rally. The master of ceremonies happened to \nbe a young attorney who, after Mr. Blizzard had finished speaking, \nsaid, ``Now we will have the benediction, and after the benediction go \nover into the other room of the schoolhouse and get yourself some ice \ncream and cakes and refreshments.''\n  About that time, an old, grizzled coal miner stood up in the back of \nthe room, and said, ``We want to hear Byrd.'' And this enterprising \nyoung lawyer said, ``You can hear Byrd some other time. We are going to \nhave the \n[[Page S3727]] benediction.'' Well, nobody is going to argue with that. \nLet the preacher give the benediction.\n  But then I said to a couple of my friends who were there with me that \nnight, ``Go out to the car and get my fiddle.'' I started playing a few \ntunes and the whole crowd came back in with their ice cream and cake \nand sat down. They filled the room.\n  I said, ``When you were on strike, you coal miners, when you coal \nminers were on strike, who fed your children? Did Bill Blizzard, the \nUnited Mine Worker President, feed your children? How many groceries \ndid he provide when you were in need? I fed your children. Are you \ngoing to vote against the man who helped the coal miners when they were \non strike?'' They answered with a loud ``No!'' The miners gave me a big \nvote in that election, and Bill Blizzard became my supporter and \nfriend.\n  So I have been a worker in the field myself. I know what it is to \nhave my brother-in-law's father killed in a slate fall in the coal \nmines. I know what it is to have the brother-in-law die from \npneumoconiosis--black lung.\n  Workers do sometimes strike for better working conditions, for safer \nworking conditions.\n  They do not strike ``because they don't want to work.''\n  A strike often pits brother against brother, neighbor against \nneighbor, and can tear entire communities apart. However, gutting this \naction of last resort by allowing companies to hire permanent \nreplacement workers, as this amendment does, removes the incentive for \ncompanies to seriously negotiate with their work force.\n  Research has shown that strikes involving permanent replacement \nworkers last an average of seven times longer than strikes that do not \ninvolve permanent replacement workers. Strikes involving permanent \nreplacements also tend to be more contentious, and can disrupt whole \ncommunities for long periods. In my own State of West Virginia, a labor \ndispute at Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation was unresolved from November \n1990, until June 1992. This dispute resulted in the hiring of 1,000 new \nworkers as permanent employees by the company. The striking workers \nwere told that if and when the dispute was resolved, they would not get \ntheir jobs back. Eventually, contract negotiations resumed and an \nagreement was finally reached that returned union workers to their \njobs. If it had not been possible to promise these replacement workers \npermanent jobs, efforts to find the replacements might have been \nhindered, giving the company greater incentive to negotiate with the \nunion and likely resolving this labor conflict much sooner.\n  Proponents have argued that the status quo should remain the status \nquo--that no effort should be made to shore up the eroding ability of \nworkers to strike for fair and equitable compensation, health benefits, \nand retirement packages. This argument simply does not recognize the \nchanging economic and employment conditions brought about by changes in \nthe world economy and by the adoption of recent trade agreements that \nhave eroded the income power and options of American workers.\n  We must not take actions that would denigrate the inherent dignity of \nwork or the noble role of the American worker in the life of this \nNation. All of us enjoy the fruits of their labor. The sweat of their \ncollective brows, the calloused hands, the bent backs, the wrinkled \nfaces, and their broken health deserve our gratitude and our utmost \nrespect. Where would any of us be without their toil?\n\n     Out on the roads they have gathered, a hundred-thousand men,\n     To ask for a hold on life as sure as the wolf's hold in his \n           den.\n     Their need lies close to the quick of life as rain to the \n           furrow sown:\n     It is as meat to the slender rib, as marrow to the bone.\n     They ask but the leave to labor, for a taste of life's \n           delight,\n     For a little salt to savor their bread, for houses water-\n           tight.\n\n     They ask but the right to labor, and to live by the strength \n           of their hands--\n     They who have bodies like knotted oaks, and patience like \n           sea-sands.\n     And the right of a man to labor and his right to labor in \n           joy--\n     Not all your laws can strangle that right, nor the gates of \n           Hell destroy.\n     For it came with the making of man and was kneaded into his \n           bones,\n     And it will stand at the last of things on the dust of \n           crumbled thrones.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho and then have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nyielding. I will not use the 5 minutes, but I did want to make a few \ncomments in relation to the Kassebaum amendment and what I believe to \nbe its importance in this issue that we are debating here on the floor.\n    \n    \n  Mr. President, I will also add to my statement a letter from NFIB \n[National Federation of Independent Business], for in that letter are \nseveral quotes that I think are extremely valuable to this debate. One \nof those quotes which is important, and I will mention it at this \nmoment, as it relates to what our President has just done and the \nmeaning of that act as it relates to a balance that we have held in \nlabor law now for a good long while. It says:\n\n       This balance of labor's right to strike with management's \n     right to stay in business using temporary or permanent \n     replacement workers during economic strikes has not been \n     challenged by any President since 1935.\n\n  Are the working conditions and are the labor conditions of America \ntoday so different, have they changed so dramatically since we placed \nquality labor laws on the books of our country since 1935 that our \nPresident would act as he has acted? I simply do not believe that is \ntrue.\n  What our President has said by this act is, ``Give in or go out of \nbusiness.'' No President has said it that way, nor should they. It is \nunilateral disarmament of employers at the bargaining table. And that \nhas never been public policy and it should never be public policy.\n  What was then was then; what is now is now. The world has changed \nsignificantly. And it is important that the laws that still work be \nallowed to work.\n  Certainly, the action that was taken by this President is to disallow \nfundamental labor law in this country and the unique balance that has \nbeen created and held for so many years.\n  The amendment to prohibit funds from being used to implement any \nExecutive order that bars hiring Federal contractors who hire permanent \nworker replacements is an amendment that should be passed by this \nCongress, and I support it strongly.\n  If there had been a pressing need for such an order, why did this \nPresident not issue it more than 2 years ago? What has changed over the \ncourse of this President's administration that would cause for this \ndestabilizing act to occur when no President has taken this stand for \n35 years? Nothing has happened. That is the answer. So why would he do \nit?\n  If the President actually had a clear legal authority to issue such \nan Executive order, why did he not do it earlier?\n  Well, he does not have, in our opinion, that legal authority.\n  Why, instead, did he put all of his eggs in one basket of striker \nreplacement legislation during the last Congress?\n  One has to wonder if the answer does not lie more in politics than in \npolicy.\n  I concur with the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] that the \nPresident has exceeded his constitutional and legal authority.\n  The Executive order flies in the face of 57 years of settled \nemployment law as written by Congress, as consistently applied by the \ncourts, and as consistently enforced by 10 Presidents and their \nadministrations.\n  No President has ever launched such a full frontal attack on settled \nFederal laws governing employer-employee relations; on fair and \nflexible bargaining in the work place; on the rights of employers and \nemployees to determine their own negotiating behavior on a level \nplaying field; and on the Federal Government's role as impartial \nreferee, rather than coach and cheerleader for one side.\n  This Executive order will be costly to taxpayers, as strikes are \nencouraged and prolonged against contractors \n[[Page S3728]] working on Federal jobs; and to the general public and \nthe economy, as the ripple effect of these strikes cause bottlenecks \nelsewhere in the economy, affecting suppliers, subcontractors, \ncarriers, and others.\n  Like so many other clever schemes that erupt within the Capital \nBeltway, this one will not help workers, it will hurt them; will not \ncreate jobs, it will destroy them; was designed to court a few elite \nlobbyists, not rank and file workers and their families; will shut the \ndoor to Federal contracting on many small businesses who will find this \ncondition economically impossible to meet.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the NFIB be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                          Independent Business\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1995.\n     Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum:  On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) \n     I urge your colleagues to support your amendment to H.R. 889, \n     the Defense Supplemental Appropriations bill. The amendment \n     would effectively void the President's Executive Order \n     barring federal contractors from the use of permanent \n     replacement workers.\n       Such an Executive Order could increase the taxpayers' cost \n     of federal contracts and would destroy the equality of \n     economic bargaining power between labor and management which \n     has been preserved for 55 years. This balance of labor's \n     right to strike with management's right to stay in business \n     using temporary or permanent replacement workers during \n     economic strikes has not been challenged by any President \n     since 1935.\n       In a recent poll, 81% of NFIB members oppose striker \n     replacement legislation. Small business owners view any \n     change in the delicate balance between labor and business as \n     a threat to the livelihood of their business. They believe \n     upsetting this balance will result in the following:\n       Increased work disruptions affecting both union and non-\n     union businesses;\n       A confrontational workplace setting, which will lead to \n     more strikes, diminished competitiveness, and lost \n     productivity;\n       Increased strike activity in large companies, which \n     adversely affects small businesses that are located near or \n     contract with the struck company;\n       The creation of an unfair union organizing tool; and\n       An unbalancing of over 55 years of labor law.\n       Small business owners urge your colleagues to support your \n     amendment to H.R. 889. Your vote on passage of the Kassebaum \n     amendment will be considered a Key Small Business Vote for \n     the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the announcement of an Executive order \nbanning the use of replacement workers by Federal contractors disturbs \nme because it appears to circumvent congressional authority to amend \nthis Nation's labor laws. Because of this concern, I support the effort \nto prevent the implementation and enforcement of this order. \nNevertheless, I remain a supporter of legislative attempts that would \namend the National Labor Relations Act and overturn Supreme Court \ndecisions which have weakened what I believe to be the original intent \nof the law--to explicitly protect a worker's economic self-help \nactivities through the right to strike.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, all of us here, on both sides of this \nissue, agree that the right to strike is essential to preserving the \nbalance of power between labor and management in this country. But that \nright is hollow if, by exercising it, a worker faces the loss of his or \nher job.\n  President Clinton has taken the important step of clarifying that in \nthis country, as in the rest of the industrial democracies with less \nthan a handful of exceptions, workers cannot be fired for exercising \ntheir legal rights.\n  Unfortunately, our attempts to clarify that right through \nlegislation, led for years by Senator Metzenbaum, were blocked by \nfilibusters, despite clear majorities that favored a ban on striker \nreplacements.\n  President Clinton's Executive order is needed because Congress has \nbeen frustrated in its attempts to clear up the current untenable \nsituation.\n  His action follows established precedent, such as actions by \nPresident Bush, who, in 1992, issued an Executive order to require \nunionized contractors to post notices in their workplaces informing all \nemployees that they could not be required to join a union.\n  President Bush also used executive authority to ban unions from using \nfor political purposes fees collected that had been collected from \nunion members who disagreed with union policy positions.\n  As a Republican Congressman said at the time, this was an ``effort by \nthe President to do something through Executive order that he cannot \nget Congress to do.''\n  So let's not be distracted by procedural arguments. President Clinton \nwas well within his authority and established precedent when he issued \nhis Executive order. Let's stick to the substance of this issue, an \nissue that goes to the fundamental rights of workers, and to the very \nfoundations of labor-management relations in this country.\n  Mr. President, before the New Deal, striking workers had no legal \nprotection against being fired. To provide legal protection for the \nright to strike, Congress passed and President Roosevelt signed the \nNational Labor Relations Act in 1935. Without it, hostile, \nconfrontational, and often violent labor-management relations would \nhave persisted.\n  But in 1938, a Supreme Court ruling that confirmed the right to \nstrike offered an unsolicited comment that established a legal basis \nfor hiring\n permanent replacements for striking workers.\n\n  This language has remained a logical and legal anomaly ever since. In \nlaw schools across the country, law professors have struggled in vain \nto distinguish between firing and permanently replacing striking \nworkers.\n  For many years, this problem was, in fact, academic; it had little \napplication in the real world.\n  But for the last decade and more, the issue has become all too real \nfor thousands of workers who have lost their jobs by exercising what \nthe vast majority of Americans believe should be their right under the \nlaw.\n  The permanent replacement of striking workers has become an all too \ncommon tactic in labor-management disputes. In a survey last year, 25 \npercent of employers said that they would hire or consider hiring \npermanent replacements, in response to a strike. A recent GAO report \nfound that employers hire or threaten to hire permanent replacements in \none of every three strikes.\n  Today, the threat of permanent replacement calls into question the \nfundamental right to strike, upsets the balance of power between \nworkers and management, and introduces an unnecessary source of \nfriction and hostility into labor relations.\n  We have evidence that strikes in which permanent replacement workers \nare hired are longer, and more heated, than those in which that tactic \nis not used.\n  Mr. President, I know that there is much emotion on both sides of \nthis issue, and I would like my colleagues who disagree with me to \nunderstand that I do not take their concerns lightly. Let me address a \nfew of those concerns now.\n  We have heard in recent debate that President Clinton's Executive \norder will upset the balance of power between labor and management and \nmake strikes more likely as a result. This argument is not only \ninaccurate, Mr. President, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of \nthe costs of a strike to workers and their families.\n  First, it is the increasing use of striker replacements that has \nupset the traditional balance of power between workers and employers. \nThe President has acted to remove this source of much of the hostility \nand divisiveness that now attends labor-management relations.\n  Second, Mr. President, under no circumstance is a strike an easy \noption for workers who will suffer the loss of wages, health benefits, \nsavings, and even major assets such as cars and homes to undertake a \nstrike with no knowledge of what the outcome will be.\n  We have also heard, Mr. President, that without the threat of hiring \npermanent replacements, employers will be powerless in the face of \nunion demands. The fact of the matter is that employers did quite well \nfor over four decades, by stockpiling inventories, \n[[Page S3729]] hiring temporary replacements, transferring work, and by \nother tactics, without recourse to permanent replacement workers.\n  As we seek new ways to encourage labor-management cooperation, to \nrecognize the shared goals of American workers and employers in a \nchanging global economy, a first step ought to be to eliminate the \nunnecessary, inflammatory practice of permanently replacing strikers.\n  Mr. President, simple fairness demands it. And simple fairness \ndemands that we defeat this attempt to cut out the funding for \nPresident Clinton's Executive order. I urge my colleagues to vote with \nme to put this relic of another era of labor-management relations \nbehind us.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment by the \nSenator from Kansas. Her amendment, if adopted, would prevent the \nexpenditure of funds by the Labor Department to carry out the Executive \norder President Clinton signed yesterday.\n  The Executive order is entitled ``Ensuring the Economical and \nEfficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government \nContracts.'' Simply put, this order would prevent Federal agencies from \ncontracting with companies that permanently replace striking workers.\n  Current law protects workers who strike for unfair labor practices, \nbut allows those who strike for economic reasons to be permanently \nreplaced--a curious synonym for being fired.\n  Congress has attempted to legislatively rectify this inequity. Time \nafter time, however, a minority of our colleagues has frustrated the \nwill of the majority, often even preventing the Senate from debating \nthe matter. In the last 3 years, the Senate has been forced to vote to \ninvoke cloture on the bill four different times. Each time, despite \ngarnering a majority necessary to pass the bill, a minority has ruled \nthe day and frustrated the will of that majority: June 11, 1992, \ncloture failed 41 to 55; June 16, 1992, cloture failed 42 to 57; July \n12, 1994, cloture failed 47 to 53; and July 13, 1994, cloture failed 46 \nto 53. Now, Mr. President, the opponents complain that the President is \nthwarting the will of Congress.\n  Whenever striker replacement legislation has come before us in the \npast, I have heard from Rhode Islanders with views on both sides of the \nissue. Many business people have told me of their fear of a tilt in the \nbalance of power in labor-management relations. They have discussed \ntheir concern with being faced with one of two choices: agree to union \neconomic demands or be forced out of business. One gentleman even \nremarked that he considered employee demands for increased wages to be \nblackmail.\n  I view striker replacement legislation and this Executive order \ndifferently. The legislation would restore a proper balance of power \nbetween employees and employers. Employees would have the right to \nstrike for increased wages and management would have the right to hire \nreplacement workers on a temporary basis. This Executive order tells \nbusinesses that if they want to do business with the Federal \nGovernment, they must respect the legal rights of working men and women \nor look elsewhere for business.\n  I look forward to a full debate on this matter and urge my colleagues \nto reject this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nSenator Kassebaum's amendment that effectively vetoes President \nClinton's Executive order that prevents striker replacement from being \nused by Federal contractors.\n  I am a blue collar Senator. I support the right to strike. I can't \nsupport Solidarity's right to strike in the shipyards of Gdansk and not \nsupport the rights of American unions to strike here at home.\n  The President's Executive order protects the right of Americans to \nstrike by prohibiting Government contractors who make their profit off \nthe Federal funds from permanently replacing striking employees. The \nExecutive order will also force these managers to deal with the issues \nraised in the strike, not just replace workers who protest as a last \nresort. It will restore basic fairness to the bargaining process.\n  Strikers can mean economic ruin for both the workers and the company \nthey rely on for work. There must also be equal pressure on both the \nworkers and the company to compromise if a strike does occur.\n  I believe that allowing management the threat of replacing workers \ngives them an unfair advantage at the bargaining table. If strikers can \nbe permanently replaced, there is considerable less pressure on \nbusinesses to address the underlying problem and settle with their \nworkers. However, if businesses can hire only temporary replacements \nand workers have to face the social economic disruption of a strike, \nthe pressure remains on both sides to work out their differences.\n  It's a matter of basic fairness to American workers. It ensures \nfairness in resolving labor disputes. My roots are in blue collar \nneighborhoods--this goes to my basic values.\n  That is why I strongly oppose Senator Kassebaum's amendment. This \namendment vetoes my values. I urge my colleagues to join me opposing \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know this is a very contentious issue, \nand I do not question anybody's motivations on either side.\n  I have a deep-rooted feeling and philosophy--and I have voted on this \nmany times--that people have a fundamental right to withhold their \nlabor--that is, to strike--if they feel it is the only way they can \nmake their point. I do not know what other alternatives labor has in \ncertain cases when the process breaks down.\n  I support the right to strike. It is fundamental. I believe that all \nof my colleagues feel that way. Therefore, if one says that it is an \ninherent, innate right for the citizens of our country, then I have to \nask the question: is it a myth, that, on the one hand we say you have \nthe right to strike, but, on the other hand we say if you exercise that \nright, you will lose your job permanently? That appears to me to be an \ninconsistency.\n  I can understand if we were to set up conditions. I can understand if \nwe said that there would be a period of time in certain industries, and \nif there was a certain strike in an industry that in terms of the \nhealth and welfare of the people that this simply could not be \ntolerated. I understand there are laws in various States--in my State--\nthat say if you are a municipal employee and strike, you can lose your \njob, benefits and procedures. But that is not what we are talking \nabout. What we are talking about is taking people and just saying, ``If \nyou strike, we will replace you permanently.'' I believe that flies in \nthe face of what we are about as a nation.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I am going to, with great reluctance, make \na motion to table the amendment that is before the Senate and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, had I asked for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table \namendment No. 331.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the question is on what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I have stated earlier, many of us want \nto get about the business of the appropriations bill. But it has been \nthe decision of the Senator from Kansas to offer an amendment that \naffects the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of workers in this \ncountry.\n  As I stated earlier in the day, it is amazing to me that this \ninstitution has debated mainly two issues. One has been unfunded \nmandates, and the second is the balanced budget amendment. And now the \nfirst issue that comes before us affecting working people is to limit \ntheir rights and liberties in the workplace. If this amendment were to \nbe passed tonight, millions of workers would be affected by it. Their \nworking conditions would not be enhanced. Their wages would not be \nincreased.\n  The well being of the children of those workers will not be enhanced. \nTheir parents will not have a greater assurance of where we are going \nand where the Contract With America is going.\n  So it is an extraordinary fact that the first measure before us \naffecting working families is to diminish their rights and interests.\n  I am quite prepared to go forward, as we did earlier, with debate \nabout the Executive order and its importance to working families. We \nhave no interest in prolonging consideration of the underlying bill. \nBut we do believe that this is a matter of considerable importance, and \nthere are Senators who want to be heard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak on a matter separate and apart from the existing bill for a \nperiod of about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate a demonstration that is currently taking place in the rotunda of \nthe Russell Senate Office Building. I urge all Members of the Senate \nand their staffs to stop by and see this exhibit.\n  It is a demonstration of a new satellite telecommunications \ntechnology and the potential for advancing telecommunications to rural \nareas.\n  The satellite technology demonstrated in the rotunda is just one of \nthe new applications that is coming on line in the near future. \nTelemedicine is one of the applications that I hope it will help bring \nto the farthest reaches of my State.\n  As I think the Senate knows, Alaska is one-fifth the size of the \nContinental United States. We have been using satellite technology to \ncommunicate with remote Alaskan communities since the 1970's, and in \nmany of those communities, we have only one village health aide. Using \nthe advanced digital technology that is now becoming available--and it \nis used in this demonstration--it will be possible for that nurse to \nsend medical images to hospitals in Anchorage, or even to what we call \nthe lower 48 States, for review by a doctor, something that cannot be \ndone today. In these remote clinics, staffed by people who just have \nhigh school education, we are going to be able to take medicine, good \ntelemedicine, directly to the villages.\n  Eventually, I hope to see even more advanced telemedicine \napplications like the remote surgery that is being developed by the \njoint civilian and military medical teams today. At the rotunda \ndemonstration, there is also a telemedicine display, and I hope other \nSenators will stop by and take time to look at this display.\n  There are a lot of other possibilities to this type of technology. \nTele-education and telecommunicating are two that come to mind.\n  Recently, I heard of a person who is moving his family to an island \nin southeastern Alaska where he is going to install advanced \ntelecommunications facilities to allow him to continue to run his \nbusiness in another State. When that same technology comes down in \nprice, as I am sure it will, I am very hopeful that others will gladly \ndo the same thing and come enjoy our State year round.\n  Finally, I want to point out that this demonstration of modern \ntechnology will allow anyone who comes by to be instantly updated on \nthe status of the last great race on Earth. That is the Iditarod. The \nIditarod is going on now. The race is 1,049 miles, from Anchorage to \nNome, in the middle of winter by dogsled. Each day at 2 p.m., I receive \na call over this new technology that is in the Russell Building from \nSusan Butcher, a four-time winner of the Iditarod. She is going point \nto point along the trail. She is not a contestant this year. She is \nreporting on the race from remote checkpoints where mushers are \nrequired to rest each day. The reason she is not in the race is because \nshe is expecting her first child and decided not to be involved in the \nIditarod this year.\n  The demonstration will be in the Russell rotunda until next Tuesday, \nMarch 14. It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each weekday, and we will \nhave a reception there on Monday evening. It is my hope that other \nMembers of the Senate and staff will come by and see the potential of \ntelecommunications to rural areas, such as we have in Alaska. It is a \nvery informational, very educational demonstration, and I personally \ninvite everyone to stop by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, I apologize to the Senate for my voice, \nbut I have a cold. Nonetheless, I have something to share with you that \nI think is important.\n  Today, the Congressional Budget Office has given their estimate of \nthe President's budget or, might I say, reestimate. The Congressional \nBudget Office released its analysis of the President's budgetary \nproposals for 1996. The analysis debunks the President's claim that his \nbudget holds the deficit in line at about $200 billion by revealing a \ntotal lack of restraint in the President's budget.\n  [[Page S3731]] Using CBO's economic and technical assumptions, the \ndeficit would climb from $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. \nThat is a 55-percent increase in that period of time over what the \nPresident estimates and has told the American people.\n  Even under the administration's favored measure, the deficit, as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, will rise from 2.5 percent in \n1995 to 3.3 percent in the year 2000, a rather significant increase.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the President's budget \npolicies will result in higher deficits than the administration \nprojected of nearly $200 billion over 1995 to the year 2000. It will be \n$200 billion higher; on average, $35 billion a year.\n  Although the difference in the economic forecasts of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the administration are not great, the \nCongressional Budget Office's slower economic growth--the assumptions \nthat they have--reduce the revenue take by about $65 billion.\n  On the spending side, the Congressional Budget Office agrees that \ngrowth in Medicare and Medicaid has slowed. It is not as optimistic as \nthe OMB because the CBO estimates that $79 billion higher will be the \ncost of Medicare and Medicaid over these years.\n  They also estimate that the President is $27 billion low in the \nestimate of housing assistance and $10 billion low on unemployment \ncompensation. That merely points out the President's budget not only \ndid nothing, which all of you said, took no difficult steps, bit no \ndifficult bullets, but underestimates the deficit by about $35 billion \nfor each of the years from now until the year 2000, a 55-percent \nincrease in the deficit. That cries out for real action.\n  I only regret that we will not have the balanced budget amendment to \nhelp us when we undertake this ordeal. But I am reminded over the past \n4 or 5 days, some on the other side have told us that we do not need \nthe balanced budget amendment to balance the budget. I hope when we \npresent a way of doing it, they will support that without the balanced \nbudget amendment as a hammer from the people of this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3730-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3731-S3741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair, without objection, directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. \n     331 to the committee amendment to H.R. 889, the supplemental \n     appropriations bill.\n         Hank Brown, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, John Ashcroft, Jon \n           Kyl, Lauch Faircloth, Don Nickles, Strom Thurmond, Dan \n           Coats, Judd Gregg, Slade Gorton, Bob Dole, Chuck \n           Grassley, Craig Thomas, Conrad Burns, Trent Lott, Mike \n           DeWine, Pete Domenici.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that the exact time for the \nvote on the cloture motion will be determined by the majority and \nminority leaders, but I would expect that the vote will be sometime \nnext Monday. Am I roughly correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator is correct. It will not be on Saturday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And I imagine the exact time will be established by the \nleaders.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the opportunity to vote on the \namendment at that time. I will urge my colleagues to vote in opposition \nto the amendment. It seems to me that this is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. It is an amendment that is unrelated to the \nunderlying measure. It is an important public policy issue and \nquestion.\n  I have tried over the course of the debate to raise the particular \nfact that the first measure that we are considering in this Chamber \naffecting working people is basically to diminish their rights, their \nhopes, their opportunities. A number of us have been struggling to try \nto find ways to enhance the lives, the opportunities, and the resources \nof working families because I think that is a core issue for the future \nof our country and for the millions of Americans, over 100 million \nAmericans, who go to work every day.\n  Many of these workers face diminished incomes, increasing concern \nabout the quality of life for themselves and their families. They are \nlooking to the future with increasing concern about the schools their \nchildren attend, the services of which are being cut back on the \nContract With America. There will be cutbacks in the school lunch \nprogram, cutbacks in summer jobs, and cutbacks that are being \nrecommended in the Budget Committees for the student loan programs and \nthe work study programs. These are programs that benefit working \nfamilies.\n  So the working families of this country watching this debate tonight \nare not going to have a great deal of satisfaction about the Kassebaum \namendment and I hope they understand why we are resisting it.\n  One of the important measures which we will have an opportunity to \nconsider, hopefully earlier in the session rather than later, will be \nthe proposed increase in the minimum wage. That is something that can \nmake an important difference in the lives of working families in this \ncountry, to recognize that work is important, that work ought to be \nrewarded, that men and women who are prepared to play by the rules and \nwork the 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, ought to be able to have a \nliving wage. The proposal that the President has suggested would not \nrestore the minimum wage to the purchasing power that it had at other \ntimes, but nonetheless would make a very important and significant \ndifference to those families.\n  A number of those families will be here tomorrow at 10 a.m., in the \nRussell caucus room, on March 10, 1995, at 10 a.m.\n  The Secretary of Labor, Secretary Reich, and the mayor of Baltimore, \nKurt Schmoke, will both be there, as will a number of business owners, \neconomists and others at a forum on the minimum wage. We will learn \nabout what is happening to working families in Main Street America.\n  In the plants and factories, in the small shops, what are the real \nconditions that are out there? Earlier in the day we discussed the \nprofile of many of the workers who had been permanently replaced by \nstrikebreakers.\n  But let me just take a few more moments of the Senate's time to talk \nabout some of those who have been replaced, some of the workers who \nhave been replaced. These are the kind of ``special interests'' that I \nam standing up for tonight and will stand up for, because their lives, \nand similar workers' lives, can be affected by whether we continue the \nPresident's Executive order or whether that is undermined by \nlegislative action.\n  I am thinking of\n   Francis Atilano, 58 who was hired by Diamond Walnut in September \n1978.\n\n       I worked for them until the strike began, I was replaced by \n     a new employee.\n       The strike has caused many changes in our lives. I have \n     been very depressed about losing my job and not knowing what \n     will happen in the future. I have been under a doctor's care \n     for depression.\n       I had hoped that maybe I could retire from Diamond Walnut \n     in the future with a pension. Now I don't know what we will \n     do since my husband's low paying job has no pension plan.\n       We at the present time are having a very hard time trying \n     to make ends meet. We have our youngest son whom we are \n     trying to get through college, so he will not have to \n     struggle with life as we have.\n       The depression even sets in more whenever I think of our 6 \n     children and 19 grandchildren. While I was employed I was \n     able to buy them a little gift once in awhile, and \n     [[Page S3732]] also take the grandchildren to a park or \n     somewhere.\n\n  Francis Atilano, age 58, has been replaced by a permanent strike \nreplacement.\n  Or Willa Miller, 54, started working at Diamond Walnut in 1961, as a \nyoung mother with 3 children.\n\n       I am now a grandmother with 7 grandchildren. I went out as \n     a QC Supervisor, worked there 30 years. I was a sorter, \n     checker and QC Sample Girl.\n       I had to sell my second car and I had to get a part-time \n     job to make ends meet. The Union has really helped me during \n     this strike and I have made many friends and I am closer to \n     them. I joined a prayer group which has really helped me \n     also, other prayer sisters in this strike. We have been there \n     for each other.\n\n  Five-year-old Vanessa Contreras was 3 years old when Diamond Walnut \npermanently replaced her striking mother, causing Vanessa and her \nmother to lose their family home.\n  Vanessa is in kindergarten at the Stockton Commodore Skills Center. \nHer favorite subjects are writing and drawing, and she likes to play \nwith dolls. Her birthday is March 26. Vanessa's mother reports that she \nhas just been learning about the President in school.\n  Griselda Contreras had been working at Diamond Walnut since 1979. She \nstarted as an entry sorter, and over the years worked her way through a \nnumber of positions. By the time of the strike in 1991, she was a \nsupervisor in the canning department.\n  Ms. Contreras volunteers once a week in her daughter's class. She \ncame to the United States from Guadalajara when she was 15 years old. \nBefore going to Diamond, she worked as a bilingual aide for the school \ndistrict.\n  I think of Olga Riuz, 62, who is a single parent who has worked for \nDiamond Walnut for 10 years.\n  She has two sons, aged 38 and 36 in addition to a 9-year-old grandson \nand a 5-year-old granddaughter. Olga says they are ``good kids,'' and \nthat she ``talks frequently with them about the strike.''\n  When she goes to Stockton, Olga's granddaughter loves to go see the \nstrikers carrying their signs at Diamond Walnut. She asks lots of \nquestions about the strikers.\n  In her spare time she loves to crochet and raise vegetables in her \ngarden. Her spare time has been cut into by the strike. Olga is no \nlonger able to read the Bible in church because of her added \nresponsibilities * * *.\n  The list goes on and on. These are the real people who have been \nreplaced. These are the real people who saw their wages reduced. These \nare the real people who saw the profits go up at the Diamond Walnut \nsome 30 percent. These are the real people who were striking to get the \n$8, $9, $10, $11 an hour, were receiving that, then took the pay cut, \nand then were trying to recover that when they saw the company's \nprofits rise by millions and millions of dollars. They tried to at \nleast reclaim the wages that they had forsaken earlier. And these are \nthe individuals, these are the special interests, individuals who have \nall been dismissed at a time when Diamond Walnut was participating with \nGovernment assistance in expanding their markets overseas.\n  Those are the real Americans whose interests we are attempting to \nprotect with this Executive order. Those are interests that are worthy \nof protection. I know that there are those who say, ``Well, it is the \nright of employers who control capital to treat workers the way that \nthey want to in a free country.'' There are those who believe survival \nof the fittest is not just the law of the jungle, it is the law of the \neconomy as well. I do not think that represents the views of the \nAmerican people.\n  There were those in my own State at the turn of the century who \nbelieved that, and used to employ child labor in the textile mills up \nin Lowell and Lawrence--8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-year-old children who \nworked in those mills. There were people who said the employer had the \ncapital. He was prepared to put up the money and, therefore, we ought \nto have permitted him to exploit those children; if those children were \nnot prepared to be exploited, there are other children prepared to go \nthrough with that. But we rejected that. Just as we have rejected \nunsafe working conditions.\n  We as a society did not believe that workers should work in \nconditions that were a danger to their health and well-being, that they \nshould endure toxic gases and acids and other kinds of dangerous work \nconditions. The senior Senator from West Virginia described in great \ndetail the conditions in the mines in the earlier part of this century.\n  We as a country have not said: Devil beware; we will permit anyone to \nexploit any of the workers in any kind of manner that they want to. \nThere is always someone else to pick up the pieces. That has not been a \npart of the great social compact of this country and this society. We \nhave rejected that, although there are those voices that today perhaps \nwould like to return to that period. But I do not believe that is the \nview of our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I hope that attention will be paid to the forum \ntomorrow in the Russell caucus room. We should listen to those \nindividuals who will be coming down here to speak about what is really \nhappening out there on the front line for workers.\n  It will be useful, I think, for Members to perhaps drop by and listen \nto what is really happening out there in the work force, how people are \ntrying to make it, the problems they are facing, the conditions which \nhave been exploiting them.\n  Workers in this country, at this time, are facing extraordinary \nchallenges and burdens which were virtually unforeseen for years and \nyears. They have been battling hard. We need to listen to them and to \nbe reminded once again what this Executive order is really all about; \nthat is, to provide some protection for them so that they can look to \nthe future with a sense of hope for themselves and for their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for his efforts in the course of this day to try to \nhelp Americans to focus on the increasing plight of those who labor in \nthis country.\n  It is very interesting. The labor law is long established after years \nof extraordinary confrontation and some very difficult times. Senator \nByrd was on the floor earlier this afternoon talking about some of the \nbackground of the labor movement, some of the price that was paid by \npeople in an effort to win certain rights in the workplace.\n  As we think back on the history of this country, there really is not \none of us as a school kid, I think, who was not moved by the images as \nwell as the stories of some of the working conditions that \ngrandparents, forebears, and many Members of the U.S. Senate went \nthrough.\n  We all remember that there was a time when child labor was exploited. \nWe remember when there was a time when people worked in sweatshops \nwithout rights, without breaks, without the ability to even relieve \nthemselves; we remember a time when people would be injured and there \nwould be no compensation, no recourse. They might even lose the job as \na consequence of the injury. There would be no payment.\n  There is such a long category or list of the ways in which human \nlabor has been pressed to the limit, in ways that we came to believe \nwere considered un-American. We felt that those things were not the way \npeople ought to live in the United States of America. Indeed, most \nMembers of the Senate have spent time arguing about Mexican workers, \narguing about workers in other countries, China, and places where \nworkers are exploited today. Thank God, that is not the situation in \nthe United States.\n  But one of the principal reasons all workers in America have made \nadvances, particularly those today who do not have to join a union, is \nbecause a sense of responsibility has entered into the broad \nmarketplace, where most employers now even try to preclude the creation \nof a union by offering a certain set of benefits--health care, \ncompensation, time off, family leave; a whole set of things that people \nhave come to understand are fair for people to have as they labor.\n  The last and only real tool available to people who are organized in \nthe marketplace to protect their rights is the right to strike. We have \na long-established set of laws in the United States \n[[Page S3733]] by which people can strike legally, and by which they \nare restrained from striking illegally. We all remember what happened \nwith PATCO when the air controllers struck in what was deemed to be an \nillegal strike. They were fired. They were, in the judgment of many in \nthe United States Senate, properly replaced.\n  Mr. President, there is no rationale that I think can be argued \nlegitimately except a rationale--and it is not legitimate--called union \nbusting, which could justify saying that you would take away from \npeople in a legal strike the right to be able to do it, to strike.\n  There is enormous power in the hands of employers today; enormous \npower. For those who are organized, in an effort to try to guarantee \nthat they are adequately paid, that they are given the safety \nprotections and other benefits that we have come to believe people \nought to have in America, the only leverage they have in the \nmarketplace is their right to band together and say to that employer, \n``We don't think we are being treated fairly.''\n  What is the employer's recourse if that happens? The employer is not \nwithout recourse. These people cannot shut down his or her plant, or \ntheir plant. They have to leave and leave without pay. They have to \nleave and interrupt their lives, and start to live on the accumulated \nsavings of a union, or those who contribute to their effort to fight \nfor what they think is right. And the employer is permitted, under the \nlaw, to replace those people with temporary workers.\n  So the employer can continue to make profits. The employer can \ncontinue to sell goods. There is no disruption, other than the good \nworkers who regularly work and the folks who know each other and the \nspirit of the plant and all of the good things that come with a good \nrelationship between management and labor; there is none of that. \nBusiness is not interrupted, but there can be disruptions, though they \ndo not stop the employer from getting a salary. They do not stop the \nshareholders from earning money. They do not stop the company from \ngrowing or putting out goods.\n  Meanwhile, people who have labored hard, more often than not under \ntough conditions, are out in the streets marching up and down, \nextraordinarily disrupted, having a hard time paying for their needs, \nfor their kids, for their mortgage, for a car, for vacation, for \nclothing--in an effort to do what? To hurt the United States? To do \ninjury? No; to try to make it, to try to get their little piece of the \nrock.\n  I wish I had with me the statistics. I do not have them. But the \nstatistics on corporate pay increases in America relative to the \nincrease of the average working American are shocking.\n  You know, from the end of World War II, right up until 1979, America \ngrew together, all of us grew.\n  This chart is a stark reminder of that. This is 1950 to 1978. If you \ndivide America up into quintiles, the lowest quintile, the bottom 20 \npercent, saw their personal income increase 138 percent. The next \nquintile went up 98 percent. The third quintile, 106 percent. The \nfourth quintile, 11 percent. And the top 20 percent of Americans went \nup 99 percent. So three quintiles grew faster than the top 20 percent \nin the United States.\n  From 1979 until 1993, look at this dramatic inversion. This is the \nstory of the working person in America. The bottom quintile went down \n17 percent. The next quintile went down 8 percent. The third quintile \nwent down 3 percent. The fourth quintile went up 5 percent. And, Mr. \nPresident, the top 20 percent of Americans gained by 18 percent. That \nis the growing gap in America from 1979 to 1993.\n  The American worker, the average worker, the person taking home \nanywhere from $20,000 up to $50,000, has been going down and the person \nearning over $100,000 is going up.\n  But it is even more dramatic, Mr. President, when you look at what \nhappened to middle-class incomes in that period, for middle-class \nincomes in America have gone down. The bottom 20 percent went down a \n10-percent drop. The middle 20 percent went down 4 percent. Mr. \nPresident, the top 1 percent in America went up 105 percent.\n  There is nobody who looks at the demographics of this country who \nwill not tell you that the gap between the working American and those \nwho are making it and who have it is growing, and growing \nsubstantially. And here we are talking about whether or not that \nworker, who is increasingly hard pressed to make ends meet, is going to \nhave the ability, in the labor-management relationship that is already \nsignificantly weighted toward management, is going to have the ability \nto simply hold on to the right of collective bargaining.\n  If you are not allowed to hold on to the right to strike--which, \nclearly, if you can have permanent replacement workers--you have lost, \nthen you have wiped out the entire gain of the whole concept of \ncollective bargaining.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of anything more fundamental than that. \nI really do not. Every single company in this country has the right to \ngo out and hire a replacement person temporarily. So this issue is \nreally a very fundamental one, and I think the President has \nappropriately offered leadership at the national level, following in \nthe tradition of other Presidents who have issued Executive orders in \norder to implement a particular policy.\n  The record is very clear. Franklin Roosevelt, in 1941, issued an \nExecutive order requiring defense contractors to refrain from racial \ndiscrimination.\n  In 1951, after the enactment of the Procurement Act, President Truman \nissued an Executive order extending that requirement to all Federal \ncontractors.\n  In 1964, President Johnson issued an Executive order prohibiting \nFederal contractors from discriminating on the basis of age and, at the \ntime, Federal law permitted such discrimination. The Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 merely directed the President to study the issue. But the \nPresident, rightfully, issued the Executive order.\n  In 1969, the Nixon administration expanded the antidiscrimination \nExecutive order to encompass a requirement that all Federal contractors \nadopt affirmative action programs, something a lot of Americans do not \nremember, but it was President Nixon who put that program in place.\n  In 1978, President Carter issued an Executive order requiring all \nFederal contractors to comply with certain guidelines limiting the \namount of wage increases. And that order had the effect of limiting \nwhat Federal contractors could agree to in collective bargaining, \nnotwithstanding the longstanding Federal policy of encouraging free \ncollective bargaining.\n  In 1992, President Bush issued an Executive order requiring unionized \nFederal contractors to notify their unionized employees of their right \nto refuse to pay union dues. The National Labor Relations Act did not \nrequire any of that. In the 101st Congress, legislation had been \nproposed to impose that right, but the legislation had not been passed. \nBut the President's Executive order, President Bush's Executive order, \nwas not subject to judicial challenge.\n  So I believe President Clinton's Executive order is an appropriate \none under the law, under the historical precedent, and it is obviously \na necessary one, Mr. President.\n  We have learned through the history of strikes that, in fact, a \nstrike that involves permanent replacements actually lasts seven times \nlonger than strikes that do not involve permanent replacements. And \nthey tend to be much more contentious, often changing a limited dispute \ninto a much broader and more contentious kind of struggle. So if one is \nreally interested in good management-labor relations, and in letting \nthe free market work, I might add, Mr. President, it is appropriate to \nstand by the law as it now stands, which protects the right of workers \nto collectively bargain.\n  In 1937, John L. Lewis said that, ``The voice of labor insisting upon \nits rights should not be annoying to the ears of justice nor offensive \nto the conscience of the American people.'' And that is really what \nthis is about--the ears of justice and the conscience of the American \npeople, Mr. President.\n  I think when you look at the trend-lines of what is happening, it is \nvery clear that, if we continue down this road, probably more Americans \nwill come together and question whether or not it is time to begin--\nsomehow--to bargain for themselves. And I believe that the struggle for \nevery working American family's right to a decent \n[[Page S3734]] and safe workplace and the most fundamental right, which \nis to seek a redress of those grievances within the workplace, is a \nvery hard-fought victory that deserves to be preserved in order to \npreserve the fabric of this country.\n  I do not think it is too much to ask, Mr. President, at a time when \nthe changing economic landscape is throwing American jobs into greater \nand greater competition in the marketplace, that American management \nsimply grant their fellow Americans--the people who live in their towns \nand make up their communities--the right to bargain for working \nconditions without the fear of losing their job. For anyone for whom \nthat is the choice, it is no choice. That is very clear.\n  And all of us who are here for a brief period of time, and we earn so \nmuch more, significantly more, than the average American does, we \nshould stop and think about what is it like to make that decision to \nwalk out of a workplace in order to get those better conditions.\n  That is not, for anyone here who has ever talked to somebody on a \npicket line, an easy choice. It is not a choice without extraordinary \nhardship in and of itself. To be faced with the prospect of potentially \nnever walking back into a plant, as a consequence of simply standing up \nto be able to bargain for the better conditions, is not to live up to \nthe American dream.\n It is certainly not to respect the history of what we have all been \nthrough as a country.\n\n  I think we have a code of conduct between labor and management and a \nset of rules that create a fair playing field. But that fairness would \nbe stripped away by an effort to suggest that any employer who can \nsimply replace people who try to bargain collectively and exercise \ntheir right to strike.\n  I hope, Mr. President, we will remember what this is really all \nabout. It is not as if the corporate entity of this country in the last \nyears has not gained enormously from the measures of the U.S. Congress. \nI would hope that as we go forward in these next days we will remember \nthose who are increasingly being separated from their potential to \ntouch the American dream, let alone to provide basics for their kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a dialog here?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would be delighted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I listened carefully earlier when the Senator was going \nthrough his charts about the decline in middle income, and the \ndisparity in who is getting the money in our country.\n  I was intrigued by the charts and how up until the 1960's, I believe, \nor the 1970's, the Senator was showing how most people increased and \nadvanced together. But it has only been in the last few years where the \ndiscrepancies--and where the income was going--has really shown up.\n  Would the Senator show that last chart, where the disparities came \nin? Now, this was the chart that shows from 1950 to 1978 we were all \nkind of growing together, if I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And it shows that we basically all increased at the same \nrate, no matter what income level.\n  Mr. KERRY. In fact, the lowest 20 percent increased the most.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The most.\n  Now, what has happened now since 1978?\n  Mr. KERRY. Since 1978, right up until the present, there has been a \ndramatic turnaround where the lower three-fifths of America are going \ndownhill; the fourth quintile has risen marginally, about 5 percent; \nand the top 20 percent are the people who are really taking home the \ngravy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So that has happened just recently.\n  Mr. KERRY. Since 1979; since the dramatic increase--I might add, it \nis a very interesting coincidence.\n  The year 1979 marks the period where we had a $1 trillion debt in \nthis country. From 1980 to 1993, which represents the greatest period \nof diminution of earnings, we also have the greatest single period of \nincrease of debt in America.\n  As I know the Senator from Iowa knows, if we separate it out--the \ninterest payments on that debt period from the current budget--not only \nare we in balance, but we run a surplus.\n  So it is the Reagan-Bush years and Congress, too. I will not dump \nthat one. I am tired of hearing that it is exclusively one or the \nother. Both were complicitous in a process of unwillingness to be \nfiscally responsible.\n  But that irresponsibility has become one of the things that is \nstripping away the capacity of these folks at the bottom to gain the \nskills necessary in the new marketplace, where information is power, \nand skills, or the capacity to earn income that has significantly \nstripped away those folks' access to those skills or to that \nopportunity.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for going over that \nagain, because as the Senator was going through these charts it \nreminded me of an article I read, from May 23, 1994, ``Why America \nNeeds Unions.''\n\n       The slide in unions has been linked to a lower level of \n     blue-collar wages, a wider disparity in incomes, and a loss \n     of benefits for workers.\n\n  Let me read part of this article. It is titled ``Scary gap''--the gap \nin income.\n\n       New research from respected economists of such schools as \n     Harvard and Princeton shows that blue-collar wages trailed \n     inflation in the 1980's, partly because unions represented \n     fewer workers. The resulting drag on pay for millions of \n     people accounts for at least 20 percent of the widening gap \n     between rich and poor which has reached Depression-era \n     dimensions.\n\n  A person might think this came out of some labor-management \nperiodical. This is Business Week, May 23, 1994. I think that even \nresponsible capitalists and responsible free enterprise publications \nlike Business Week are beginning to understand that when we start doing \naway with unions and start doing away with the bargaining power of \nunions, we will be in for real trouble.\n  In fact, the article went on to say that:\n\n       Free market economies need healthy unions. They offer a \n     system of checks and balances, as former Labor Secretary \n     George Shultz [a Republican] has put it, by making managers \n     focus on employees as well as on profits and shareholders.\n\n  I think this Business Week article really buttresses what the Senator \nwas saying in terms of the disparity in income and where it is going. I \nalso believe that it shows that it is because of the lack of union \nbargaining power, because of the threat that is always held over their \nheads that, ``Well, you got to take what management wants, or leave it; \nand if you leave it and go on strike, which is legal, you will be \npermanently replaced, and therefore you have no bargaining power \nanymore.''\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has hit it right on the head. We just \ncannot permit this widening gap to continue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may point out to my colleague even \nfurther, this is another chart which shows that more working families--\nworking families in America, we are not talking about the poor that are \nso quickly bashed here in Washington today who are on welfare; the poor \nwho are not even on welfare and do not qualify and are not working; \nthese are working Americans--Americans who are out there paying their \ntaxes, struggling to make it. And what is happening?\n  In 1975, only about 8.2 or 8.3 percent of Americans who were working \nfamilies qualified as poor in America. Dramatically, beginning in 1979, \nthat went up to about 11.4 percent. We can see the incredible increase \nwhen we went through that very dramatic period of raising the defense \nspending, cutting the taxes, and increasing the deficit. It started \ndown marginally for 3 years, between 1982 to 1985. Now it is going back \nup, and it is higher than it was in 1980. It is now at the highest \nlevel it has been in years, that is--the number of working Americans \nwho are poor.\n  What is also interesting is back in 1960, 1970, 1980, the minimum \nwage could lift those folks out of poverty. The minimum wage, 100 \npercent value of the minimum wage between 1960 and 1980, if a person \nwere earning just the minimum wage they could be lifted out of poverty. \nBut that is no longer the case. The trend line has been straight down \nsince 1980, so that now, in 1995, the minimum wage will only bring a \nperson up to a 70 percent level of the poverty line.\n  What we are witnessing is an increase in the difficulty of those who \nare working. And the folks who are working in those conditions, by and \nlarge, are not the people who do not \n[[Page S3735]] have the need to join a union, who are working in a \nhigh-technology company or would have a benefits package that is \nbasically geared to be fair and keep the union from growing. They are \nthe folks who most need the union, and now they are also the folks who \nare finding that there is an effort to deprive them of the capacity to \nraise those wages to a level where they can make ends meet.\n  I have been, I will say to my friend from Iowa, I am not someone who \nhas come to the floor and always pleased labor. I voted for GATT, I \nvoted for NAFTA, and I have taken a lot of heat from friends in labor \nfor doing it. I certainly have come to understand that there are in \nsome practices in the marketplace, things that I object to on both \nsides of the fence.\n  But I cannot understand what it is that is so compelling in America, \nother than the effort to try to break the movement altogether, that \nsuggests that it is appropriate to deprive people of the right to say \nthat they can bargain collectively for a better effort, for a better \nwage, particularly given the fact that unlike the past, today's law \ndoes not shut the company down. They can bring in workers. They can \nkeep on selling. They can keep on growing. They keep their salaries. \nThey are not giving up anything.\n  So why should not that worker who has bargained--and we saw an \nexample of this in a hospital the other day in New York where nurses \nwent out, trying to get a contract, and some of the nurses refused to \ngo out, and they stayed in the hospital and kept working. The patients \nwere served. They brought in extra people. They made it work. And then \nthey finally settled with those who had gone out and, indeed, the whole \nspirit of the place changes. People who are part of the fabric of that \nplant or endeavor come back together, they work together.\n  The best companies I have seen in America are companies where \nmanagement brings labor into the process, where they are working \nclosely together, where they never have a need for strikes because they \nare not adversarial.\n  Clearly, it seems to me, this effort to reduce the capacity of people \nto bargain simply runs counter to all of the experience of the \nmarketplace since the robber baron days and on through the early 1900's \nup until the present. I do not think we can say labor law today is so \nstacked against management or, in fact, so balanced toward labor that \nthere is some huge rationale that suggests that it is an appropriate \nmoment for the U.S. Senate to join in gutting the entire history of the \nmovement altogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank my friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts for his very eloquent and, I think, \non-the-mark statement regarding what is happening in this country \ntoday, as we stand here and watch unions be taken apart piece by piece \naround the United States.\n  Mr. President, I want to recap what this is all about, why we are \nhere, and what this amendment is for those Senators who are in their \noffices or for viewers who may be watching on C-SPAN.\n  Yesterday, President Clinton issued an Executive order giving the \nauthority to the Secretary of Labor to make a decision, to make a \nfinding whether or not a company was permanently replacing workers who \nhad exercised their legal right to strike. If such a finding was made, \nthen the President would issue orders to relevant agencies of the \nFederal Government, to say they could no longer contract with that \ncompany in the future for any goods as long as that company persisted \nin hiring permanent replacements.\n  The amendment we have on the floor by Senator Kassebaum from Kansas \nwould make that null and void by stating that through the power of the \npurse string in the Congress, that moneys could not be spent to enforce \nthat Executive order. Now a cloture motion has been filed to cut off \ndebate and bring it to a vote by Monday.\n  What precipitated all this? What precipitated the President of the \nUnited States in issuing such an Executive order?\n  It is a culmination of things, but I do not think there can be a \nclearer example of what brought this about than the example from my own \nState of Iowa, in the actions by Bridgestone/Firestone. So I am going \nto take the time of the Senate to walk through one of the--I was going \nto say saddest--one of the sickest episodes in the history of U.S. \nlabor/management relations. I am sorry that it had to take place in my \nState of Iowa. I am sorry because our workers in Iowa have been good \nworkers, loyal, productive, hardworking, and now they have been told by \nBridgestone/Firestone that they can just go out on the trash heap.\n  We all have heard of Firestone Tire & Rubber, a well-known name in \nAmerican industry. I am sure we all, at one time or another, had a \nFirestone tire on our car. Firestone in the 1980's was up for sale. \nThere were a couple bidders for Firestone. One was Pirelli, an Italian-\nbased company, which bought Armstrong Tire. The other was Bridgestone, \nwhich is a Japanese-based company.\n  They began bidding up the price. It is not that Firestone was \nbankrupt. We heard those comments earlier today. It was not bankrupt. \nIn fact, Firestone was doing pretty well prior to that. In 1981, \nFirestone recorded a $121 million profit for the first 9 months. \nBridgestone paid some $2.6 billion for Firestone.\n  In the early 1980's, Firestone began a series of actions, ratcheting \ndown on the workers. First, they started laying off workers. Then in \nFebruary 1985, they asked the workers to take a wage cut. The workers \naccepted a cut of $3.43 an hour. Later in 1985, Firestone asked that \ntheir property taxes be reduced from $1 million to $800,000, which was \napproved. So the property owners in Polk County, the county in which \nFirestone is located, had to make up the $200,000 through other \nincreased property taxes.\n  Then in 1987, they asked union members to take another wage cut, and \nthey did--$4 an hour. So now in the space of a little over 2 years, the \nworkers at Firestone have taken wage and benefit cuts of $7.43 an hour.\n  Then in May 1987, Firestone requested some assistance from the \ngovernment: $1 million from the State; $300,000 from Polk County; \n$100,000 from the City of Des Moines; $100,000 from Iowa Power; $50,000 \nfrom Midwest Gas. And the next month, Firestone gets all the grants \nfrom the taxpayers of the State of Iowa.\n  Bridgestone purchased the company for $2.6 billion, as I mentioned \nbefore, in 1988.\n  By 1993, the Des Moines Bridgestone/Firestone plant was profitable. \nThey are $5 million ahead of budget.\n  By March of last year, the Bridgestone/Firestone plant in Des Moines \nset a new high record of productivity, 80.5 pounds per man-hour, and \nset an all-time record for pounds warehoused.\n  And then what happened? Last summer, when the contract came up for \nrenewal, Bridgestone/Firestone, the employers, the management, refused \nto bargain with the employees.\n  So, left with no other recourse, the employees went out on strike. \nThey have now been out for 8 months.\n  So this is not about workers who refuse to work. These workers worked \nhard.\n  Let me read a letter that I referred to earlier today from Sherrie \nWallace. She wrote me this letter on January 8. She said:\n\n       When Bridgestone came to each of us asking for help because \n     we were not doing as well as the company needed to do, we all \n     did our best. They asked me for one more tire every day and \n     to stay out on the floor and to forgo my clean-up time. Not \n     only did I respond, so did each and every member of the URW.\n       Not only did I give them the one more tire per day, I gave \n     them three times what they asked for. Our production levels \n     soared. We threw ourselves into our company believing that we \n     all must succeed together in order to create a better way of \n     life for all. The membership joined committees and we became \n     involved, we gave them our hearts. We began to believe this \n     company was different. We gave them our input to create a \n     better working environment. To increase productivity, we \n     began to meet our production levels. We were proud of our \n     company and our union. Together we did make a difference.\n\n  And then what did they get for it? When their contract came up for \nrenewal, Bridgestone said, ``Sorry, suckers. Too bad. Too bad you gave \nyour all. Too bad you worked hard. Too bad \n[[Page S3736]] you increased your productivity three times. Too bad you \ntook $7 an hour in wage and benefit cuts in the 1970's. Too bad that \nyour tax money gave us money so that we could become more profitable. \nYou are a bunch of suckers. Out the door.''\n  That is in effect what Bridgestone did. They never sat down and \nnegotiated. Not once, not once in 8 months have the employers sat down \nto negotiate.\n  There is a report in the Des Moines Register of today: ``Bridgestone/\nFirestone officials have not met with local union negotiators since the \nbeginning of the record 8-month dispute.''\n  So it is not the workers. They are willing to sit down and negotiate \nunder the law. We are a nation of laws, are we not? We have an existing \nlegal structure under which these workers operate. They just want to \nabide by the law and negotiate.\n  The company said, ``Here are our demands. Take them or leave them.''\n  That is not negotiation. That is not good-faith bargaining. In fact, \nthere is a case now pending before the National Labor Relations Board \nthat the employer, Bridgestone/Firestone, is in violation of section 8, \nrefusal to bargain in good faith. I do not see how anybody could find \notherwise because section 8 does say that both sides are required to \nmeet at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances to \nnegotiate on issues of wages, hours, and conditions of employment.\n  So I am hopeful that very soon the NLRB, which has had this case \nsince last October, will render a decision. I can only hope that that \ndecision will be that Bridgestone/Firestone is in violation of the law.\n  Earlier today, I talked about some of the demands that they were \nmaking on the workers of Bridgestone/Firestone, about the fact that \nthey want lower wages and longer hours for our workers here than for \ntheir workers in Japan. Bridgestone/Firestone is trying to make up for \nthe exorbitant prices they paid for Firestone by taking it out of the \nworkers.\n  It is not that Bridgestone/Firestone is not profitable. No one has \nstated that. They are very, very profitable as a matter of fact. In \nfact, this is from the Wall Street Journal talking about the strike. \nThey said:\n\n       The eight-month strike, the longest running in the tire \n     industry, fails to hurt the company, Bridgestone/Firestone, \n     which reports an 11 percent jump in sales and tripled profits \n     for 1994.\n\n  ``Tripled profits for 1994.'' And yet they will not even sit down and \nnegotiate with workers.\n\n       The company operates tire plants with 3,000 permanent \n     replacements and 1,300 workers who cross picket lines and \n     says it doesn't need any more help.\n\n  No, it does not need any more help now. It got all the help in the \nbeginning. They got all the help in workers taking wage cuts, \nconcession cuts. They got help from the State of Iowa and the City of \nDes Moines giving them money, giving them grants.\n  There was another strike at Pirelli/Armstrong, and they have agreed \nto go back to work. Pirelli has to hire workers back or face fines \nunder a National Labor Relations Board ruling.\n  Well, I think that same ruling is going to come down on Bridgestone/\nFirestone, that they have failed to negotiate in good faith. Again, I \nhope that that decision will be coming soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article dated March \n7, 1995 appear in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 7, 1995]\n\n       Rubber Workers strike out in their walkout at Bridgestone/\n     Firestone.\n       The eight-month strike, the longest-running in the tire \n     industry, fails to hurt the company, which reports an 11% \n     jump in sales and tripled profits for 1994. The company \n     operates tire plants with 3,000 permanent replacements and \n     1,300 workers who cross picket lines, and says it doesn't \n     need any more help. David Meyer, a labor expert at the \n     University of Akron, predicts replacement workers will \n     eventually vote to decertify the United Rubber Workers. The \n     standoff drains the strike fund, forcing the union to stop \n     $100-a-week checks to strikers.\n       The URW tries to save 1,000 jobs at Pirelli Armstrong by \n     offering an unconditional end to the strike there. Pirelli \n     has to hire the workers back or face fines under a National \n     Labor Relations Board ruling. ``This way,'' Mr. Meyer says, \n     the union ``can at least stay in the plant and fight another \n     day.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Wall Street Journal in December of this year, \nDecember 27, 1994, had a story about Bridgestone/Firestone. I am going \nto read some excerpts from it, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nentire article from the Wall Street Journal appear in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is part of the article from the Wall Street Journal. \nIt says:\n\n       When he took the wheel at Bridgestone Corp's U.S. \n     operations 3 years ago, Japanese executive Yoichiro Kaizaki \n     warned managers that he's a born gambler, and that he always \n     wins. Mr. Kaizaki--who spent more time at the mahjong table \n     than his college economics classes, a classmate says--was \n     given bad odds for turning around the ailing U.S. operation . \n     . .\n       Now, Mr. Kaizaki has cast the dice in perhaps his toughest \n     wager yet; that he can crush a six-month-old strike at three \n     of the company's eight U.S. tire plants, allowing Bridgestone \n     to stand alone against a costly master contract adopted by \n     its industry peers. Analysts think it would be tougher for \n     the United Rubber Workers to maintain its clout in the \n     industry if Bridgestone prevails in the strike.\n\n  That is why this is so insidious. Goodyear settled. Pirelli/Armstrong \nis going back to work. Dunlop, they have all signed on. They all have \ncontracts. But now here is Bridgestone. They are saying, no, we are not \ngoing to reach an agreement. We will crush the union. We will depress \nour wages. And that will put Goodyear, Dunlop, and Armstrong at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. And what are they going to do? Their \nshareholders are going to say, ``Wait a minute; we have to do the same \nthing they are doing.'' And thus you get the ratcheting down of \nconditions in this country. So this does not have just to do with \nBridgestone. It has to do with the whole tire industry in the United \nStates and what is going to happen to the workers there.\n\n       The 61-year-old Mr. Kaizaki isn't looking for a compromise.\n\n  Here's more from the article from the Wall Street Journal, quoting \nMr. Kaizaki: ``Ending the strike is not necessary for the company if we \nare forced to set working conditions that kill the company.''\n\n       Mr. Kaizaki says Bridgestone is racking up losses of about \n     $10 million a month at the three striking plants.\n\n  And you would think that would bring them in, but even with that \ntheir profits tripled in 1994. So they are making big money. The real \npoint is they do not want their workers to share in a legitimate, fair \nway with the increased profits they are making. That is what this is \nall about.\n  Earlier this afternoon, the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, \nsaid ``This has to do with the right of a free people to withhold their \nlabor and the right of the employer to hire somebody else willing to \nwork.''\n  That is what the Senator from Texas, who has now thrown his hat in \nthe ring as an announced candidate for the President of the United \nStates, said. Let me read that again. ``It has to do with the right of \na free people to withhold their labor and the right of the employer to \nhire somebody else willing to work.''\n  Mr. President, I have a lot of cousins who work at Bridgestone/\nFirestone. There is not a one of them not willing to work. Many of them \nhave worked there 20, 30 years. They want to work. And as Sherrie \nWallace said in her letter to me not only do they want to work, they \nwill work very hard. The company asked them to produce one more tire a \nday. She said, ``I gave them three more tires a day.''\n  Now, I am sorry. Mr. Gramm has it wrong. They are willing to work. \nThey are just not willing to be slaves. And we ought not to stand here \nand allow a company like Bridgestone/Firestone to make them slaves.\n  I chose my words carefully. I mean exactly what I said--these workers \nare like slaves, with no voice in what they are going to get as a share \nof the profits of that company. ``Take it or leave it,'' from the \nemployer. ``No matter how long you have worked there, we do not care. \nYou worked there 20 years, you give your best years to the company, we \ndo not care. Take it or leave it, or out the door.''\n  That is slavery, pure and simple. These people are willing to work. \nThey \n[[Page S3737]] want to work. They want to work under the rubric of the \nlaws of the United States of America. These are law-abiding citizens. \nThey are not breaking any law. If there is a law breaker it is \nBridgestone, violating section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  And Bridgestone/Firestone cannot say that they are not hiring \npermanent replacements. They are hiring permanent replacements. That is \nexactly what they are doing. Here is a letter that was sent to Gary \nSullivan, Sr., by Lamar Edwards, labor relations manager for \nBridgestone.\n\n       On January 19, 1995, you did not report to work because you \n     were on strike and you were permanently replaced.\n\n  That is what the letter says.\n\n       Please address any questions you have to the labor \n     relations office. Lamar Edwards, Labor Relations Manager.\n\n  Not even ``Sincerely.'' Not even ``Cordially Yours.''\n  Gary Sullivan penned a note on the letter he sent to me. He said: \n``This is all I am worth after 24 years of devoted and loyal service. \nPlease continue to hang in there. We need your help.''\n  Mr. President, 24 years Gary Sullivan gave to this plant. He worked \nhard; he produced a lot of tires. They did not even say thank you.\n  I only have one question for Bridgestone. Where is their heart? Where \nis their conscience? Do they not have just a little bit of compassion? \nDo they not have just a little bit of feeling for working people, \npeople like Gary Sullivan or Sherrie Wallace, or all my cousins who \nhave been working at Bridgestone/Firestone?\n  We are not asking the company to go broke. Profits tripled last year. \nThey are in a great position. But what is happening is they are taking \nall the money for Mr. Kaizaki and his shareholders, and they are going \nto see how little they can pay their workers to get the production \nlevels that they want. And they will keep squeezing them down.\n  That is what this is all about. That is what this is all about, pure \nand simple. It has to do with whether or not in the specific instance \nwe are about here--whether or not the Federal Government will take tax \ndollars from Sherrie Wallace and Gary Sullivan and Richard Harkin and \nMartin Harkin and Edward Harkin--I can go through all my cousins who \nworked there; it will take me about half an hour--whether they will \ntake their tax dollars; will our Federal Government take their tax \ndollars and use those tax dollars to turn around and buy tires from \nBridgestone/Firestone for the U.S. Government?\n  The fact is we have contracts with them; there are several contracts \nwith Bridgestone/Firestone from the Federal Government. We know of some \n47 Federal contracts held by Bridgestone/Firestone nationwide, not \nincluding contracts held by the corporation's subsidiaries. With this \nExecutive order, Bridgestone would not be able to renew over $8 million \nin Government contracts, $1.5 million from the Des Moines plant alone.\n  So will we let the Federal Government take the tax dollars of these \nworkers and turn around and use them to buy tires from a plant that has \ntold them, no, we will not bargain with you; we are going to \npermanently replace you even though you have exercised your legal right \nto strike? That is why I am proud of what President Clinton did. He \nsaid: No, we are not. We are not going to renew our contracts with \nBridgestone/Firestone. We are not going to buy tires from that company \nfor the Federal Government if they will not even sit down and bargain \nand abide by the National Labor Relations Act and bargain in good \nfaith.\n  Again, I do not know where Bridgestone/Firestone gets off on this. I \ndo not know Mr. Kaizaki. I never met the man. But I do know something. \nThey were talking about violence. We had a couple of violent instances \nat the Des Moines plant, strikers who were fearful of what is going to \nhappen to their families and their children. I want to read one letter \nhere:\n There are many ways to do violence. Twelve workers at Bridgestone/\n     Firestone were fired by the company three days before \n     Christmas as a response to what the company referred to as \n     ``acts of violence, threats and aggressive behavior.''\n       I do not condone physical violence and physical threats. \n     Most of us abhor such things as they occur in labor \n     confrontations. However, that is what company officials are \n     counting on in this situation as they commit their own brand \n     of violence by refusing to bargain in good faith for an end \n     to the strike. The company is using its financial might as a \n     club over the workers.\n       The management of Bridgestone/Firestone wants nothing less \n     than complete capitulation by the members of the United \n     Rubber Workers union. The union is trying to hang on to \n     benefits gained over the years in legitimate negotiating \n     processes.\n       It behooves the rest of us in the community to understand \n     that what is happening out on Second Avenue in Des Moines and \n     at the other Bridgestone/Firestone locations around the \n     country is an attempt to further erode the rights of workers \n     to maintain some control over their own lives, minds and \n     bodies rather than become the de facto property of the \n     company.\n       Do not be fooled by the actions of the management of \n     Bridgestone/Firestone. It is every bit as violent (and more \n     so) as any act of physical violence on the picket line in its \n     destructive effects on human life--The Rev. Carlos C. Jayne.\n\n  So what Bridgestone/Firestone is doing are acts of violence, violence \nto decent, hard-working people, many of whom served in our military, \nfought in our wars; many who gave the best years of their lives; many \nwho have sustained injuries of one form or another; many who are now in \ntheir fifties and will not be able to find work anywhere else.\n  And what Bridgestone is saying is it is just tough luck. We are going \nto throw you out on the trash heap of life.\n  It did not just start here. It started a long time ago. It started \nwith other companies, but now it has reached epic proportions. \nBasically, what we are seeing in America today is the destruction of \nthe working spirit, because what we are telling workers is they are \nlike a piece of machinery. We can use you up and depreciate you down \nand then we can just kind of throw you out. I think it is destructive \nof the work ethic. I know it is destructive of human nature. I know it \nhas destroyed a lot of people.\n  I first came across something like this, when my brother Frank was \nworking at a plant in Des Moines, Delavan Manufacturing Co., started by \nMr. Delavan, right before the Second World War. During the Second World \nWar, it grew big because it made a lot of defense articles and it \ncontinued to make a lot of defense equipment on through the years. My \nbrother went to work there. He was a machine tool operator and worked \nthere for 23 years.\n  He loved his job. He loved the plant. He loved Mr. Delavan, a man I \nhad met myself. He had a good job. He belonged to the United Auto \nWorkers. He was a proud union man. He worked there for 23 years. In the \nfirst 10 years he worked there, he did not miss 1 day of work and was \nnot late once in 10 years.\n  I remember I came home from the service on leave one time, and at a \nChristmas dinner they gave him a gold watch with his name on it because \nin 10 years he had not missed 1 day of work and he had not been late \nonce in 10 years.\n  My brother worked in that plant for 23 years. He missed 5 days of \nwork in 23 years because of the snow conditions. We lived in a small \ntown outside Des Moines, and he could not make it to work.\n  The same thing happened there as happened at Firestone. Mr. Delavan \ngot old. He sold the company. He took care of his workers. In all of \nthose 23 years that plant never had labor strife; they never went on \nstrike. When the contract went up for renegotiation, Mr. Delavan would \nsit down with them, and they would renegotiate.\n  Mr. Delavan got old and sold the company to a group of investors. \nThey bought the company. One of the leaders of this investor group \nbragged at a speech in Des Moines. ``If you want to see how to bust a \nunion, come to Delavan.'' The contract came up for negotiation. He \nrefused to sit down and bargain.\n  The same thing is true at Bridgestone/Firestone. The workers went out \non strike. They brought in the permanent replacements. That was the end \nof it.\n  For 23 years my brother worked there. My brother is a high school \ngraduate. He gave the best years of his life, and worked hard. He would \nstay after work. No matter what they asked him to do, he would do it; \n23 years.\n  Another part of the story I have not mentioned. My brother is \ndisabled; he's deaf. He went to the Iowa School for the Deaf and Dumb. \nI remember he always said, ``You know, I may be deaf \n[[Page S3738]] but I am not dumb.'' But that is what they called it: \nThe Iowa School for the Deaf and Dumb.\n  When he went there, they said, ``You can be three things: A shoe \ncobbler, a printer's assistant, or a baker. It is your choice.'' He \nsaid, ``I do not want to be any one of those.'' But he said, ``OK. I am \ngoing to be a baker.''\n  He got out of school and baked for a while. Then he got this great \njob at Delavan's. He made good money. He was a union member. He bought \nhis own car. It was incredible. Here is a deaf man in his early \ntwenties making decent money, bought a new car, out on his own.\n  You see, Mr. Delavan had gone out and hired disabled people--he was \nway ahead of his time--to work in his plant and found out that they \nmade some of the best workers. When this new crowd came in and bought \nthe plant, did they give a hoot? They did not care. The bottom line was \nprofits. That was it. They figured it out. If they could take my \nbrother, Frank, who had been there for 23 years and worked his way up \nthe wage scale, if they could get rid of him, they could hire somebody \nelse for a third less. That is exactly what they did.\n  I will never forget as long as I live two things my brother said to \nme. The one was when he said to me, ``I may be deaf but I am not \ndumb.'' I will never forget that. I will never forget that after he \nlost his job at Delavan's, he was then 54 years old. Do you know where \na 54-year-old deaf man finds a job? He got a job as a janitor working \nat night cleaning out the latrines.\n  Here is a man who for 23 years operated a nice piece of equipment. It \nwas a drill press. As a matter of fact, he made jet engine nozzles that \nI used in the jets that I flew in the Navy. He was contributing to the \ndefense of his country. He was making a good wage. He was a member of a \nunion; highly productive; 54 years old. No one is going to hire a 54-\nyear-old deaf man. He went and got a job as a janitor at minimum wage; \nno union; no benefits; no health care; no anything.\n  The second thing he said to me that I will never forget. He said, ``I \nfeel like that piece of machinery.'' Delavan had out in back a dump \nwhere they dumped all the tailings, and worn out machines. He said, ``I \nfeel like one of those pieces of machinery that they used up and they \nthrew out.''\n  I will tell you. When those things hit home, you never forget them. \nSo I have been in favor of doing something about striker replacement \never since that time. It is just not right. It is not right for \ncompanies to do this to people. Not all companies do this. It started \nsmall. But now it is like a wildfire. Now they are all starting to do \nit. If Bridgestone/Firestone gets by with it, it will be Armstrong next \nand then it will be Goodyear and then it will be Dunlop and it will \njust keep going on because they are going to have to compete. That is \nwhat is happening in our society.\n  So that is what this is all about. It is not convoluted. It is not \ncomplicated. It is very simple. It is about whether or not working \npeople in America have any dignity, whether they have any rights at \nall, whether we believe that people who work should have some \nbargaining power to bargain with their employer, or whether or not the \nemployer can just say ``take it or leave it.'' That is all it is about. \nIt is nothing more than that.\n  Finally, it is about whether or not we in the Federal Government will \npermit our tax dollars to be used to help subsidize this kind of \ncorporate greed, corporate irresponsibility.\n  President Clinton did the right thing, and I hope we do the right \nthing. I hope we defeat the Kassebaum amendment and send a strong \nsignal to our workers that the Federal Government, at least, is not \ngoing to use their tax dollars to subsidize companies like Bridgestone/\nFirestone.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 27, 1994]\n\n    Corporate Focus: Bridgestone Bets It Can Defeat Rubber Workers' \nStrike--Kaizaki Tries To Turn Around Firestone by Bucking Industrywide \n                                Contract\n\n    (By Valerie Reitman, Masayoshi Kanabayashi, and Raju Narisetti)\n\n       When he took the wheel at Bridgestone Corporation's U.S. \n     operation three years ago, Japanese executive Yoichiro \n     Kaizaki warned managers that he's a born gambler, and that he \n     always wins.\n       Mr. Kaizaki--who spent more time at the mahjong table than \n     his college economics classes, a classmate says--was given \n     bad odds for turning around the ailing U.S. operation. So \n     far, he has beaten them.\n       His aggressive restructuring, known as ``risutora'' in \n     Japanese, has produced the beginning of a turnaround at rusty \n     Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., which Bridgestone acquired for \n     $2.6 billion in 1988. Mr. Kaizaki's performance at the U.S. \n     operation, known as Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., led to his \n     promotion last year to president of the Tokyo-based parent \n     company, one of the world's largest tire makers, with $10.7 \n     billion in tire revenue last year.\n       Now, Mr. Kaizaki has cast the dice in perhaps his toughest \n     wager yet: that he can crush a six-month old strike at three \n     of the company's eight U.S. tire plants, allowing Bridgestone \n     to stand alone against a costly master contract adopted by \n     its industry peers. Analysts think it would be tough for the \n     United Rubber Workers to maintain its clout in the industry \n     if Bridgestone prevails in the strike.\n       The battle is reaching a flash point: Bridgestone says it's \n     about to replace workers permanently, while the union vows to \n     keep Bridgestone from gutting the hard-won increases at other \n     companies.\n       The outcome likely will determine whether Bridgestone's \n     purchase of Firestone--widely considered one of the worst \n     Japanese investments in America several years ago--will prove \n     a durable winner. Or whether it will go down on the list that \n     includes Sony Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures and \n     Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s acquisition of MCA Inc.\n       The strike's resolution also will stand as a verdict on the \n     management performance of Mr. Kaizaki, who has been applying \n     the restructuring lessons he learned in America to Japan.\n       When it acquired Firestone, Bridgestone instantly gained a \n     substantial base of U.S. and European factories and sales \n     outlets, doubling its revenue. But Mr. Kaizaki's sweeping \n     reorganization in the U.S. including cost cuts and massive \n     layoffs, and his attempts to boost productivity, have led to \n     this year's strike. Bridgestone and the union are ``locked in \n     mortal combat,'' says William McGrath, a Cleveland tire-\n     industry consultant.\n       Negotiations are at a stalemate in the strike, which has \n     already surpassed the 141-day walkout that crippled the U.S. \n     tire industry in 1976. Bridgestone is considering making \n     permanent many of the temporary workers hired to replace the \n     4,200 strikers. Tension has erupted on racial lines, with \n     pickets bearing placards saying ``Nuke 'em'' and ``WWII Part \n     II--Japan's Bridgestone Attack on American Economy.''\n       The union wants Bridgestone to extend the same master \n     contract adopted by U.S. tire industry bellwether Goodyear \n     Tire & Rubber Co.\n      The contract calls for wage and benefit increases of 16% \n     over a three-year period from the current average of \n     $67,000, with the average salary portion going up to \n     $49,000 from $45,000.\n       Bridgestone and Mr. Kaizaki aren't budging. The company \n     says its crushing debt load--$2 billion left over from the \n     acquisition and subsequent capital investment, and another \n     $500 million of off-balance-sheet debt--makes it unfeasible \n     to accept the same agreement as its powerful rival, Goodyear. \n     But Bridgestone contends its proposal is generous, providing \n     average annual compensation of $63,000 when pegged to \n     productivity improvements and 12-hour rotating shifts. The \n     union abhors the work schedule and says it's impossible to \n     calculate the value of the proposal, given several proposed \n     reductions of pension and medical benefits.\n       The 61-year-old Mr. Kaizaki isn't looking for a compromise. \n     ``Ending the strike is not necessary for the company if we \n     are forced to set working conditions that kill the company,'' \n     he says in an interview.\n       Mr. Kaizaki says Bridgestone is racking up losses of about \n     $10 million a month at the three striking plants, but that \n     the U.S. operations overall will still earn a profit for the \n     year. Its five other plants are operating full throttle: \n     Union contracts there do not fall under the URW master \n     agreement. Indeed, for the first time since Bridgestone's \n     acquisition, the U.S. operation swung into the black with a \n     $6 million profit last year, and another $10 million in \n     profit is expected this year.\n       While the strike has forced Bridgestone to import costly \n     tires from Japan and to fall behind in farm-tire deliveries, \n     the betting is that Mr. Kaizaki will prevail. With the \n     union's war chest running low and some union workers crossing \n     pickets, ``this one is an endgame,'' says University of Akron \n     management Prof. Daniel Meyer. ``If the URW picket lines \n     break and a lot of those workers go back, they (URW) will \n     still be a force, but their ability to impact in a major way \n     would be gone''\n       Judging by his past record, Mr. Kaizaki isn't likely to \n     retreat. A maverick by any standard, he particularly stands \n     out among Japanese managers, The son of a soy-sauce brewer, \n     built like a fireplug, the chain-smoking Mr. Kaizaki \n     resembles the bulldog of a manager he is.\n       He surprised Firestone workers when he arrived in the U.S. \n     in 1991. He admitted that he knew little about the tire \n     business, coming from Bridgestone's chemical division, and \n     even less about North America. Nor did \n     [[Page S3739]] he speak English. But what he did say was \n     memorable--that he could make tough decisions because he \n     ``had a strong stomach and no problem sleeping at night,'' \n     recalls Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s vice president, Trevor \n     Hoskins.\n       The first Japanese word many Firestone workers learned when \n     he took over was dame (pronounced DA-may), or ``no good,'' \n     which he often used about compromises with the union, \n     according to Nikkei Business magazine.\n       Productivity assessments have been another hallmark. Mr. \n     Kaizaki quickly divided the U.S. operation into 21 divisions, \n     set clear goals for each manager and gave each division chief \n     ``The Buck Stops Here'' placards. He says he has no second \n     thoughts about the demands that prompted the strike, \n     including a nonstop production cycle and tying wages to \n     productivity.\n       From his U.S. vantage, Mr. Kaizaki says he could ``see many\n        defects'' in the Japanese headquarters. ``When I went to \n     the U.S., the parent in Japan did not possess the ability \n     to institute cost-cutting measures.'' Now, he's \n     implementing some of his U.S. changes at the Japanese \n     parent, putting it on a restructuring diet that he calls \n     slim-ka, in order to offset rubber-price increases (50% \n     this year alone), the yen's appreciation and anemic sales. \n     He has halved management positions, established direct \n     managerial communication lines and meted out the lowest \n     raises in the Japanese tire industry to Bridgestone \n     workers, still the industry's highest-paid.\n       The diet is working: Bridgestone just boosted its 1994 \n     earnings forecast for Japanese operations to 21.5 billion yen \n     ($216 million), a 26% increase from 17.05 billion yen last \n     year.\n       In the interview, Mr. Kaizaki dares to say he would lay off \n     workers at the parent if it starts losing money. Even \n     suggesting such a possibility is radical in Japan. But, he \n     says, ``I will fire people if the company here falls into as \n     bad a situation as Firestone was in when I was in the U.S.''\n       Even now, he acknowledges that it will be some time before \n     Bridgestone beats the long odds placed on its investment in \n     Firestone. ``I think it will take a long time for us to see \n     results. We are getting on the right track, but we are still \n     deeply hurt.''\n\n              Bridgestone by the numbers--the fundamentals              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        1993      1992  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSales (trillions)...................................      1.60      1.75\nNet income (billions)...............................     28.39     28.40\nEarnings per shares.................................     36.8      36.8 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Major product lines: Tires (accounting for 74.5% of total \n     sales), wheels, industrial rubber products, chemical \n     products, sporting goods, bicycles.\n       Major competitors: Group Michelin (in Europe), Goodyear \n     Tire & Rubber (in U.S.).\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to associate myself and concur with the remarks \nof the Senator from Iowa, my neighbor. I, too, rise in opposition to \nthe pending amendment.\n  This amendment would block the Executive order issued by President \nClinton that prevents the Federal Government from contracting with \nemployers that permanently replace legally striking employees. I \nstrongly support the Executive order.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, for all of us in this body to begin \nto correct the significant imbalance that exists in labor law today; an \nimbalance that must be corrected if America is going to thrive in the \nincreasingly competitive global marketplace.\n  Mr. President, under our Federal labor law, an employee cannot be \nfired for exercising the right to strike. Congress guaranteed that \nright in 1935 with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, \nwhich told every worker that he or she had the right to organize labor \nunions, to bargain collectively with employers, and to strike in \nsupport of those bargaining demands.\n  Unfortunately, based on the Supreme Court decision in the case of \nNLRB v. MacKay Radio and Telegraph Company, that same employee who \ncannot be fired can be ``permanently replaced.'' Mr. President, I have \nyet to figure out how to console an employee who just lost his or her \njob for going out on strike by telling her that she has not really been \n``fired,'' she has just been ``permanently replaced.''\n  The distinction makes absolutely no sense. It is newspeak. It is a \ndistinction without a difference. Perhaps those in the Congress who \noppose the President's Executive order could take a moment to explain \nthe distinction to the Senate, the difference between being permanently \nreplaced on a job versus being fired from that job. Or, better yet, \nperhaps they could take a minute to explain the difference to people \nlike Carol Little, a former employee of the Woodstock Die Cast Co. in \nWoodstock, IL. I want to tell Carol's story because I think it is \nsignificant and it points to some of the issues that the Senator from \nIowa raised in his eloquent statement.\n  In 1988, Woodstock workers went out on strike to protest severe \ncompany cutbacks. At issue were proposed reduction in wages and health \ncare benefits, as well as complete elimination of pension benefits, all \nin a time when the company was making a profit.\n  Many strike participants had 30 and 40 years of service in the plant, \nand a majority had over 10 years of service. Carol Little was one of \nthe 370 workers who went on strike as a typical Woodstock Die Cast \nworker. A 22-year veteran of the plant, she began working at Woodstock \nDie Cast in 1966.\n  The job made it possible for her to support her children and disabled \nhusband, while putting a son through college. As the family's primary \nbreadwinner, she depended on the fair wages and benefits historically \nprovided by the Woodstock Die Co.\n  Within 2 days of the beginning of the strike, the company began \nadvertising for and hiring permanent replacement workers. The company \nultimately replaced 220 of the 370 strikers.\n  While the union provided hardship payments to workers facing severe \nfinancial problems, a number of strikers still lost their homes. \nSeveral of the striking Woodstock Die Cast workers were forced to file \nfor bankruptcy. In addition, the practice of replacing strikers had \nsevere repercussions throughout the community. The stress caused by the \nstrike and the ensuing job losses contributing to an increase in the \ndivorce rate among former Woodstock Die Cast employees. The most \npoignant example of tragic personal loss, however, is that of a 26-\nyear-old striker who, in an act of hopelessness, took his own life \nafter his wife left him.\n  Fortunately, everything turned out OK for Carol Little. She was able \nto find another job and continue to support her family, but not \neveryone was as fortunate as Carol Little.\n  This tragic story is not unique, Mr. President. Similar stories could \nbe told by the 85 workers replaced by Capitol Engineering in 1983; the \n100 workers replaced by Calumet Steel in 1986; the 160 workers \npermanently replaced by Aircraft Gear Corp. in Chicago, in 1990; and \nthe 338 members of the Chicago Beer Wholesalers Association who were \npermanently replaced--to cite just a few examples.\n  Over the last few months, the Bridgestone/Firestone Corp. has also \npermanently replaced several hundred workers in its plant in Decatur, \nIL. There is a plant in Decatur as well as Des Moines. This decision \nhas created severe economic disruptions for working families that \ndepend on Bridgestone/Firestone for their livelihood. It has also \nimpacted many people and businesses throughout the Decatur area that \nare not directly connected with the company.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that there is no difference\n   between permanently replacing a striking worker, or firing a \nstriking worker. As Thomas Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO \nstated:\n\n       Stripped of the legal niceties, the Mackay doctrine is a \n     grant to employers of the `right' to punish employees for \n     doing no more than unionizing and engaging in collective \n     bargaining. Mackay takes back a large part of the Federal \n     labor law's broad promise to employees that they are \n     protected against employer retaliation if they choose to \n     exercise their freedom to associate in unions. And it does so \n     when that promise would have the most meaning: A collective \n     bargaining dispute. At that critical time, the Mackay \n     doctrine sacrifices basic workers' rights in the interest of \n     aggrandizing employer prerogatives.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate failed to end debate on the striker \nreplacement act last July. This legislation would have amended both the \nNational Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act by banning the \npermanent replacement of striking workers.\n  The Executive order issued yesterday by President Clinton will help \nus take a small, first step; toward restoring the long-standing \nimbalance in labor-management relations by prohibiting the Federal \nGovernment from contracting with employers that replace legally \nstriking workers.\n  [[Page S3740]] It does not mean that the choice that employees have \nwill be removed from them. They can still decide if they want to avail \nthemselves of the right to permanently replace somebody, but it does \nmean that taxpayers will not be a party to decisions to permanently \nreplace workers when indeed the law that guarantees people the right to \nstrike would have prohibited it.\n  Mr. President, this order represents a lawful exercise of \nPresidential authority. The Federal Procurement Act, enacted by \nCongress in 1949, expressly authorizes the President to ``prescribe \npolicies and directives, not inconsistent with the provisions of this \nact, as he shall deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said \nact.''\n  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike have issued Executive \norders addressing the conduct of companies with which the Federal \nGovernment does business. For example, in 1941, President Roosevelt \nissued an Executive order which prohibited defense contractors from \ndiscriminating against individuals on the basis of race. In 1951, after \nenactment of the Procurement Act, President Truman--whose desk I share, \nby the way, Mr. President--issued an Executive order extending that \nrequirement to all Federal contractors. When both orders were issued, \nsuch discrimination was not unlawful and, in fact, Congress had failed \nto enact an antidiscrimination law proposed by President Truman.\n  In 1964, President Johnson issued an Executive order prohibiting \nFederal contractors from discriminating on the basis of age. At the \ntime, Federal law permitted such discrimination.\n  In 1969, President Nixon expanded the antidiscrimination Executive \norder by requiring all Federal contractors to adopt affirmative action \nprograms. President Nixon did that.\n  In 1992, President Bush issued an Executive order requiring unionized \nFederal contractors to notify their unionized employees of their right \nto refuse to pay union dues.\n  Mr. President, since being elected to the Senate I have had the \nopportunity to speak to hundreds of workers about the issue of striker\n replacements throughout my State and indeed in other places, as well. \nThe most important point that I try to make when I talk with working \npeople is that a company's most important asset is its labor force.\n\n  This permanent replacement situation, I believe, is counterproductive \nin that it sets up a dynamic of mistrust and hostility between labor \nand management that cannot be constructive or conducive to \nproductivity. That really breaks down the capacity of the organization \nto function.\n  Of course, every time I talk to working people, I am preaching to the \nchoir. Telling a group of UAW members, for example, about the \nimportance of passing legislation that would prohibit permanent striker \nreplacements is like telling South Africans about the importance of \nvoting. They get it right off, and they understand immediately what it \nmeans.\n  But I have also tried to get the same message through to members of \nthe business community in Illinois. I hope I have been successful. \nAmerica's employers have nothing to fear from President Clinton's \nExecutive order. In the end, labor and management's interests really \nare the same. We are all in a global economy and we will rise or fall, \nsink or swim together. We are all in this together.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield to me on that point for just a \nvery brief comment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I really am pleased to hear the Senator \ntalk about how important it is to have good relations between the \nworkers and management.\n  I know that our Presiding Officer is a very successful business \nperson. I know how much we think of him. We think he is one of the \nfinest Senators, and I am sure that his workers felt the same way about \nhim because this is a man of quality. I think that relationship is \ncrucial.\n  I just wanted to put in the Record at this point a comment that was \nmade by a nurse who was voted the nurse of the year in one of our great \nhospitals in California. There was a terrible strike going on and the \nnurses felt that they were really being abused in many, many ways. I \nwill not go into all the details. It is not important here.\n  But what is important is that they went out on strike and within a \nday they were replaced. This is what she said:\n\n       I always felt that you strike because of the issues and \n     when you settle the issues you go back to work. You do not \n     win every issue. You compromise. That is how we do it in \n     America. I never thought they would replace the workers. Why \n     would anyone ever go on strike then?\n\n  And I think that very simple message gets through to me. We need to \nsettle our differences amicably. And if you know that you are going to \nbe replaced the minute you withhold your labor, which is a human right, \nthen I think it has a tremendously chilling effect.\n  So I am very pleased to associate myself with the Senator's remarks, \nthe fact that I think that it is the right thing for business and for \nthe working people and that our President did the right thing. He stood \nup and said, you know, ``I'm drawing a line here in the sand.''\n  I am very sorry that we are into this on a bill that is supposed to \nreimburse the Pentagon for peacekeeping expenses. It seems to me very \nodd that the Republicans would offer such an amendment on a bill I know \nthey want to get through. It is delaying us, but I guess that is the \nway it goes.\n  I am proud to associate myself with my colleague. I look forward to \nworking with her on this issue.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her remarks, as well.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address some of the incorrect \nstatements that have been made about President Clinton's Executive \norder.\n  The President's Executive order will not encourage workers to strike, \nit will only restore balance to their relations with employers. It also \nwill not prevent employers whose workers choose to strike from carrying \non with their business.\n  A company faced with a strike has a number of options. It can hire \ntemporary replacements. It can rely on supervisory or management \npersonnel to complete jobs. It can transfer work to another plant, \nsubcontract work, or stockpile in advance of a strike. In addition, the \nSupreme Court has long held that an employer lawfully may lock out \nemployees as a means of controlling the time of a work stoppage and \ngain an advantage thereby in bargaining. The President's Executive \norder will not take away any of those alternatives.\n  All it will do, again, is keep taxpayers from being made an \ninadvertent, unwilling, and unexpected party to the capacity of an \nemployer to permanently replace a worker. Again, ``permanently \nreplace''--in my mind, I would like someone to explain how that is \ndifferent from firing somebody.\n  There are, of course, those who say that the Executive order is \nunnecessary, that employers are no more likely to hire permanent \nreplacements for their workers now than they were when the Mackay \ndecision was originally issued. The facts, however, tell another story. \nSince 1980, employers have made far more frequent use of permanent \nreplacements.\n  In 1990, Mr. President, the General Accounting Office released a \nstudy on the use of permanent replacements by employers of labor \ndisputes covered by the NLRA. The study covered the years 1985 to 1989. \nThe study found that in fully one-third of the strikes examined, \nemployers indicated they intended to hire permanent replacements. In \napproximately 17 percent of the strikes, employers actually did hire \npermanent replacements. The GAO stated that approximately 14,000 \nstriking workers were replaced in 1985 and 14,000 more in 1989.\n  Of course, this figure did not cover employees covered by the Rail \nLabor Act, or the RLA, such as the 8,000 pilots, machinists and flight \nattendants replaced by Continental Airlines in 1985, or the 7,000 \nemployees replaced by Eastern Airlines in 1989. An AFL-CIO study found \n11 percent of striking workers, 126,450 individuals in all, were \npermanently replaced in 1990.\n  What we are seeing is an increase in the use of permanent \nreplacements, and an increase in the use of this tactic by employers. \nAgain, given the trauma that it occasioned, I daresay it cannot \n[[Page S3741]] be in our national interests to promote or to continue.\n  What is even more important to realize, Mr. President, is the real \nissue is not ultimately how often the permanent replacement weapon is \nused. The truth is that the mere availability of this weapon to \nmanagement distorts the collective bargaining process in many, many \nmore labor disputes than those in which it is actually used. The mere \nexistence of the threat, whether or not it is carried out, is enough to \nundermine the right to organize and to undermine workers' ability to \nbargain on a level playing field about the conditions of their work.\n  In that regard, I reference the letter that was read by the Senator \nfrom California, when the letter writer said, ``If you knew you were \ngoing to get fired, why would you try?\"\n  After 12 years of antagonism during previous administrations, the \ntime I believe has come to forge a new direction. The time has come for \nlabor and management to work together in this country. Our major \nindustrial competitors including Canada, Japan, Germany, and France, \nhave recognized that banning the permanent replacement of strikers \nrestores balance in the collective bargaining process and makes good \neconomic sense. The time has come for Congress to do the same.\n  I point out again, with regard to Bridgestone/Firestone in Decatur \nand Des Moines, what is happening in Decatur, and what is happening in \nDes Moines, is illegal in Japan. It is almost too perverse to \ncontemplate.\n  America's union workers are not simply another cost to be cut. They \nare human beings who are often struggling to provide for their families \nto make ends meet. Under our Nation's labor laws they have certain \nrights, including the right to strike. Congress thought that we were \nguaranteeing that in 1935 when the NLRA was passed. Unfortunately, they \nwere wrong. They had not counted on someone coming up with the idea \nthat to be permanently replaced was not the same thing as being fired.\n  But we can guarantee that today. We can acknowledge what everyone \nknows to be true: That absent the right to strike without being \npermanently replaced, collective bargaining does not work. It cannot. \nIt cannot if management can replace workers the minute they take to the \npicket lines. Workers then do not have the right to bargain. They walk \naround in every negotiation with a loaded gun, frankly, at their heads.\n  Mr. President, we are entering a new era in economic competition. All \nover the world, barriers to trade between nations are falling. We are \nwitnessing the development of a truly global marketplace. I believe \nthat America can and must lead the way in this marketplace, but if we \nare to succeed, if we are to retain our competitive into the 21st \ncentury, there must be a symbiosis between labor and management and \ngovernment. That means a mutually beneficial working relationship, one \nof mutual respect: Labor needs jobs, workers need jobs, workers need \nthe business to be competitive to make a profit to be able to compete. \nGovernment should be a partner of all of that.\n  Certainly, this issue of permanent replacement of strikers just cuts \nagainst the grain and prohibits and precludes our ability to advance \nourselves and to go forward in terms of this global marketplace and the \ncompetitiveness challenges that we are facing in the world.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton's Executive order, I believe, is a \nfirst step in restoring the balance, the delicate balance, that will \nallow America to retain its competitive edge. I would, therefore, like \nto conclude my remarks by urging this body to oppose the pending \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3731-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3741-S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, recently, concern was expressed that the \nPell Grant Program may be giving college students a free ride, and that \nFederal funds might be better spent by transferring funds to the \nCollege Work Study Program. Because of this, I thought it might be \nhelpful to take a somewhat closer look at the Pell Grant Program, and \nplace it in a more proper context regarding student aid in general and \nits relationship to college work study in particular. I thought it \nmight also be good to see just how many students today have to work to \nhelp pay for their college education.\n  At the outset, let me make it clear that I support both of these very \nworthy programs. The Pell Grant Program provides students with need the \nopportunity to pursue a college education that might be beyond their \nfinancial reach. The College Work Study Program often supplements the \nPell Grant Program and offers deserving students the chance to help \ndefray their educational expenses by working. Both programs are \nimportant, and both programs are essential.\n  I am concerned, however, that with respect to the Pell Grant Program, \nthe impression in the public's mind might be that these students do not \nhave to work and that their college education is being fully financed \nby their Pell grant. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\n  As my colleagues know, the Pell grant award is need-based, which \nmeans it goes only to students who demonstrate financial need. Over 75 \npercent of all students who receive Pell grants come from families with \nincomes of less than $15,000 a year, which means that the program is \ntargeted to those students who have the greatest financial need.\n  In addition, it is very important that one realize that the maximum \nPell grant can be no higher than $2,340, the current maximum, or 60 \npercent of the cost of attendance, whichever is less. Thus, in no \nsituation does the Pell grant pay for a student's entire education. At \nbest, it covers only 60 percent of the cost of attendance, and that in \nthe case of those students who demonstrate the very greatest need.\n  Increasingly, more and more students find they must work in order to \nobtain the additional funds necessary to pay for a college education. A \nrecent Washington Post article indicated that the proportion of all \nfulltime college students between the ages of 16 and 24 who worked to \nhelp pay for their education had increased from 35 percent in 1972 to \n51 percent in 1993. And, fulltime students now work an average of 25 \nhours a week.\n  The figures for Pell grant recipients are even more dramatic. Of \nthose who responded to a recent survey by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, more than 75 percent of all Pell grant recipients worked and \n60 percent worked while they were in school. Numerically, this means \nthat almost 2.8 million Pell grant recipients work, and over 2.2 \nmillion must work and go to college at the same time.\n  I am equally concerned that there may simply not be enough hours in a \nday for needy and deserving students to pay for their entire education \nby working. One goes to college to learn. If that is to be done and \ndone well, students must have sufficient time to study. While work may \nbe both necessary and laudable, it should not rob students of the time \nthey need to fulfill the academic responsibilities that led them to \nseek a college education in the first place.\n  Further, it is very doubtful that there are enough jobs in and around \ncampus to meet the demand that would be created if the Pell Grant \nProgram were handed over to college work study. When we reauthorized \nthe Higher Education Act in 1992, we considered an expansion of the \nWork Study Program, but found that many colleges were literally \nstretched to the limits in terms of finding employment for their \nstudents. Thus, as worthwhile and important as the College Work Study \nProgram is, it simply cannot meet the overwhelming needs of students.\n  One of the unique features of the Pell Grant Program is that it is \ntargeted to the student and not the institution. If students \ndemonstrate need, Pell grant funds are available to help them attend a \ncollege of their choice. Transferring that approach to the campus-based \nWork Study Program would change the very nature of the Pell Grant \nProgram. \n[[Page S3742]] Access and choice are twin features of this important \nprogram, and I am of the mind that we should not alter that approach.\n  The Pell Grant Program has helped literally millions of students \nachieve a college education that otherwise would have been beyond their \nreach. This year more than 3.7 million students received Pell grants, \nand more than 54 million grants have been made since the program began \nin 1973-74 school year. It is a program that has outstripped the widely \npopular and important GI bill on which it was modeled.\n  Mr. President, today we are faced with the fact that more students \nand families are having to go deeply into debt to pay for a college \neducation. The number of students and families who must borrow and the \namount of money they are borrowing are reaching gigantic proportions. A \ndecade ago the anticipated new loan volume in the Guaranteed Student \nLoan Program was $7.9 billion with just under 3.4 million borrowers. \nThis year the anticipated loan volume is $25.8 billion and almost 6.6 \nmillion borrowers. The number of borrowers has less than doubled, but \nthe amount borrowed has more than tripled.\n  Instead of focusing concern on either the Pell Grant Program or the \nCollege Work Study Program, we should be examining with care the long-\nterm effects of student indebtedness. Instead of a debate that would \nhave us choose between grants or work study, we should be debating how \nto increase both of those programs in order to relieve students and \nfamilies of the terrible debt burden they are incurring through student \nloans.\n  Mr. President, in a Congress where the size of the national debt is \nrightfully a major focus and where the need for a better balance \nbetween income and expenditures is absolutely necessary,\n we should not lose sight of the fact that this applies not only to \nFederal spending but also to family spending and the deficit they face \nin trying to pay for a college education.\n\n  In a Congress where budget cutting is a major theme, it may not be \npopular to suggest that the right and prudent course to follow in \nstudent aid is to increase funding in both the Pell grant and the \nCollege Work Study program. Yet, that is, to my mind, the course we \nshould be following if, in fact, we are really, truly concerned about \nthe debt American students and families are incurring as they invest \nnot only in education but in their own and their Nation's future \nstrength and well-being.\n  What Disraeli said of England over a century ago is surely just as \ntrue for America today: ``Upon the education of our children depends \nthe future of the nation.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3741-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATION OF NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I bring to the \nattention of my colleagues National Sportsmanship Day which was \ncelebrated on March 7.\n  My pride stems from the fact that this celebration, which is \nrecognized by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, \noriginated as a concept of the Institute for International Sport. The \ninstitute, housed at the University of Rhode Island, has brought us the \nhugely successful World Scholar-Athlete Games and the soon to be held \nRhode Island Scholar-Athlete Games. National Sportsmanship Day, now in \nits fifth year, has grown into a national and now an international \nmovement.\n  National Sportsmanship day was conceived to create an awareness among \nthe students of this country--from grade school to university level--of \nthe importance of ethics, fair play, and sportsmanship in all facets of \nathletics as well as society as a whole. The need to periodically \nrefocus our young people on sportsmanship and fair play is sadly \nevident on the playing field in these days of taunting, fighting, \nwinning at all costs mentality, and the lure of huge sums of money for \nathletes hardly ready to cope with life's normal challenges.\n  To commemorate National Sportsmanship Day, the Institute for\n   International Sport sends to all participating schools--now \nnumbering 5,000 in all 50 States as well as a number of schools in \nnearly 50 countries--packets of information with instructional \nmaterials on the themes surrounding the issue of sportsmanship. \nThroughout the country, students are involved in discussions, writing \nessays, creating art work, and in other creative ways engaging each \nother on the subject.\n\n  The institute's nationally recognized Sports Ethics Fellows Program, \nwhich counts among its present members Olympic gold medal skater Bonnie \nBlair, promotes and supports National Sportsmanship Day activities.\n  Mr. President, as it has in past years, the President's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports had recognized National Sportsmanship Day. \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter signed by the council's \ncochairs Florence Griffith Joyner and former Congressman Tom McMillen \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks. I also urge my \ncolleagues, Mr. President, to encourage students to focus on National \nSportsmanship Day.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        The President's Council on\n\n\n                                  Physical Fitness and Sports,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1994.\n     Mr. Todd Seidel,\n     Director of National Sportsmanship Day, Institute for \n         International Sport, University of Rhode Island, \n         Kingston, RI.\n       Dear Mr. Seidel: The President's Council on Physical \n     Fitness and Sports is pleased to recognize March 7, 1995, as \n     National Sportsmanship Day. The valuable life skills and \n     lessons that are learned by youth and adults through \n     participation in sports cannot be overestimated.\n       Participation in sports makes contributions to all aspects \n     of our lives, such as heightened awareness of the value of \n     fair play, ethics, integrity, honesty and sportsmanship, as \n     well as improving levels of physical fitness and health.\n       The Council congratulates the Institute for International \n     Sport for its continued leadership in organizing this \n     important day and wish you every success in your efforts to \n     broaden participation and awareness of National Sportsmanship \n     Day.\n           Sincerely,\n     Florence Griffith Joyner,\n       Cochair.\n     Tom McMillen,\n       Cochair.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3742-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3742-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3742-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3742-S3743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The United States has been engaged in nuclear cooperation with the \nEuropean Community, now European Union, for many years. This \ncooperation was initiated under agreements that were concluded in 1957 \nand 1968 between the United States and the European Atomic Energy \nCommunity [EURATOM] and that expire December 31, 1995. Since the \ninception of this cooperation, EURATOM has adhered to all its \nobligations under those agreements.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 amended the Atomic Energy \nAct of 1954 to establish new nuclear export criteria, including a \nrequirement that the United States have a right to consent to the \nreprocessing of fuel exported from the United States. Our present \nagreements for cooperation with EURATOM do not contain such a right. To \navoid disrupting cooperation with EURATOM, a proviso was included in \nthe law to enable continued cooperation until March 10, 1980, if \nEURATOM agreed to negotiations concerning our cooperation agreements. \nEURATOM agreed in 1978 to such negotiations.\n  [[Page S3743]] The law also provides that nuclear cooperation with \nEURATOM can be extended on an annual basis after March 10, 1980, upon \ndetermination by the President that failure to cooperate would be \nseriously prejudicial to the achievement of U.S. nonproliferation \nobjectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security, and \nafter notification to the Congress. President Carter made such a \ndetermination 15 years ago and signed Executive Order No. 12193, \npermitting nuclear cooperation with EURATOM to continue until March 10, \n1981. Presidents Reagan and Bush made similar determinations and signed \nExecutive orders each year during their terms. I signed Executive Order \nNo. 12840 in 1993 and Executive Order No. 12903 in 1994, which extended \ncooperation until March 10, 1994, and March 10, 1995, respectively.\n  In addition to numerous informal contacts, the United States has \nengaged in frequent talks with EURATOM regarding the renegotiation of \nthe U.S.-EURATOM agreements for cooperation. Talks were conducted in \nNovember 1978; September 1979; April 1980; January 1982; November 1983; \nMarch 1984; May, September, and November 1985; April and July 1986; \nSeptember 1987; September and November 1988; July and December 1989; \nFebruary, April, October, and December 1990; and September 1991. Formal \nnegotiations on a new agreement were held in April, September, and \nDecember 1992; March, July, and October 1993; June, October, and \nDecember 1994; and January and February 1995. They are expected to \ncontinue.\n  I believe that it is essential that cooperation between the United \nStates and EURATOM continue, and likewise, that we work closely with \nour allies to counter the threat of proliferation of nuclear \nexplosives. Not only would a disruption of nuclear cooperation with \nEURATOM eliminate any chance of progress in our negotiations with that \norganization related to our agreements, it would also cause serious \nproblems in our overall relationships. Accordingly, I have determined \nthat failure to continue peaceful nuclear cooperation with EURATOM \nwould be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of U.S. \nnonproliferation objectives and would jeopardize the common defense and \nsecurity of the United States. I therefore intend to sign an Executive \norder to extend the waiver of the application of the relevant export \ncriterion of the Atomic Energy Act until the current agreements expire \non December 31, 1995.\n                                                  William J.

Consistent \nwith the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5302(b), I am hereby notifying the \nCongress of that determination. The congressional leadership issued a \njoint statement with me on January 31, 1995, in which we all agreed \nthat such use of the ESF was a necessary and appropriate response to \nthe Mexican financial crisis and in the United States' vital national \ninterest.\n  On February 21, 1995, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Mexican \nSecretary of Finance and Public Credit signed four agreements that \nprovide the framework and specific legal arrangements under which up to \n$20 billion in support will be made available from the ESF to the \nGovernment of Mexico and the Bank of Mexico. Under these agreements, \nthe United States will provide three forms of support to Mexico: short-\nterm swaps through which Mexico borrows dollars for 90 days and that \ncan be rolled over for up to 1 year; medium-term swaps through which \nMexico can borrow dollars for up to 5 years; and securities guarantees \nhaving maturities of up to 10 years.\n  Repayment of these loans and guarantees is backed by revenues from \nthe export of crude oil and petroleum products formalized in an \nagreement signed by the United States, the Government of Mexico, and \nthe Mexican government's oil company. In addition, as added protection \nin the unlikely event of default, the United States is requiring Mexico \nto maintain the value of the pesos it deposits with the United States \nin connection with the medium-term swaps. Therefore, should the rate of \nexchange of the peso against the U.S. dollar drop during\n the time the United States holds pesos, Mexico would be required to \nprovide the United States with enough additional pesos to reflect the \nrate of exchange prevailing at the conclusion of the swap.\n\n  I am enclosing a Fact Sheet prepared by the Department of the \nTreasury that provides greater details concerning the terms of the four \nagreements. I am also enclosing a summary of the economic policy \nactions that the Government of Mexico and the Central Bank have agreed \nto take as a condition of receiving assistance.\n  The agreements we have signed with Mexico are part of a multilateral \neffort involving contributions from other countries and multilateral \ninstitutions. The Board of the International Monetary Fund has approved \nup to $17.8 billion in medium-term assistance for Mexico, subject to \nMexico's meeting appropriate economic conditions. Of this amount, $7.8 \nbillion has already been disbursed, and additional conditional \nassistance will become available beginning in July of this year. In \naddition, the Bank for International Settlements is expected to provide \n$10 billion in short-term assistance.\n  The current Mexican financial crisis is a liquidity crisis that has \nhad a significant destabilizing effect on the exchange rate of the \npeso, with consequences for the overall exchange rate system. The \nspill-over effects of inaction in response to this crisis would be \nsignificant for other emerging market economies, particularly those in \nLatin America, as well as for the United States. Using the ESF to \nrespond to this crisis is therefore plainly consistent with the purpose \nof 31 U.S.C. 5302(b): to give the United States the ability to take \naction consistent with its obligations in the International Monetary \nFund to assure orderly exchange arrangements and a stable system of \nexchange rates.\n  The Mexican peso crisis erupted with such suddenness and in such \nmagnitude as to render the usual short-term approaches to a liquidity \ncrisis inadequate to address the problem. To resolve problems arising \nfrom Mexico's short-term debt burden, longer term solutions are \nnecessary in order to avoid further pressure on the exchange rate of \nthe peso. These facts present unique and emergency circumstances, and \nit is therefore both appropriate and necessary to make the ESF \navailable to extend credits and loans to Mexico in excess of 6 months.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to limit the acquisition by the United States of land \nlocated in a State in which 25 percent or more of the land in that \nState is owned by the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  the no-net-loss of private lands act\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the No-\nNet-Loss of Private Lands Act.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that I think is a commonsense approach \nthat would begin to slow and halt the Federal Government's continual \nland acquisition in the public land States.\n  This is an issue that is peculiar to the West; peculiar to public \nland States. As you know, as the original States grew at the \nMississippi River and beyond, as the States came into the Union, they \nacquired all the lands that lay within their States. They even went \ninto private ownership, or in fact belonged to the State. Those kinds \nof things that were of public interest, such as parks and forests and \nothers, were withdrawn later by the Government for a particular use. I \ncertainly support that idea.\n  In the West, however, it was handled differently. There was a period \nof time for homestead, and much of the public land was taken up. But \nthere were incentives to take it up. However, the West is peculiar. The \narid States are peculiar in that the lands pretty much rely on the \nwater. They rely on the feed for livestock.\n  [[Page S3745]] So lands that were not taken up were left after the \nhomestead time was over. These were simply lands that were there when \nall the private ownership was done.\n  So they were managed by the Federal Government. And in fact, the \norganic act of the land management agencies indicated that they would \nbe held prior to pending disposal. The fact is, to make a long story \nshort, there was no disposal, and that they are now permanently managed \nby the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government continues in addition to that to acquire \nsubstantial amounts of land throughout the Nation in every State. I \nthink people are saying it is time to slow or stop the growth of the \nFederal Government in its land ownership and to limit its ever-\nincreasing impact on our lives.\n  In my State of Wyoming, approximately 50 percent of the surface \nbelongs to the Federal Government, and more, as a matter of fact, in \nthe subsurface in the State. But when half of your State belongs to the \nFederal Government and is managed by Federal land managers, then your \neconomic future depends a great deal upon how the management takes \nplace and what happens in those lands.\n  Other Western States have an even higher percentage of Federal \nownership. For example, in Idaho it is 61 percent; Utah, 63 percent; \nand, in Nevada, nearly 85 percent of that State is owned and managed by \nthe Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, particularly, in recent years, as the economies begin \nto grow, the Federal Government has not always been a good neighbor to \nthe people of the West. The Federal land management agencies continue \nto make it more difficult, and continue to lock up vast amounts of land \nin the West.\n  We are not talking here in multiple use of parks or wilderness. We \nare talking about lands that have been set aside for multiple use and \nthe Federal Government--and particularly this administration--has made \nit increasingly difficult to use these lands as multiple use for timber \nharvest, for grazing, and\n for mining. All these uses, many of which are compatible ones with \nanother, play a very important part, of course, in our economy. So \nthere has indeed and continues to be a ``war in the West.''\n\n  Just yesterday we had some hearings to talk about domestic energy. \nOne of the issues that certainly is a part of that is the difficulty of \naccess to public lands for exploration and production of minerals. It \nhas been almost a deathblow to the domestic oil industry in the West.\n  Recently, the General Accounting Office released a report detailing \nthe growth of the amount of lands and found that over the last 3 \ndecades the Federal land ownership has increased dramatically. In the \nfiscal year 1994 alone, the Federal land management agencies acquired \nan additional 203,000 acres of land in the United States.\n  These increases, of course, were a result of expansion to the forests \nor wildlife refuges or national parks. I have no objection to that. As \na matter of fact, when there is a reason to acquire lands for a public \npurpose that is determined through the process, I have no problem with \nit.\n  The purpose of this bill is to say that in States where more than 25 \npercent of the surface is owned by the Federal Government and when \nadditional lands are acquired, there should be lands of equal value \ndisposed; a fairly simple concept, and I think a fairly fair concept. \nIt is particularly, of course, appropriate only for the West, only with \nthose States with more than 25 percent.\n  It seems to me it is a fairness issue. It puts the West in sort of \nthe same position as the rest of the States. It is an equity issue. It \ncertainly is an issue of economics for us.\n  So I am very pleased to introduce this bill. I have a number of \ncosponsors. I urge my colleagues to take a look at this bill and see if \nthey think there is fairness causing the Federal Government through \ntrades or sales to dispose of lands of equal value to additional lands \nthat are acquired.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to take a look at itself. Of \ncourse, that is what this whole Congress has been about; making some \nfundamental changes in Government in terms of the size of Government, \nin terms of the cost of the Government, and in terms of shifting those \nthings--that can be managed better in the private sector or by the \nStates--back to the private sector and to the States. This bill is \nconsistent with that view.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator Thomas in \nintroducing legislation which will limit land acquisition by the \nFederal Government. Very simply, it makes no sense for the Federal \nGovernment, with all of its financial problems, to continue buying land \nthat it can not afford to properly manage.\n  On the contrary, the Federal Government should be examining its \ncurrent land holdings for possible sale prospects. I am sure there are \nmany instances where the Government bought land over 100 years ago to \nsupport a program or policy which is no longer valid in today's \nsociety. Here is where Senator Thomas' bill will ask the question: why \ndo we still have the land? Under this legislation, a review would occur \nprior to any land purchase to maintain a no-net-gain public lands \npolicy. This analysis will permit the identification of land to be sold \nto compensate for the piece considered for purchase. It will also \nanswer that important question.\n  This legislation applies only to States in which the Federal \nGovernment currently controls more than 25 percent of the land. This \napproach focuses a legislative solution where the problem is the \ngreatest. It avoids that one-size-fits-all mentality which existed in \npast Congresses.\n  Presently, there are 13 States in which the Federal Government \nalready owns and controls over a fourth of the land. You could call \nthese States Federal colonies. They are virtual hostages to Federal \npolicies and to the Washington bureaucrats who dominate the States' \neconomies by their whims and agenda.\n  Fortunately, Mississippi's public lands percentage is under 5 \npercent. That does not mean I do not appreciate the problem. I became a \ncosponsor because Federal intrusion into local jurisdictional matters \nis pervasive.\n  Every State must have the ability to sustain a viable growing economy \nand to manage its natural resources. How can a State or local \nmunicipality function when out of the blue, a Federal policy can \noverride legitimate local concerns? We saw that happen last year with \nregard to a questionable agenda concerning grazing fees.\n  Let's talk numbers because they will illustrate the magnitude of the \nFederal Government's appetite. There are roughly 2 billion acres in the \nUnited States, of which the Government already owns about 650 million \nacres. When this patchwork of Government ownership is consolidated, it \ntranslates into a land mass equal to the size of 11 Southern States \nstarting with Virginia and stretching around the gulf to Texas and \ngoing north to Arkansas and Kentucky. And we still need more. In \naddition to the South, you would have to add the west coast from \nCalifornia through Oregon and half of Washington is required to equal \nthe size of the land area controlled by the Federal Government.\n  That's over one-fourth of the United States, and if that is not \nenough, the Federal Government continues on a buying frenzy. Just last \nyear, it claimed over 7 million more acres of land. That represents an \narea larger than the State of Maryland. I do not think anyone can \ndispute the fact that this Federal land policy needs to be reviewed and \nput on a diet. The Thomas legislation provides a responsible first \nstep. It merely tries to stabilize the growth.\n  When you visualize the extent of Federal ownership, several questions \ncome to mind. Why does the Federal Government need so much land? Is it \nall really needed? Will the sky fall if this Government stops buying up \nmore private land?\n  Beyond Federal land gluttony, what is even more disturbing is how \npoorly the Federal Government manages these lands. For the Government \nto take land on the premise that it will do a better job conserving the \nland, ignores reality. There is ample evidence that private lands are \nfar better managed ecologically than Government lands.\n  A review of the budgets for just two Federal agencies responsible for \nland management reveals they are funded only to a level to perform \ncustodial care. Ordinarily, I would be sympathetic to their desire for \nmore funds for \n[[Page S3746]] land management improvements, but these same agencies \nare the ones who seek to acquire more and more land. The Bureau of Land \nManagement and the National Park Service just can not say no. Rather \nthan use their budget to manage and husband natural resources already \nin their care; they are out shopping for more land. They have become \nthe Nation's largest absentee landlord. Evidently, their agenda is to \ntake as much private land as possible with no real intention to manage \nit wisely.\n  Today, Senator Thomas is offering a win-win legislative solution. The \nFederal Government gets a maintenance diet, and the States get a chance \nto chart their own destiny without fear of more Government intrusion.\n  Let me be clear about this: Federal holdings take land off local tax \nrolls, causing the property tax base to shrink and tax rates to rise \ncommensurately for those who remain. This only gets worse as more and \nmore land is taken.\n  Let me be even more candid: A growing Federal presence is \nincreasingly perceived as an oppressive Federal occupation. In most \ninstances, the Federal Government is not necessarily a good neighbor.\n  Our Founding Fathers deeply believed in individual rights. That \nincludes freedom of speech and religion; and the right for Americans to \nown property. Unfortunately, today it looks as if the Federal \nGovernment believes it must own and control the land, rather than \nindividual Americans. Senator Thomas has provided us an opportunity to \nstop this policy and restore our country to what our Founding Fathers \nenvisioned.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration, and I hope they will \nexamine this worthwhile legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Exon, Mr. Ford, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 519.

I have respected the leadership \nof Senator Conrad on this issue, as I have of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. President, a number of Senators have been developing for some \ntime a bill that we are introducing today that would put our money \nwhere our mouth is when it comes to making the tough decisions on the \nbudget that we all know must be made.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks, we have had a vigorous \ndebate about the advisability, the practicality, and the prudence, of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  As everyone knows, by a very close vote, the Senate has decided, at \nleast for now, that there will not be a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. But no one should interpret that to mean there will \nnot be an effort to reduce the deficit, or that we will not continue on \nthe progress that we have made in the past 3 years on getting the \ndeficit under control. We intend to continue deficit reduction further \nthan it has come to this point. We want to balance the budget by a date \ncertain without relying on the Social Security trust funds.\n  We made good progress. We have reduced the deficit, now, by 40 \npercent from what it was just 3 years ago. It has been a long time \nsince the Senate and the Congress has done that. The last time \nWashington has reduced the deficit 3 years in a row was during the time \nof Harry Truman. So we have come a long way. We have made some very \ntough choices. We made tough choices with regard to both revenue as \nwell as cuts in 1990. We made very tough choices, and on another very \nclose vote, passed a $600 billion deficit reduction package in 1993.\n  We have come this far as a result of those very tough choices, \nchoices for which a lot of Members took a lot of political heat. We can \nsay, perhaps somewhat boastfully, that because of those tough choices, \nour country is stronger today. Because of those tough choices, we have \nactually been able to make real progress in meaningful deficit \nreduction.\n  We need another effort just like that this year. The only change that \nI hope we can make is that in 1993, unfortunately, it became a very \npartisan choice, the Republicans versus Democrats. I hope this year, \ngiven the tremendous burden we all must share in coming to grips with \nthis deficit, that it does not have to be partisan; that it indeed will \nbe a bipartisan effort at deficit reduction; that we could put the next \ninstallment on deficit reduction into place now in 1995.\n  So the bill that we are introducing, Mr. President, will do just \nthat. It says very fundamentally three things. First and foremost, that \nwe shall reduce the deficit to zero by the year 2002, or at the \nearliest possible date set by the Budget Committee.\n  Our view is that unless we have a time certain, it is really \nimpossible to develop the necessary blueprint to get us from here to \nthere. Recognizing that we have $1.8 trillion of deficit reduction \ndecisionmaking ahead of us, there is no way we can come to grips with \nit and do all that we must to do it right unless we take it in \ninstallments year after year, recognizing that each year has to be a \ndownpayment.\n  So that is the provision in our bill: to set a date certain, either \n2002 or the earliest date set by the Budget Committee.\n  The second provision is one that we have talked a good deal about: \nprotecting Social Security. I said the deficit over the course of the \nnext 7 years will be $1.8 trillion more if we do nothing. That is our \ngoal. It would be $1.2 trillion if we were to use the Social Security \ntrust funds to finance the deficit. Many of us feel that using Social \nSecurity trust funds to pay for other government programs is wrong. \nThere is a designated purpose for those trust funds, and we do not want \nto play games with trust fund dollars or with the revenue that would be \nrequired to meet the obligations we have to workers who will need the \ntrust funds to retire in future years.\n  So our view is to take Social Security off the table, to recognize \nthe magnitude of the problem for what it really is--$1.8 trillion--and \nto begin making the effort to balance the budget, as we know we must.\n  The third, and an equally important element in this budget package, \nis one which simply says this must be the Congress to start this \neffort. This must be the Congress to begin making the headway and \nleading the way to ensure that future Congresses do what we know we \nmust do. We cannot delegate the responsibility to future Congresses, it \nhas to be this one now, this year, this session of Congress. And so our \nbill makes that point very clear.\n  Our bill provides for a budgetary point of order--a requirement that \n60 Senators must vote to overturn--against any reported budget \nresolution that does not balance the budget by a date certain.\n  So, Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion, a lot of \ndebate, and a lot of strongly held feelings about how we get from here \nto there. I believe the time has come for us to put aside the rhetoric, \nto get down to the real hard decisionmaking that we all must do if we \nare going to accomplish this in a successful way.\n  In 23 days' time, the Budget Committee is required--by law--to \nproduce a budget blueprint. In 38 days, Congress must approve a plan. \nWe stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues to craft a plan \nthat meets the goals set out in the bill we are introducing today. We \nhope they will support this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Social Security trust funds are the only Federal \nfunds that are explicitly excluded from the deficit calculations under \nthis bill. That is because, as I have said, the surplus revenues \nbuilding up in those trust funds--amounting to $705 billion between now \nand 2002--would otherwise be raided to balance the budget.\n  Just as we are determined to protect Social Security, this bill would \nforce Congress to set national priorities as \n[[Page S3747]] we balance the budget. As we engage in that process, we \nneed to protect those who need our help. Cutting back on meals for \nschoolchildren, as some are proposing, is not what proponents of this \nbill have in mind. Neither would we support cutting back on benefits to \nveterans with service-connected disabilities.\n  The debate should be about priorities. We must balance the budget, \nand we must do it in a way that strengthens the economy and that is \nfair.\n  I am very pleased that so many of my colleagues have joined me in \ncosponsoring this bill. Many of them are on the floor this morning to \nparticipate in this colloquy. I yield the floor at this time to \naccommodate the other statements.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the time that I have just used be taken \nfrom my leader time. And I ask unanimous consent that the full 30 \nminutes under my control be made available to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and I designate the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota as the manager of the time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The discussion by Senator Daschle, the minority leader, is about an \ninitiative that would give this Congress a procedure to try to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit and reach a balanced budget. All of us \nunderstand that changing the Constitution will not change the budget \ndeficit. That requires specific actions by the Congress.\n  We finished a battle last week that was a bruising debate, a battle \non the question of should the U.S. Constitution be amended to require a \nbalanced budget. That proposition would have had 75 or 80 votes had it \nincluded a provision that said the Social Security trust funds will not \nbe used to balance the budget. But that provision was voted down, and, \ntherefore, the amendment itself lost.\n  But the question is not whether there is a constitutional amendment. \nThe question is whether we will balance the Federal budget. We have \nproposed today a process by which we hope Republicans and Democrats can \njoin together to say it is up to us now together to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  I said yesterday I had watched ESPN 1 day just very briefly and they \nwere showing a bodybuilding contest. The announcer, in announcing this \nbodybuilding contest, said something kind of interesting that I thought \napplied to Congress as well. He said, ``You know, there's a difference \nin the skills a bodybuilder uses between when he poses and when he \nlifts,'' because in this contest they were posing. He said, ``That \nrequires a different skill than lifting.''\n  It occurred to me that that is a perfect description of what happens \nhere. Some are skillful posers and do no lifting at all. The question \nat the moment is not how do we pose on the issue of a balanced budget, \nthe question is how will we all decide to lift together to cut the \nspending, to do the things necessary in a real way to balance the \nFederal budget.\n  So we propose that by statute we require that as a Congress we \ncomplete a budget that includes a specific plan to bring the deficit \ndown to zero by the year 2002, without raiding the Social Security \ntrust funds. No one need force us to do that. It is our job to do that.\n  We propose a 60-vote point of order against any budget that would \ncome to the floor of the Senate that does not do that. We propose to \nset up a supermajority against legislation that would fail to do \nexactly what everyone in this Chamber says we want to do, and that is \nrequire a budget plan to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.\n  That is real medicine. That is not in the sweet by-and-by. That is \nnot posing. That is deciding on a process that will require real \nlifting.\n  Everyone in this Chamber understands, or should, that what happened \nin 1993 probably will not happen again. We won by one vote a $500 \nbillion reduction in the Federal deficit over 5 years. It turned out to \nbe a $600 billion reduction in the accumulated deficits. We carried \nthat by one vote because one side of the aisle decided they would help \nlift, the other side did not. That probably will not happen again.\n  The only way we can achieve progress toward a goal the American \npeople want and a goal the American people know this country needs is \nif every one of us, all of us--Republicans and Democrats, conservatives \nand liberals--decide our goal is 2002, our responsibility is a budget \nplan that is real and enforceable and our determination, our grim \ndetermination is to get there and to do that. This legislation \nestablishes a process that will accomplish that.\n  The question then for Members of the Senate is not a question of \nposing anymore. It is a question of who is going to join together to be \ninvolved in helping balance the budget in a real way.\n  I hope that in the coming days, we will decide as a Senate to adopt \nthis process, which was proposed by the minority leader and I hope will \nbe embraced on a bipartisan basis. The minority leader is saying that \nwe share a common goal and we will come together for a common purpose. \nWe will legislate in a manner that gives this country a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. No excuses. No raiding the Social Security trust \nfunds. No dishonest budgeting. If we do that, this country will have \nbeen well served by all of us working together for a change, and I \nthink that will strengthen America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I rise today to offer \nmy support for the Democratic leadership's balanced budget legislation. \nThis legislation says two things: First, the only budget that Congress \nshould consider is one that contains a plan that will bring us into \nbalance; and second, in bringing our budget into balance, Congress \nshould protect Social Security.\n  Though there is disagreement on whether we need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, there are few who think that we should \nnot be moving toward that goal. And though a few want Social Security \non the budget cutting table, a large majority believe that we ought to \nbalance the budget without using the Social Security trust fund. And so \nI do not see why the legislation that we are talking about today should \nnot gain a huge majority vote in the U.S. Senate.\n  Anyone who voted for the balanced budget amendment, as I did, and \nanyone who believes that we should not balance the budget using Social \nSecurity, as I do, should clearly support this legislation. The \nAmerican people are tired of hearing us endlessly debate the idea of a \nbalanced budget. They want to see us do something to get there. If that \nmeans changing our rules so we cannot consider a budget that is out of \nbalance, then we ought to change our rules. And if that means Democrats \nand Republicans sitting down together to map out the hard cuts we need \nto make, then we ought to sit down together. But make no mistake, we \nwill be held accountable if we let our work toward a balanced budget \nend with the defeat of the balanced budget amendment. I voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment even though it would not take effect for \nyears because I believe that it is imperative we get our Nation's \nfiscal affairs in order. I support this legislation because it does \nsomething right now to force Congress into balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It is my understanding \nthat this proposal will be offered as an amendment on legislation the \nSenate will be considering shortly. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation to put the Federal Government on a \npath toward a balanced budget.\n  The proposal we are introducing today contains elements of an \namendment Senator Exon, the distinguished ranking Democrat on the \nBudget Committee, offered when the Senate considered the congressional \naccountability bill, and an amendment I offered during Senate \nconsideration of the constitutional balanced budget amendment. In my \nopinion this proposal is one of the most sensible ideas ever presented \nto this body. It is sensible because it is more likely to actually \nachieve a balanced Federal budget than the amendment to the \nConstitution considered by the Senate last week and secondly because \nthis proposal is statutory in nature, and thus would not trivialize the \nConstitution with an unenforceable amendment.\n  The proposal we are introducing today would set the Federal budget on \na glide path toward being balanced beginning this year. What this means \nis that, rather than waiting 7 years before acting, as the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment provided for, the Congress \nwould have to begin reducing the deficit this year. Under this glide \npath the Federal budget deficit would be lower every year between now \nand 2002, when the budget presumably would be balanced.\n  If the Budget Committee were to report a budget resolution that did \nnot set us on a glide path toward a balanced budget or that failed to \nachieve a balanced budget by the targeted date, any Member of this body \ncould raise a point of order. It would take 60 votes to overcome this \npoint of order. In comparison, the constitutional balanced budget \namendment failed to provide an enforcement mechanism. If Congress \nfailed to achieve a balanced budget, nothing would happen unless \nCongress passed legislation permitting the courts to enforce the \namendment--a result most proponents of the amendment said would not \noccur.\n  When I offered my amendment as an alternative to the constitutional \namendment, Senator Hatch, the distinguished manager of House Joint \nResolution 1, pointed out that statutory budget restrictions don't work \nbecause they can be overcome by a simple majority vote. However, \nSenator Hatch failed to note that my amendment required 60 votes in \norder to modify or repeal the balanced budget requirement. The very \nsame 60 votes that would have nullified the balanced budget requirement \nof the constitutional amendment. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which \nwe are introducing today, contains the very same 60 vote requirement \nbefore changes could be made.\n  The proposal we are introducing today is also far superior to the \nconstitutional amendment because it addresses some of the very \nlegitimate concerns expressed by Senators during the debate on House \nJoint Resolution 1. For instance, unlike the constitutional amendment, \nthe Social Security trust fund would not be able to be used to mask the \ndeficit. When we say the budget is balanced, it will really be \nbalanced.\n    \n    \n  In addition, our proposal would prevent a minority of Senators from \nsending this country into an economic tailspin. Congress could suspend \nthe balanced budget requirement by passing a joint resolution in a \nfiscal year which CBO identified a period of low-growth--at least 2 \nconsecutive quarters of below zero real economic growth. The \nconstitutional amendment, in comparison, would have allowed 41 Senators \nto stop any effort by the Government to prevent a depression through \nstimulus spending.\n  Mr. President, the people of this country do not expect miracles. \nThey expect us to be sensible, and they expect us to keep faith with \nthem in their demands to get our deficit under control. The beauty of \nthe proposal we are offering today is that we can both achieve a \nbalanced federal budget and save our sacred organic law called the \nConstitution of the United States, which every single one of us held up \nour hand to protect, preserve, and defend when we were sworn into the \nSenate. That did not just mean to protect the Constitution and all the \nrights it provides for the people of this country; it also meant \nprotecting it against trivialization and politicization.\n  There have been over 11,000 efforts to amend the Constitution since \nthis country was founded. Think of it, 11,000. And because of the \neminent good sense of the Congress and people of this country, we have \nonly amended the Constitution on 18 separate occasions, and that \nincludes the Bill of Rights, which was adopted at the same time the \nConstitution was.\n  The only time we have ever attempted to put social policy into the \nConstitution was Prohibition. We found out that you can say as an \namendment to the Constitution everybody will love the Lord, but you \ncannot enforce that. You should not put things that are unenforceable \ninto the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to proceed for \n3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, since last week's vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment I have received calls and letters from people saying, \n``Senator, you are going to be in big trouble if you run for reelection \nin 1998.'' My response is far better that I be in political trouble \nthan the Nation be in big trouble by starting down the path of putting \nevery single whim and caprice that somebody can come up with in some \nnational magazine in the Constitution.\n  The people in this body who do not want the issue for political \npurposes but who really want a balanced budget are not only going to \nsupport the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 when the Senate considers the \nproposal, they are going to support it strongly, because it has teeth \nand it requires action immediately.\n  The people in this country are not interested in all the partisan \nbickering that has taken place in Congress. When it comes to the \ndeficit, they expect the people of this body to hold hands and work \ntogether.\n  I made a chamber of commerce speech the other night. I said the \nbeauty of our system is that while you may not like our politics, the \ntruth of the matter is that we agree on a lot more things than we \ndisagree on.\n  The people on that side of the aisle and the people on this side of \nthe aisle get awfully partisan, almost personal at times. But the truth \nof the matter is where the country is at risk we join \n[[Page S3749]] hands. And every day in the world, we agree on a lot \nmore things than we do not agree on.\n  Mr. President, if there ever was a time when the American people have \na legitimate demand that we join hands and agree on something, it is \nthis deficit. And the proposal we are introducing today does what the \nAmerican people want and it does not tinker or clutter our \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is always good to listen to my \ndistinguished friend from Arkansas. He tells it like it is, and I think \nwe all enjoy his remarks and the manner in which he expresses his \nconvictions. It is very difficult for some of us in this Chamber to be \nas eloquent as he is. We are no less sincere than he is, but his \nsincerity can be put in a way that communicates with all of us.\n  During the debate over the balanced budget amendment, our colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle put forth grand sounding resolutions \nabout how they would balance the budget by a date certain without using \nthe Social Security trust fund to do it. That was all well and good, \nand many Democrats voted in favor of the honorable sounding proposals. \nThe problem is, they did not do anything. Those sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, you know, had no teeth. We could vote for that, go back \nhome, pound our chests and say we voted for it, but it did not mean \nanything. It had no enforcement provisions.\n  Yesterday, several of our colleagues, those who voted for the \nconstitutional amendment and those who voted against the amendment \npassing this Chamber--but all with the same goal, the same end, and \nthat is a balanced budget--said let us start eliminating the deficit, \nget to paying off the debt. As the Senator from Arkansas said, we all \nwant the same thing and the way to get there is here and now. It is not \nlater. We can do it today.\n  So our colleagues yesterday held a press conference. We put forth \nwhat I feel is a real budget balancing piece of legislation. This \nproposal replaces words with action. It calls for a 60-vote point of \norder on any budget resolution that comes before this body that does \nnot lead to a balanced budget by a certain date. This point, a certain \ndate, is important. It may be difficult to get there. But we need, as \nthe Senator from Arkansas said, to tell our constituents that we are \nmaking an honest effort. I have heard my colleagues on the other side \nsay, and in the press, making speeches back in their home States: I \nhave never supported a tax increase in my political career. But now, if \nwe pass this balanced budget amendment, I will start considering tax \nincreases.\n  That tells this Senator--and it does not take a brain surgeon to \nunderstand it, I do not think--they want a gun to their head to balance \nthe budget. Otherwise, they are not going to do it. They are not going \nto lean on this amendment to the Constitution to be that gun to their \nhead to start helping.\n  You can hear a lot of things, but in 1993, when it was a tough vote \nand the hide was coming off politically, we stood here without a \nRepublican; 50 of us voted, and the Vice President of the United States \nbroke that tie. We reduced the deficit over $600 billion, and we did it \nwithout any help of those who proposed a constitutional amendment. That \nproves that the body can, with a capital C--do it.\n  Now, all we have to say is let us get down to it; pass this amendment \nand say every year, every year, every year the deficit has to be less \nthan it was the year before.\n  With or without a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, Mr. \nPresident, we the Congress must still act to implement it. We have the \npower to achieve the desired goal right now. We do not have to wait \nuntil 38 States ratify an amendment. We do not have to wait until 2005, \nif they do not ratify it until 2003. We can start right now.\n  So let us use that power that the people placed in our hands. Our \nproposal would force this action--and I underscore force this action. \nIf the constitutional amendment would force that Republican who made \nthe speech, that he would now consider increased taxes if you have the \nbalanced budget amendment in the Constitution, why do we not have the \nintestinal fortitude to do it now?\n  Our proposal would force this action and get on the path to what we \nall want. As the Senator from Arkansas said, we all agree on more \nthings than we disagree on. Already this morning, I have seen reports \nthat suggested our colleagues from the other side of the aisle have \nalready labeled our actions that we took yesterday and are attempting \nto take here as just another political ploy--just another political \nploy.\n  Vote for this amendment and see if it is a political ploy. See if we \ndo not start on the right path to get a balanced budget. And we will \ncome closer by this action today, or tomorrow, than we would have had \nwe voted for a balanced budget amendment and waited for the States to \nratify it. Try us. That is all I ask. If you think this is a political \nploy: Try us. Vote for it and see what happens.\n  I hope they do not mean this, that it is a political ploy. I truly \nbelieve that this amendment will do what everybody in this Chamber \ntalks about but we do not have the right kind of action on, such action \nas this is, to achieve a balanced budget. If they do not join us in \nthis effort, we will never get to a balanced budget. This can be the \nmost political of all actions, trying to take the issue--trying to take \nthe issue.\n  I said last evening that before the vote in the hearts of some of \nthose on the other side of the aisle, and at the national committee, \nthey hope it fails because they want the issue. Boy, it did not take 24 \nhours to find out they wanted that issue. I want to tell you. My phone \ncalls are still the same. They are still better than 50 percent. If you \ncount the votes, you win by better than 50 percent. You do not lose. So \nI am still getting more thanking me than those saying you are out of \nhere. They are going to get a chance, I guess, to tell me more in the \nnext few years. But let us not take the issue. Let us take the action. \nThe action is necessary to actually balance the budget.\n  So if this is a political ploy, I say again, Mr. President, try us. \nVote for this amendment. Let us start doing something right and leave \nSocial Security alone. I was here in 1983. We made a hard decision \nthen. I think it would have been very, very tough on any of us to vote \nin 1983 to say in 12 years we are going to take this tax that we are \ntaking out of the pockets of the employees and the employers to pay for \nforeign aid and welfare, and to attempt to do all these other things.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that all our colleagues will join on this \nand not say that it is just anther political ploy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 520. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable tax credit for adoption expenses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                the adoption assistance for families act\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nhelp strengthen the role of the family in America. With the hustle and \nbustle of the world today, we sometimes overlook simple, commonsense \nways to help one another. My bill, entitled ``Adoption Assistance for \nFamilies Act,'' would effectively find homes for children who need \nparents and find children for parents who need families. Mr. President, \nthe objective of my legislation is to provide an appropriate and \nreasonable incentive to encourage a policy which should be embraced by \nall Americans.\n  Adoption is a positive action that benefits everyone involved. \nObviously, a loving, caring family is the primary benefit of adoption. \nStudies show the child also receives a strong self identity, positive \npsychological health and a tendency of financial well-being.\n  On the other hand, parents who adopt children also benefit. They \nreceive the joy and responsibility of raising a child as well as the \nlove and respect only a child can give. The emotional fulfillment of \nraising children clearly contribute to the fullness of life.\n  Lastly, do not forget society. Society is unambiguously better off as \na result of adoption. Statistics show time and again that children with \nfamilies intact are more likely to become productive members of society \nthan children without both parents.\n  Unfortunately more times than not, a financial barrier stands in the \nway of otherwise qualified parents-to-be. The monthly costs of \nsupporting the child \n[[Page S3750]] is not the hurdle, but instead the initial outlay. Many \npeople may not realize, but there are many fees and costs involved with \nadopting a child. These include: maternity home care, normal prenatal \nand hospital care for the mother and child, preadoption foster care for \nthe infant, home study fees, and legal fees. These costs can range \nanywhere from about $13,000 to $36,000 according to the National \nCouncil for Adoption.\n  Just like the person who wants to buy a home, but cannot because the \nfinancial hurdle of a downpayment stops them, so are the parents-to-be \nwho cannot adopt a child because of the substantial initial fees, fees \nthat could actually exceed the cost of a downpayment for a house. As a \nresult, the benefits to everyone involved never materialize; children \ndo not receive loving parents and married couples are prohibited from \nwelcoming children into their compassionate family.\n  My bill seeks to address this problem. The Adoption Assistance for \nFamilies Act would allow a $5,000 refundable tax credit for adoption \nexpenses. This credit would be fully available to any individual with \nan income up to $60,000 and phased out up to an income of $100,000.\n  I believe this tax credit will go a long way in helping children find \nthe caring homes they so desperately need. This legislation would \nundeniably benefit children, parents, and society as a whole. Mr. \nPresident, I hope my colleagues will join me in reaching out to \nfamilies in order to provide a better, brighter future for our children \nand a heightened degree of appreciation for the potential life holds.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 521. A bill entitled ``the Small Business Enhancement Act of \n1995''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the small business enhancement act of 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce a package of legislation \nto meet the needs of America's small businesses. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will help these small businesses by extending a tax \ndeduction for health care coverage, requiring an estimate of the cost \nof bills on small businesses before Congresses passes those costs, and \nassign an Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business.\n  In order to create jobs both in my home State of Maine and across \nAmerica, we must nurture small businesses, because small business is \nthe engine of our economy. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees make \nup more than 85 percent of Maine's jobs, and nationally, small \nbusinesses employ 54 percent of the private work force. In 1993, small \nbusinesses created an estimated 71 percent of the 1.9 million new jobs. \nWhen we call small business the ``engine'' of our economy, we mean it: \nand America's small businesses are jump-starting our economy.\n  Small businesses are the most successful tool for job creation that \nwe have. They provide two-thirds of the initial job opportunities in \nthis country, and are the original--and finest--job training program. \nUnfortunately, as much as small businesses help our own economy--and \nthe Federal Government--by creating jobs and building economic growth, \nGovernment too often gets in the way. Instead of fueling small \nbusiness, Government too often stalls our small business efforts.\n  Government regulations and redtape add up to more than a billion \nhours of paperwork time by small businesses each year, according to the \nSmall Business Administration. Moreover, because of the size of some of \nthe largest American corporations, U.S. commerce officials too often \ndevote a disproportionate amount of time to the needs and jobs in \ncorporate America rather than in small businesses.\n  My legislation will address three aspects of our Nation's laws on \nsmall businesses, and I hope it will both encourage small business \nexpansion and fuel job creation.\n  First, this legislation will allow self-employed small businessmen \nand women to fully deduct their health care costs for income tax \npurposes. This provision will place these entrepreneurs on equal\n footing with larger companies by eliminating a provision in current \nlaw that limits deductions to 25 percent of the overall cost. In \naddition, the legislation makes the tax deduction permanent. At a time \nwhen America is facing challenges to its health care system, and the \nFederal Government is seeking remedies to the problem of uninsured \ncitizens, this provision will help self-employed business people to \nafford health insurance without imposing a costly and unnecessary \nmandate.\n\n  From investors to start-up businesses, self-employed workers make up \nan important and vibrant part of the small business sector--and too \noften they are forgotten in providing benefits and assistance. Indeed, \n11 percent of uninsured workers in America are self-employed. By \nextending tax credits for health insurance to these small businesses, \nwe will help to provide health care coverage to millions of Americans.\n  I am pleased that the Committee on Ways and Means in the U.S. House \nof Representatives has decided to report out a bill restoring the 25-\npercent tax deduction retroactively. This decision will allow self-\nemployed small business people to deduct health care costs on their \n1994 tax returns. I can think of no better incentive for small \nbusinesses than a positive action of this nature.\n  Earlier this month, I joined 74 of my colleagues in writing to the \nSenate leadership urging quick consideration of this issue once it is \ntransmitted to the Senate from the other body. I remain committed to \nworking with the leadership to restore this crucial provision.\n  My legislation will also require a cost analysis of legislative \nproposals before new requirements are passed on to small business. Too \noften, Congress passes well-intended programs that shift the costs of \nprograms to small businesses. The proposal will ensure that these \nunintended consequences are not passed along to small businesses. \nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small business \nowners spend at least 1 billion hours a year preparing Government \nforms, at an annual cost that exceeds $100 billion. Before we place yet \nanother obstacle in the path of small business job creation, we should \nunderstand the costs our plans will impose on small businesses.\n  The legislation will require the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice to prepare for each committee an analysis of the costs to small \nbusinesses that would be incurred in carrying out proposals contained \nin new legislation. This cost analysis will include an estimate of \ncosts incurred in carrying out the bill or resolution for a 4-year \nperiod, as well as an estimate of the portion of these costs that would \nbe borne by small businesses. This provision will allow us to fully \nconsider the impact of our actions on small businesses--and through \ncareful planning, we will succeed in avoiding unintended costs.\n  Finally, this legislation will direct the U.S. Trade Representative \nto establish a position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nSmall Business. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is \noverburdened, and too often overlooks the needs of small business. The \nnew Assistant U.S. Trade Representative will promote exports by small \nbusinesses and work to remove foreign impediments to these exports.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that this legislation will truly assist \nsmall businesses, resulting not only in additional entrepreneurial \nopportunities but especially in new jobs. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hatch, \n        and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 523. A bill to amend the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act \nto authorize additional measures to carry out the control of salinity \nupstream of Imperial Dam in a cost-effective manner, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the colorado river basin salinity control act amendments act of 1995\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which \nwill amend the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act and authorize \nadditional measures to carry out the salinity program. During the last \nsession of Congress, this noncontroversial bill passed the Senate \nEnergy Committee; \n[[Page S3751]] however, the legislation was stalled in a log jam in the \nclosing days of the session. I am hopeful we will be able to move this \nbill early in this session of Congress.\n  The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program has been authorized \nby Congress and implemented by Federal and State entities for the last \n20 years. There is now a need to update and revise the authorizations \nprovided for in the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act so that \nthe Bureau of Reclamation [Reclamation] can move ahead in a more \nresponsive and cost-effective way with the portion of the program which \nReclamation is responsible for administering. The following statement \nprovides general background as to the purposes and legislative history \nof the Salinity Control Act and the identified reforms necessary to the \nact.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n  In the 1960's and early 1970's, rising salinity levels in the Lower \nColorado River caused great concern because of damages inflicted by \nsalt dissolved in the water. This damage was occurring in the United \nStates and Mexico. In 1972, with the passage of the Clean Water Act, it \nwas apparent that water quality standards needed to be adopted in the \nUnited States, and a plan of implementation to meet those water quality \nstandards needed to be identified. The U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency [EPA] published water quality standards for the Colorado River. \nThe United States modified the treaty with Mexico to add to the United \nStates commitments a water quality parameter.\n  The Colorado River Basin States were involved in many of the \ndiscussions with respect to both the Mexico commitment and the water \nquality standards. Through the formation of a Colorado River Basin \nSalinity Control Forum, the States became collectively and formally \ninvolved in discussions with Federal representatives concerning the \nquality of the Colorado River.\n  At the urging and with the cooperation of the basin States and the \nState Department in 1974, the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act \nwas enacted by Congress. That authority became formally known as Public \nLaw 93-320 (88 Stat. 266), the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control \nAct. That act consisted of two titles. Title I addressed the United \nStates commitment to Mexico, and title II addressed the authorization \nfor programs above Imperial Dam to help control the water quality in \nthe river for the benefit of users in the United States.\n  The amendments now being proposed in this legislation are exclusively \nrelated to title II authorizations. Title I has not been amended since \nthe original enactment in 1974. Title II has received minor \nmodifications as authorities were given to Reclamation to consider \nsalinity control implementation strategies in some additional areas of \nthe Colorado River Basin. More importantly, title II was amended in \n1984 by Public Law 98-569 (98 Stat. 2933). The 1984 amendments provided \nfor a formally constituted U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] \nprogram within the Salinity Control Act. The amendments gave additional \nresponsibilities to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management [BLM] to seek \ncost-effective salinity control strategies. The amendments further \ndescribed the basin States' cost-sharing responsibilities with respect \nto the USDA program, and further increased the cost-sharing \nrequirements of the basin States with respect to newly authorized and \nimplemented Reclamation programs.\n\n\n                             Needed Reforms\n\n  The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum [Forum] has perceived \nfor some period of time the need for amendments to the authorization \nrelating to Reclamation's program. It has been felt by the States that \nthe program has, at times, been encumbered by formalities imposed by \nReclamation and the authorizing legislation which related to procedures \nReclamation used in implementing major water development projects in \ndecades past. It is felt that authorization which would allow \nReclamation to avoid some of these encumbrances and move more \nexpediently and cost effectively to the best salinity control \nopportunities would ensure compliance with the water quality standards \nof the Colorado River, and this compliance could be accomplished at \nless cost.\n  There is a need to allow Reclamation to consider salinity control \nstrategy implementation in three geographic areas where planning \ndocuments have been prepared and cost-effective salinity control \nstrategies have been identified. In the past, for Reclamation to \nimplement salinity strategies in new areas, formal approval by Congress \nhas been required. It is viewed that this is encumbering.\n  Further, it is felt that Reclamation needs flexibility so that it \nmight move to opportunities with the private sector to cost-share, \noffer grants, and/or allow the private sector, rather than the Federal \nGovernment to contract for the expenditure of appropriated funds. In \nthis manner the limited dollars would not be partially lost through \nexpenses which have been directly identified with the use of Federal \nprocurement procedures.\n  Last, Reclamation was authorized a ceiling expenditure in 1974 by \nCongress. After two decades, the funds expended are approaching the \nauthorized ceiling. It is believed that it would be more appropriate \nfor a $75 million authorization provision to be placed on the program. \nThis will allow the salinity program to move forward for approximately \n3 to 5 years at proposed spending levels.\n  The Salinity Forum believes that legislative reform for the \nReclamation program would be tailored after authorities given to the \nUSDA by the Congress in 1984. The inspector general for the Department \nof the Interior released findings in 1993. Those findings are \nincorporated in a document entitled, ``Audit Report, Implementation of \nthe Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program, Bureau of \nReclamation'', March 1993. The above legislation proposals are in \nkeeping with the recommendations of the inspector general.\n  Last year, Reclamation sent out a broad-based mailing to affected \nparties and interest groups asking for recommendations concerning the \nneed for potential future efforts by Reclamation with respect to \nsalinity control. Further, Reclamation asked for input as to how the \nprogram might possibly be reformulated. The responses received by \nReclamation are in keeping with this legislation, and it is my \nunderstanding that the Bureau of Reclamation is expected to support \nthis legislation again this year.\n  To that end, I appreciate the excellent working relationship that has \nexisted between my office, the Commissioner's Office of the Bureau of \nReclamation, and the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit insurers from denying health insurance \ncoverage, benefits, or varying premiums based on the status of an \nindividual as a victim of domestic violence and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          the victims of abuse access to health insurance act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President today I am introducing the Victims of \nAbuse Access to Health Insurance Act. This bill would outlaw the \npractice of denying health insurance coverage to victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  In Minnesota three insurance companies denied health insurance to \nentire women's shelter because ``as a battered women's program we were \nhigh risk.'' The women's shelter in Rochester was told that it was \nconsidered uninsurable because its employees are almost all battered \nwomen.\n  A woman sought the services of Women House in St. Cloud because the \nabuse during her 12-year marriage had escalated to such an extent that \nshe was hospitalized for a broken jaw and spent 2 weeks in a mental \nhealth unit of a hospital. She was subsequently denied coverage by two \ninsurance companies--one said they would not cover any medical or \npsychiatric problems that could be related to the past abuse.\n  These are just a couple examples of women who have been physically \nabused and sought proper medical care only to be turned away by \ninsurance companies who say they are too high of a risk to insure.\n  Victims of domestic violence are being denied health insurance \ncoverage. This is a abhorrent practice. It is plain old-fashioned \ndiscrimination. It is profoundly unjust and wrong. And, it is the worst \nof blaming the victim.\n  We must treat domestic violence as the crime that it is--not as \nvoluntary risky behavior that can be easily changed and not as a pre-\nexisting condition. Insurance company policies that deny coverage to \nvictims only serve to perpetuate the myth that the victims are somehow \nresponsible for their abuse.\n  Domestic violence is the single largest threat to women's health. \nDenying women access to much needed health care must be stopped.\n  The Victims of Abuse Access to Health Insurance Act is a very simple \nand straightforward bill. It would prohibit insurance companies from \n``engaging in a practice that has the effect of denying, canceling, or \nlimiting health insurance coverage or health benefits, or establishing, \nincreasing or varying the premium charged for the coverage or \nbenefits'' for\n victims of domestic violence.\n\n  It would prohibit insurance companies from considering domestic \nviolence as a preexisting condition. Under the bill, domestic violence \nis defined as any violent act against a current or former member of the \nfamily or household, or someone with whom there has been or is an \nintimate relationship. This could mean spouse, partner, lover, \nboyfriend, or children. If an insurance company, or even a company that \nis large enough to self-insure, violates this act it could be held \ncivilly and criminally liable.\n  Reporting domestic violence and seeking medical help is often the \nfirst step in ending the cycle. Oftentimes health care providers are \nthe first, and sometimes the only, professionals in a position to \nrecognize violence in their patient's lives. Battered women should be \nencouraged to seek medical help. We should not be discouraging this by \nallowing insurance companies to use this information against them. \nWomen should not have to fear that when they take that first step they \ncould lose their access to treatment.\n  Doctors and other health care providers need to be encouraged to \nproperly diagnose, treat, and document domestic violence. Denial of \nhealth insurance coverage will cause doctors not to document it \naccurately if only to protect the victim.\n  Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women, more \ncommon than auto accidents, muggings, and rapes by a stranger combined. \nIt is the No. 1 reason women go to emergency rooms. And research \nindicates that violence against women escalates during pregnancy.\n  Last year during the health care reform debate, I raised this issue \nin the context of requiring insurance companies to make insurance \navailable to all people who wanted it. We should certainly all be \nmoving toward that goal. However, this is a real immediate need and it \nmust be addressed.\n  Last year Congress passed the first most comprehensive package of \nlegislation to address gender based violence--the Violence Against \nWomen Act. It was a great step forward in stopping the cycle of \nviolence. But, it is not enough. We cannot stop at reforming and \nimproving the judicial system and think it will solve the problem. The \nentire community must be involved in the solution--we all must be \ninvolved in stopping the cycle of violence.\n  Insurance companies should not be allowed to discriminate against \nanyone for being a victim of domestic violence. This is an abhorrent \npractice and should be prohibited.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Victims of Abuse \nAccess to Health Insurance Act, and I commend Senator Wellstone for \nintroducing it. This needed legislation will prohibit insurers from \ndenying health insurance coverage, benefits, or premiums to victims of \ndomestic abuse. Enactment of this measure is an essential step in the \nstruggle to combat domestic violence and to assist women and children \nwho are its victims.\n  Violence against women has reached epidemic proportions. Nationwide a \nwoman is beaten every 18 seconds. A woman is raped every 5 minutes. \nMore than 1 million women across the country are victims of reported \ncrimes of domestic violence; 3 million more such crimes go unreported.\n  Last year, as part of the omnibus crime bill, Congress passed the \nViolence Against Women Act. In doing so, we established new Federal \npenalties for spouse abusers, provided a civil rights cause of action \nfor gender-motivated crimes of violence, and authorized funds for \nservices for victims, including victim counselors, battered women's \nshelters, rape crisis centers, and a national domestic violence toll-\nfree hotline.\n  By enacting that law, Congress made a strong commitment to do more to \nhelp the victims of domestic violence. We encouraged them to report \ntheir abusers, and to seek assistance. We gave them new means to help \nthem protect themselves. And now, with this legislation, we must tell \nthem that they will not be denied health insurance for doing what is \nnecessary to protect themselves and their children.\n  Insurance companies that refuse to cover battered women commit an \ninjustice to those women and to society. Denial of health insurance to \nvictims of domestic violence is discrimination against women and \nchildren. It is another way to blame and punish the victim, while \nletting the abuser go free. Allowing this discrimination tacitly \nendorses it--and endorses the myth that victims of domestic abuse are \nresponsible for the violence committed against them.\n  Denying such insurance also discourages victims of domestic abuse \nfrom reporting the crimes against them and from leaving their abusers \nand seeking help. It discourages victims from seeking medical treatment \nfor injuries inflicted by their abusers. For countless Americans, \nhealth insurance is the only realistic means of obtaining access to \nhealth care. The loss of health care for themselves and their children \nis enough to intimidate many victims into staying in abusive \nenvironments and keeping silent.\n  We must not condone any practice which makes it harder for women to \nleave their abusers or deters them from reporting the crimes against \nthem and their children. We must not condone any practice which \npunishes women for seeking medical treatment for themselves and their \nchildren, for seeking safety from violence, or for speaking out against \nthe crimes committed against them. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \npromote its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Pressler):\n  S. 525. A bill to ensure equity in, and increased recreation and \nmaximum economic benefits from, the control of the water in the \nMissouri River system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the missouri river water control equity act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will not speak for the full 25 minutes; \nit will be 10 or 15 minutes. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. Mr. \nPresident, I rise this morning with my colleagues from North Dakota and \nSouth Dakota to discuss the Army Corps of Engineers and particularly \nthe Missouri River system.\n  We are here today to make our side of the story known on what is \ncalled the Preferred Alternative to the Missouri River Master Water \nControl Manual. That sounds very technical, but it is really about the \nheart and soul of our State of Montana. Let me explain.\n\n\n                     montana and the missouri river\n\n  It is difficult to describe what the Missouri River means to Montana. \nPeople across the country may be familiar with the writer Norman \nMaclean's book ``A River Runs Through It.'' He grew up in Missoula, and \nthe title refers to the Big Blackfoot on the western side of the \nDivide. But for so many of us growing up east of the Continental \nDivide, the river is the Missouri.\n  This river was part of our life before we became a State. Our \nattachment to Missouri began eight decades before statehood, when Lewis \nand Clark came up in their boats way back in 1805.\n  I grew up in the Helena Valley. My parents and friends--my friends \nand I, in particular, spent our summers swimming in Holter Lake by my \nfamily's ranch on the Missouri. Sometimes in Hauser Lake, sometimes \nCanyon Ferry. Is it impossible to imagine Montana without lie on the \nMissouri River.\n  The Missouri is where farmers get water for their crops; where \nranchers take their stock to drink; where sportsmen take the weekend to \ngo rafting or fishing. It comes up through Broadwater and Lewis and \nClark Counties, Great Falls, and Fort Benton, and runs all the way \nthrough the State to the Fort Peck Dam and the North Dakota line.\n  So when people at the Army Corps of Engineers headquarters in \nWashington, DC, or St. Louis, or Omaha, decide how high the reservoirs \nwill be, how much water we will have for irrigation, or whether we can \ndock our boats at Fort Peck, it is an emotional, important decision \nthat affects us.\n\n\n                          the 1987-92 drought\n\n  That would be true even if they at corps made good decisions. but up \nto now, most of the decisions have not been good. They have been bad--\nvery bad.\n  We were hit by a big drought a few years ago that lasted 6 years, \nfrom 1987 \n[[Page S3754]] to 1992. During most of that drought, the corps did \nabsolutely nothing to help us out. It stuck like a leech to the status \nquo. Everything for irrigation down river, almost nothing for \nrecreation up river. One drawdown after another--drawdown during a \ndrought--when we had no rain to refill our reservoirs.\n  Our lake levels fell dramatically. At Fort Peck, the lake shore \nreceded until it was more than a mile from many boat ramps. Weeds were \ngrowing in fields by the docks. This picture to my left will give you \nan idea of the wreckage. At that point, I and other Montanans decided \nwe had enough, we were not going to take any more. We needed the corps \nto go back to the book and make basic changes.\n\n\n                 traditional corps management mistaken\n\n  Well, why did the corps allow this disaster to take place? Because \nthe corps has traditionally given the maximum preference to barge \ntraffic down river, which makes no sense.\n  According to the corps' own numbers, navigation is worth only about \n$15 million a year. Many experts think even that is too high. \nRecreation and tourism, according to the corps' own numbers, bring in \nmuch more--about $77 million annually, which is five times the value of \nnavigation.\n  For years, the corps said the law required this approach. They said, \nthat is the law, you have to do it. But again, the corps is wrong--dead \nwrong.\n  As the General Accounting Office testified at a hearing I held in \nGlendive, MT, last year:\n\n       Contrary to what the Corps believed, Federal statutes\n        do not require the Corps to give recreation a lower \n     priority than other project purposes--flood control, \n     navigation, irrigation, and the generation of \n     hydroelectric power--in major decisions about water \n     releases.\n\n\n                    new master manual is inadequate\n\n  For years, I urged the corps to update its operating plan for the \nMissouri River. The draft of the new preferred alternative operating \nplan is a step in the right direction.\n  But I am sorry to say it is not good enough. It is not much more than \na rehash of the status quo. It continues to give recreation the lowest \npriority, even though recreation yields the most economic benefits. It \nignores the need to raise permanent reservoir levels, and it ignores \nerosion below Fort Peck Dam. Let me examine these issues one by one.\n\n\n            disproportionate benefits for lower basin states\n\n  The first is simple fairness.\n  The four upper basin States receive about $358 million, or 32 percent \nof the benefits, from river management. Lower basin States get $756 \nmillion, or 68 percent of benefits. As for Montana, we receive only \nabout 4 percent--not even a nickel of each dollar--of all of the \neconomic benefits of the Missouri River system. The preferred \nalternative will not change that.\n  As you can see from this chart, it will mean that 32 percent for the \nupper basin States and 68 percent for the lower basin States. That is \nthe allocation; no change, which is obviously unfair.\n\n\n                     recreation too low a priority\n\n  Second, the corps still values navigation over recreation. That is \nbackwards. Navigation is worth only 1 percent of the river system's \neconomic benefits. One percent. Recreation brings in more. It is more \nthan just pleasure boating, it is jobs. Recreation is therefore more \nvaluable to the country, and it should be a much higher priority.\n  As I mentioned earlier, recreation benefits, overall, are five times \nnavigation benefits. The corps undervalued recreation in its Master \nManual Review. According to the corps, the average visitor to a corps \nreservoir spends about $7 a day. But the Sports Fishing Institute found \nthat the amount spent for walleye fishing, for example, is $45 a day. \nAnd at Fort Peck, the average was $69 a day. The corps' figures do not \nadd up.\n                   minimum pool level must be higher\n\n  Third, the new plan does not change reservoir levels. The minimum \npool level, below which the corps will not release water in a drought, \nis now 18 million acre-feet. At that level, weeds grow on the bed of \nFort Peck Reservoir. Boat ramps are high and dry a mile from shore. \nUnder the preferred alternative, the minimum pool level is still 18 \nmillion acre-feet.\n  The right level should be 44 million acre-feet. The master manual \nenvironmental impact statement prepared by the corps states that 44 \nmillion--not 18--44 million acre-feet yields the greatest economic \nbenefit to the Missouri basin States. Repeating that, 44 million acre-\nfeet yields the greatest economic benefit to the Missouri basin States. \nSpecifically, it adds $1.28 million to the regional economy.\n  As you can see from the chart on my left, those numbers speak for \nthemselves. And that level would benefit the environment and the \nquality of life--things we cannot estimate in cold cash, but which are \nmore important in Montana than I can tell you.\n  River management requires compromise, and we understand that. \nDownstream States have not understand that in the past. They wanted to \nstone wall. They wanted everything, and they have usually gotten it in \nthe past. But the problems remain. We pledge to work with our friends \ndownstream to find a fair solution.\n  I can tell you now, Mr. President, that anything under 44 million \nacre-feet is unacceptable, and anything that gives navigation more than \nits fair share will not fly.\n\n\n                plan is inadequate in combating erosion\n\n  Finally, the plan ignores erosion. Before we completed Fort Peck Dam \nin 1940, there was virtually no erosion anywhere along the river, from \nwhat is now the dam to Lake Sakakawea. Since then, 4,935 acres of prime \nfarm land have eroded away, washed down to North Dakota by explosive \nreleases from the Fort Peck Reservoir. And the corps itself predicts in \nthe next 50 years, erosion will cost us another 4,500 acres.\n  Talk about taking private property without compensation. Here is an \nexample. The farmers in Montana have received no compensation for what \nthey have lost. And the corps has done nothing to stop further erosion. \nIn the 54 years we have had the Fort Peck Dam, the corps has built \none--just one--streambank stabilization project in Montana.\n  That defies common sense. It defies good policy. And it defies the \nlaw. The Water Resources Development Act of 1990 requires the corps to \nspend $3 million every year to perform streambank stabilization.\n And under the preferred alternative, there will be more releases, not \nfewer. It is no better--in fact, it is worse--than the status quo.\n\n\n                             fdr's promise\n\n  Plain and simple, the corps must do better. It is time the corps kept \nthe old promise that the river would be managed for everybody.\n  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt made that promise to us. He came \nto Fort Peck 4 years before I was born. In those days, few Montanans \nowned cars. The Depression had us flat on our back. Twenty-eight \nMontana counties applied for aid from the Red Cross. We have only 56 \ncounties in the entire State. North of Fort Peck, in Daniels County, \n3,500 of the county's 5,000 citizens were on Federal relief--3,500 of \nthe county's 5,000 citizens were on relief.\n  But even so, 20,000 Montanans came out to see their President. FDR \nstood under the massive wooden scaffold they put up to build the dam. \nAnd he said:\n\n       The Nation has understood that we are building for future \n     generations of our children and grandchildren, and that in \n     the greater part of what we have done, the money spent is an \n     investment which will come back a thousand-fold in the coming \n     years.\n\n  We believed him. We put in the investment. Montana farmers gave up \n250,000 acres of prime riverbottom land. But very little of it--forget \n``a thousand-fold''--has returned.\n  Year after year, for six decades, the corps has betrayed FDR's \npromise. We are sick and tired of it. It is time to put it right.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  I am sorry if I have gotten a little emotional about this. But when \nit comes to keeping Montana's water in Montana, most of us get \nemotional. And I do want to recognize the progress the corps has made.\n  Ken Byerly, the editor emeritus of the Lewistown News Argus, once \nwrote that ``solving this problem is like eating an elephant; you take \nit one bite at a time.''\n  We have taken some bites already. About 4 years ago, the late Senator \n\n[[Page S3755]] Quentin Burdick and I convinced the corps to admit that \nthe basic manual--a work drafted in the 1950's, before the Interstate \nHighway System made barge traffic more or less obsolete--had to be \nredone to meet the needs of the 1990's.\n  But the corps has not spent a penny. Instead, it orders releases of \nwater that increase erosion.\n  In 1993, at our hearing in Glendive, Colonel Schaufelberger, who was \nthe commander of the Missouri River Division of the corps at that time, \nsomewhat sheepishly agreed that the corps' lawyers had been wrong. \nFederal laws actually do let the corps consider recreation on an equal \nbasis with navigation and other uses. I ask unanimous consent that an \nexcerpt of his testimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excerpt From a Hearing Before the Committee on Environment and Public \n                         Works, October 1, 1993\n\n       Senator Baucus. * * *\n       I would like to begin with Mr. Duffus. You state in your \n     report that there is no legal requirement that the Corps give \n     preference to navigation over recreation; in fact, you state \n     in your report that recreation must be given at least equal \n     status to navigation. That is, the law makes that clear, in \n     GAO's judgment, that recreation has equal status compared \n     with navigation. Is that correct?\n       Mr. Duffus. That's correct, Mr. Chairman.\n       Senator Baucus. And what do you base that on? Is that just \n     your reading of the statute? What's the reason for that?\n       Mr. Duffus. The basis for the Corps' categorization of \n     project purposes as primary or secondary rose out of their \n     conclusion that if a project purpose was not identified and \n     had cost allocated to it, then it was not primary, it was \n     secondary. It had to be relegated to a secondary purpose. In \n     documents that they sent up to the Congress when the project \n     was authorized in 1994 and approved, recreation was not \n     allocated any cost. So it was on that basis that the Corps \n     came to the conclusion that recreation was a secondary \n     purpose.\n       Our review of the statute and our review of the legislative \n     history found no basis for that.\n       Senator Baucus. Colonel, do you agree that there is nothing \n     in the law that requires navigation to be given preference \n     over recreation--or to ask the same question turned around, \n     that the law in fact requires that equal emphasis be given to \n     recreation as compared to navigation?\n       Colonel Schaufelberger. Sir, the law does not discriminate. \n     The law says in the purposes of the reservoirs--and they are \n     enunciated--there is no priority established. So there is \n     nothing in the law that says there has to be one priority \n     over the other. The only priority established in the law is \n     the O'Mahoney-Milliken amendment, which specifies that \n     consumptive use has priority over other purposes. That's the \n     only priority that I'm aware of that is specified by law.\n       Senator Baucus. But there is nothing in the law that gives \n     preference to navigation over recreation?\n       Colonel Schaufelberger. That is correct, there is nothing \n     in the law.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And today I am introducing a bill entitled the ``Missouri \nRiver Water Control Equity Act.'' It will balance the equities between \nthe upper and lower basin States. It will require a greater emphasis on \nrecreation. And it will ensure that common sense, not pork-barrel \npolitics, determine how the Missouri River is run.\n  It may seem unimportant compared to many bills before the Congress. \nBut it means everything to Montanans. We have a lot of elephant steak \nleft to fry, but we are firing up the grill and we are determined to \nmake progress.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleagues, \nparticularly the distinguished minority leader and also my very good \nfriend, the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, for joining me \nhere today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 525\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1 SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Missouri River Water Control \n     Equity Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) gross revenues from recreation on the Missouri River \n     system are estimated by the Army Corps of Engineers to be \n     $77,000,000 annually;\n       (2) gross revenues from navigation on the Missouri River \n     system are estimated by the Army Corps of Engineers to be \n     $15,000,000 annually;\n       (3) barge traffic produces only 1 percent of the annual net \n     revenue that derives from the operation of the Missouri River \n     system;\n       (4) the Army Corps of Engineers requires 18,000,000 acre-\n     feet of water to remain in the reservoirs of the Missouri \n     River system;\n       (5) maximum economic benefits for the Missouri River system \n     are estimated by the Army Corps of Engineers to be achieved \n     if 44,000,000 acre-feet of water are maintained in the \n     reservoirs of the Missouri River system;\n       (6) the recreation industry along the Missouri River has \n     been stifled by drawdowns of the reservoirs of the Missouri \n     River system during drought periods;\n       (7) barge traffic on the Missouri River has steadily \n     decreased since 1977 so that currently the quantity of cargo \n     shipped on the Missouri River is only 1,400,000 tons \n     annually;\n       (8) the States of Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska \n     receive 68 percent of the total economic benefits of the \n     Missouri River system; and\n       (9) the States of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \n     Wyoming receive only 32 percent of the total economic \n     benefits of the Missouri River system.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the States of Montana, North Dakota, \n     South Dakota, and Wyoming receive an equitable portion of the \n     economic benefits from the operation of the Missouri River \n     system;\n       (2) to encourage the development of the recreation industry \n     along the Missouri River;\n       (3) to maximize the economic benefits to the United States \n     of the operation of the Missouri River system; and\n       (4) to phase out navigation, which is the least productive \n     use of the Missouri River system, in order to increase the \n     productivity of other competing uses of the system such as \n     hydropower and flood protection.\n\n     SEC. 4. MINIMUM POOL LEVELS.\n\n       (a) Missouri River System.--The Secretary of the Army, \n     acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army having \n     responsibility for civil works (referred to in this Act as \n     the ``Secretary''), shall not permit the permanent pool \n     levels in the Missouri River system to fall below 44,000,000 \n     acre-feet at any time unless the Secretary makes a finding \n     that a lower level is required to provide necessary--\n       (1) emergency flood control to protect human life and \n     property;\n       (2) hydropower; or\n       (3) water supply.\n       (b) Fort Peck Lake.--The Secretary shall not permit the \n     permanent pool level in Fort Peck Lake to fall below \n     12,000,000 acre-feet (which is equivalent to an elevation of \n     2,220 feet) at any time unless the Secretary makes a finding \n     that a lower level is required to provide necessary--\n       (1) emergency flood control to protect human life and \n     property;\n       (2) hydropower; or\n       (3) water supply.\n\n     SEC. 5. NAVIGATION DEAUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Transition Provision.--The Secretary shall decrease the \n     length of the first navigation season that begins after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and each navigation season \n     thereafter, by 30 days from the length of the previous \n     navigation season, until such time as the navigation season \n     for the Missouri River is eliminated.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Beginning on the day after the end of the \n     last navigation season under subsection (a), the Secretary \n     may not authorize a program, project, or activity that \n     involves navigation on the Missouri River.\n\n     SEC. 6. MITIGATION OF EROSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than January 1, 1997, the \n     Secretary shall develop and implement a plan to mitigate \n     streamback and reservoir erosion caused by the operations of \n     the Missouri River system.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the plan developed under \n     subsection (a) $20,000,000 for each fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to salute the Senator from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, for his leadership on this subject. The \nSenator from Montana has been an absolute champion for our part of the \ncountry in trying to get fair treatment and equity with respect to the \nmanagement of the mainstream reservoirs. He has been absolutely \ndetermined and dedicated to achieving a fair result.\n  I can remember very well when the Senator from Montana and I teamed \nup to stop the appointment of a new head of the Corps of Engineers \nuntil our part of the country got fair treatment in the depths of the \nworst drought we had suffered since the Great Depression. The Senator \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus, has shown nerves of steel in taking on \nthe Corps of Engineers on this issue. Very frankly, our part of the \ncountry has gotten short shrift, gotten shortchanged, and it has to be \naltered.\n  Now we know that for years the Corps of Engineers was operating on a \npolicy that was not supported by law and was not supported by fact. And \nit is because of the energy and effort of the Senator from Montana, in \nlarge \n[[Page S3756]] measure, that we are moving toward a new day today. I \nwant to thank him publicly for everything he has done.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I think that North Dakotans should know that there is \nno Senator who has worked harder on this issue than their Senator, Kent \nConrad. He and I have teamed up many times on this matter. And I must \nsay it is a combination of working with the Senator from North Dakota, \nas well as the other Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and \nother members of the House delegation that has enabled us to stem--\npardon the pun--more of the flow down the stream. But this is a problem \nthat has to be corrected, and I thank my colleague for joining me in \nassuring this correction is made.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Montana. It has been a team \neffort, but I think there is no doubt the Senator from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, has been a key player in this effort.\n  Mr. President, from its origins in Montana to its end near St. Louis, \nthe mighty Missouri River is managed and controlled by the Army Corps \nof Engineers. Five years ago, the Army Corps of Engineers began a \nreview of its river management plan, commonly called the master manual. \nThis was the first major review of the manual since it was implemented \nin 1960.\n  The corps started this review in response to our concerns over \nfalling reservoir levels in the Dakotas and Montana. At that time, we \nwere in the middle of the worst drought since the Great Depression, and \nthe corps was draining huge amounts of water from the reservoirs for \nthe sole purpose of keeping a small number of barges on the Missouri \nRiver afloat.\n  I can remember very well holding a hearing in the midst of that \nterrible drought and learning, to my shock and my surprise, that the \nArmy Corps of Engineers was releasing record amounts of water from our \nreservoirs in the midst of the worst drought in 50 years. I mean, think \nabout it. It is absolutely extraordinary. In the worst drought in 50 \nyears, they were releasing record amounts of water and, as a result, \nour reservoir levels were dropping like a stone.\n  Mr. President, while the barges continued to float, Lake Sakakawea \nand other mainstream reservoirs dropped by almost 30 feet. It is hard \nto imagine. It is hard to visualize what that meant, Mr. President. I \nknow the occupant of the chair, the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, is from a downstream State, and I know there are legitimate \ninterests there as well. But I say to you, if you could have seen what \nwas happening in our part of the country, I think even the \ndownstreamers would have been stunned. To see a reservoir drop 30 feet \nin a very short period of time and to see the economic wreckage caused \nby that drop, I think, told many of us that something was badly askew.\n  I can still remember a young couple. He had been a pro football \nplayer. He and his wife put everything they had into a resort right \nbefore the drought hit. And when the reservoir dropped, they found \ntheir marina high and dry. They found everything they had put in, all \ntheir life savings, everything they could borrow, was lost, all of it \nput at risk and all of it lost.\n  Mr. President, the water has returned to our reservoirs, but the need \nto change the master manual remains. Five years of corps study has made \nit clear that the current master manual provides disproportionate \nbenefits for downstream States at the expense of upstream States. About \n70 percent of the system's economic benefits goes to downstream States, \nwhile upstream States get roughly 30 percent. This is not a fair \ndistribution\n of benefits and it should change.\n\n  Of special concern to me is the fact that the current plan destroys a \ngrowing recreation industry from the upper basin to keep subsidizing a \nshrinking Missouri River barge industry.\n  The main problem with the current manual is that it is slanted toward \nnavigation and based on outdated assumptions. The master manual \nanticipates annual river navigation traffic of 12 million tons. We have \nnever even gotten close to that number. Commercial navigation is now \naround 2 million tons per year; in other words, one-sixth of what is \nassumed in the current master manual.\n  Navigation supplies only 1 percent of the system's annual economic \nbenefits--$17 million out of $1.3 billion. This compares with $76 \nmillion in annual benefits from recreation. Yet, the corps continues to \nmanage the entire system for the benefit of navigation and to the \ndetriment of other functions. Navigation is the only project function \nmanaged for 100 percent of its potential--potential--economic output.\n  In economic terms, does it make any sense for the corps to favor \nnavigation over recreation? Anyone who takes an honest look at the \nfacts would answer ``No.''\n  Mr. President, the time has come to change this policy. The corps \nshould stop pretending that navigation is king. It is not. It never \nwas. My colleagues may be surprised to hear that the entire Missouri \nRiver system would actually generate greater economic benefits if \nMissouri River navigation were deemphasized. In other words, we would \ngive the taxpayers a better return on their investment if we would \nplace less emphasis on barges on the Missouri.\n  I believe that a better way to manage the river would be to \ndeemphasize Missouri navigation and keep more water in the upstream \nreservoirs. Such a move would increase total economic benefits, improve \nthe river ecosystem, and result in more equitable distribution of the \nbenefits. Recreation and hydropower benefits would increase while flood \ncontrol and water supply functions would be largely unaffected.\n  In addition, deemphasizing Missouri river navigation would \nsignificantly improve the river ecosystem. This approach makes economic \nsense. It makes environmental sense. I cannot understand how any \nrational review of the situation could reach any other conclusion.\n  Mr. President, the public has been fed a good deal of misinformation \nabout the master manual review. I want to address two falsehoods that \nare being spread by some who are opposed to change.\n  First, the upstream States are not trying to use up, take away, or \nsell all of the Missouri River water that would otherwise go \ndownstream. There is no way that North Dakota or any other upstream \nState could use enough Missouri River water to affect the downstream \nflows. It simply cannot be done. In addition, North Dakota has, I say, \nno--and I repeat no--plans to divert to another State, sell, or trade \naway the rights to Missouri River water.\n  Second, changes in the Missouri River master manual will not \nsignificantly impact navigation and water supply on the Mississippi \nRiver. Corps analysis concluded that ``Changes in the Missouri River \noperations would not''--let me repeat that--``would not affect water \nsupply on the Mississippi River.'' Corps analysis also found there was \nessentially no difference in Mississippi navigation between the current \nplan and the corps' proposed change.\n  Finally, my colleagues should keep in mind that there is a legitimate \nissue of fairness at work here. The upstream States have sacrificed 1.2 \nmillion acres of prime land to house the reservoirs that serve and \nprotect the downstream States. In return, we get a fraction of the \nbenefits and a fraction of the water projects that were promised as \ncompensation some 50 years ago.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize, we have given up 1.2 million acres--\na permanent flood in our States--in order to save the downstream States \nfrom repetitive flooding. So we have the permanent flood to save them \nfrom annual flooding. Yet, they get the lion's share of the benefits of \nthe management of the system.\n  In contrast to what we have experienced upstream, the downstream \nStates have sacrificed nothing but received the lion's share of the \nbenefits, including navigation water supply, and to date $5 billion \nworth of flood control--not million--$5 billion worth of flood control. \nThis is not what I call equity.\n  Mr. President, what we need in the Missouri River Basin is balance in \nfairly meeting the competing interests along the river. By making key \nchanges in the master manual, we can achieve this balance while at the \nsame time increasing economic and environmental benefits.\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Corps of Engineers manages the flow \nof the Missouri River based on assumptions about economic uses of the \nriver that have not been seriously reexamined or revised in 50 years. \nImpartial observers, including the General Accounting Office, \nacknowledge that the rules for operating the dams along the river, \nknown as the master manual, are outdated.\n  Historically, upstream States, including South Dakota, have accepted \nthe burden of flood control on the river. This tradition began with the \nsacrifice of prime land to the construction of dams to prevent \ndownstream flooding.\n  Over time, recreation in upstream States has come to play a much more \nprominent role in producing economic benefits from the river. Yet corps \nmanagement of the river ignores this development and continues to give \nrecreation lower priority than competing downstream uses.\n  Today there is general consensus on the need to substantially revise \nthe guidelines by which the Federal Government operates the dams on the \nMissouri River. After reviewing the management of the Missouri River in \n1992, the General Accounting Office concluded that the corps has been \nmanaging the river based on ``assumptions about the amount of water \nneeded for navigation and irrigation made in 1944 that are no longer \nvalid.'' According to GAO, ``the plan does not reflect the current \neconomic conditions in the Missouri River Basin.''\n  As a result, in 1989 the Corps of Engineers initiated a study of the \noperation of the main stem of the Missouri River, in anticipation of \nrevising the master manual. A number of alternative management plans \nwere developed and, based on the historical behavior of the river--from \n1898 to 1994--the economic and environmental impacts of each \nalternative were evaluated. The goal of this exercise was to identify \nwhich alternative would maximize the economic value of the river, \nconsidering such factors as flood control, navigation, hydropower, \nwater supply, and recreation.\n  In May 1994, the corps selected a preferred alternative, which called \nfor shortening the navigation season by 1 month and maintaining a \nhigher permanent pool behind the dams. In July 1994, the draft \nenvironmental impact statement [EIS] was released for review. The \npublic comment period ended on March 1.\n  What has become clear through this 6-year process is that the \ndownstream States will go to great lengths to prevent this reassessment \nfrom moving forward. Congressional representatives from downstream \nStates consistently have attempted to block any revision of the Master \nmanual that reflects the changing economics of\n the river and gives recreation the priority it deserves.\n\n  The House Appropriations Committee in 1993--at the behest of \ndownstream members--called on the corps ``to follow the legislative \npriorities and regulatory guidelines expressed in its current master \nmanual until a new management plan is approved by Congress.'' Now that \nthe corps has selected the preferred alternative, the downstream States \nhave made it clear that they will fight the changes it recommends.\n  It appears increasingly unlikely that even modest changes in the \nmaster manual will be allowed to occur without legislation. That is \nregrettable.\n  To focus light on the heart of this issue, today Senator Baucus is \nintroducing the Missouri River Water Control Equity Act, which seeks to \nensure that the changing economic conditions are acknowledged and \nreflected in the management of the river. This bill simply states \nexplicitly policy that should be implicit.\n  This bill reflects the analysis of corps professionals. It would \nrequire the agency to maintain a permanent pool of 44 million acre-feet \nbehind most dams, while allowing it to maintain lower levels if \nnecessary to meet downstream needs for flood control, water supply and \nhydropower. It would also reduce the navigation season and require the \ncorps to develop and implement a plan to mitigate stream bank erosion \ncaused by operation of the dams.\n  Mr. President, times have changed. Assumptions valid 50 years ago are \nno longer valid today.\n  Since 1944, significant economic changes have occurred in the economy \nof the Missouri River. The downstream users refuse to accept this fact. \nInstead, they cling to the outdated assumptions that disproportionately \nreward their States to the detriment of upstream users.\n  Given the results of the corps' own evaluation, the revisions should \nhave gone much farther. Greater consideration should have been given to \nincreasing the permanent pool from its current level of 18 million \nacre-feet. The analysis performed by the corps demonstrates significant \nincreases in recreation and wildlife habitat benefits at higher \npermanent pool levels. Given the immense economic value of recreation \nin the upstream States--now a $77 million per year industry--as well as \nthe ecological damage that has been suffered over the years due to \ndisruption of wetlands and the flooding of prime crop land--the master \nmanual should be altered to better support these activities.\n  The bill introduced today would require the corps to make modest \nchanges in the management of the river that their professionals have \nrecommended; changes that are fair and that increase national \nenvironmental and economic benefits from the river.\n  Neither the upstream States nor the Nation as a whole can afford to \ncontinue business as usual. It is my hope that Congress will take an \nobjective look at this issue, recognize the merits of this legislation \nand move swiftly to enact it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to make modifications to certain provisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      the osha amendments of 1995\n\n Mr. GREGG.\n  Mr. President, when OSHA was enacted it was intended to make the \nworkplace free from ``recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to \ncause, death or serious physical harm to * * * employees.'' As with \nmany programs established by Congress, however, over the years OSHA has \ndeveloped a well-earned reputation for over-regulation. OSHA has moved \nfrom its original purpose of protecting the workers to hindering \nbusinesses with excessive mandates.\n  While I feel that a major problem within OSHA is of a cultural \nnature, the bill will concentrate on five areas that will relieve the \noppressive and burdensome regulations. My bill, the OSHA Amendments of \n1995, addresses the need for employee participation, risk assessment in \nstandard making, consultation services, reduced penalties for \nnonserious violations, and warnings in lieu of citations.\n  This balanced approach will remove a feeling among the American \nemployers and employees that OSHA is the bad cop, and institute an \nawareness of a partnership in assuring safety and health in the \nworkplace. The limitation of burdensome and repetitious paper work, \ncompiled with risk assessment and a reduced threat of large fines, will \nmake for a more businesslike approach.\n  As Chairman of the Labor Subgroup of the Regulatory Relief Task \nForce, I have received numerous requests for the reform of OSHA. This \npast month I held a roundtable on regulatory reform in my State of New \nHampshire and, although there were many issues raised, the one that was \nunanimously supported was OSHA reform. Businesses across America share \nNew Hampshire's exasperation with what OSHA has become, as well as \ntheir demands for relief. This bill begins to answer that call to \naction.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 527. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Empress; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                certificate of documentation legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct the \nvessel Empress, Official Number 975018, be accorded coastwise trading \nprivileges.\n  [[Page S3758]] The Empress was constructed in 1925 in the United \nStates. It is 75 feet in length, 16 feet in width, 5.5 feet in depth, \nand is self-propelled. The vessel was owned by the United States until \n1960. The vessel has been used as a corporate business vessel, private \nresidence, and charter vessel. It has also been used by nonprofit \ngroups such as the Special Olympics, March of Dimes, and the Ronald \nMcDonald House.\n  The current owner obtained the boat from his father. The owner has \nall ownership records except for the years 1960 to 1965, when the \nvessel was being used by the Boy Scouts of America.\n  The owner of the vessel is seeking a waiver of the existing law so \nthat the vessel can be used as a charter vessel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding section 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsement for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel EMPRESS (United States official number 975018).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 528. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for \nthree vessels; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                certificate of documentation legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nseeks to temporarily authorize the operation of three vessels in the \ncoastwise trade. Ordinarily, I do not support any legislative relief \nfrom section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 to allow operation \nof vessels not constructed in the United States. In this particular \ninstance, however, temporary relief from the Merchant Marine Act will \nincrease jobs in the shipbuilding industry, support the addition of \nmaritime jobs and expand the maritime transportation base.\n  I want to point out that the bill I am introducing today protects the \nU.S.-build requirements of the Jones Act by stipulating that these \nthree vessels are authorized to operate in the coastwise trade if, and \nonly if, three criteria are met. These criteria are:\n  The owner of these vessels must execute a binding contract for \nconstruction of replacement vessels within 9 months of enactment of \nthis provision;\n  All necessary repairs required to operate these vessels in the \ncoastwise trade must be performed in shipyards in the United States; \nand\n  Each of these vessels must be manned by U.S. citizens.\n  If this legislation is adopted, jobs in the U.S. maritime industry \nwill be increased and new opportunities for maritime passenger \ntransportation in high demand areas will be created. Without this \nauthorization, these opportunities--including the addition of over 100 \nnew shipyard jobs--will not occur.\n  I appreciate the attention of my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COASTWISE TRADE AUTHORIZATION FOR HOVERCRAFT.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \n     (46 U.S.C. App. 883), the Act of June 19, 1886 (46 U.S.C. \n     App. 289), and sections 12106 and 12107 of title 46, United \n     States Code, the Secretary of Transportation may issue a \n     certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement for \n     each of the vessels IDUN VIKING (Danish Registration number \n     A433), LIV VIKING (Danish Registration number A394), and \n     FREJA VIKING (Danish Registration number A395) if--\n       (1) all repair and alteration work on the vessels necessary \n     to their operation under this section is performed in the \n     United States;\n       (2) a binding contract for the construction in the United \n     States of at least 3 similar vessels for the coastwise trade \n     is executed by the owner of the vessels within 6 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (3) the vessels constructed under the contract entered into \n     under paragraph (1) are to be delivered within 3 years after \n     the date of entering into that contract.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3744-3",

Mr. President, recently, the Bloomington Pantagraph \nhad an \n[[Page S3760]] editorial that I ask be printed the Record, commenting \non the matter of gambling in Illinois.\n  The phenomenon is not a problem only in Illinois.\n  I have introduced legislation calling for a national commission to \nlook at where we are going in this area and to look into its impact on \nthe Nation.\n  We are talking about the fastest growing industry in the United \nStates, and there are obviously problems that go with that escalation.\n  The Drake Law Review recently had a very extensive study of this \nquestion and came to the conclusion that we are harming our country.\n  I hope Congress will authorize a careful look at this whole question.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                  [From the Pantagraph, Feb. 23, 1995]\n\n          Odds Against Controlling Gambling Fever in Illinois\n\n       Gambling fever seems to be spreading across Illinois like a \n     prairie fire.\n       Horse tracks have been around for awhile, but the state \n     broke new ground by subsidizing the rebuilding of Arlington \n     International Raceway when the original track burned.\n       For those who didn't want to go to the tracks, there have \n     been plenty of bingo parlors around. And the state finally \n     got around to licensing them to make them legal.\n       And there is the state lottery, where the proliferation of \n     games to lose money--with a few exceptions, of course--never \n     ceases to amaze us.\n       We also have the riverboats, the floating crap games. It \n     hasn't been enough to just have the riverboats; owners have \n     chartered buses to transport gamblers from various cities.\n       Oh yes, let's not forget the offtrack betting parlors that \n     have sprung up in at least a half-dozen Illinois cities.\n       But there is still constant stirring in Springfield for \n     more licensed gambling--casino gambling.\n       Had enough? There's more.\n       The mega-raffles seem to be hitting Illinois much harder \n     this year, too.\n       There's one in Bloomington-Normal now. Central Catholic \n     High School's Dream House raffle is offering a top prize of a \n     $200,000 house under construction on Bloomington's northeast \n     side. Only 2,400 tickets are being sold at $100 each.\n       Sangamon County is concerned enough about such raffles that \n     it regulates them with a code. Last month, the county raised \n     the maximum for such raffles from $150,000 to $250,000. Since \n     then, a fourth ``mega-drawing'' of the year has been \n     announced in Springfield--this one for a $180,000 house to \n     benefit Big Brother/Big Sister of Sangamon County.\n       Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that in that same city, \n     legislation was introduced two weeks ago to permit video \n     lottery gambling at locations licensed to conduct charitable \n     games, primarily private/social clubs.\n       We haven't even mentioned the office pools or the illegal \n     bookies and tip boards in probably every major city.\n       It seems rather ironic that this fever pitch for gambling \n     is often tempered because proceeds are earmarked for charity, \n     or education, or county fairs.\n       We know gambling is an easy way to make a quick buck--for \n     the sponsor.\n       And we haven't mentioned that a small bet for a large prize \n     can be titilating.\n       But the stakes seem to be escalating. It's time Illinois \n     legislators take a more critical look at gambling--what it \n     was, what it has become, what it has done and where it is \n     going.\n       Please, no more legalized gambling. We'll bet there are \n     ample opportunities to lose money now.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/09/senate-section/article/S3759-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
