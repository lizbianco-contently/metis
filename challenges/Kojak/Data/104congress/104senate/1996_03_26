Mr. President, let me claim my 15 minutes, and I ask the \nChair to notify me when I have consumed 10 of the minutes.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor today with Senator Reid from \nNevada to discuss a preliminary report that has been completed, after \nsome 2 years of work, by the General Accounting Office. This report \ntakes an extensive look into the activities and operations of the \nFederal Reserve Board and its regional banks. The Federal Reserve was \ncreated in 1913. It is kind of a dinosaur in our Government in an age \nof openness, an institution shrouded in great secrecy. But in 1913, the \nCongress created the Federal Reserve Board. That was the year in which \nHenry Ford built the first assembly line for the Model-T and paid \npeople $5 a day to work to construct automobiles.\n  That was a long time ago, but some things do not change very much. \nThe Federal Reserve still exists. It still sits as a house on a hill \nwith a large fence around it and invites no one to peer in to see what \nthey are doing. They make a substantial amount of money. They make \ntheir own spending decisions, and they are accountable only to \nthemselves.\n  Senator Reid and I asked the GAO to do an investigation and \nevaluation of\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nhow the Fed works: What does it spend its money on? How well does it \nspend its money? How accountable is it?\n  We have some 200 pages in a report that represents the work of nearly \n2 years by the GAO. This is not a final report. It is a preliminary \nreport that is now awaiting comment by the Federal Reserve Board.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I decided to release it now only because \nlast week it was made available to us, and this week the Senate \nscheduled a hearing on Chairman Greenspan's renomination. We felt that \nthe Senate Banking Committee at least ought to have the benefit of what \nis in this report prior to the hearing.\n  Let me discuss a couple of points in this report and ask Senator Reid \nto discuss a couple of other points, because I think this will provide \na substantial amount of information that the American public will be \ninterested in.\n  You talk about the Federal Reserve Board and people's eyes start \nglazing over, and there starts to develop a large fog around the \nsubject. This is largely because it is a central bank, accountable \nlargely only to itself. It conducts monetary policy by itself and does \nso behind closed doors, with great secrecy.\n  Now, what did the GAO find? A couple of things. First of all, let me \ndiscuss the surplus account that exists at the Federal Reserve Board. \nThe Federal Reserve Board has a surplus account of about $3.7 billion. \nIn fact, the surplus account has increased well over 70 percent in the \nlast 6 years. They have increased their surplus, which they set aside \nto absorb potential losses, by 79 percent over this period. So they \nhave a cash stash of $3.7 billion in a surplus account.\n  This account presumably is to cover their losses. But the Federal \nReserve Board has not lost money in 79 consecutive years and is not \ngoing to lose money in the future. Last year, it had a $20 billion-plus \nprofit, it had expenses of about $2 to $3 billion, and it turns the \nrest back to the Treasury. But it still keeps a small surplus--small by \ntheir definition, large by my definition. I come from a town of only \n300 people, and there billions mean something.\n  What does the GAO say about that? The GAO talks about this surplus \naccount by suggesting that the downward adjustment to the size of the \nsurplus account, or perhaps its elimination, would result in a positive \nbudgetary impact, and so on and so forth. Then they point out that when \nthey asked the Federal Reserve Board why they had this and how they \ndetermined what they needed, they said it is arbitrary. There is really \nno criteria used by the Fed to how much they need in the surplus \naccount. They just squirrel away as much as they want.\n  This is the taxpayers' money, $3.7 billion squirreled away in a \nconcrete edifice that houses the Fed. The GAO recommends, and I \nrecommend--and we will introduce legislation--that this money be \nreturned to American taxpayers and not stashed as a surplus in an \ninstitution that has not had a loss in 79 years and is not going to \nhave a loss in the next 79 years.\n  There are other areas in this GAO report that also describe the \noperation of the overall Federal Reserve system. The Federal Reserve \nBoard largely conducts monetary policy. While I disagree with its \nmonetary policies these days, I do not think that the monetary policy \nought to exist here in the well of the Congress. I think it ought to be \nseparate and apart.\n\n  But I do not agree with the Fed when it believes its mission in life \nis to be a set of human brake pads designed to slow down the American \neconomy. They happen to believe the American economy should not grow \nmore than 2.5 percent. If it grows more than that, somehow we are going \nto produce more inflation they think.\n  They are dead wrong. In the global economy, inflation is going down, \nnot up; wages are going down, not up. So I think their monetary policy \nis wrong, and they are inhibiting growth in this country and slowing \ndown the American economy.\n  However, that is not what the GAO looked at. The GAO evaluated the \nother functions of the Fed. What does it spend its money on? Less than \n10 percent of the activities of the Federal Reserve System are spent on \nmonetary policy activities. The rest of it is bank supervision, check \nclearing, and a whole range of other things.\n  The Fed has counseled this country to cut its expenditures, slim \ndown, downsize, and streamline. What has the Fed done? The Fed has \ncounseled that America go on a diet and it has decided to over-eat. \nHere you have a circumstance where this shows what has happened between \n1988 and 1994 according to the GAO: Personnel compensation up 53 \npercent. Benefits, that is, benefits per employee, increased about 90 \npercent during the same period; equipment and software up; buildings \nup.\n  In fact, they built one building, and they estimated when they \ndecided to build the building they would need a 7,000-square-foot \nlobby. That is a pretty good-sized lobby. When they finished the \nbuilding, they had a 27,000-square-foot lobby. You ought to see a \npicture of this lobby with no chairs--27,000 square foot. And that also \nis in the GAO report.\n  If you take a look at the expenditures of the Fed, you will see this \nline, which is the blue line, and from 1988 to 1994, the Fed, which \nwrites its own checks and decides how much it wants to spend--nobody is \nsuggesting that it ought to do this or ought not to do this. It decides \nhow much of its money it wants to keep--had a 48 percent increase in \nexpenditures, according to the GAO. During the same period, the \nConsumer Price Index increased 25 percent--almost double the Consumer \nPrice Index in terms of the increase in costs down at the Fed.\n  I just indicated a couple of those items, but the cost per employee \nof the increases in benefits, employee benefits of the Fed increased 90 \npercent during the 6-year term.\n  So again, the suggestion by the Fed that the rest of the Government \ntighten its belt is apparently advice lost on the Fed itself. If you \ntake a look at a whole range of these issues, the amount of money spent \non personnel, on buildings, on benefits, and a whole series of issues \nlike that, what you will find is a Federal Reserve Board that has not \nhad a previous audit but a board for which an audit would discover that \nit seems to be growing while the rest of the Government is shrinking.\n  Maybe we ought to bring the Federal Reserve Board into the same \nrealm. I am not talking about bringing monetary policy functions into \nthis realm, but maybe the non-monetary policy functions of the Federal \nReserve ought to be subject to annual appropriations just as are all of \nthe other functions of Government.\n  Certainly, we ought to now proceed, based on what we will find in \nthis report, to decide there should be every year, each and every year, \nan independent audit of the Federal Reserve Board. We ought to, based \non what we have discovered in this report, decide that we should have \nthis $3.7 billion taken out of the surplus account that has been \nsquirreled away by the Fed itself and brought back into the stream of \nincome that is available to the American taxpayers. Those are the \nthings that we ought to do together. There are a whole series of \nrecommendations that Senator Reid and I will jointly employ in the \ndecision on future legislation as a result of this GAO report.\n  Let me conclude my portion of this where I began. The Federal Reserve \nBoard is a dinosaur; in the rest of Government, we are now discussing \nopenness. In the Federal Reserve Board, we still have the shroud of \nsecrecy. In the rest of the Government, we have the requirement for \nfinancial accountability. At the Federal Reserve Board, it is: We will \nspend what we need to spend, and we will make that judgment.\n  While the rest of the Federal Government is shrinking with fewer \nemployees, fewer now than at any time during the Government's history \ngoing back to John F. Kennedy, the Federal Reserve Board system is \ngrowing. That is why I think this GAO audit suggests it is out of step \nand does need some correction.\n  Mr. President, let me yield the floor. My colleague, Senator Reid, \nfrom Nevada, will discuss some of the other results of this GAO \nevaluation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair advise me when I have used 12 \nminutes of my time.\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\n  Mr. President, this report that was released yesterday has taken \nabout 2 years for the General Accounting Office to conduct. The \nfindings of this report, if centered on a Member of Congress or an \nagency of the Federal Government, would be, for lack of a better word, \nscandalous.\n  It is interesting to note the apologists that are around this country \nfor the Federal Reserve Board. Take, for example, the Wall Street \nJournal. They wrote an article on the release of this report today, but \nit was an apology for the Federal Reserve Board. The Wall Street \nJournal looks at the Members of Congress and Federal agencies and \nanything they do, they do not dot an ``i'' on the right place on the \npage, do not cross the ``t,'' they not only report it, but they write \nan editorial about it.\n  This $3.7 billion? The huge cost overruns? Not a word said in today's \nWall Street Journal, but it is very typical for that newspaper.\n  This report raises legitimate questions about fiscal management \nwithin the Federal Reserve System. Some important questions should be \nanswered as we proceed, Senator Dorgan and I, with our legislative \nagenda as it relates to this General Accounting Office report. And I \nthink there should be some questions asked during the confirmation \nproceedings relating to Alan Greenspan.\n  We have been told by the General Accounting Office that this is the \nmost in-depth study they have ever done of the Federal Reserve Board. \nIn all the time I have been in Congress, certainly it is the most in-\ndepth study by far that has ever been done of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  I agree the Federal Reserve should be independent, and I think that I \nwill do what I can to make sure it is independent, but that does not \nmean the Federal Reserve Board and system does not need accountability. \nIt needs accountability, as indicated in this 200-page report that has \ntaken 2 years to prepare by the General Accounting Office.\n  Mr. President, I think what the Federal Reserve Board has been saying \nis, ``Do not do as I do, do as I say,'' because they say that \nGovernment has to cut back. What do they do? They significantly \nincrease their spending in all areas. Take, for example, the operating \ncosts of the Federal Reserve System. Supervision and regulation, from \n1988 to 1994, increased 102 percent--102 percent. An annual audit \ncertainly is the least we should get out of this. We should know what \nis happening in the Federal Reserve System. A ray of sunlight should \nbegin shining on the Federal Reserve System. It may not need to be part \nof our sunshine laws that were so popular a decade or two ago, but it \nneeds a ray of sunshine shining on it. It would instill greater public \nconfidence in our banking system. It is important.\n  I have talked only a little bit about the increased operating costs, \nbut the costs certainly have skyrocketed. And we are talking about big \nmoney. From 1988 to 1994, the costs have gone up from $1.3 billion to \n$2 billion. That is a lot of money. Operating costs for the Federal \nReserve have grown at twice the rate of inflation. Fed operating costs \njumped 50 percent between 1988 and 1994.\n  Mr. President, I have behind me here a visual aid, and I think it is \npretty clear, if we look at what has happened with travel within the \nFederal Reserve System, it has gone up 66 percent. We see what has \nhappened to the Federal Government. It has gone up 4 percent; staffing \nlevels of the Federal Government, minus 2 percent. We see what has \nhappened with the Federal Reserve System. It is incredible.\n  These costs are a story in and of themselves. From 1988 to 1994, the \nFed salary costs increased by 44 percent. Interestingly, also, salaries \nof reserve bank presidents are significantly greater than the Chairman. \nThey vary. Somebody in San Francisco makes more than somebody in St. \nLouis. It is interesting; there is no conformity as to how much they \nmake. They can kind of pay themselves, I guess, what they want. And 120 \ntop Fed officials earn more than the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, Alan Greenspan. Within the Federal Reserve System, their \nbenefits increased by 89 percent. Whereas in the rest of the Federal \nGovernment, we have been reining in the costs, theirs have gone up \nalmost 90 percent.\n\n  I might say, when we talk about the travel expenses increasing by 66 \npercent--but they travel in style. In 1994, the Fed's travel \nexpenditures were over $42 million. They are permitted to be reimbursed \nhowever they feel they should be reimbursed: They can be reimbursed per \ndiem, they can be reimbursed actual costs. How would this institution \nwork if, in fact, every Member of Congress could be reimbursed for \ntravel costs, whatever they felt was appropriate? There needs to be \nsome uniformity. Because the policy varied from bank to bank, these \ncosts could easily be contained by a uniform, more taxpayer-friendly \npolicy.\n  Senator Dorgan has talked about the double standard, and certainly \nthere is a double standard. When we also understand that 93.25 percent \nof all of the work that the Fed does has nothing to do with monetary \npolicy--only a little over 6.5 percent of what they do relates to \nmonetary policy--that is why I agree wholeheartedly with my friend, the \njunior Senator from North Dakota, that in fact they should be subject \nto the appropriation process. They should be.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. We spend most of our \ntime trying to figure out a way to downsize, to cut budgets, to \neliminate programs. At the same time the Fed is telling us that we need \nto do this, their costs are spiraling. The rest of the Government \nunderwent necessary belt tightening. The Fed enjoyed a smorgasbord of \ngrowth; they picked whatever they wanted. While the Federal \nGovernment's overall staffing level declined by 2 percent, the Fed's \nstaffing level increased 6 percent over that.\n  So we know there needs to be better internal management. The General \nAccounting Office found this. I have gone around the State of Nevada. \nPeople ask questions about the Fed. I have introduced legislation in \nthe past to have an annual audit of the Federal Reserve System. It has \ngotten nowhere. It has gotten from being introduced to the garbage can. \nBut now there are facts to indicate that what I have been talking about \nis absolutely necessary; that we do need to have an annual report, we \ndo need better management control within the Fed.\n  We do not know how costs have gone up in the last year and a half or \nso, but between 1988 and 1994, personnel compensation increased 54 \npercent, equipment and software expenditures increased 85 percent, \nbuilding expenditures increased 34 percent, and, as I already talked \nabout, travel expenditures increased by 66 percent. There is very \nlittle in the Fed to keep these under control. The Fed is not subject \nto the same cost reduction pressures that have affected both public and \nprivate agencies.\n  The $3.7 billion slush fund that they have, that they keep around for \nlosses that may occur--we have not had any that occurred in 79 years. I \nam on the Appropriations Committee. We are now in conference, trying to \nwork out the disputes we have. We badly need a few more dollars to \nallow this omnibus bill to be signed, these five appropriations bills. \nIt could be done if we had the Fed's money that is sitting there, \ngathering dust. We would solve the problem. The Federal Government \nwould be financed. We would not need any more continuing resolutions.\n  So we know, as the Senator from North Dakota has indicated, that we \nneed to do something legislatively. We first must have the $3.7 billion \nreturned to the Treasury. We need to require an annual audit, an \nindependent audit. We need to institute uniform procurement and \ncontracting practices. We need to institute executive branch policies \nrelating to travel, benefits and security. We certainly need to do \nthat, at a minimum.\n  I think it would be well that we tied the salaries of Fed executives \nto similarly situated Government personnel, and we need to subject the \nFed's nonmonetary policy operations to the appropriations process. That \nis the least we can do.\n  I think it also says a lot when we realize that the Federal Reserve, \nas described by my friend from North Dakota, has had this beautiful \nhome. We can just see the top of that home. We cannot see it all \nbecause there is a huge fence around it. We know we have \nresponsibilities for the structure, the landscaping in there, but we \ncannot see it.\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n  All we are asking is let us find out what is going on. It is \nimportant. They conduct important functions of this Government, and we \nshould know more about what they do. We have to do away with the shroud \nof secrecy. We have to peel back this cloak that they covered \nthemselves with since 1913. This rainy-day fund they have set up is not \na rainy-day fund, it is for a hurricane. They have this spending free-\nfor-all attitude. That has to stop. They have a blank check mentality. \nI would like to know who is minding the shop, because 1913 accounting \npractices must be put to a stop.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator from Nevada?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 2\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me use a couple of these minutes by \ntrying to put this in perspective.\n  There is the policy issue with respect to the Federal Reserve Board, \nhow it behaves, what it does, how it impacts this country's economy. \nThen there is the issue that we raised with respect to the GAO \nevaluation of the Fed. That is what we are discussing before the Senate \ntoday.\n  This 200-page evaluation of the Federal Reserve Board and its \noperations is the most significant look inside the Fed in 70 or 80 \nyears. What it shows, as we have indicated, is they have stashed away \n$3.7 billion for a surplus, despite the fact they have not had a loss \nin 79 consecutive years. They are spending more and more during times \nwhen others in the Federal Government are being told they ought to \ntighten their belts. Those issues are issues the Congress ought to deal \nwith. The Federal Reserve Board ought to be subjected to an annual \nindependent audit. We ought to have information and knowledge about \nwhat is going on behind that fence. That is the reason we want to make \nsure our colleagues, the relevant committees, and others will be able \nto evaluate the wealth of information that exists in this draft GAO \nreport.\n  Let me, finally, say a word about the policies of the Federal Reserve \nBoard itself, which are different, separate and apart from the issues \nwe have been discussing. I have very serious reservations about the \nmonetary policies pursued by the Fed. As I have indicated, the Federal \nReserve Board has seemed to feel, now, for some long while, that this \ncountry cannot have economic growth rates above 2.5 percent. If they \nfancied themselves as a set of human brake pads whose mission in life \nis to slow down the American economy, I say they have succeeded. Give \nthem a trophy.\n  That is not what this country needs. The global economy means wages \nare falling, not rising. It means inflation is going down, not up. And \nit means this country can have a higher rate of growth. There are \nDemocrats and Republicans who believe very strongly that a 2.5 percent \ngrowth rate for our economy is anemic and cannot provide the kind of \nopportunity and expansion that we need in this country.\n  I hope, in addition to the discussion we will have about what the Fed \nis doing, how it runs its operations, how it spends its money--in \naddition to that, and we should have that discussion as a result of \nthis report, I hope we will also have a discussion about the Fed's \nmonetary policies, and whether they are appropriate to try to produce \nthe kind of economic future that we want in this country. In my \njudgment, they are not.\n\n  Two years ago, we saw the Federal Reserve Board increase interest \nrates seven times. Why? Because they were heading off the fires of \ninflation, they suggested. But inflation was not going up, inflation \nwas going down, and it continues to go down.\n  What they managed to do with those interest rate increases was to \nslow down the American economy. That is not such a significant talent. \nMy Uncle Joe can slow down the American economy. Just bring Uncle Joe \nto town, and I am sure he can figure out how to throw a wrench in the \ncrank case. It does not take a special talent to slow down the economy.\n  The question is, how do we get the economy moving again, a vigorous \neconomy with new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans, without \nraising the specter of additional inflation? That is the task for all \nof us.\n  The Federal Reserve Board sees itself on a singular mission: Keep \neconomic growth somewhere in the range of 2.5 percent. That is not \nenough growth for this country. No one ought to be satisfied with that. \nIt does not produce the jobs or the opportunities this country needs.\n  Mr. President, I hope that even as we discuss the report about what \nthe Fed does and how it spends its money, we will alternatively discuss \nFederal policies, especially in the area of monetary policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tucked into the 2,000-page, 9-pound-11-\nounce stack of documents that make up President Clinton's latest budget \nwas a small booklet that many people might have overlooked. That \nbooklet is called ``A Citizens Guide to the Federal Budget.'' I would \nlike to read to you a couple of the paragraphs from chapter 2, and that \nchapter deals with where money comes from and where it goes.\n  It says:\n\n       In a typical American household, a father and mother might \n     sit around the kitchen table to review the family budget. \n     They might discuss how much they expect to earn each year, \n     how much they can spend on food, shelter, clothing, \n     transportation, and perhaps a vacation, and how much they \n     might be able to save for future needs.\n       If they do not have enough money to make ends meet, they \n     might discuss how they can spend less, such as cutting back \n     on restaurants, movies or other entertainment. They also \n     might consider whether to try to earn more by working more \n     hours or taking another job. If they expect their shortfall \n     to be temporary, they might try to borrow.\n\n  This is from the ``Small Citizens Guide to the Federal Budget.'' I \nagree with every word of that--the situation it describes is precisely \nwhat American families are facing today. But then the booklet continues \nand says:\n\n       Generally speaking, the Federal Government plans its budget \n     much like families do.\n\n  Generally speaking Mr. President, the Federal Government plans its \nbudget nothing at all like a family across the country has to do.\n  A family does not have unlimited access to a credit card access that \nhas allowed the Federal Government to amass a national debt of more \nthan $5 trillion.\n  A family would not be allowed to spend beyond its means forever--it \nwould reach its credit limit and the family would eventually have to \ntighten its belt and begin paying back its debt. The Federal \nGovernment, on the other hand, just continues to steal from our \nchildren.\n  A family does not have the resources of foreign investors they can \nturn to when the bill come due. The Federal Government does, and \nexpects the taxpayers to foot the bills and the massive interest \npayments those bills generate.\n  And finally, a family could not impose hundreds of millions of dollar \nworth of new taxes and fees on its friends and neighbors to help offset \nits own extravagant spending. But the Federal Government can, and it \ndoes.\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\n  For years, I have used the story of the family sitting around the \nkitchen table as an example of how middle-class Americans understand \nbudgeting in a way Washington never will.\n  The methodical, commonsense approach to reconciling expenses against \nrevenues represents everything that Washington is not.\n  So to suggest that the Federal Government's free-spending, \nunaccountable ways have anything in common with the way the working-\nclass people of this Nation plan their budgets is ludicrous.\n  Librarians take notice: The Government will recommend that ``A \nCitizen's Guide to the Federal Budget'' be filed in the bookshelves \nalong with the rest of the official Federal publications.\n  I say it ought to go up alongside Louis L'Amour and the Harlequin \nRomances, because it is pure fiction.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that families are facing tough \ntimes.\n  Money is tight, and there is not much left at the end of the day to \nput away for savings.\n  They are cutting back in order to make ends meet--skimping not just \non entertainment, as the authors of ``A Citizen's Guide to the Federal \nBudget'' would have us believe, but too often on necessities like new \nclothes, insurance, or even groceries.\n  Their credit card bills are straining under the load, They are \nworking two or three jobs and taking on overtime hours just to make \nends meet.\n  But why are things so tight for American families? A close look at \nthe President's latest budget offers some answers.\n  In his State of the Union Address delivered just 2 months ago, \nPresident Clinton boldly declared that ``the era of big government is \nover.''\n  Big government presumably meant the high taxes that have squeezed the \nmiddle class, the gigantic bureaucracy that has made redtape a synonym \nfor Washington inefficiency, and the wasteful spending that has drained \nthe taxpayers of their precious dollars.\n  But maybe big government means something different to the President. \nUnder the budget he outlined Tuesday, big government is far from dead. \nIn fact, it is off the respirator, breathing on its own and taking \nnourishment.\n  The Clinton budget--the ninth budget he has sent to Congress in the \nlast 12 months--is nothing more than the status quo his administration \ncontinues to deliver, because it calls for increasing Federal spending \nevery year over the course of the 7-year plan, until we're spending \nnearly $1.9 trillion just after the turn of the century.\n  The President claims he will pay for all that new spending with \nunspecified cuts in domestic programs sometime in the future. Most of \nthe cuts would not come until after the year 2000, meaning Bill Clinton \nwill never have to make any of those tough choices.\n  As the President's budget grows, so does the Nation's debt, again, \nrising every year of the President's plan. By the time we have reached \nthe year 2002, the national debt will have ballooned from $4.9 trillion \nthis year to almost $6.5 trillion. That is an increase of nearly 27 \npercent in just 7 years.\n  And where are the tax cuts the President has repeatedly promised \nAmerican families? It is practically nonexistent. The President claims \nhe is cutting, but in reality, most of his tax reductions are offset by \nnew tax increases. This is unacceptable.\n  It is nothing but token tax relief, and his child tax credit is a \nsham. It begins at $300 per child, is slowly ratcheted up to $500, and \nthen eliminated just 2 years later. By the way, teenagers are too old \nto qualify.\n  The President pays for all this big government not by controlling \nWashington's appetite for spending, but by spending the savings \nAmericans have sacrificed over the last year toward a balanced budget.\n  Other areas of the budget that demand the President's immediate \nattention are virtually ignored.\n  He does practically nothing to save the failing Medicare system and \nbring it into the 21st century.\n  Under the Clinton plan, Medicare remains a relic from 1960's that \ndoes not work in the 1990's, and will not survive much beyond it.\n  His budget does not reform Medicaid, either.\n  At a time when a bipartisan coalition of Governors is calling on \nWashington to entrust the States with managing this vital program, the \nPresident says Washington has all the answers.\n  He does not make fundamental changes in welfare to control spending. \nThe President would not ``end welfare as we know it''--he would extend \nwelfare as we know it.\n  The President's budget plan is just a bandage on a wound that's \ndemanding emergency surgery.\n  President Clinton is asking the American family to pay for his \ncampaign and he needs to pay off Washington bureaucrats and special \ninterest groups.\n  His demand for billions of additional taxpayer dollars to finance \nbigger government, again, is consistent with his support for big \nWashington government.\n  And President Clinton funds his new spending, again, through \nincreased taxes, increased user fees, and one-time sales of assets \nfinanced directly by the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I am a firm believer that privatization is crucial to \nreaching a balanced budget and protecting taxpayer dollars. But what is \nthe point in selling off assets if we are just going to spend it on a \nbigger government?\n  Asset sales should be dedicated to deficit reduction--if they are \nnot, and are simply redirected by Congress into another Federal \nprogram, how are the taxpayers any better off than they were before the \nsale happened?\n  Unfortunately, this budget will do nothing to help working Americans \ndevastated by the Clinton crunch that has trapped them somewhere \nbetween the falling wages and the President's economy has generated, \nand the rising taxes the President's budgets have demanded.\n  That is why families are having trouble making ends meet--the middle-\nclass squeeze is squeezing them dry. A balanced budget would help, and \nthe people deserve one, but the President's budget is not the answer.\n  We have to inject a dose of reality into the proceedings: President \nClinton can claim to support all of these goals, but every time he has \nhad the opportunity to prove it, he has let us down.\n  Congress passed a budget that balances in 7 years, protecting our \nchildren and grandchildren by freeing them from a legacy of debt and \ntax increases.\n  Our budget lets taxpayers keep more of their own dollars, for \nspending on things important to families, not on things Washington \nthinks are important.\n  Our budget says a life on welfare is not much of a life at all, and \nwe offer encouragement to get people off the welfare rolls and into \nsociety.\n  Our budget says seniors ought to have a Medicare system they can rely \non, so we save it from bankruptcy and offer Medicare patients the same \nkind of health care choices that are now available to everybody except \nseniors.\n  Our budget does all of that and more, and yet despite his claims that \nhe endorses each of those goals, as we all know, the President vetoed \nevery single one of those measures.\n  So you can see why it is hard to get excited about the President's \nprofessed interest in a balanced budget, tax relief, and welfare and \nMedicare reform, when his commitment to them seems to go no deeper than \nthe tip of his veto pen.\n  The President met with the distinguished majority leader and Speaker \nGingrich last week, and they will meet again. I wish them well, because \nnegotiating with the President is like boxing with a jellyfish--it is \nhard to score any points when your opponent seems to have no backbone \nor any firm principles of his own.\n  But if there is any hope of reaching an agreement on a budget this \nyear, we will need to see some encouraging signs soon.\n  So, Mr. President, on a closing note, if the Nation were to continue \nalong the path outlined by the President and the congressional \nmajorities which came before him, a pathway dominated by high taxes and \nbig government, I am afraid we might begin to parallel the experiences \nof Sweden.\n  There is this article from the Associated Press that appeared in the \nMinneapolis Star Tribune on March 15.\n  In this article it describes what happens when a nation guided by the \nbelief that as long as it was collecting plenty of taxes and building \nplenty of government, it could provide a good life for everyone. But \nthat has met the realities of the 1990's.\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\n  With a top income tax rate of 49.9 percent, Sweden ranks as one of \nthe two highest-taxing countries in the world. ``But today,'' says this \narticle, ``Swedes are deep in debt, taxed to the limit, edgy about \nunemployment, and cynical about the model in which they once took \npride.''\n  Even Soviet leaders once praised Sweden's welfare state. But now, \ncontinues the story, ``the welfare dream is in crisis, along with the \nSocial Democratic Party that built it.''\n  While Bill Clinton and the liberal establishment try to push America \ntoward the kind of high-taxing, big-spending government Sweden has \ntried and is now rejecting, Sweden's Social Democrats are pushing for a \nbalanced budget, tighter welfare rules, and entrepreneurship.\n  ``There is a growing insight that you can't tax a society into \nequality.'' Let me say that again. ``There is a growing insight that \nyou can't tax a society into equality.'' That is from a speechwriter \nfor Sweden's retiring prime minister.\n  Somehow, Mr. President, we have moved perilously close to following \nin Sweden's footsteps, but it is not too late to take a step back.\n  If we are serious about giving our children a better future, the best \nthing we can do is to cut taxes, end the current spending frenzy, \nbalance the budget, and begin paying off the national debt.\n  ``Americans want a government that uses common sense when it makes \ndecisions that affect their lives,'' concludes the administration's \nlittle budget primer.\n  I agree, as long as we're talking about the common sense of a family \ncrafting its budget around the kitchen table, and not the nonsense we \ntoo often craft around the conference tables here in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2844-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2846-S2847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NAVAL PROMOTIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I spoke in support of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee not granting promotion to Comdr. Robert \nStumpf. Last Thursday night I had an opportunity to listen to Senator \nCoats, Senator Byrd, and Senator Nunn speak on the same subject. I \nagree with everything they said. I will speak, once again, on that same \nsubject but put it in a little broader context.\n  Before I do that, there was, last Thursday, in the Washington Post \nthis article about Commander Stumpf and the Navy, pushing for his \npromotion to be granted again. I suppose that means it will come back \nto the Senate Armed Services Committee sometime in the future.\n  If people wonder why this might not be granted, I read a paragraph \nfrom this article. It talks about the Tailhook conference 4 years ago \nin Nevada. It talks about the behavior at the Tailhook convention in \nSeptember 1991. It drew scrutiny on at least two accounts about the \nbehavior of Commander Stumpf. It says he was present in a hotel room \nhosted by his squadron where two strippers performed, although he left \nthe room before one of the women engaged in a sex act with another \nairman. Now, he avoids all responsibility for that. I assume that is \nthe moral of the story, why it should not be considered in whether or \nnot he gets a promotion.\n  It would be similar if I had a Christmas party for my staff and I \nhired a couple of strippers, and before they did their act, before \nother things would happen, I leave the party and claim no \nresponsibility for that. Commander Stumpf was the commander. It was his \ngroup that was involved. He thinks he can avoid responsibility for what \ngoes on there. I think not.\n  But also for the entire Navy, I point out that when you have that \nsort of convention, it is under the auspice of the U.S. military, and \nwe have two strippers hired and a sex act performed with an airman, I \nremind the Navy--and I say this because farming is my background and my \nson operates our family farm--that is the way animals operate. Animals \noperate that way. Human beings, in their interaction with people of \nopposite sex, do it with love and with concern and of course with the \ngoals that every act of love has. That is what separates human beings \nfrom animals. I suggest to the Navy that they act like human beings and \nnot like animals.\n  I want to put this whole thing in a different context because the \nlatest tremors concern the future career of this Navy Commander, Robert \nStumpf. Commander Stumpf's promotion to the rank of captain has been \nblocked, and properly so. The committee remains opposed to the \npromotion because Commander Stumpf is suspected of inappropriate \nbehavior, as I described at this Tailhook convention.\n  Last week, under intense pressure and lobbying, the committee \nreexamined the promotion one more time, and the outcome was sustained. \nCommander Stumpf is off the promotion list and will stay off. I said 2 \nweeks ago that I support the committee's action, and I support their \nreconsideration by taking no action.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, I do not think we have heard the last \nfrom Commander Stumpf. A recent report in the Washington Times suggests \nthat Commander Stumpf's name will be on the 1997 captain's promotion \nlist. Now the good commander is suing Secretary of the Navy Dalton for \nhelping the Senate to improperly block his promotion.\n  Commander Stumpf's predicament is a sign of a much bigger problem. It \nis the ``problem of naval leadership,'' as one naval aviator put it \nrecently. The Navy's leadership problem neither begins nor ends with \nCommander Stumpf. The root cause of the problem may be much higher up \nin the chain of command. I believe the Navy's leadership problem may \nlie at the very top, with people like Secretary Dalton and the Chief of \nNaval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda.\n  Mr. Dalton and Admiral Boorda should have been flagged--just like \nCommander Stumpf was--when their promotions came up here to be at these \nhighest ranks. Unresolved issues in their past raise questions about \ntheir integrity and their ability to lead the Navy. The adverse \ninformation in their background should have been exposed to public \nscrutiny and debated, but that did not happen.\n  Surely these troublesome facts lay buried in Government files \nsomewhere during the confirmation process. We were sleeping at the \nswitch when they were slipped quietly through the Senate confirmation \nnet. Mr. President, we had no reason to ask questions about Mr. Dalton. \nMr. Dalton was presented to the Senate as a financial wizard with \nextensive business and managerial experience. He got a green light \ninstead of a red warning flag that his wizardry deserved.\n  Mr. Dalton was confirmed on July 21, 1993. Exactly 1 year later, the \ndamaging information in Mr. Dalton's background began leaking into the \npublic domain. The New York Times ran a front-page story on July 22nd, \n1994. It was written by Mr. Jeff Gerth. This is how it began:\n\n       When President Clinton announced that he had picked John H. \n     Dalton to be Secretary of the Navy, he praised the nominee's \n     true leadership ability as a Texas businessman.\n\n  As Mr. Gerth pointed out, ``There was a part of Mr. Dalton's \nbackground that most Senators were unaware of.''\n  His leadership was not advertised. We did not know he was deeply \ninvolved in the management of at least two failed savings and loan \ninstitutions. Mr. Dalton's S's were bailed out at the cost to the \ntaxpayers of $100 million.\n  As president of one S institution, Mr. Dalton was threatened with a \nsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for violating State \nand Federal laws and for gross negligence. The institution's insurance \ncompanies had to pay $3.8 million to settle a civil suit.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is very damaging information, I believe. It \nraises questions about the Secretary's integrity and his ability to \nlead the Navy. How did he skate right through confirmation without red \nwarning flags? Commander Stumpf got the flag treatment for the big \nquestion marks in his file, and rightly so. Why did Mr. Dalton not get \nflagged and confronted?\n  We had an identical experience with Admiral Boorda's nomination. He, \ntoo, slipped right through the confirmation net. Admiral Boorda should \nhave been flagged. Admiral Boorda was confirmed on April 1, 1994. About \n2 months later I picked up a newspaper and saw this headline, ``Court \nSays Navy Brass Shielded Official's Son: Lenient Treatment is the \nLatest Plight in the System.'' That is a headline. This report appeared \nin the Washington Post June\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\n15, 1994. It was written by Mr. Barton Gellman.\n  Mr. Gellman's report went on to say, ``Some of those criticized by \nthe court in the case remain in important posts. Among them is Admiral \nBoorda.'' That really bothered me, so I got the court document and read \nit. I was truly dismayed by what I saw--a bunch of senior naval \nofficers behaving in dishonest ways. So I came to the floor of this \nbody, and on June 28, 1994, spoke on this subject. If the people are \nwondering what I spoke about a year ago on this subject, they can find \nit in the Congressional Record S7744 to S7745. Those are the pages.\n  My concern about Admiral Boorda's character comes directly from that \nmilitary court document. Specifically, an opinion by the United States \nNavy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review in the case of the United \nStates versus Chad E. Kelly, U.S. Navy. The document is dated June 13, \n1994.\n  This was a clear-cut case of command influence and abuse of command \nauthority.\n  The court document clearly indicates that Admiral Boorda may have \ninterfered with a criminal investigation. Now, Admiral Boorda claims he \nwas unaware of the suspect's criminal activities when he had him \ntransferred to his own headquarters. That may be. The suspect was a \nlow-ranking enlisted man who happened to be Navy Secretary Garrett's \nson. He was suspected of drug use, larceny, credit card fraud, receipt \nof stolen property, and lying under oath. That is very heavy stuff.\n  Once Admiral Boorda realized criminal behavior was involved, Garrett \nshould have been ordered back to the scene of the crime--consistent \nwith common Navy practice. But that did not happen. Why not?\n  Now, Mr. President, this brings me back to Commander Stumpf. We \nshould not be surprised, when Commander Stumpf sets a bad example. A \nfollower likes to imitate a leader's behavior. He is not blind. He sees \nthe big boys abusing the system, doing bad things, and getting rewarded \nfor it. So he figures it should be OK for him to do it as well.\n  No aspect of leadership is more powerful than setting a good example. \nIf the Secretary and Chief of Naval Operations expect integrity, \ndiscipline, courage, and competence from their followers, then they \nmust demonstrate those very same qualities themselves. Herein lies the \ncrux of the Navy leadership problem.\n  Mr. Dalton and Admiral Boorda demand excellence from Commander \nStumpf, but failed to deliver it themselves. ``Flagging'' is good for \njunior officers, but somehow not for admirals and above. That attitude \ndoes not sit well with junior officers. The big boys are asking their \ntroops to do something they are unwilling to do themselves, and that \njust does not work.\n  So we cannot begin to address shortcomings in the leadership at \nCommander Stumpf's level until those at the top, like Mr. Dalton and \nAdmiral Boorda, set an example of excellence in their personal \nbehavior.\n  I suggest, once again, that as far as what went on at the Tailhook \nscandal, I want to remind the Navy that those things are things that \nare done in the animal kingdom, and human beings should not be involved \nin that sort of sexual behavior.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2846-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2847-S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to express some conflicting \nfeelings here this morning about the bill we are about to go to. I know \nthe Senator from Alaska understands this because we have been talking \nand working together on the Presidio for quite some time.\n  The Presidio legislation that is about to be before us--if it simply \nwas the Presidio and other environmental issues that were not \ncontroversial, this would be one of my happiest days since I came to \nthe Senate, because, for me, the Presidio bill is so close to my heart. \nMr. President, I represented, for many years, the congressional \ndistrict in which the Presidio sits. Years ago, Congressman Phil \nBurton, looking at the Presidio, said, ``If the gates ever close, we \nwould not want to lose this extraordinary resource.'' Back in the early \n1980's--actually, I stand corrected, in 1972, Congressman Burton's \nlegislation creating the Golden Gate Recreation Area and the Presidio \nwas passed. The law provided that the Presidio would become a national \npark when it was no longer needed by the Army.\n  In 1988, when the Base Closure Commission recommended the closure, \nthe law kicked in and triggered this incredible new park called the \nPresidio for the people of this country.\n  So why do I say that I am faced with such a terrible conflict here? \nIt is because, rather than just voting this Presidio legislation up or \ndown--which, by the way, we can do in 10 seconds because everybody \nagrees it is so important; it sets up a trust, and that would enable us \nto use the buildings on the park to create revenue to keep the park in \ngood shape and to keep it safe and beautiful--we have this tangled up \nin the Utah wilderness conflict.\n  I suppose there are those who say, well, that is just the way it is \ndone. Well, I simply do not buy that. If we really want to make \nprogress here, if we really want to cut through the gridlock, what \nbetter chance do we have than to pull out this Utah wilderness bill--\nwhich is so controversial that it deserves its own separate attention--\nand pass these other environmental measures that are so important to \nthe people of the country? We could do that in a minute.\n  I want to give you my feelings as to how much work has gone into this \nPresidio legislation. I already told you that the vision was \nestablished in the 1970's, and in the 1980's when the Presidio was \nclosed, we all realized at that moment that it would become a glorious \npark. We also knew that funds were not there to keep it in the pristine \ncondition. We figured out a way, with Congresswoman Pelosi's \nleadership, and Senator Feinstein and I working with many others, we \nintroduced the bill that would set up a trust. Everyone agrees that it \nis a wonderful idea.\n  I want to compliment Senator Murkowski for coming out to the Presidio \non more than one occasion to meet with the people. Senator Campbell has \nbeen a key person working on this. Senator Chafee went out to visit the \nPresidio. Perhaps, for me, the most rewarding thing happened when \nSenator Dole went out and, in fact, agreed this was the way to go.\n  So we did something here that we did not think was possible. We \nreached across party lines and we agreed on an approach for the \nPresidio that both Democrats and Republicans could support. Did it have \neverything that this Senator wanted? No. Did it have everything that \nthe Senator from Alaska wanted? No. Clearly, we would have written it a \nlittle bit differently. But we worked together and we got a wonderful \nbill.\n  It is hard for me to imagine why it now has to get caught up in this \ntangle with the Utah wilderness bill, other than the fact that there \nare those who are pushing that bill and feel the only way they can pass \nit is to get it on the Presidio train.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from California \nthat the 5-minute limit has been exceeded.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So we have a national historic landmark. Five hundred \nbuildings are on the National Register of Historic Buildings. We need \nto make sure that these buildings do not deteriorate and make sure we \nget the revenues to support the Presidio. Today, what are we faced \nwith? The best of bills and the worst of bills--in one bill. It is like \nthe Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde approach here. We take a wonderful piece of \nlegislation, the Presidio trust bill, and everyone supports it from \nboth parties, the whole spectrum, and it gets hooked to this Utah \nwilderness.\n  I hope, Mr. President, a couple of things will occur today in the \ntime that we have. No. 1, I hope we take the Utah wilderness bill out \nof this omnibus bill. It deserves its own debate. Right now, 3.3 \nmillion acres of that Utah wilderness are basically under protection. \nIf this bill passes, half of those acres are going to lose protection. \nHow can we even call it a Utah wilderness bill? Clearly, it puts the\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nSenators from California in a very, very difficult position.\n  So I hope we can move this Presidio on its own. Senator Dole and \nSenator Daschle both agree--they both cosponsor this bill--that it \ncould be moved in a moment by a unanimous-consent request. Let us not \nload it down with a bill that has serious, serious problems.\n  I hope we can get to the point where this is truly a celebration for \nthe people of California, that we can have our bill, have it stand \nalone, and take up the controversial matters independently.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address a few of the points \nthat were made yesterday by the distinguished Senators from Utah on the \nunderlying wilderness bill. First, there is the assertion that S. 884, \nthat we are now dealing with, had been fixed, particularly that the \nrelease language had been fixed, been modified.\n  It has been modified somewhat, I think, to reflect the debate in the \nEnergy Committee but despite all the changes the amended version just \ndrops the requirement that the released lands shall be managed for \n``nonwilderness multiple purposes'' and substitutes a full range of \nuses--not much difference. However, the amendment still says that the \nlands released ``shall not be managed for the purpose of protecting \ntheir suitability for wilderness designation.''\n  The previous version of the bill as reported out was a kind of belt \nand suspenders approach to release. It had two protections against \nfurther wilderness designation. The revised version still leaves the \nbelt even though the suspenders have been removed. It still remains an \nunprecedented provision in wilderness bills.\n  Next, the protected areas. Is it fair to say that almost 20 million \nacres have been released and can now be exploited? The distinguished \nSenator from Utah questioned whether you could say that, but both \nversions of the bill as reported and as amended find that all public \nlands in the State of Utah administered by the BLM have been adequately \nstudied for wilderness designation. This eliminates further \nconsideration of approximately 20 million acres.\n  There are other problems which I will not get into at this stage, but \nI would like to just focus on the acreage where the distinguished \nSenators from Utah have asserted that plenty of land in the Kaiparowits \nPlateau and other areas, plenty of land has already been protected--\n125,000 acres in Kaiparowits and 110,000 in Dirty Devil Canyon--but the \npoint is what is not protected. There are about 525,000 acres in \nKaiparowits that were in the House bill and 152,000 acres in the Dirty \nDevil area. So the question is not what is protected but what is not \nprotected, particularly on the Kaiparowits Plateau.\n  The proponents of the bill have basically constantly referred to the \nHouse bill which is 5.7 million acres. I am not pushing 5.7 million \nacres. I have not introduced a bill that advocates 5.7 million acres, \nnor has any such bill been introduced. I am simply concerned that 2 \nmillion acres is far too little to protect out of 22 million acres of \nBLM land. I am concerned that all the remaining land would be \npermanently released from consideration as wilderness. But once again I \nam not saying that 5.7 is the right number. Keep in mind that it is 3.2 \nmillion acres that are currently protected as wilderness.\n\n  Also, the Senators from Utah should recognize that if the Utah \nwilderness bill does not pass or is vetoed, the result will not be that \n5.7 million acres are protected. Instead, for the time being, the 3.2 \nmillion will remain protected for study and a new recommendation will \nhave to be developed.\n  Third, there is the assertion that acreage is an issue for Utah to \nresolve. I would argue that acreage is far from the only issue here. In \nfact, there are many other issues that should be of great concern to \nother Senators and to other taxpayers.\n  As to the hard release language, as I said, the belt is still there \neven though the suspenders have been removed. The land exchange \nprovision should be of concern to taxpayers since the State is going to \nlikely give up land of little value in exchange for very valuable \nFederal land on which they will want to mine coal, according to the \nAssistant Secretary. The exceptions to traditional wilderness rules for \nmotor vehicle, also to water rights language, all are very ominous \nprecedents.\n  And finally there is the assertion that there was nothing wrong with \nthe BLM inventory process. The distinguished Senator from Utah \nbasically said that this was not the case, and he quoted Jim Parker, a \nformer Utah BLM State director, to support the assertion that the BLM's \ninventory was not seriously flawed. Mr. Parker has made statements \nsupporting the BLM wilderness inventory and has been cited as an \nexpert. However, Mr. Parker did not work on the BLM in Utah during the \ninventory but was living in Washington, DC, at the time.\n  I think it should be clear what the BLM's position is on this bill. \nYesterday, I received a letter from Bob Armstrong, the Assistant \nSecretary of Lands, Minerals and Management, that supports the view \nthat the BLM officials recognize the Utah BLM process was in fact \nflawed. Mr. Armstrong says:\n\n       I am told by professional career staff at all levels of the \n     organization that the Utah wilderness process was the most \n     controversial, and perhaps the most political, in the entire \n     BLM wilderness process.\n\n  The letter goes on to state:\n\n       It is the position of the BLM that far too little land is \n     protected under this bill and too much land is released for \n     development. In short, no one should be claiming the support \n     of the Bureau of Land Management and its professional staff--\n\n  No one should be claiming BLM support--\n\n     for S. 884.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Armstrong be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Bill Bradley\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bradley: I understand you will shortly be \n     considering whether to include S. 884, the ``Utah Public \n     Lands Management Act of 1995,'' in an omnibus package of \n     parks legislation. I would like to clarify the record with \n     respect to the position of the Bureau of Land Management and \n     the Department of the Interior on the subject of the acreage \n     covered in this bill.\n       In 1991, President Bush forwarded his recommendation that \n     1.9 million acres of Utah lands be immediately protected as \n     wilderness. The Congress did not act on that recommendation \n     and President Clinton did not adopt it when he came into \n     office. Interestingly, President Bush did not support the \n     ``hard release'' of the rest of Utah's lands, as is proposed \n     in this bill, and neither does the Clinton Administration.\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\n       Last July, Deputy Assistant Secretary Sylvia Baca testified \n     before the Senate regarding the numerous problems with this \n     legislation. She testified that the Bush proposal of 1.9 \n     million acres is ``inadequate to protect Utah's great \n     wilderness resources.'' In fact, S. 884 would remove \n     protections for some 300,000 acres recommended for wilderness \n     by President Bush.\n       Nevertheless, some supporters of the legislation have \n     repeatedly sought to portray the position of the previous \n     Administration as that held by the Bureau of Land Management, \n     or to claim that ``field professionals'' independently and \n     objectively formulated the previous Administration's \n     position. This is not the case. I am told by professional \n     career staff at all levels of the organization that the Utah \n     wilderness process was the most controversial, and perhaps \n     the most political, in the entire BLM wilderness process.\n       It is the position of the Bureau of Land Management that \n     far too little land is protected under this bill and too much \n     land is released for development. In short, no one should be \n     claiming the support of the Bureau and its professional staff \n     for S. 884.\n       We have reviewed the most recent changes proposed by the \n     bill sponsors and find that the same basic problems exist: \n     too little designated, too much opened to development, \n     unprecedented ``hard release'' language, reduced protections \n     inside wilderness, and unprecedented land exchange language. \n     The Secretary has indicated--most recently in a March 15, \n     1996, letter to Senator Murkowski--that he would recommend \n     the President veto legislation carrying the text of S. 884. \n     It continues to be my hope that the core problems of this \n     bill can be fixed so the President receives legislation he \n     can sign.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Bob Armstrong,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                     Land and Minerals Management.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I remind my colleagues that there are 33 titles to this \nbill. I personally would have no objection to moving almost all 33, and \nwe already have a veto threat in the form of a letter from the \nSecretary, and yesterday also we have a statement of administration \npolicy from the Executive Office of the President also being very clear \non that issue.\n  I hope we will be able to recognize that this Utah wilderness bill is \nfar from complete and that there are many things that need to be done \nbefore it could be thought to be a true wilderness bill.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just as a matter of a point of \ninformation, on yesterday when there was the announcement of the \nRepublican leader, which is on page S. 2839, in the Program, Mr. Lott \nsaid, ``For the information of all Senators, the Senate will resume the \nPresidio legislation tomorrow morning with the understanding that \nSenator Daschle or his designee will be prepared to offer an amendment \nat 10:30.''\n  I am his designee, and I was prepared to offer the amendment at \n10:30. The amendment I was going to offer was the increase in the \nminimum wage. I was offering it for myself, my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, Senator Wellstone, and others.\n  This was not in order, I want to make it very clear. So it was not \nconsent, but it was an understanding about the way we were going to \nproceed. Now, as a result of our indication to try to get a debate on \nthe increase on the minimum wage, and hopefully some action on the \nminimum wage, we have been put into this holding pattern to effectively \ndeny us that opportunity for debate and discussion about increasing the \nwages for working families, some 13 million working families in this \ncountry.\n  What we are being faced with is another procedural effort by our \nRepublican friends to deny the Senate taking action on this issue. This \nis a similar kind of avoidance by the Senate that we saw on July 31, \nwhen we voted 48 to 49 on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution; again on \nOctober 27, 1995, 51-48 to override a budget point of order on the \nissue on the minimum wage, raised by my colleague, Senator Kerry.\n  We had a hearing on this issue on December 14, 1995. We have not had \nthe markup. We have not reported anything out. We were prepared to \ndebate this issue, which is of such fundamental importance and fairness \nto working families in this country. Now we are caught up in a \nprocedural situation where we are, at least at this time, foreclosed \nfrom being able to offer it.\n  I can even foresee the possibilities where that will continue in the \nafternoon, as we are coming down to the line for a cloture motion to be \nvoted on tomorrow, where those, under the current situation, under the \nright of recognition, will be able to offer an amendment and then offer \nanother amendment right on top of that and virtually foreclose our \nopportunity to speak for working families, the 13 million working \nfamilies who have not experienced any increase since 1991 and have seen \nthe real value of that minimum wage deteriorate by some 40 percent.\n  So we are seeing the commitment of our Republican friends, and \nRepublican leadership, which cannot be separated from the Republican \nwho is on the ballot out in the State of California, Senator Dole, as \nwell as the Republican leadership, saying on the issue of worker \nfairness, we are not even going to permit you to vote on that or \naddress that on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are going to use all \nthe parliamentary means of denying working families the chance to get \nany kind of increase in that minimum wage.\n  At a time when CEO salaries have gone up 23 percent and we are having \nrecord profits in 1995; again, 1991, of 23 percent--we are refusing to \npermit the Senate of the United States to even address this issue, to \nvote on this issue--an issue which will mean some $1,800 for working \nfamilies. This is an issue which will affect 13 million working \nfamilies. It will be the equivalent of a year's tuition in a 2-year \ncollege; 9 months of groceries, 8 months of utilities for working \nfamilies. We are seeing, at a time when the disparity between the \nwealthiest workers and families and poorest families has been growing \nand growing and growing, the small, modest step to try to do something \nfor working families, families that work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year, trying to make it--we are seeing we are effectively being \nclosed out. You cannot interpret the kinds of actions we have heard \nhere this morning to be anything else.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to point out, because I am on limited time on \nthis\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nmorning hour--hopefully we will have additional time during the debate \ngoing before the break--this has not been a partisan issue, \nhistorically. There have only been two Presidents, Presidents Reagan \nand Ford--they are the only two Republican Presidents who have not \nsupported an increase in the minimum wage. President Eisenhower \nsupported it, President Nixon supported it, President Bush supported \nit. The last time we had an increase, Republicans supported it. Bob \nDole supported it. Newt Gingrich supported it.\n  At that time, we had a Democratic Congress and a Republican \nPresident. Now we have Republican Congress and a Democratic President. \nAnd we ask: Why? Why is it that we cannot, at least, debate this issue? \nAnd why is it that we cannot afford to provide working families with a \nlivable wage?\n  Mr. President, I hope we are not going to hear our Republican friends \ntalk about their concern for working families in this country when \nsomething that we can do, here on the floor of the U.S. Senate today, \nand the House of Representatives can do in a matter of hours, that can \nmake a difference to the lives and well-being of those--that we are \nbeing denied the opportunity to face this issue, to debate the issue, \nto talk about the issue, to take on the issues which have been raised \nagainst the increase --the questions of inflation, the question of job \nloss.\n  All of those issues which we have debated and discussed at other \ntimes, we are prepared today, with our colleagues, to debate those \nhere. But we are back at a situation where those who lay the agenda out \nfor the American people in the U.S. Senate, absolutely refuse to give \nthe American working families the opportunity to be heard on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, as we have said before, Senator Kerry, Senator \nWellstone and others have said before, this issue is not going away. \nThis issue is not going away. We have seen the parliamentary maneuvers \nto deny us an opportunity to take action. We have seen that before. We \nknow it is out there again today.\n  I do not understand what it is. Yes, I could understand. It is, \nagain, the power of special financial interests, the special interests \nthat just refuse to let working families in this country be treated \nfairly, equitably, and decently. Finally, this is an issue about women, \nsince 70 percent of all of those who get the minimum wage are women, \nand it is an issue about children, whether they are going to grow up in \nhouseholds that are going to be decently fed and clothed, and in a \nsetting which is humane and decent. This is not just an issue about \nmen. It is an issue about women and it is an issue about children. It \nis an issue about families. We will not be silenced and we will not be \ndenied. We are going to continue to press this. I am absolutely \nconvinced that the working families in this country will be heard and \nwe will have a successful vote.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, for his leadership in this effort, and Senator \nWellstone and others who believe that the moment has really come for us \nto confront the reality of the rhetoric in Washington that talks about \nworker anxiety, that pays lip service to addressing the problem of \ndownsizing and to the problem of the transformation in the American \nworkplace.\n  Countless Senators, on both sides of the aisle, have come to the \nfloor on many different occasions and talked about the difficulties \nthat the American worker faces today.\n  In the Republican primaries, it became a major issue as Pat Buchanan \nfocused on the anger that is coming out of those workers who work \nharder and harder and harder, play by the rules, pay their taxes, try \nto make ends meet, teach their kids, and yet they cannot get ahead.\n  We have an opportunity in the U.S. Senate to ratify what the Senate \nhas already expressed. Fifty-one U.S. Senators already voted last year, \nsaying they want to vote on a proposal to increase the minimum wage. \nThe minimum wage is worth less now than it was when those 51 Senators \nwho voted said we need to raise it.\n  The Republican majority has the opportunity to set the agenda of the \nSenate and, to some degree, thereby, the agenda of the country. As my \ncolleague from Massachusetts said, this is their statement about their \nagenda. Their agenda is to not even let the U.S. Senate debate this and \nhave an up-or-down vote on whether or not a majority of the U.S. Senate \nthinks it is time to raise the minimum wage.\n  Increasing the minimum wage is not a great breaking of new ground in \nthis country. In 1938, we passed a minimum wage and set it at 25 cents. \nIn 1938, we came to a consensus in America that we ought to pay people \na minimum base standard of living by which they ought to be able to \nwork and achieve the American dream. Every year since 1938, when that \nwage dipped below because of inflation and changes in the marketplace, \nwe raised the minimum wage. Democrat and Republican alike joined \ntogether to raise the minimum wage. The last time we raised it was \n1989, and I think there were something like 86 or 89 votes in the U.S. \nSenate to raise it to the current level of $4.25.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder, given the bipartisan support since 1938, can \nthe Senator answer the question for me, what would be the basis now for \nthe opposition of the majority leader, Senator Dole, and others in \npreventing us from even having this amendment out on the floor and \nhaving an up-or-down vote? Does the Senator have any idea, given this \nbipartisan support, given how important it is to working families, \ngiven the fact we have heard the majority leader campaign around the \ncountry about the importance of working families and fairness, what \nwould be the basis of opposition to our having this amendment on the \nfloor and having this debate? Does the Senator have any idea?\n  Mr. KERRY. I must confess to the Senator from Minnesota, I do not \nunderstand that. I cannot understand why Senator Dole, who previously \nvoted to raise the minimum wage, would not want to raise the minimum \nwage above what soon will be a 40-year low in purchasing power. The \nminimum wage in this country soon will be at a 40-year low. The poverty \nlevel in America is $12,500 for a family of three. It is $15,150 for a \nfamily of four. On a minimum wage, you can earn $8,500, three-quarters \nthe level of poverty for a family of three, and only about half the \npoverty level for a family of four.\n  I honestly do not know why the Senator from Kansas, the majority \nleader, the nominee-to-be of the Republican Party, would not want to \nsee the minimum wage raised, particularly since he has previously \njoined in the bipartisan effort to try to do that. I do not have an \nanswer. Maybe my colleague has an answer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I can ask one other question, because I am trying \nto understand the disconnect between politics in Washington today where \nat least for the moment you have a Presidential candidate, the majority \nleader, who does not seem to want us to have a debate on this versus \nwhat we hear back in our States.\n  In Massachusetts, as you visit with families and spend time in \ncommunities, do you find that people talk a lot about the importance of \njobs, of decent wages and raising the minimum wage? Is this an issue \nthat you hear about all the time from people you represent?\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Minnesota, when you talk to \nworking people in Massachusetts and when you talk to almost anybody--\nwhite-collar workers, people who have good jobs in our high-technology \neconomy, people who are part of our financial services industry, which \nis one of the strongest in the Nation--I would say 80 percent of the \npeople believe that workers at the bottom rung of the economic ladder \nought to be able to secure income from their work that is at least \nequal to the poverty level. That is all we are asking for here.\n  As an example, to answer your question specifically, a fellow named \nNeil Donovan, who runs something called Project Impact, which is a \nMassachusetts organization that puts homeless people into jobs, has \nsaid that a job placement at the minimum wage is, in\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nfact, a recipe for failure. That is the experience of someone who runs \na homeless shelter and wants to help those in the shelter to move \ntoward self-sufficiency.\n  Why is that? I can tell you, using as examples people who live in \nhomeless shelters. There is a fellow about whom I have talked recently \nwho lost his job. He is now in a homeless shelter. Four months ago, he \nfound a new job. He is working as a stock clerk, doing errands in a \nsmall operation. He is working at the minimum wage, and at the end of \nthe week, he brings home $132.50. He proudly brings this $132.50 back \nto the homeless shelter in which he still lives, because even the full \n$132.50 is too little to be able to pay for the smallest, cheapest \nstudio apartment in the city of Boston.\n  That amount does not begin to pay for health care. If you are a \nparent of a young child, it does not pay for day care. It does not pay \nthe food bills for the month, after you have paid for the rent. We are \ntalking about fundamental subsistence here.\n  Corporations have seen their revenues increase 12 percent or more, \nbut the total personal income of the country as a whole, taking all \nincomes into account, has only gone up 2 percent. And we know that even \nthis increase was not evenly distributed across the income spectrum. \nThe incomes that increased were mostly at the upper level.\n  Here in the Congress we have a lot of people earning 10 times the \npoverty level. Ten times the poverty level we earn in the U.S. \nCongress, and the Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate is unwilling \nto raise the income level for those who are working at three-quarters \nof the poverty level and one-tenth of the salary of Senators.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask the Senator two more questions?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So what the Senator is saying is that right now, $4.25 \nan hour, what happens is that with a family, you have somebody working \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year and still not making poverty wages.\n  If we were to raise this minimum wage in the amendment we want to \noffer, I think the senior Senator from Massachusetts said this would be \nan additional $1,800. I know what this means to a family in Minnesota, \nbut for a working family in Massachusetts, what does that mean? What \ndoes $1,800 mean?\n  Let us talk in real people terms so that people understand this is \nnot some party strategy, this is about people's lives, and we think \nthis is critically important to do. As of the moment, we cannot even \nget our colleagues on the other side to debate. What does this mean to \npeople in Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KERRY. To a family in Massachusetts, say a single parent with two \nkids, that spends about 60 bucks a week on groceries, this means a \ndifference of 7 months groceries. What we are talking about is 7 months \nof food for the adult who is the combination breadwinner and parent and \nthe two children. Obviously, if you can buy the 7 months of groceries, \nyou then may also be able to move some of the money you had been \nspending on food to pay the heating bill, pay the rent, pay the \nutilities, or, if you are lucky enough to own a home, pay the mortgage. \nBut, of course, you are very unlikely to own a home if the family's \nincome depends on a minimum-wage job.\n  But there are many Americans who are hampered in what jobs they can \nget because they do not have transportation. Often that is the \ndifference--being able to travel by some means from home to a job. An \nincrease in the minimum wage easily could enable a worker to afford \ntransportation, maybe a $3,000 used car, so you can travel beyond the \nconfines of an area where there are not a lot of jobs, and find a \nbetter job.\n  There are many people with whom I talk in Massachusetts who are \nlimited in their ability to get a decent job by their inability to be \nable to get to the job. As we are seeing more and more reductions in \ntransit subsidies, bus routes are being cut, the fares are going up. \nPeople are actually written out of jobs because they cannot get to \nthem.\n  But let me just make one further point to my colleague, and then I \nwill yield the floor to him. All of this is not really that \ncomplicated. You hear the same arguments every time. Oh, if you raise \nthe minimum wage, all those kids in the work force or who want to come \ninto the work force are going to be denied jobs. But the truth is, we \nare not talking about kids. We are talking about adults. More than 70 \npercent of the people working on minimum wage are adults. More than \ntwo-thirds of them are women. These are working families that are \naffected here.\n  The argument is made that, oh, we are going to lose jobs if we raise \nthat minimum wage. Well, there are at least 12 studies, several of them \nin the last couple of years, that refute that argument. A couple of \nthese studies were done in New Jersey because New Jersey raised its \nminimum wage. You heard all the same arguments about New Jersey. And \nNew Jersey experienced an increase in jobs.\n  Can anyone look around America in any year in which we have raised \nthe minimum wage and say that doing so held us back--that it hurt our \neconomy or cost us jobs? Can you look around this country and suggest \nthat we have not created more jobs and raised people's incomes while we \nprovided that income floor which guaranteed that American workers are \nnot going to be exploited?\n  Mr. President, let us be honest about the history of what happened in \nour Nation. Go back and read the ``Grapes of Wrath.'' Go back through \nthe history of the labor movement. Are we going to pretend that the \ngains for America's workers came spontaneously? Did they come out of \nthe goodness of the hearts of managers or owners of the coal mines or \nthe steel mills or the railroads of this Nation? No.\n  Everybody knows the sacrifices that the labor movement had to make, \nand that people lost their lives. People were shut out, people were \nstarved, people were hit over the head, knees were broken. People were \nkilled because workers had to fight for the right to be able to get a \ndecent wage. There was even a time, believe it or not--how amazing--\nwhen people had to strike because they thought that they should not \nwork more than 8 hours a day. Remember the exploitation of child labor? \nRemember the various diseases, the inhumane working conditions?\n  So through the years we have reached a point in America where we \nthought we had a fundamental understanding about what was fair. Now you \nhave people working at the minimum wage who are earning only three-\nquarters or half the level of poverty for their families. And we have a \nparty that believes that those of us elected to try to make these \nchoices in Washington should not have the right on the floor of the \nSenate to have an up-or-down vote on a proposal to increase that \nminimum wage. It is very simple. In this body, 51 votes is the measure \nof what we do. In this case, 51 votes is the measure of whether \nAmericans working at the minimum wage will receive a raise.\n  The chief executive officers of this country have not had a hard time \ngetting raises. When 40,000 people are laid off at AT, the stock goes \nup and the chief executive can walk away with millions of dollars in \nadditional compensation. What happens to those workers who were the \nvictims of the downsizing? Well, maybe they have a skill level where \nthey will break into another job. But for those people at the very \nbottom rung of the ladder, they are not going to have a chance to reach \nthe next rung, or even to stay on the bottom rung, unless we lift their \nliving standard and give them a raise.\n  When one examines the ratio of salaries of chief executive officers \nto salaries of their companies' wage earners, the ratio has moved from \n50 to 1, where it remained for decades in this country, to over several \nhundred to one today. It just seems incomprehensible to me, Mr. \nPresident, that we should be even debating whether we should give the \nworkers on the bottom rung of the ladder a raise, especially when the \npurchasing power of their current wage is at a 40-year low. That is \nwhat this is all about. I hope that our colleagues will join with us in \nour traditional bipartisan approach on this issue and raise the minimum \nwage in this country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privilege \nof the floor be granted to Paul Mazur during the duration of the debate \non this bill\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to thank both my colleagues from Massachusetts. Let me \njust get back to basics. This amendment that I thought we were going to \nlay down this morning is simple and straightforward. It would increase \nthe minimum wage, the Federal minimum wage from the current $4.25 an \nhour to $5.15 an hour over the next 2 years. That is all. Mr. \nPresident, 90 cents over 2 years, no indexing to adjust for the cost of \nliving, no other things to complicate the debate.\n\n  A straightforward proposition--raise the Federal minimum wage from \n$4.25 an hour for working families in our country, to $5.15 an hour \nover 2 years, and 90 cents over 2 years. For some reason my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, at least as of this morning, do not \nwant us to be able to lay this amendment out on the floor of the Senate \nand have the debate and vote for it up or down.\n  I would just say to my colleagues, that this is simple, this is \nstraightforward. My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, talked \nabout CEO salaries. Let me just be blunt. The U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate sure as heck voted themselves a \nhuge raise, an increase from about $100,000 a few years ago to $130,000 \na year. I heard my colleagues tell me that, you know, you have kids in \ncollege and there is additional expenses and all of the rest.\n  Fair enough. But if the U.S. Senate can vote for a salary increase \nfrom $100,000 to $130,000 a year--and the House took the action \nearlier--do you not think it is about time we are willing to raise the \nminimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour over 2 years? Do you \nnot think it is about time that we would be willing to raise the \nminimum wage by 90 cents over 2 years?\n  Mr. President, I do not know what the majority leader plans on doing. \nBut it does seem to me that we have now reached the point where \nregardless of the strategies and regardless of whatever parliamentary \nruling there might be, it is going to be very difficult for Senators to \nessentially finesse this issue. Because while we are putting off the \ndebate, at least for the moment, there are many Americans who have to \nlive with this minimum wage. We are putting the debate off on the \nminimum wage this morning, while many Americans have to live with it. \nFor 200,000 working people and their families in Minnesota, this is an \nextremely important issue.\n  Later on, Mr. President, when we get to the debate, I will talk about \npeople. I do not want it to be abstract. But let me just tell you, \nwhether it is a single parent working or whether it is two parents \nworking, this debate about the minimum wage, this effort to raise the \nminimum wage, is absolutely key toward providing people with a ladder \nto get into the middle class. This is a fundamental economic justice \nquestion. I will just say one more time, I came to the floor about \n10:30. I thought we had an understanding that we would go forward with \nthis amendment.\n  My hope is that after the caucuses meet at lunch we will be able to \ndo so, that we will be able to lay down our amendment, that we will \nhave debate on this amendment, and that Senators will be accountable, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. Because I will tell you; in Minnesota, \nthe cafe discussion is whether or not your children are going to be \nable to find jobs at a decent wage. The cafe discussion is whether or \nnot you can pay your mortgage payment or whether you can pay your rent. \nThe cafe discussion is whether you can afford to send your kids to \ncollege. The cafe discussion is on the economic squeeze that families \nfeel.\n  The vast majority of people in Minnesota and the vast majority of \npeople all across this country want to see us take action on this.\n  I say one more time, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives did not seem to have any problem in voting ourselves a \nhuge pay increase. Do you not think it is about time we vote for a pay \nincrease for working families in this country, and set some kind of \ndecent, humane, compassionate minimum wage floor for working men and \nwomen and their children?\n  That is what this is about. I do not think anybody is going to be \nable to hide from this debate. I do not think there is going to be any \nway of maneuvering around this debate. I am just speaking for myself. I \nam not even speaking for my two colleagues from Massachusetts. But I \nintend to be a part of this effort to introduce this amendment over and \nover and over again.\n\n  You cannot duck. You cannot hide. It is an important economic issue. \nIt is an important economic opportunity issue. It is all about working \nmen and women and their children. It is all about economic justice. It \nis all about fairness. And it is time we get serious about these kinds \nof issues in the U.S. Senate. I hope this afternoon after lunch we will \nhave the opportunity to lay down our amendment and then we will have \nthis debate. Then we will have a positive, affirmative vote for working \nmen, women, and children in the State of Minnesota. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the time is divided. I am just \nwondering--I want to have a few more moments for a statement I want to \nmake between now and 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, his side has 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, why we wanted to have the opportunity to \naddress this issue is because, as this chart shows, between 1979 and \n1993, this shows what has happened to real family income during this \nperiod of time.\n  This body is familiar with what happened before 1979 from the postwar \nperiod from 1949 up to 1979. Virtually each of these columns all moved \nup together up to about 100 percent improvement in the family income \ngrowth. Virtually at every level of the economy everyone moved up \ntogether. We have gone through that in other debates on the minimum \nwage and we may have a chance, if there is a challenge to this, to go \ninto that in some greater detail.\n  But what we have now seen is 1979-93, the bottom fifth of the \npopulation has seen a real loss of 17 percent. I am always interested \nin how we evaluate what has happened in the median, where the median \nis. If you take the median as for the highest wages and the highest \nprofits and the highest growth of the wealthiest families and the least \nyou come out somewhere in the middle.\n  But the fact of the matter is that is not a good indication of what \nis happening to those on the bottom rung of the ladder. They are the \nones that have fallen furthest behind from 1990 to 1993. This is the \ngroup which would be most affected and most helped and assisted with \nthe increase in the minimum wage. It would be modest. It amounts to \nabout $3.4 billion that would go to that particular group.\n  We will hear a lot about this is very inflationary. That is $3.4 \nbillion in a $5 trillion economy. That is $3.4 billion in a $5 trillion \neconomy. And they are going to talk about, well, it is inflation and it \nis going to set off all of the economy? This demonstrates what is out \nthere in terms of our colleagues who are working in America.\n  The ones that are being affected by the minimum wage, as has been \npointed out, are the ones that are working full time, 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks of the year. This chart shows what the real minimum wage is. \nThat is in the purchasing power. This continues to go. It will be the \nlowest it was since 1989.\n  In 1989, as has been pointed out in this debate, at that level, of \nRepublicans and Democrats, there were only nine Members of the U.S. \nSenate in 1989 that voted against it. And 32 Members of the Republican \nParty voted for this increase. George Bush voted for that increase. \nEffectively we are right back down to--Bob Dole voted for the increase. \nWe are right back to that level now. Plus, I think most would \nunderstand that the economy is stronger\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\ntoday than it was at that particular time.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows what is happening. The Dow-Jones \naverage, inflation adjusted, goes right up through the roof. Here it \nis. It breaks through the roof. This is what is happening with the \nstock market, the Dow-Jones average, right up through the roof. The \nreal minimum wage, inflation adjusted, the small increase here with the \n90-cent increase, right back down again. And what we are talking about \nwith this amendment would be a 90-cent increase over the next 2 years.\n  Mr. President, as has been pointed out, these are the individuals who \nare affected--16 to 19 years is 31 percent; over 20 years of age, 70 \npercent. We are talking about adults; 70 percent of the individuals are \nover 20 years of age.\n  Mr. President, this is an indication, again, as I mentioned briefly, \nabout who in our society is going to be impacted. Men represent 40 \npercent of the wage earners from $4.25 to $5.14. These are the wage \nearners that would be impacted by this increase. Again, 60 percent \nwould be women. Many of them are single women. Many of them have \nchildren. That is why I believe that this is not just----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the final 30 seconds.\n  Is not just a workers' issue; it is a women's issue and a child's \nissue.\n  Mr. President, we will have the opportunity to go on and show about \nwhat the impact has been on inflation and employment since the end of \nWorld War II. We are glad to debate this issue, to take on issues and \ngo through them and let the Senate vote its will.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will have that opportunity when the \nlegislation is going to come up under what was agreed to last evening \nto be recognized. We will offer this amendment. We hope that we will be \nable to work out an agreeable format so that we can have a real debate \non the issue and then have a final vote, find out who is on the side of \nworking families in this country.\n  My time has expired. I understand the remaining time will be \navailable to the Members of the other party and we will be back here at \n2:15 to continue this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor for the \npurpose of discussing this issue, but having listened to this \ndiscussion, I do want to remark on the bizarre nature of an argument \nwhich emphasized so strongly the outrage of the last three Senators in \nnot being permitted to debate an issue which they were, of course, \ndebating, on which they will place an amendment, when each of those \nthree Senators has been visibly engaged in the last 4 weeks in \npreventing the Senate from voting on an appropriations bill for the \nDistrict of Columbia with all of the positive impact that has on poor \npeople, law enforcement, and education in the District, and by \nfoolishly engaging at the same time in filibustering an attempt to \nbring to conclusion--to extend and bring to conclusion--the Whitewater \ninvestigation. We have not been permitted to debate these issues on \ntheir merits or to vote on their merits. For the life of me, I do not \nunderstand how that differs from the objection they are making today, \nparticularly since they will, of course, be able to bring up such an \namendment and have a debate on it.\n  I also point out, they neglected to state that all of their examples \nrelate to some 10 or 15 percent, a very small percentage, of minimum-\nwage people who are the primary supporters for their families, and that \na proposal that would obviously benefit that small handful of people \nwill have a terribly damaging effect on first jobs for teenager and \nwelfare recipients attempting to build new lives and living for \nthemselves.\n  The compassion for those people, at the beginning of their careers, \nseem to be remarkably absent in the debate we have heard so far.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2849-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2853-S2854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A BAD IDEA\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to some of the \nstatements that were made by our colleagues from Massachusetts, who \nsaid we should increase the minimum wage. I will make a couple of \neditorial comments because I do not know that we need to debate it at \nthis time, but I feel a need to respond to some of the statements made \non the floor of the Senate.\n  The implication was that if we do not increase the minimum wage, we \ndo not care about low-income people. I find that to be offensive. That \nattempts to show that maybe those of us who oppose raising the minimum \nwage are not only insensitive, but we do not care about poor people or \nsomething. I disagree with that. Maybe we should turn that argument \naround. Maybe those of us who care more about poor people should \nincrease the minimum wage to $10, $15, or $20 an hour. I would like for \neverybody in America to make $20 an hour. But is the proper way to do \nit to pass a law that says it is against the law for you to have a job \nif you do not make that? That is what our colleagues from Massachusetts \nare doing. They want to offer an amendment that says it is against the \nlaw for you to have a job unless it pays $5.15 an hour. They do not \ncare if the job is in rural Missouri or Oklahoma. Maybe every job in \nMassachusetts pays that much. I do not care if the State of \nMassachusetts passes a minimum wage law for any figure. That is their \nprerogative. But to pass a law that makes it effective in my State and \nall across the country and says it is against the Federal law to have a \njob that pays less than $5.15, I think is a serious mistake.\n  Who does it hurt? I think it would hurt the very people they propose \nto help. It would be telling a lot of people who are low income, who \nhave a job that maybe does not pay much, it pays minimum wage--by \ndefinition, that is not much, but at least they have a job--and we are \ngoing to say, unless that job pays at least $5.15 an hour, we do not \nthink you should have that job. As a matter of fact, it is against the \nlaw, against the Federal law for you to have a job unless it pays that \namount. I totally disagree with that.\n  I just have to say that I do not understand the effort made to have \nthis amendment on this bill. We have a lands bill up. We have a bill \nthat deals with Presidio, deals with the land exchange in Oklahoma and \nArkansas, and we have a bill dealing with Utah wilderness. It is a \ncomplicated bill. I compliment my colleague from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, for his leadership on this bill.\n  What does the minimum wage amendment have to do with this bill? \nNothing--except for politics. I will say it has something to do with \npolitics. My colleagues said that we have not had an increase in the \nminimum wage since 1989--7 years. Wait a minute. The Democrats were in \ncontrol of the Senate and the House and the White House in the years \n1993 and 1994. Why did they not have the bill on the floor then? The \nmajority leader, Senator Mitchell, at that time could have brought it \nup. But he did not. Why? Well, they were trying to have a big increase \nin the minimum wage because they wanted to mandate a very expensive \nhealth care plan on America. Maybe they figured they could not do both. \nThey controlled the agenda. The Senator from Massachusetts could have \noffered that amendment, and he did not do it. We did not have a vote in \n1993 and 1994 when President Clinton and the Democrats were in control. \nBut we are having one today.\n  I noticed a coincidence in today's paper, the Washington Post. The \nheadline is, ``AFL-CIO Endorses Clinton, Approves $35 Million Political \nProgram.'' They want to enact their agenda. This is on their agenda. My \ncolleagues talked about special interests. I would say this is a pretty \nbig special interest. I would say that all of their members make more \nthan minimum wage. Maybe all of them do. There are a lot of people in \nrural Missouri or rural Oklahoma making minimum wage, and if you \nincrease the minimum wage by a certain amount, you are going to be \nputting some people out of work. I do not know who, but I know there \nare some. I have been in rural areas that have grocery stores that are \nstriving to stay alive because they had a big company come in, like \nWal-Mart or somebody, a big competitor.\n  Yes, they were paying $4.50 an hour or whatever the amount would be, \nand they are not making any money. But if\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nwe mandate that they increase their minimum wage or whatever they are \npaying by 21 percent as proposed, you are going to be putting some of \nthose jobs out, maybe put the business out.\n  And what are these jobs? A lot of them are starting level jobs. I \nworked for minimum wage 27\\1/2\\ years ago. It was when my wife and I \nwere first married. I worked for it before then as well. But I remember \nthat was the best job we could get. We both worked. At that time I \nthink the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour, and was it enough? No. Did I \nwant more? Yes. Did I learn part of the trade? And that trade at the \ntime was a janitor service. Yes. And I started my own.\n  So the minimum wage was not so much a minimum wage as it was a \nstarting wage. It helped me learn a craft or business, and I was able \nto start a business. I employed more people and they made more than the \nminimum wage. But what we are doing, if we increase the minimum wage \nsignificantly, what we are going to be doing is telling all people if \nyour job does not pay at least this amount, it is against the law for \nyou to have a job, we are going to pull up the economic ladder. The \nFederal Government is determined if your job does not pay that amount, \nyou should not have it; it is against the Federal law.\n  I think that is wrong. That is the heavy hand of the Federal \nGovernment coming in and saying we know best. We know you should be \nmaking more. Now, what is right in Boston, MA, may not be what is right \nin my hometown of Ponca City, OK.\n  So I just really disagree with this idea of big Government knows \nbest; we are going to mandate, we are going to tell everybody what to \ndo and act like there are no economic consequences whatsoever.\n  Sure, there are economic consequences. You are going to be pricing \nsome jobs--maybe the job is pumping gas--out of the market. That is one \nof the first jobs that a lot of my group growing up were working at. \nYou do not see that anymore. Most of the gas stations are self-serve. \nThat may not be the greatest job in the world, but I would rather have \nthat young person coming in and getting a start and maybe learning the \nfact this is not good enough; I cannot make enough money, so maybe I \nneed to go back and complete high school or maybe I need to go into vo-\ntech or maybe I need to go get some additional training. That is all \npart of the educational process.\n  We say, ``Oh, no. If the job doesn't pay over $5.15 an hour, you \ncan't have it; it is wrong.'' Or maybe the job is sacking groceries. \nYou do not see many jobs like that. We used to have those jobs. The \nFederal Government is going to put people out of business and back on \nthe streets, people who need that job training.\n  A lot of people in Boston, a lot of people in different parts of the \ncountry need that first job. That first job teaches them a lot more \nthan just the dollar amount. And we should give them that opportunity. \nWe should not be pulling the economic ladder up and saying, no, if it \ndoes not pay that much, it is not worth it; you go ahead and stay home. \nAnd, yes, so what if you are 16 years old and you do not have anything \nelse to do, just stay home. And then what happens? A lot of those idle \npeople say, well, I need some money. How can I make money? Maybe I can \nmake money running drugs, maybe I can make money stealing things, \nwhatever. A lot of people get into trouble because they have time on \ntheir hands.\n  That is a mistake. We should not price them out of the marketplace, \nand that is what is being proposed.\n  And then some of our colleagues say, well, there are no economic \nconsequences whatsoever. This is not going to mean an increase in \nunemployment. I think it just defies the law of supply and demand. If \nthere are no negative economic consequences by a 21-percent increase in \nthe minimum wage, why not increase it 50 percent? Why not increase it \n100 percent? Maybe we should have a perfecting amendment that says the \nminimum wage will be $10 an hour?\n  That is all right. If you work 2,080 hours a year, that is $20,000 a \nyear. I think that would be nice. I would like for everybody to make \n$20,000 a year. So maybe we should perfect this amendment. If you are \nnot going to have any negative consequences by a 21-percent increase in \nthe minimum wage, let us make it 100 percent, make it $10 an hour. I \njust think that argument makes no sense whatsoever. Common sense would \nsay, hey, this is going to cause some problems for some people and \nthose some people are going to be the people on the lowest end of the \neconomic scale that maybe are trying to crawl that ladder and we are \ngoing to pull the ladder up. We should not do that.\n  I wish to make a couple of comments. Yes, there are negative economic \nconsequences. CBO said that this is an unfunded mandate on cities and \ncounties and States and tribes of about $1 billion over the next few \nyears. They said it is an unfunded mandate on the private sector to the \ntune of over $12 billion for the next few years.\n  The real problem is that this is going to be telling a lot of young \npeople we are sorry; if you cannot find a job that pays this much, we \ndo not want you to have a job; it is against the law for you to have a \njob. That is a mistake. I think that is a serious mistake. We should \nnot do that.\n  So I will urge my colleague at the appropriate time to oppose this \namendment if and when it is offered. It does not belong in this bill. \nSome people are kind of frustrated Congress does not get its business \ndone, and on occasion I may join that frustration. But this amendment \nis for politics because the leaders of organized labor are in town, \nbecause the leaders of organized labor are endorsing Clinton and \npromising record amounts, record amounts, $35 million in political \ncampaign contributions. This is special interest legislation and the \nreal problem is the real people it will hurt will be low-income people \nwho need jobs.\n  So I will urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to defeat this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And I believe the increase proposed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts is from $4.25 to $5.15. That is about 45 cents I believe \nover a 2-year period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2853-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2854-S2855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FEDERAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have today a bizarre example of the \nunthinking impact of conflicting Federal regulations on other \nconflicting Federal regulations and the fact that so often our \nbureaucracy simply does not think out the consequences of what it does.\n  Recently, I was in the Tri City area of east central Washington and \nwas discussing his business with the manager of a Unocal fertilizer \nplant in the city of Kennewick. He brought to my attention a fairly \nrecent message that he had received from the U.S. Coast Guard. The \nCoast Guard has written to everyone with various kinds of facilities in \nports from California through the State of Washington, warning them \nabout potential terrorism, pointing out that the base of the explosive \nat the Oklahoma City courthouse disaster was fertilizer, and telling \nthe manager of this fertilizer plant how important it was to guard \nagainst terrorism, to guard against outsiders getting into the facility \nand engaging in terroristic acts.\n  Well, it was oratory in nature and did not suggest any particular \nthings to do. I do not think it suggested anything that the plant was \nnot already doing. But at the same time, Mr. President, the Unocal \nplant was informed by the Environmental Protection Agency of a truly \nbizarre proposal on its part.\n  As a fertilizer plant, and because fertilizers do, under some \ncircumstances, raise certain health risks and also certain explosive \nrisks, this business is subject to widespread regulation on the part of \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental \nProtection Agency. In fact, those regulations are so detailed in nature \nthat 23 people out of 150 employees in the plant are devoted almost \nsolely to abiding by various governmental regulations.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n  In any event, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a new \nregulation to apply to some 122,000 facilities across the country. That \nregulation would require each of these 122,000 facilities to make \npublic the worst-case scenario, the worst thing that could possibly \nhappen if any of the materials handled by or stored in the facility \nwere released.\n  So, in other words, Mr. President, we have a Federal Government \nwarning against terrorism with one hand and instructing companies to \npublicize the worst thing a terrorist could possibly do with their \nmaterials on the other hand--in detail.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, when it was asked how many \ndeaths had resulted off of the site of one of these 122,000 plants from \nthe release of such material, came up with the answer ``zero.'' No such \ndeaths. But they have a regulation which will tell the terrorists \nexactly how to cause those deaths in very, very large numbers.\n  Mr. President, there is no question but that safety regulations are \nvitally important and environmental protection regulations are \nimportant. This Unocal plant, I may say, had 1 injury that caused one \nday of lost time in the last several years in its plant, and that was \nfrom heavy lifting, not the use of hazardous material. It runs an \nextremely safe plant.\n  But, Mr. President, could we possibly come up with a better \nillustration of the proposition that we need to look over our old \nregulations after a certain period of time and determine whether or not \nthey are still relevant or still working; that before we impose new \nregulations, we ought to figure out what the cost and the downside is \nagainst whatever the purported gain is before we impose them? Are we \ngoing to simply publicize ways in which to engage in terrorism, when we \nhave not had any serious problems from the very condition that the \nregulation is designed to control?\n  Mr. President, should we not have some kind of coordination among \nvarious Federal agencies as to whether or not the regulation of one is \nnot going to undercut the very purpose for which another exists? Well, \nMr. President, I think the answer to these questions is quite obvious. \nHere is another example of the use of the so-called safety regulation \nor environmental regulation in a way which is destructive of the very \ngoals it seeks in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Coast Guard missive \nand the letter from Mr. Powell of Unocal be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                                             U.S. Coast Guard,\n\n                                    Alameda, CA, January 14, 1996.\n       Dear Waterfront Facility Operator/Maritime Transportation \n     Company: As a result of a series of recent U.S. judicial \n     proceedings, I have received an advisory indicating possible \n     retaliatory acts against U.S. interests. The sentencing of \n     Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and nine others for their \n     involvement in the bombing of the World Trade Center and \n     other New York landmarks may prompt sympathizers to possible \n     retaliate. Similar responses could also follow if the U.S. \n     extradites Musa Abu Marzuq, a member of the ``Islamic \n     Resistance Movement (HAMAS)'' to Israel for his involvement \n     in terrorist activities there. In addition, Salman Rushdie, \n     the target of an Iranian death order, is currently on a \n     multi-city U.S. book tour. Finally, the trial of alleged bomb \n     maker and terrorist Ramei Ahmed Youssef is expected in the \n     first half of 1996. He and his accomplices are charged with \n     conspiring to bomb a U.S. commercial airlines in the Asia \n     Pacific region.\n       The possible retaliatory acts to these judicial proceedings \n     may include attacks against the U.S. transportation \n     infrastructure. It should be emphasized that no specific \n     threats against any form of transportation have been \n     identified to date. However, the Secretary of Transportation \n     believes it is prudent and appropriate to ensure deterrence \n     and prevention of these activities. Therefore, I am advising \n     all waterfront facility operators and companies involved in \n     maritime transportation in Northern California to take \n     appropriate and immediate actions to ensure that adequate \n     measures are in place to prevent or deter terrorist actions \n     against facilities and port personnel. These actions should \n     begin with a review of your security measures already in \n     place and an assessment of whether or not additional security \n     measures are necessary.\n       To facilitate information sharing and response actions \n     during a security-related emergency, the Department of \n     Transportation has established a hotline for reporting \n     incidents. The number for the hotline is 1-800-424-0201. \n     Should you receive any threats or notice any unusual \n     activities which may compromise your security, I urge you to \n     contact this hotline and appropriate law enforcement \n     agencies. You may also contact the Marine Safety Office's \n     watch office at (510) 437-3073 to report these incidents.\n       Your cooperation in ensuring the safety of the port is \n     greatly appreciated. Should you have any questions regarding \n     this matter, please contact Lieutenant Lee of my staff at \n     (510) 437-5873.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     D.P. Montoro,\n     Captain, U.S. Coast Guard.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Unocal Petroleum Products &\n\n\n                                           Chemicals Division,\n\n                                     Kennewick, WA, June 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard ``Doc'' Hastings,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Hastings: Thank you for the time you \n     afforded my entire family when we were in Washington, D.C. \n     last week. Meeting a congressman in his office was a big \n     event for us.\n       During our brief talk I told you that I was in town for a \n     meeting of the Fertilizer Institute where EPA's proposed risk \n     management (RM) regulations were discussed in depth. These \n     regulations which focus on community safety are explicitly \n     called for by the 1990 Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7). In \n     addition to our internal discussion, an EPA spokeswoman, Dr. \n     Lyse Helsing of EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \n     Prevention Office, provided us with an update of the status \n     of their proposed regulations. EPA's proposed RM regulations \n     will substantially overlap with existing regulations also \n     called for by the Clean Air Act and already implemented by \n     OSHA to protect worker safety. These are OSHA's Process \n     Safety Management (PSM) regulations which went into effect in \n     1992. Unfortunately, the overlapping portions of the \n     regulations are not quite identical. The Fertilizer Institute \n     and Unocal feel this problem can be easily solved and that \n     the solution would be in line with President Clinton's recent \n     directive to eliminate or modify regulations that are \n     obsolete or unnecessary.\n       The attached letter explaining the problem with these \n     overlapping regulations was drafted by the Fertilizer \n     Institute. It briefly explains the problem and offers a \n     solution. I hope you will consider sending this or a similar \n     letter to the EPA.\n       One element in the RM regulations called for by the Clean \n     Air Act is not dealt with by OSHA in its PSM regulations. \n     That is a requirement that industries storing certain \n     hazardous materials above threshold quantities make public \n     the ``worst case'' scenario for the release of this material \n     including its impact on the surrounding community. RM \n     regulations will effect 122,000 facilities in this country \n     according to EPA's spokeswoman Dr. Lyse Helsing. When asked \n     how many such worst case releases had ever resulted in an \n     injury to a person offsite from the affected facility. Dr. \n     Helsing stated that EPA's records showed zero deaths. She did \n     not comment on injuries, but I suspect there is scant \n     evidence of a problem. However, the requirement to publicize \n     worst case information will be costly and we will in the \n     process of releasing such information make it known to \n     potential terrorists as well as to average citizens. In the \n     wake of Oklahoma City, the Trade Tower incident in New York \n     and subway incidents in Japan, I doubt that public safety \n     will be enhanced by making worse case information public. \n     This is especially true in this instance where EPA \n     acknowledges no history of problem in this country.\n       The clock is ticking on EPA's court ordered deadline of \n     March 1996 to issue RM regulations with a requirement for \n     publication of worst case scenarios. I urge you to take \n     action to avoid implementation of this aspect of the Clean \n     Air Act.\n       Thank you for your time, your consideration and your \n     constant efforts at improving the workings of our government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mark R. Powell.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Washington \nfor that statement. That may be the most vivid example of bureaucracies \nrunning amok, actually endangering the lives of some of our \nconstituents. That is unfortunate. I appreciate the Senator for \nbringing that to our attention. I hope we will be able to take some \ncorrective action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2854-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2855-S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to continue our earlier \ndiscussion a little bit more. I remind this body of the pending \nbusiness that is before the Senate, and that is a package of parks \nbills, some 56 titles, and a couple of them are contentious--Utah \nwilderness and Presidio. And as we look at getting things done around \nhere, it is inconceivable to me that we would not finish\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nwhat we started. We started yesterday with this parks package. It was \nscheduled to come up throughout the day. We had about 7\\1/2\\ hours of \ndebate, good debate yesterday. Today, we were going to take amendments, \nand the first thing out of the box is the minimum wage. Putting aside \nthe merits of the minimum wage, the question is, Why not finish what we \nstarted?\n  The Utah wilderness debate is a legitimate issue for the State of \nUtah. The Presidio trust establishment is a legitimate issue for the \nState of California. The concern relative to Utah wilderness is whether \nor not 2 million acres of additional wilderness is adequate or, as some \nfrom the elitist group suggest, it should be 5 to 6 million acres. \nCurrently, Utah has a pretty good chunk of wilderness. They have \napproximately 800,000 acres that is Forest Service wilderness. The \nproposed bill that we presented would increase that BLM wilderness \nclassification to 2 million acres, making a total of 2.8 million.\n  That is pretty significant, Mr. President, when you consider just how \nbig a million acres of wilderness actually is. Few people recognize as \nthey wander around in the great outdoors what a million acres of \nwilderness equates to. A million acres equates to a State the size of \nDelaware. Two million acres, what we are talking about, is about three \ntimes the size of the State of Rhode Island. Two million acres is about \nhalf the size of the State of New Jersey.\n  With reference to the Utah wilderness, why they are somewhat \nreluctant to put in even more acreage is that there has been an \nextended study done as to what would be adequate in the minds of \nUtahns, the legislature, the Governor, and so forth. And I think some \n15 years have been spent in the study, some $10 million expended to \ncome up with the recommendation of 1.9 million. As I said before, the \nproposal here is 2 million acres.\n  Now, Utah needs for its economy, for its infrastructure, funds coming \nfrom resource development. Some of these areas would be used for the \nproduction of resources to support the needs of Utah--the schools and \nvarious other long-term commitments to better the residents of that \nState. Some might wonder why I am speaking coming from the State of \nAlaska, but we, too, are affected by wilderness designations. We have \n56 million acres of wilderness in our State of Alaska, so I know \nsomething about the topic.\n  But, as we reflect on what is behind the issue, on one hand, of \ntrying to reach an accord to get the 56 titles through that represent \nthe parks in some 26 States, I encourage all my colleagues to remember \nthe importance of standing behind this package. Because, if the Senate \nvotes out this package, it will be accepted by the House. If the Utah \nwilderness is stricken, if the Presidio is stricken, why, the House has \nassured us, they are not even going to take it up.\n  But the significance here is what the Utahns are trying to do to \ndevelop their economy and meet their school obligations by utilizing \nthe resources in that State, the resources that, if additional \nwilderness is set aside beyond the 2 million acres, they are simply not \ngoing to be able to achieve their needs.\n  Who are these folks who are proposing it should be 5 to 6 million \nacres? They are not residents of the State of Utah. They are some of \nthe eastern elitists, who have moved their focus, if you will, from the \nWest as being an area where there is great productivity and return for \ntheir investments, as they reside in the East, to easterners who look \nat the West as a great place to recreate.\n  What we are talking about here is balance. We are trying to get a \nbalance between preserving the wilderness and developing our resources \nand trying to address our jobs. As I hear my colleagues this morning \ntalk about the minimum wage, I ask them where in the world are the jobs \nthat we formerly had in resource development in this country? We have \nlost 600,000 jobs since 1980 in the oil and gas industry; 600,000 jobs. \nThese are not minimum-wage jobs. These are high-paying union jobs, \nblue-collar jobs of the highest skills necessary to produce oil and \ngas. What have we done? We have relied on imports. We are bringing in, \nnow, 54 percent of our crude oil. Mr. President, 54 percent of our \ncrude oil consumption is imported. So, what we are doing is we are \nexporting our dollars, we are exporting our jobs, and we have lost \n600,000 jobs since 1980.\n  I do not see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying what \ncan we do to stimulate domestic jobs in oil and gas production, where \nwe have huge reservoirs simply ready to be tapped, we have the \ntechnology, we have the expertise to do it safely. They do not want to \nstand up and be counted, because some of the elitist groups might \nsuggest we should not be developing oil and gas on public lands, we \nshould not be generating revenue and taxes for the communities. They \nmove over to the minimum wage, on a parks bill, and suggest that this \nis the issue for the Senate. This is not the business of the Senate. \nThe business of the Senate is the 56 titles of the parks bill.\n  Look at the timber industry. Timber is a renewable resource. Do you \nknow why the U.S. Forest Service was established? It was established so \nwe could have an ongoing supply of timber. It is up to us to determine \nwhether the management is adequate or inadequate. We have lost 30,000 \ntimber jobs in 10 years. How many communities did that affect? Lots and \nlots.\n  As a consequence, I just am bewildered at my colleague's immediate \njump to a minimum-wage increase with no consideration for the lost jobs \nin timber, mining, oil, gas, ranching--virtually every resource from \npublic lands that has traditionally employed Americans in high-paying \njobs. Where have the jobs gone to in the United States? They have gone \nto the service industry. They have gone to McDonald's. They have gone \nto the low pay, as we import the things we need, like our wood fiber. \nSome of the extreme elitists suggest we do not have to develop that in \nthe United States, we can import it. But many of those countries do not \nhave the same environmental sensitivity that we do in the United \nStates. They are not developing their renewable resources with the same \nsensitivity that we are.\n  So, I think it is a little inconsistent, as we listen to this debate \ntoday, particularly in view of the statement from my friend from \nOklahoma that it is a bit coincidental, with the AFL-CIO in town, \nendorsing the current administration, committing $35 million out of the \nunion members in this country for a political action effort. Where are \nthose people when it comes to the basic, hard-core resource jobs of \nthis country? They are not on this floor. They are not defending the \nright to use our science and technology to keep this job base that we \nhave had in this country, that has made this country self-sufficient.\n  Mr. President, 54 percent of our crude oil is imported. As I said, \nthe dollars and jobs are going overseas. Over one-half the trade \ndeficit is the cost of imported oil. There is absolutely no excuse for \nthat. We are importing over 8 million barrels a day. The total cost to \nimport that is $1 billion per week. We could have those jobs in the \nUnited States if we would recognize, as we look at our regulatory \nrequirements, that they really do not keep pace with the technological \nadvancements. To suggest we cannot open up oil and gas deposits safely \nwith the technology that we have been developing is really selling \nAmerican engineering and ingenuity short.\n  I see the hour of 12:30 is almost upon us, Mr. President. I again \nremind my colleagues of the inappropriateness of trying to move a \nminimum-wage action on a parks bill, a parks bill that addresses some \n25 States, 56 titles, and has been worked on for many, many years by \nmany Members here and addresses the needs of many, many States.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to refrain from the debate on the minimum \nwage to simply take advantage of the political opportunity associated \nwith the presence of the AFL-CIO and their convention in town and their \npledge of $35 million to the current administration and get back to the \nbusiness of the Senate, which is this parks package, debate it, pass \nit, and move on. I am sure there will be a time and place for the \nminimum wage, but it is not on this parks bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, during a speech in the 1968 Presidential \ncampaign, Senator Edmund Muskie, who was the Democrat nominee for Vice \nPresident, told his audience, ``you have the God-given right to kick \nthe Government around--don't hesitate to do so.''\n  That remark was pure Ed Muskie. Blunt. To the point. And leaving no \ndoubt that Americans should expect the best of their public officials.\n  And the best is just what the people of Maine and America received \nfrom Ed Muskie during a public service career that spanned five \ndecades.\n  Along with all Senators, I join today in mourning the death of Ed \nMuskie, who passed away here in Washington early this morning.\n  The son of a Polish immigrant, Ed Muskie grew up knowing about the \nblessings of freedom and democracy, and he spent a life time standing \nup for those blessings, beginning with serving for 3 years in the \nAtlantic and Asiatic-Pacific Theaters in World War II.\n  After the war, he returned to his beloved Maine, and soon began his \npolitical career as a Democrat in a State that for over a century had \nrarely elected anybody but Republicans.\n  Ed Muskie changed all that. During his 6 years in the State house of \nrepresentatives, his 4 years as Governor, and his 21 years in the U.S. \nSenate, Ed Muskie's intelligence and integrity changed the voting \nhabits of Maine--many of whom called themselves Muskie Republicans.\n  Ed's years in the Senate were highlighted by his service as the first \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I was proud to be on that \ncommittee with him at that time. In that role, Ed took some criticism \nfrom those of his party who believed he was too tough in his opposition \nto increased spending.\n  He handled this criticism by saying that America would not get its \nfiscal house in order if we continued to have public servants who--and \nI quote--``talked like Scrooge on the campaign trail, and voted like \nSanta Clause in the Senate.''\n  Ed Muskie was a patriot who always answered the call of his Nation. \nHe resigned from the Senate when President Carter asked him to serve as \nSecretary of State. And when Ronald Reagan--the man who defeated \nPresident Carter--asked him to serve on the Tower Commission, Ed was \nthere, as well.\n  Mr. President, the State of Maine and America are better because of \nEd Muskie's life and career.\n  I know all Senators join with me in extending our condolences to his \nfamily and friends.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank and commend the majority \nleader for these comments. I join in the feeling which he has spoken so \nvery eloquently about.\n  I wanted to speak very briefly on Senator Muskie. I do not know \nwhether others wanted to speak on this matter, but I have some remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we extend our recess time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader very much.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I simply wanted to commend the majority \nleader for his comments about the late Senator Muskie. I did not know \nhim well. I had met him a number of times. This was an era when there \nis often a caricature created about those involved in public service. \nHe represented, I think, what is the best of public service. He was \nsmart, tough, strong. He served not only the State of Maine but this \ncountry with great distinction.\n  All of us who had met him, or those of us who had crossed paths with \nhim over the years will miss him. We extend our sympathies to the \nMuskie family. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in thanking the majority leader \nfor his comments about Senator Muskie, and I would like to express my \nappreciation to others for their comments.\n  Ed Muskie was a fellow New Englander, and over his long and \ndistinguished career, his friendship for the members of our family and \nfor my brothers was very real, ongoing, and based upon our very high \nregard and great respect for Senator Muskie.\n  As has been pointed out here in the Senate, he was a Senator's \nSenator. I like to think of him as being the foremost authority on \npreserving the environment. Senator Muskie inherited this extraordinary \ncommitment because he represented one of the most beautiful States in \nour country, the State of Maine. He spent a good deal of time on that \nissue as Governor and gave it very special attention in the Senate, \nwhere he championed the Clean Water Act and other environmental \nreforms. We made great progress in preserving the environment in those \nyears, and Ed Muskie deserves the commendation and the gratitude of a \nnation.\n  He also took on challenging responsibilities as the first chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, in trying to ensure that the Nation acts \nresponsibly in its financial affairs. With his extraordinarily gifted \nmind and his ability to analyze and understand complex issues, he was \nable to get at the heart of the problem and master the details of a \nbudget in a way which all of us admired and respected. He played an \nenormously important role in trying to put this country on a path \ntoward a more sensible and responsible fiscal policy.\n  His work as Secretary of State was outstanding as well. His key role \nin the release of the American hostages in Iran was an extraordinary \ndiplomatic initiative and achievement. It was when he served as \nSecretary of State that this Nation achieved new heights in the \npreservation of human rights around the world, a cause which he \nchampioned.\n  Many commentators have described Ed Muskie as Lincolnesque. He was \nLincolnesque in stature and character--a tall, lean man, a towering \nfigure, with those piercing eyes and strong features that characterized \nan enormously gifted mind and a backbone of steel and courage.\n  He was a great public servant for our time. The people of Maine were \nwell served, the Senate was well served, and the country was well \nserved in a range of different responsibilities that he undertook.\n  Mr. President, I join with those expressing our sense of sorrow and \nloss to his wife Jane and the other members of the Muskie family. We \nwill be saying our prayers for Ed Muskie and for his family. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2857-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to deny cash \nbenefits to drug addicts and alcoholics, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the social security act amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today, I introduce legislation \nfor which there is broad bipartisan support. Many of my colleagues \nshare my concern about monthly cash payments provided through the \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] and Social Security Disability \nInsurance [SSDI] programs to people who are considered disabled solely \nbecause they are drug addicts and alcoholics. My bill would terminate \ncash benefits for these recipients of SSI and SSDI, and would instead \nprovide treatment for their addictions.\n  SSI was established in 1972 to provide cash benefits to needy \ndisabled persons with limited resources. Most Americans would be \nsurprised to learn that drug addiction and alcoholism can qualify a \nperson to receive monthly cash benefits under this program.\n  In fact, 135,000 people receive monthly SSI payments because they are \nalcoholics or drug addicts--148 of them in my own State of North \nDakota. And this number is growing at a shocking pace.\n  The number of addicts receiving monthly SSI benefits quadrupled in \nthe last 4 years. Over 10 years, the percentage of SSI recipients who \nreceive payments because of an addiction to drugs or alcohol increased \nfrom 0.3 percent of the caseload to more than 2 percent of the total \ncaseload today--for an annual cost to taxpayers of about $630 million.\n  To most Americans, this policy is wrong-headed. Substance abusers \nneed treatment, not cash handouts from the Federal Government. The bill \nI am introducing today would address this problem by ending SSI and \nSSDI cash benefits for those for whom substance abuse is a material \nfactor in their disability. Instead, drug addicts and alcoholics would \nbe provided with access to quality treatment for their diseases.\n  There is broad consensus that we must end cash benefits for substance \nabusers. The House and Senate voted to terminate SSI and SSDI for drug \naddicts and alcoholics when welfare reform legislation was considered. \nThese provisions have now been attached to legislation to raise the \nSocial Security earnings limit, which will soon be considered by the \nSenate.\n  My bill is different from these proposals, however, because my bill \nwould retain Medicaid eligibility and provide access to treatment for \ndrug addicts and alcoholics.\n  Under the current system, recipients are required to participate in \ntreatment programs if they are available. However, quality programs \noften are not available or are not easily accessible to SSI and SSDI \nrecipients. To make matters worse, the inspector general at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services recently reported that the \nSocial Security Administration does not know the treatment status of \nmost SSI recipients and does not provide monitoring of the program.\n  Access to quality treatment for drug addiction is not only an \neffective way to truly help chemically dependent Americans--it is also \ncost-effective. Experts testifying before the House Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Human Resources recently pointed out that every dollar \ninvested in treatment produced between $3 and $76 in health- and \ncriminal justice related savings.\n  These provisions of my bill ensure that  people  whose  primary  \ndisability is alcoholism or drug addiction will receive treatment \ninstead of cash benefits to address their disability. In addition, my \nbill helps to ensure that people who have other disabilities but who \nalso have a chemical addiction will use cash benefits in a way that is \nbeneficial for their well-being.\n  Under current law, SSI and SSDI cash payments to recipients whose \nprincipal disability is a chemical addiction are distributed through a \nrepresentative payee, rather than directly to the recipient. This is \nintended to ensure that payments are used for the benefit of the \nrecipient, rather than to further his or her disability. My bill \nextends that safeguard to any SSI or SSDI recipient who is chemically \ndependent if the recipient is incapable of managing his or her own \nbenefits.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation so \nthat we can underscore the importance of this issue. Cash assistance \nwill not help alcoholics and drug addicts overcome their diseases, but \nquality treatment and medical care will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal years 1997 through 2001, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\n               the older americans act amendments of 1996\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older \nAmericans Act Amendments of 1996. This important law recently saw its \n30th anniversary, and I believe it is the type of legislation that we \nshould have more of in this country; it is a bill that is designed to \nhelp our senior citizens help themselves. This is a bill that focuses \non meeting the needs of senior citizens in ways that will promote their \nwell-being and independence. Through a variety of supportive programs--\nfrom providing meals that are both home-delivered and served in \ncongregate settings, to subsidizing seniors' income through an \nemployment and training program, to facilitating information, case \nmanagement, and referral services so that all available services to \nseniors can be coordinated and maximized--this bill works to ensure the \nsystem works for our older Americans.\n  This bill essentially takes what has become an overly complicated, \nprescriptive law and streamlines it, turns significant amounts of \nauthority over to the States, encourages a bottoms-up planning process, \nand allows programs and services to be tailored to meet actual--rather \nthan perceived--social and economic needs. This legislation will \nprovide maximum authority and flexibility to States and localities in \nthe design and operation of their services for seniors, while \nprotecting the integrity of a number of priority programs--including \noutreach and counseling programs, the long-term care ombudsman, \npreventive health efforts, elder abuse prevention, and legal assistance \nservices.\n  The bill drives more money into the delivery of those services most \nneeded in States and local communities through sound economic \nprinciples. Throughout this bill, a ``bottoms-up'' planning process is \nfacilitated; this means actual needs will be met on the local level, \nrather than what we perceive the needs to be from our distant vantage \npoint here in Washington. It is clear from a myriad of other programs \nthat we fund and that have failed that Washington does not always know \nbest. We must ensure that we don't drag this program down under a \nfather-knows-best mentality.\n  This is not a welfare bill. It is not legislation that is designed to \nonly meet the needs of specific populations or address specific \nproblems. Instead, the Older Americans Act is a continuum of programs \nwhich have been structured to respond to everything from economic \nneeds, to physical and transportation problems, to answering \nindividuals' social requirements. All of our seniors should have the \nopportunity for a nutritious meal, or to get other assistance when they \nneed it; this bill facilitates their access to these kinds of services.\n  This has never been considered a partisan piece of legislation, and \nSenator Kassebaum and I have worked hard, along with Senator Mikulski \nwho is the ranking member on the Aging Subcommittee, to ensure that it \nremains bipartisan. That is not to say that concerns on both sides of \nthe aisle were not fully explored. The goal has been to achieve the \nstrongest policy possible, and in doing so, meet the concerns of all of \nour colleagues.\n  A concerted effort has been made to maintain an atmosphere of \ncollegiality and consensus. For the Republican members of the Labor \nCommittee, this has meant a willingness to recognize the value of a \nparticular policy in cases where we would have made other decisions \nbased on our general philosophy. In addition, we have taken a great \ndeal of time and effort to listen to and consult with interested groups \nwho are part of the aging network. We have extended an open-door policy \nto anyone who expressed an interest in sharing their views and \nexchanging ideas in a constructive environment. We responded to what we \nheard; for example, we have retained the Eldercare Locator Service, a \nprogram which allows family members to find services for their loved \nones, even if they are in a different part of the country. We retained \na separate line-item of funding for the long-term-care ombudsman \nprogram, after hearing repeatedly of its significance in States across \nthe Nation.\n  The bill I am introducing here today, along with my colleague from \nKansas and the Chairman of our Committee, Senator Kassebaum, is a \nresult of that process over the last year. It contains policy that was \nstructured in response to excellent witnesses who testified both before \nour subcommittee and the House. These individuals brought their unique, \ngrassroots perspective from the trenches to us here in Washington. \nTheir comments had a tremendous value in this process, as their issues \nare real, not perceived. One provision we adopted on their advice was, \nfor example, to permit States to institute cost-sharing provisions; \nhowever, we have ensured that these provisions will not prevent any \nsenior from receiving services due to an inability to pay.\n  This bill responds to concerns and questions that were posed after we \ncirculated a legislative proposal last December. It also incorporates a \nnumber of items raised by the administration and the Democratic members \nof the Labor Committee, both technical and substantive. These include: \nRetaining authority for the Assistant Secretary to make grants for \npreventive health activities, with priority given to medically \nunderserved areas and locations with the greatest economic need; \ndefinition of low income at 150 percent of the Federal poverty line; \nand mandated State planning requirements for legal assistance and \ninsurance-public benefit counseling.\n\n  The overall structure of this bill has also been changed. Like a \nhouse that had numerous additions over the years, the Older Americans \nAct had become disjointed. We have corrected that, restructuring the \nact so that it is logically based on service and oversight \nresponsibilities, as opposed to program by program, fractionalized by \nseven titles. The four titles of this bill include one for Federal \nfunctions, one for State responsibilities, one for Area Agency on Aging \nauthorities, and one title for native American programs.\n  This bill maximizes flexibility for service delivery at the State and \nlocal level, while still retaining protections over priority services, \nsuch as outreach and counseling, long-term care ombudsmen, and case \nmanagement. The bill also rationalizes the funding formulas for both \nnutrition and supportive services as well as SCSEP, the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program. This is important because we must \ndirect our limited Federal resources to where a real need exists. We \nmust also be planning now for the future, and ensure that legislation \nthat we pass today will be structured to respond to the needs of \ntomorrow and the 21st century.\n  In addition, we have directed funds to the administration, States, \nand localities as required for the purpose of administering these \nprograms. While important functions are carried out with administrative \ndollars, when faced with a choice between administration and service, \nwe have opted to meet the needs of our seniors wherever we can. To \nfurther promote quality service delivery, we have eliminated the \nartificial funding wall between home-delivered and congregate meals \nprograms. We have also increased the transfer authority between \nnutrition programs and supportive services, which funds items such as \ntransportation, in-home assistance, health screening and education, \nhealth insurance benefit options, crime prevention, and work on \nmultipurpose senior center facilities.\n  This bill retains the authority and authorizes funding of research \nand demonstration grants in order to encourage innovative approaches to \nthe delivery of the critical services provided for under this act. \nWhile, again, there is a limit on the number of dollars that can be \nprovided for such activities, we also have seen some excellent programs \nemerge from these projects, and have attempted to find a way to \ncontinue them.\n  We maintained a number of provisions to protect the quality of the \nlong-term-care ombudsman offices in each State by clarifying the \nminimal criteria for eligibility and providing conflict-of-interest \nsafeguards. This bill ensures that particular attention continues to be \npaid to the needs of the minority elderly population. In addition, the \nlegislation permits States to institute cost-sharing requirements as \nthey see necessary under a self-declaration-of-income standard. \nConfidentiality standards are provided, and there is language which \nensures that no one will be denied services due to an inability to pay.\n  It is time to reexamine the status quo for all Federal programs and \nmake\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nimprovements where necessary. And I think we have made an excellent \nstart with this bill, the Older Americans Act. Again, I would like to \nthank Senators Kassebaum and Mikulski for their efforts on this bill. I \nbelieve the bill will allow seniors across the country to remain \nhealthy, living in their own homes in their community, and supported in \ntheir endeavors to stay independent. And this bill does all of this by \nstriving to maximize public-private partnership to supplement the \nlimited Federal funds available--encouraging the Federal dollars to be \nused to leverage private funding, and by allowing priorities to be set \nat the grassroots level whenever possible.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nof legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act of 1965. I am \npleased that Senator Gregg has taken the lead in drafting a bill that \ngrants States and local communities the authority and flexibility to \ntailor programs to best fit the needs of their aging citizens.\n  The original Older Americans Act was passed in 1965 with the \nintention of using joint Federal and State funds to provide a range of \nservices for elder Americans. Since that time, the act has evolved into \na comprehensive list of programs and services--ranging from legal and \ncounseling services to transportation and employment services to, \nperhaps most importantly, nutrition services.\n  Every day thousands of seniors gather at congregate meal sites to \nobtain nutrition services, as well as enjoy the companionship these \nsites offer. Often, a nutrition site will serve as the point of entry \nfor seniors to gain knowledge of other services available to them \nthrough their local communities or their area agency on aging. The \ncongregate meal sites serve as a valuable socialization too, as well as \noften providing the only nutritious meal of the day for many seniors.\n  Through changes in the Older Americans Act, this legislation will \nprovide maximum authority and flexibility to States and localities in \nthe design and operation of their services for seniors, while \nprotecting the integrity of certain priority programs including: \noutreach and counseling programs, case management, the long-term-care \nombudsman, preventive health efforts, and elder abuse prevention \nprograms. Mr. President, each State has very different needs. This bill \nallows each State to craft programs to fit their individual \ncommunities.\n  In addition, this proposal strives to maximize public-private \npartnership, recognizing that the Federal Government is not able to \nmeet all the needs that exist among this growing population, but that \nFederal funds can form a basis of support for leveraging private \ndollars. Also important, I believe, is the retention of the authority \nand funding for research and demonstration projects which encourage the \ndevelopment of innovative approaches to the delivery of critical \nservices for seniors.\n  As the population continues to age and as needs change, more pressure \nwill be placed on providers to make sure that essential needs of the \nelderly are met. I am hopeful that our efforts will lead to a system of \nsenior services that are not only more consumer driven but are also \nbetter designed to offer support to seniors in their endeavors to \nremain healthy and independent.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Baucus):\n  S. 1644. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (most-favored-nation) to the products of Romania; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             romania most-favored-nation status legislation\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today with several of my \ndistinguished colleagues, including Senator Paul Simon, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, and Senator Max Baucus, to introduce a historic measure, a \nbill to permanently restore nondiscriminatory treatment to the products \nof Romania. We are joined by Representatives Phil Crane, Sam Gibbons, \nand Barbara Kennelly in the House who are also introducing this same \nbill in that body today.\n  On December 22, 1989, Romania emerged from years of brutal Communist \ndictatorship and began its careful journey toward democracy and free \nmarkets. By 1991, Romania had approved a new Constitution and elected a \nParliament, laying a foundation for a modern parliamentary democracy. \nThis year will mark the second nationwide Romanian Presidential \nelection under the new Constitution.\n  Romania's economic legacy of extreme centralization, an oppressive \nCommunist government and a stifling bureaucracy gave it one of the \nlongest paths to reach a functioning market economy of any of the \nemerging democracies of Central Europe. Nonetheless, according to the \nU.S. Department of Commerce, after many years of difficult work, much \nof the necessary legislative framework for a market economy is in \nplace. Romania's economic reforms include the establishment of a two-\ntier banking system, the introduction of a modern tax system, the \nfreeing of most prices and elimination of most subsidies, the adoption \nof a tariff-based trade regime, and the privatization of nearly all \nRomanian agriculture and rapidly developing enterprises.\n  As I witnessed on my recent visit to Romania, the economic changes \nare remarkable. Romania's private sector currently accounts for 45 \npercent of gross domestic product, including more than 80 percent of \nagricultural property with 5 million. new landowners, more than half a \nmillion private firms, and 46,000 joint ventures with foreign capital.\n  American investment in Romania doubled from 1993 to 1994 and doubled \nagain in 1995, with total foreign investment of $1.6 billion as of \nDecember 31, 1995. Romanian exports to the United States are growing \nrapidly, increasing by 27 percent through the third quarter of 1995 \nover the same period in 1994.\n  All in all, Romania's progress in instituting democratic reforms and \na free market economy has earned it a permanent extension of most-\nfavored-nation treatment. In addition, Romania has been found by \nPresident Clinton to be in full compliance with the freedom of \nemigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. As I \nfound during my recent visit, Romania is clearly making significant \nprogress in rejoining the West. I urge the support of my colleagues for \nthe earliest consideration of this important measure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1645. A bill to regulate United States scientific and tourist in \nAntarctica, to conserve Antarctic resources, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce.\n\n\n      the antarctic science, tourism, and conservation act of 1996\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Antarctic \nScience, Tourism, and Conservation Act of 1996. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to enable the United States to implement the Protocol on \nEnvironmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Protocol was \nnegotiated by the parties of the Antarctic Treaty System and signed in \nOctober, 1991. The Senate gave its advice and consent to the Protocol \non October 7, 1992. In August, 1993, I introduced the precursor to this \nbill and the Senate Commerce Committee reported it to the full Senate \nin early 1994. Unfortunately, continuing disagreements among \nscientists, conservation groups, and the administration about the \nlegislative changes needed for the United States to carry out its \nresponsibilities under the Protocol prevented further action on that \nbill.\n  Today, I am pleased to announce that the legislative impasse has come \nto an end. The bill Senator Hollings and I are introducing is supported \nby all the parties engaged in this somewhat lengthy but ultimately \nsuccessful consensus-building process.\n  Why are we concerned about implementing this particular international \nagreement? The protocol recognizes that Antarctica is a unique and \nfragile ecosystem that must be monitored and protected and it reaffirms \nthe designation of Antarctica as a special conservation area. At the \nsame time, the protocol encourages and supports the unparalleled \nresearch opportunities Antarctica offers for scientific study of both \nglobal and regional environmental processes. Finally, the protocol \nacknowledges and addresses the impact of the growing number of tourists \nwho travel to the Antarctic to witness its wild beauty and bountiful \nmarine life, but whose presence is responsible for increasing \nenvironmental stress.\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\n  The bill before us builds on the existing U.S. regulatory framework \nprovided in the Antarctic Conservation Act to implement the protocol \nand to balance two important goals. The first goal is to conserve and \nprotect the Antarctic environment and resources. the second is to \nminimize interference with scientific research. The bill amends the \nAntarctic Conservation Act to make existing provisions governing U.S. \nresearch activities consistent with the requirements of the Protocol. \nAs under current law, the Director of the National Science Foundation \n[NSF] would remain the lead agency in managing the Antarctic science \nprogram and in issuing regulations and research permits. In addition, \nthe bill calls for comprehensive assessment and monitoring of the \neffects of both governmental and nongovernmental activities on the \nfragile Antarctic ecosystem. It also would continue indefinitely a ban \non Antarctic mineral resource activities. Finally, the bill amends the \nact to prevent pollution from ships to implement provisions of the \nprotocol relating to protection of marine resources.\n\n  Before closing, I would like to thank Senator Hollings, ranking \nDemocrat on the Commerce Committee; the Department of State, especially \nUnder Secretary for Global Affairs Tim Wirth and Tucker Scully of the \nBureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific \nAffairs; Dr. Neil Sullivan, Director of Polar Programs, and Larry \nRudolph of the National Science Foundation; and other interested \nparties including Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, and especially the \nAntarctica Project and its director Beth Marks for their hard work and \nassistance in developing this bill.\n  As one of the founders of the Antarctic Treaty System, the United \nStates has an obligation to enact strong implementing legislation, and \nour action to complete ratification of the protocol is long overdue.

Mr. President, today I join with Senator Kerry \nin introducing the Antarctic Science, Tourism, and Conservation Act of \n1996, which will implement the Protocol on Environmental Protection to \nthe Antarctic Treaty. The protocol was signed by the United States 5 \nyears ago and approved by the Senate in the 102d Congress; yet \nimplementing legislation remains to be completed. In the 103d Congress, \nthe Senate Commerce Committee reported implementing legislation, but \ndifferences among key agencies and interests prevented further action. \nNow that those differences have been reconciled, it is timely to \ncomplete the implementation effort.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Antarctica in 1988, and can attest \nboth to its pristine beauty and to the unique scientific activities \nbeing conducted there. As many of my colleagues know, the activities of \nU.S. citizens and interests in Antarctica are almost exclusively those \nof federally sponsored scientific expeditions, together with their \nFederal logistics support. These activities are concentrated at the \nedge of the ice shelf and are based at the three U.S. research \nstations: McMurdo, South Pole, and Palmer. The peak of activity occurs \nat the height of the Antarctic summer, when there are about 1,200 \npersonnel at McMurdo, 140 at South Pole, and 40 at Palmer. Occasional \nU.S. tourists visit as well, under the overall responsibility of the \nNational Science Foundation [NSF]. NSF and the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration [NOAA] are the main scientific agencies, and \nthe logistics and icebreaking support is provided by the Navy and Coast \nGuard.\n  The Antarctic provides scientists with a truly unique laboratory to \nconduct research that cannot be carried out anywhere else. During my \nvisit I was impressed by a number of dedicated scientists operating \nunder difficult circumstances to help us to understand better our \nglobal environment. I witnessed NOAA's ozone hole research at the South \nPole, the sampling of ice cores at the Newell Glacier along the coast, \nand marine biology investigations at McMurdo. Much of this research has \nimplications for the long term survival of human beings.\n  We must recognize, however, that such scientific endeavors need to be \ncarried out with great care in an environment as fragile as \nAntarctica's. This is essential if Antarctica is to remain a natural \nreserve that is of great scientific value for generations to come. \nWhile much has been done in recent years to improve the environmental \nsoundness of U.S. operations there, the Antarctic Science, Tourism, and \nConservation Act of 1996 will help to ensure that present and future \nU.S. activities comply with the highest environmental standards. \nImplementation of the protocol is long overdue, and I am hopeful that \nwe can enact this bill very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the American \nLegion Post No. 88 in Loudon, NH on their 50th anniversary.\n  On January 18, 1946, the American Legion Post No. 88 applied for \ntheir first charter. Exactly a month later, the members of Post No. 88 \nheld their first meeting and began planning activities for the \ncommunity. The original Post No. 88 application had 15 names including \nH.L. Annis, C.H. Derby, C.B. Hall, S.B. Hall, W.G. Harrison, Laura A. \nHayward, R.C. Lovering, W.L. Manchester, G.P. Marcotte, H. McCoy, P.E. \nMorrill, P.W. Ordway, L.C. Palmer, D.P. Reardon and D.B. Stuart. W.L. \nManchester was first the Commander of Post No. 88. This milestone of 50 \nyears is a significant accomplishment for all the post members.\n  The members of Post No. 88 have become an integral part of the Loudon \ncommunity and donate hundreds of hours of service to their community \neach year. So many veterans, children and needy families have been \ntouched by the assistance these legionnaires provide through their \nvolunteer work. They visit fellow veterans in local hospitals, \ncoordinate youth programs and are involved with numerous Boy Scout and \n4-H groups who use the post headquarters for meetings. Post No. 88 also \nparticipates in the nationwide legion efforts which include: sponsoring \nstudents for both Boys and Girls State, sponsoring poster contests that \nfocus on patriotism in local schools, writing and mailing letters to \nAmerican troops in Bosnia, recycling, collecting eyeglasses for the \nneedy, helping the elderly with housing, and making quilts for at-risk \nchildren. All the members of Post No. 88 deserve a special word of \nappreciation for serving the Loudon and Concord communities so \ndiligently. Many people have greatly benefited from their goodwill and \ncharity.\n  Fifty years ago, Post No. 88 opened its doors to the town of Loudon. \nJust last month, exactly 50 years later, a special anniversary program \nfor Post No. 88 was held in the original building on South Village \nRoad. In fact, one of charter members of the auxiliary unit, Marion \nStuart, attended the ceremony.\n  We are truly fortunate to have such a caring group of individuals at \nthe American Legion Post No. 88. For half a century, these members have \nexemplified goodwill and concern for their needy neighbors and their \nefforts will no doubt continue for the next 50 years. As a veteran, I \ncongratulate Post No. 88 on their steadfast service to Loudon and \nConcord. New Hampshire is truly indebted to the Loudon American Legion \nPost No. 88.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2883-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2883-S2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I came to the \nfloor to announce the realization of another component of our \ninitiative to prevent violence against women--the national domestic \nviolence hotline. At that time, I indicated that I would come to the \nfloor every day for 2 weeks, whenever my colleagues would be kind \nenough to give me about 30 seconds of time, to read off the 800 number \nof the hotline.\n  The toll-free number, 1-800-799-SAFE, will provide immediate crisis \ncounseling, and local shelter referrals to women across the country, 24 \nhours a day. There is also a TDD number for the hearing impaired, 1-\n800-787-3224.\n  Mr. President, roughly 1 million women are victims of domestic \nviolence each year and battering may be the single most common cause of \ninjury to women--more common than auto accidents, muggings, or rapes by \na stranger. According to the FBI, one of every two women in America \nwill be beaten at least once in the course of an intimate relationship. \nThe FBI also speculates that battering is the most under-reported crime \nin the country. It is estimated that the new hotline will receive close \nto 10,000 calls a day.\n  I hope that the new national domestic violence hotline will help \nwomen and families find the support, assistance, and services they need \nto get out of homes where there is violence and abuse.\n  Mr. President, once again, the toll-free number is 1-800-787-3224, \nfor the hearing impaired.\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\n\n\n                  COMMEMORATING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Greek \nIndependence Day--a national day of celebration of Greek and American \ndemocracy. Yesterday marked the 175th anniversary of the beginning of \nthe revolution which freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire.\n  A historic bond exists between Greece and America, forged by our \nshared democratic heritage. America is truly indebted to the ancient \nGreeks for giving the world the first example of direct democracy. The \nphilosophical and democratic influences of the ancient Greeks provides \nthe inspiration for our democratic Government to flourish. It is \ntherefore fitting that Members of this Chamber join in paying tribute \nto the long struggle for freedom that Greece endured.\n  On March 25, 1821, when Germanos, the archbishop of Patros, \nproclaimed Greek independence, another link between Greece and the \nUnited States was forged. The American revolution served as a model for \nthe Greek struggle for freedom and when the Declaration of \nIndependence, translated into Greek, served as the declaration of the \nend of the Greek struggle, a circle was completed.\n  The interconnection between Greek and American democracies lies not \nonly in the philosophical underpinnings of our Government, but in many \nareas of American life. Percy Bysshe Shelley once said, ``We are all \nGreeks! Our laws, our literature, our religion, our art, have their \nroots in Greece.'' The tremendous influence that Greece has had on \nAmerican life continues today through the activities of the vibrant \nGreek community in America. In every field--politics, entertainment, \nbusiness and education--Greek-Americans continue to contribute to \nAmerican life.\n  In particular, I wish to pay tribute to the Greek-American community \nin New Jersey. Groups that are leaders in the New Jersey Greek \nCommunity include: the Greek American Chamber of Commerce of New \nJersey, the Greek American Voters League of New Jersey, the Hellenic \nAmerican Bar Association of New Jersey, the Pan Gregorian Enterprises & \nFoundation, P.G.E.I. of America Charitables Foundation, Inc., the \nCouncil Generals of Greek Cypriot, the Order of AHEPA and the Joint \nPublic Policy Committee of Hellenic American Women. On behalf of these \norganizations, the Greek community in New Jersey and all Americans of \nGreek descent, I am honored to pay tribute, on behalf of the Nation, to \nthe Greek community during the celebration of their independence \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2883-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE LONDONDERRY HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND FOR BEING \n               SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ROSE PARADE\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

All the band members including Andrew Soucy, the \nband's director, deserve special commendation for their hard work and \nachievement.\n  Being selected for the Tournament of Roses Parade is quite an honor \nfor a high school band. The Lancer Marching Band has a proud tradition \nof representing the Granite State in parades across the country. They \nhave also performed in Washington, DC, for the St. Patrick's Day \nParade, at Foxboro Stadium for the New England Patriots football team, \nand this will be the second time the Londonderry Lancers will appear in \nthe Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade. The Lancers should be very \nproud of their efforts because only the very best bands in the country \nare asked to participate in this nationally recognized New Years Day \nparade.\n  The young men and women of the Lancer Band and Colorguard demonstrate \nthe hard work and dedication that is characteristic of the Granite \nState students. As special participants in the Tournament of Roses \nParade, these students have proven that determination and teamwork are \nthe hallmark of success both as musicians and students. We are honored \nto have the Lancer Band and Colorguard representing New Hampshire with \ntheir outstanding musical performances.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to both the students and \nfaculty at Londonderry High School for their commitment to excellence. \nCongratulations again on such a magnificent accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2884-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SHERMAN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, A 1996 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL OF \n                               EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER Mr. President, I want to take this \nopportunity to recognize Sherman Junior High School of Seth, WV. This \ninstitution was recently selected as a 1996 National Blue Ribbon School \nof Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. It was 1 of 6 \nsecondary schools in my State to garner this prestigious award, and 1 \nof only 216 public schools from throughout the United States to get \nthis recognition.\n  Sherman Junior High School's motto is ``We believe, we achieve, we \nsucceed.'' It is thoughtful, provocative and obviously works. For if \nbelieving in yourself defines your ability to succeed, let me share \nwith everyone a little taste of the tremendous feats this school has \naccomplished.\n  Sherman Junior High School is nestled in a remote southern portion of \nmy State in Boone County, a rural Appalachia county in our legendary \ncoal fields. The geography of this region is challenging. The coal \nindustry dominates the local economy and has a history of sporadic \nemployment which affects the families and the community greatly, \nincluding school enrollment and student attendance.\n  There are more than 200 students enrolled in Sherman Junior High \nSchool and most of them have to be bused over narrow, rough roads \nwithin a 20-mile radius of the school. Many ride these buses for almost \nan hour each way, and more than half of the students qualify for free \nor reduced lunches. Because these students live in a rural, isolated \narea, the school is their primary center for most activities ranging \nfrom cultural events to sports which are crucial activities to help \nyoung people make the transition into adulthood.\n  Under the leadership and support of Principal John Hudson, the \ncreative staff of Sherman Junior High shared their facilities with the \nlocal high school, but maintained their autonomy with a separate \nadministration and faculty. This gives the students a sense of \ncommunity, while also having access to more facilities and high school \nprograms for students ready to accept more challenging programs. For \nexample, many junior high students have an opportunity to learn basic \ncomputer and word processing skills. They can also take advanced \nacademic classes, like a foreign language. Having enhanced \nopportunities obviously makes a difference in the lives of these young \npeople, because almost 70 percent of the students of Sherman Junior \nHigh School score above the 50 percentile on their annual CTBS tests.\n  This is a time when public education faces many challenges--dwindling \nresources, intense public debates over the proper role of public \neducation, and integrating new technologies into schoolrooms and \nteaching. Sherman Junior High is a school that is facing such \nchallenges. The enthusiastic and caring teachers and administrators are \ncommitted to providing our students with the quality education. As a \nNational Blue Ribbon School, Sherman Junior High is a role model on how \nteachers, administrators, parents, and students can come together and \ncreate an educational environment that helps young people excel. Every \nmember of Sherman Junior High School should be proud of the \naccomplishments achieved. It is my pleasure to publicly congratulate \nthis school for its community spirit and academic success. I know this \nschool will keep up the good work, and continue to represent West \nVirginia proudly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2884-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2884-S2885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I come to this debate on the minimum wage \nfrom a different perspective than some of my colleagues here today. In \nJanuary of this year, my State of Delaware decided to raise the minimum \nwage, after\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\na debate a lot like the one we are hearing today.\n  We like to think that Delaware is a special place, Mr. President, and \nin many ways it is. But it is also a lot like the rest of the country. \nWe have big businesses and small, we have world-class high-technology \nbusinesses in chemicals and pharmaceuticals, a cutting-edge financial \nservice sector and--a lot of my colleagues are surprised when I tell \nthem this--a major agricultural sector.\n  With that kind of diversity, I think Delaware has something to teach \nthe rest of the country. We are, after all, the first State to ratify \nthe Constitution, so we think our example is worth following.\n  The proposal we adopted in Delaware is much like the one before the \nSenate today. The proposal before us today would call for a two-step \nincrease in the minimum wage, from the current $4.25 an hour to $5.15. \nIn Delaware, we also chose a two-step increase, from $4.25 to $5.00.\n  In my State, that increase will directly affect over 30,000 \nDelawareans and their families, 9.5 percent of the work force, just a \nlittle below the national average of 11.5 percent who currently work \nfor the minimum wage.\n  So Delaware is like the rest of the country, Mr. President, just a \nlittle bit ahead of everybody else when it comes to addressing the \nproblem of stagnant family incomes in general and the shrinking value \nof the minimum wage in particular.\n  And that is what I would like to talk about today, Mr. President--the \npuzzle of why, in a growing economy, with rising productivity and \nrising profits, a full-time job for hard-working adults has failed to \nprovide a rising standard of living.\n  The minimum wage itself provides one important illustration of this \ndisturbing trend. Since 1991, the last time we raised the minimum \nwage--with a bipartisan majority, Mr. President, and signed into law by \nPresident Bush--the real spending power of the minimum wage has dropped \nnearly 50 cents.\n  If we fail to raise the minimum wage, it will drop to a 40-year low \nwhen this year is over. Right now, you can put in a full 40-hour \nworkweek, 52 weeks a year, and take home just $8,840, just three-\nquarters of the poverty level for a family of three.\n  For those families, with a full-time worker, the current minimum wage \nis not even the minimum they need to stay out of poverty. That is \nsomething we cannot forget as we search for ways to convince more \npeople to stay off of welfare and to turn away from crime.\n  There are, unfortunately, other examples of the declining rewards of \nhard work for so many American families.\n  It is not just those wage earners who are working to keep themselves \nand their families out of poverty who have seen their incomes stuck, \nwho are running as fast as they can just to keep from falling further \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, the median wage--the real middle income statistically \nspeaking--is actually 5 percent less this year than it was in 1979. \nThis is happening in an economy that has been growing at about 2.5 \npercent over the same time.\n  Where has all that growth been going? Who has gained from the growth \nin the economy? Between 1977 and 1992, the lowest 20 percent of \nAmerican families saw their incomes drop 17 percent. But the top 20 \npercent enjoyed a 28-percent increase, and the top 1 percent saw their \nincomes shoot up 91 percent--virtually doubling.\n  So there has been growth, Mr. President, but the distribution of that \ngrowth among working families has been increasingly unequal.\n  Now, I for one do not think that human nature has changed all that \nmuch in the last 20 to 25 years. I do not think the richest 1 percent \nare suddenly twice as smart as they used to be, or that workers at the \nother end of the scale decided to become less productive.\n  Something else is going on, Mr. President, something more fundamental \nand far reaching than a simple business cycle, perhaps something we \nhave seen only a couple of times before in our Nation's economic \nhistory. There is a lot of evidence that the economy no longer \nfunctions the way it used to, that it no longer provides the stable, \nmiddle-income jobs that built America's middle class after World War \nII.\n  As someone who has put his faith in the free enterprise system, Mr. \nPresident, I am inclined to see these changes as part of the way this \nsystem works--changing markets, changing products, changing skills have \nalways been a key feature of the American economy.\n  But while Americans have a strong tolerance--even an appetite--for \nthe dynamic shifts that characterize our economic system, they have an \nequally strong sense of fairness. Americans expect that hard work will \nbe rewarded--not with riches, maybe, but certainly with a little \nsecurity and a little comfort.\n  For far too many Americans, Mr. President, our system is providing \nfar too much of those dynamic changes and far too little fairness.\n  I don't want my colleagues to forget that the absolute, bedrock \nrequirement of our democratic system is the belief by the majority of \nour people that they are being treated fairly. Because this is not just \na free enterprise economy, Mr. President, that we have here in America. \nWe are blessed to have a system of popular government that provides and \nprotects the property rights that are the foundation of our economy.\n  Take away that sense of fairness, take away the sense that at the end \nof the day, there is some justice in the way our capitalist democracy \nworks, and people can start looking at other systems, other answers. \nThe unhappy history of this century provides too many examples for us \nto blithely dismiss this problem.\n  It is not too much to say that the real bottom line that we have to \nkeep our eyes on is on the balance sheet of fairness. No amount of \nnational wealth can buy that sense of fairness, no list of statistics \ncan substitute for it.\n  As an optimist, Mr. President, I do not believe we are facing an \ninsurmountable crisis. In fact, by my reading, a large part of our \nhistory has been a pretty successful search for ways to balance the \nchanging demands of a dynamic economy with the unchanging demand for \nsome basic fairness, for some simple justice, in the way we reward \nwork.\n  We can make work pay, and make work a realistic alternative to the \nwasteful choices of welfare or crime, that will surely cost us more \nthan the modest minimum wage bill before us today.\n  So I urge my colleagues to follow the lead of my State of Delaware. \nRestore some of the historical value of the minimum wage, some of the \njustice that is the real bottom line in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2884-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2885-S2886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDMUND SIXTUS MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying respect to \nthe memory of former Senator Edmund Muskie. He was a very productive \nMember of this body and he made great contributions to its \ndeliberations and to the welfare of our Nation. I admired him very \nmuch.\n  I first came to know Ed Muskie when he was Governor of Maine and a \ndelegate to our party's national conventions. I always found him to be \na person of great common sense and practicality, traits that reflected \nhis years of experience in the Maine State Legislature and before that \nas a city official in Waterville.\n  He was always a highly effective advocate for the interests of New \nEngland, and in that role as in other aspects of his wide ranging \nSenate career, he was capable of displaying his sense of righteous \nindignation in the interests of producing results.\n  Perhaps his greatest and most lasting contribution was his work in \nsecuring enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and his \nsubsequent service as the first chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. Here his practical vision saw the need for a consolidated \nlegislative budget that coordinated and reconciled legislative \nappropriations with executive spending.\n  Ed Muskie's Senate career came to a sudden and surprising conclusion \nwith his elevation to the office of Secretary of State in the Carter \nadministration at the height of the Iraq crisis in 1980. It was a \nmeasure of Senator Muskie's statute in the Senate and in the Nation \nthat President Carter turned to him at a time when circumstances called \nfor a steady and authoritative hand.\n  It was a fitting climax to a career of exceptionally distinguished \npublic service.\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\n  I join my colleagues in honoring the memory of Edmund Muskie and I \nextend my sympathy to his wife Jane, family and many associates in \nMaine and across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2885-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ED MUSKIE: A TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a colleague and friend of mine who has just recently passed \naway. To those of us who were here during the sixties and seventies, \nEdmund Muskie was more than a fellow legislator, he was a model of what \na Senator should be. He was well liked and respected by all, and he \nlistened to his constituents closely, and he effected change on their \nbehalf.\n  To put it simply, Ed Muskie was the best. Today, with all the talk \nabout the Government being too big, and all the public scorn for the \nestablishment, it is easy to lose sight of the optimism that used to be \na driving force of politics. Senator Muskie embodied that optimism; He \nlooked upon government as an opportunity, as a solution to problems. \nCharacteristically, he acted on these beliefs to get things done. He \nled the demand for fiscal responsibility. As the first chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee in 1974, he virtually created the budget \nprocess. He will also be remembered as a great environmental \nlegislator. The Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act: these were not a \npart of Muskie's political agenda due to pressure from lobbyists or \nspecial interest groups. They were things that he believed were \nnecessary, and so he made them happen.\n  I knew Ed Muskie long before I came to the Senate, and he always felt \nthings keenly. I used to joke with him about what I called his \nrighteous indignation, but I always respected the moral conviction and \nstrength that lay behind it. Senator Muskie detested the influence of \nlobbies and partisanship, and what they were doing to politics. He was \nin government to do a good job, not to play games. He was--and in this \ncity, this is a great compliment--a man who got things done. The \nprinciples that he lived by came through in his work, whether as a \nSenator, a Secretary of State or as a lawyer and statesman. He knew the \nimportance of character and of listening to the voter.\n  In 1970, Senator Muskie gave a memorable speech in which he said: \n``There are only two kinds of politics. They are not radical and \nreactionary, or conservative and liberal, or even Democratic and \nRepublican. They are only the politics of fear and the politics of \ntrust.'' As we head into another election year and another century, \nthese are words to remember. Ed Muskie was a champion of the politics \nof trust. We will remember him fondly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2886-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDMUND SIXTUS MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, few who ever served in this body have been \nas universally mourned as those of us from both sides of the aisle who \nknew him will mourn our former colleague, Ed Muskie, who died here in \nWashington early this morning.\n  The reports already circulating on the news wire services and the \nobituaries that will appear in tomorrow's newspapers, all will make \nmuch, and rightly so, out of his long and distinguished service as a \npublic man.\n  Few men or women in our history have contributed so much to the \nNation as Ed Muskie did as a U.S. Senator for 21 years and as Secretary \nof State; few have contributed as much to their native State as Ed \nMuskie did as a member of the Maine House of Representatives and as \nGovernor of the State he loved so much; and few have contributed as \nmuch to one of the major political parties as Ed Muskie did to the \nDemocratic Party, which he served as a Vice Presidential candidate in \n1968 and as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  It is fitting that, upon his death just 2 days before his 82d \nbirthday, Americans should be reminded of his long and faithful public \nservice and leadership--but those of us who knew and served with Ed \nMuskie will remember him more familiarly as a man of principle, as a \npowerful personality, and, most of all, as our good friend.\n  One thing that I learned very quickly, serving with him on the Budget \nCommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee, was that while he \nexhibited the gravitas--the character and substance--that might be \nexpected of a man whose full given name was Edmund Sixtus Muskie, he \nwas a very human, very good-humored man--most of the time--who was most \ncomfortable simply as Ed Muskie, and who if he was your friend was your \nfriend for life.\n  It is true that his good humor would sometimes momentarily desert \nhim--he had a temper that verged on the volcanic, and he was capable of \nweeping public tears over an insult to the wife whom he loved--but \nthose moments occurred, for the most part, because Ed Muskie never \nbelieved that a career in politics obliged his head to divorce his \nheart; despite a powerful intellect that won him a law degree, a Phi \nBeta Kappa key and a long, successful career both in law and in \npolitics, he never believed that political feelings must somehow be set \naside.\n  He was passionate about his politics--he believed the work we do here \nis important to improving the lives of Americans--and he believed that \nwhat he felt was as important to achieving that end as what he thought.\n  But though Ed Muskie sometimes wore his heart unashamedly on his \nsleeve, he was also very much a Yankee, very much a man of Maine, who \nput great stock in getting things done, and getting them done at the \nright price.\n  By that I am not referring so much to his chairmanship of the Budget \nCommittee--although he certainly exerted a strong hand at that helm, \noften to the dismay of bureaucrats throughout the land and not \ninfrequently to Senate colleagues who failed to make a strong enough \ncase for their favorite program--no, for him, getting things done at \nthe right price meant achieving that meld of idealism and realism which \nwe often say a democratic system of Government requires but which few \nof us ever achieve with the grace and consistency of an Ed Muskie.\n  The people of Maine understood that as well as we did here in the \nSenate, and he understood and loved them, as well.\n  I remember him saying one time, ``in Maine, we tend not to speak \nunless we think we can improve upon the silence.''\n  Out of his wisdom, out of his passion, out of his drive to get things \ndone, Ed Muskie often spoke up for Maine and for America--and we need \nonly feel the silence of his passing gather about us now to know how \nmuch he improved upon it during a long and accomplished life.\n  In the words of William Shakespeare, ``he was a man, take him for all \nin all, [we] shall not look upon his like again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2886-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2886-S2887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this morning we were sad to learn of the \npassing of one of our most distinguished former colleagues, Senator \nEdmund Muskie of Maine.\n  Ed Muskie served our Nation in many ways. He was a soldier. A \nGovernor. The first chairman of the Budget Committee. The Secretary of \nState. The Democratic Party's candidate for Vice President.\n  He also was responsible, in large part, for one of the most positive \nand profound legislative achievements of postwar America: the passage \nof the environmental laws of the 1970's, to clean up our Nation's air, \nwater, and waste.\n  Remember what things were like 25 years ago. We had experienced \ndecades of industrial growth without environmental protection. Lead in \nthe air caused brain damage in children. Toxic waste dumps all across \nthe country caused cancer. The Cuyahoga River even caught fire.\n  Something had to be done. And, as chairman of the Environmental \nProtection Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nEd Muskie saw that it was. He worked tirelessly to create bipartisan \nsupport for landmark environmental laws.\n  The Clean Water Act, requiring rivers and streams to be fishable and \nswimmable; the Clean Air Act, cutting emissions from cars and \nfactories; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Endangered Species Act.\n  These laws are not perfect. But, on the whole, they have been \nremarkably successful. Our air is cleaner. Lead\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nemissions fell nearly 90 percent. To put it another way, we took nearly \nfive ounces of lead out of the sky for every American man, woman, and \nchild. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulates \nare way down, and half as many Americans live in cities with unhealthy \nair as in 1970.\n  Our water is cleaner. You can swim without getting sick and eat the \nfish you catch in twice as many rivers and streams. Even the Cuyahoga \nRiver has revived, to become a center for tourism in downtown \nCleveland. The bald eagle is back from the brink of extinction.\n  Overall, because of the work of Ed Muskie and his colleagues, our \nchildren are growing up in a more healthy and beautiful America.\n  Mr. President, I am reminded of the Latin epitaph on the tomb of Sir \nChristopher Wren, the architect of St. Paul's Cathedral. It's inside \nthe cathedral, and it says, ``If you would see his memorial, look \naround.''\n  So it is with Ed Muskie. If you wish to see his memorial, look around \nyou: at the air in our cities; at the Potomac River, or the Cuyahoga; \nat a cleaner environment from Maine to Montana; at a nation that is \nmore healthy and more beautiful because of his work.\n  He was a great environmental statesman, and his passing diminishes \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/26/senate-section/article/S2886-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) multiple use, as set forth in current law, has been and \n     continues to be a guiding principle in the management of \n     public lands and national forests;\n       (2) through the cooperative and concerted efforts of the \n     Federal rangeland livestock industry, Federal and State land \n     management agencies, and the general public, the Federal \n     rangelands are in the best condition they have been in during \n     this century, and their condition continues to improve;\n       (3) as a further consequence of those efforts, populations \n     of wildlife are increasing and stabilizing across vast areas \n     of the West;\n       (4) grazing preferences must continue to be adequately \n     safeguarded in order to promote the economic stability of the \n     western livestock industry;\n       (5) it is in the public interest to charge a fee for \n     livestock grazing permits and leases on Federal land that is \n     based on a formula that--\n       (A) reflects a fair return to the Federal Government and \n     the true costs to the permittee or lessee; and\n       (B) promotes continuing cooperative stewardship efforts;\n       (6) opportunities exist for improving efficiency in the \n     administration of the range programs on Federal land by--\n       (A) reducing planning and analysis costs and their \n     associated paperwork, procedural, and clerical burdens; and\n       (B) refocusing efforts to the direct management of the \n     resources themselves;\n       (7) in order to provide meaningful review and oversight of \n     the management of the public rangelands and the grazing \n     allotment on those rangelands, refinement of the reporting of \n     costs of various components of the land management program is \n     needed;\n       (8) greater local input into the management of the public \n     rangelands is in the best interests of the United States;\n       (9) the western livestock industry that relies on Federal \n     land plays an important role in preserving the social, \n     economic, and cultural base of rural communities in the \n     Western States and further plays an integral role in the \n     economies of the 16 contiguous Western States with Federal \n     rangelands;\n       (10) maintaining the economic viability of the western \n     livestock industry is in the best interest of the United \n     States in order to maintain open space and fish and wildlife \n     habitat;\n       (11) since the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the \n     amendment of section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) by the \n     National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a et \n     seq.), the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture have been charged with coordinating land use \n     inventory, planning and management programs on Bureau of Land \n     Management and National Forest System lands with each other, \n     other Federal departments and agencies, Indian tribes, and \n     State and local governments within which the lands are \n     located, but to date such coordination has not existed to the \n     extent allowed by law; and\n       (12) it shall not be the policy of the United States to \n     increase or reduce total livestock numbers on Federal land \n     except as is necessary to provide for proper management of \n     resources, based on local conditions, and as provided by \n     existing law related to the management of Federal land and \n     this title.\n       (b) Repeal of Earlier Findings.--Section 2(a) of the Public \n     Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1901(a)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4);\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as paragraphs \n     (1) and (2), respectively;\n       (3) in paragraph (1) (as so redesignated), by adding \n     ``and'' at the end; and\n       (4) in paragraph (2) (as so redesignated)--\n       (A) by striking ``harrassment'' and inserting \n     ``harassment''; and\n       (B) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a \n     period.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the inclusion of the National Grasslands within the \n     National Forest System has prevented the Secretary of \n     Agriculture from effectively administering and promoting \n     grassland agriculture on National Grasslands as originally \n     intended under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act;\n       (2) the National Grasslands can be more effectively managed \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture if administered as a separate \n     entity outside of the National Forest System; and\n       (3) a grazing program on National Grasslands can be \n     responsibly carried out while protecting and preserving \n     sporting, recreational, environmental, and other multiple \n     uses of the National Grasslands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     improved management and more efficient administration of \n     grazing activities on National Grasslands while preserving \n     and protecting multiple uses of such lands, including but not \n     limited to preserving sportmen's hunting and fishing and \n     other recreational activities, and protecting wildlife \n     habitat in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this title, the term--\n       (1) ``National Grasslands'' means those areas managed as \n     National Grasslands by the Secretary of Agriculture under \n     title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1010-1012) on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     title; and\n       (2) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 204.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1296) to provide for the administration of \n     certain Presidio properties at a minimal cost to the Federal \n     taxpayer.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending: Murkowski modified amendment No. 3564, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n                    amendment no. 3564, as modified\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my substitute \namendment for the Presidio bill, offered in conjunction with the \nSenator from Alaska and the majority leader. Many people have been \nwaiting a long time for this bill. I know the Senators from California \nand Congresswoman Pelosi have put a great deal of time and energy into \nthis legislation, as have the staff from the Energy Committee and \npersonal offices. In our efforts to try to reach consensus on all \nlevels, we have managed to craft a bill that will provide enough \nbalance and flexibility to incorporate all points of view. This bill \noffers a unique, creative and innovative approach to provide for the \nlong-term protection and preservation of one of our Nation's greatest \ncultural, historical, and natural treasures.\n  When I was a college student at San Jose State University, my buddies \nand I would often take off for the weekend to ``the city.'' One of my \nfavorite places back then was the Presidio, and I spent a lot of time \nexploring the batteries and bunkers along the coast. It is just a \nspectacular site, situated on the threshold of the Golden Gate Bridge, \noverlooking the entire bay area. Last fall, I had the opportunity to \nvisit the Presidio, and found that the base had changed very little in \nthe years since I was a college student at San Jose.\n  There is something very special about the Presidio. The natural \nbeauty, as well as the impressive history of the site captivated me 40 \nyears ago, and continues to captivate millions of tourists, locals, and \neven some politicians today.\n  Before Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World, the indigenous \ntribes of Ohlone and Miwok inhabited the area known now as San \nFrancisco. Taking advantage of this unique natural harbor, these tribes \nflourished from fishing in the plentiful bay.\n  When the land was finally taken over by the white new immigrants, the \nPresidio almost immediately became a strategic military post. For over \n220 years, the Presidio is the oldest continually operated military \npost, commanded first by Spain in 1776, then Mexico and finally the \nUnited States in 1846. The Presidio has played a supporting role in \nalmost every single major military conflict the United States has ever \nengaged in, starting with the Spanish-American War to the Civil War, \nWorld War I, and of course, World War II. The Presidio served also as a \nrefuge for an estimated 16,000 people after the great earthquake and \nfire of 1906, and was the very first Army airfield established in the \nNation in 1921.\n  Mr. President, the history of this national historic landmark is \nindeed distinguished and celebrated. I comment on it to describe to my \ncolleagues the unique nature of this site and thus to explain the \nparticulars of the legislation it requires.\n  For the past 7 years, since the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission [BRAC] included the Presidio on its list of bases to be \nclosed, the fate of the Presidio has been somewhat uncertain. When the \nNational Park Service took control of the post in 1994, along with the \naddition of one of the most glorious parks to the system, the Park \nService was faced with one of their most complex and challenging \nmanagement problems.\n  Aside from its spectacular natural beauty, the Presidio is unlike any \nother national park. Scattered throughout the grounds are over 1,200 \nresidential units, more than 6.2 million square feet of building space, \nand dozens of miles of paved roads. Because of the nature of the \nhistoric facilities, the cost of maintenance and management of this \nsite is a whopping $25 million a year, making it our most expensive \nnational park. Faced with the fiscal realities that we, in the Federal \nGovernment, must confront, the question that was posed to Congress was \nthis: How can we continue to protect and preserve the Presidio for the \nbenefit of all Americans without draining the already limited reserves \nof the National Park Service?\n  Mr. President, I believe the substitute amendment offered by Senators \nDole and Murkowski and myself answers this question and in so doing, \nstrikes the balance that we are all looking for.\n  The bill before us today establishes a mechanism that will reduce the \nneed for appropriations to operate the Presidio. Rather than seeing the \ninfrastructure in the Presidio as obstacles to the preservation of the \npark, this bill will utilize these buildings to generate revenues that \nwill be recycled back into the funds that manage the park. By weaning \nthe Presidio off of Federal taxpayer dependency, this bill will \neventually create a self-sustaining park. The management structure \ncreated by our bill will enable the Presidio to be used in such a way \nthat it will pay for itself.\n  Mr. President, our legislation will create a public-private \nmanagement entity--the Presidio Trust--to provide for the management of \nthe leasing, maintenance, and repair of the property within the \nPresidio. In addition, the National Park Service will continue to \nprovide its expert guidance for interpretive services, visitor \norientation, and educational programs. Under the structure of \ncooperative management, this bill will allow the trust (made up of \nprivate sector real estate and finance experts) and the Park Service to \nmanage what they manage best, thereby eliminating costly bureaucratic \nblunders. If the bill is enacted, the Presidio will be the only unit of \nthe National Park System, that will cost significantly less in 10 years \nthan it costs today.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, I had the opportunity to tour the base \nfacilities in San Francisco, as well as meet with the various interest \ngroups last fall. While there were some differences on what the \nlegislation affecting the Presidio should include, the groups were \nunanimous in their belief that the base should remain as a unit of the \nNational Park System. People expressed real fears that there was a \nmovement to sell the Presidio to a private developer, and I stated, at \nthe time, that a sale would happen, ``over my dead body.'' Many of my \ncolleagues feel the same way.\n  This bill will not enable private interests to develop swank upscale \ncondos, or private dining clubs. This bill will cater only to the \ninterests of all Americans, by protecting the invaluable cultural, \nhistoric, and natural resources of the Presidio for this generation and \ngenerations to come. It is quite simply a good government approach that \nstrikes a balance with the fiscal realities of our time with the need \nfor continued conservation and preservation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this worthy piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the substitute to H.R. \n1296.\n  Mr. DOLE. Presidio properties bill, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, I do not know how many different projects \nare involved here, but they are all related and come from the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts would like to add to that the minimum wage amendment, \nwhich we do not believe belongs on this bill. Maybe it will belong on \nsome other bill. It should not be considered at this time.\n  We would like to complete action on this. We have a number of items \nto complete this week, including, we hope, the farm bill conference \nreport, line-item veto conference report, the omnibus appropriations \nbill, and, of course, the debt ceiling. It would be our hope we can \ncomplete action some time early on Friday. That may or may not happen. \nIf not, I suggest we probably would have to be here on Saturday to \ncomplete action on those bills because some relate to whether or not \nthe Government is shut down.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment regarding the \nLost Creek Land Exchange Act of 1996.\n  This amendment is important for the acquisition of the Lost Creek \narea of Montana for the public.\n  I want to emphasize that this amendment is a starting point. I fully \nanticipate major changes will need to be made when this bill goes to \nconference with the House. Yet, the process needs to move forward.\n  Under this amendment, 14,500 acres of blueribbon bighorn sheep \nhabitat known as Lost Creek would became a part of the Deerlodge \nNational Forest. For the past few years, local sportsmen and \nconservation groups, the Forest Service, and many others have been \ninterested in the public acquiring this prime habitat. I, too, believe \nthis is a worthwhile endeavor.\n  The amendment would transfer the Lost Creek area, and 3,000 \nadditional acres currently owned by R-Y Timber, to the Forest Service. \nIn return R-Y Timber will acquire the deed to land and timber.\n  The Lost Creek area has been valued at about $8 million. And the days \nof the Federal Government simply paying the price tag are over.\n  With assistance from the Forest Service, I am hopeful that \nalternative lands can be found to exchange for the Lost Creek area. The \nForest Service has started this process.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier the amendment I am offering is a \nstarting point. I fully anticipate having to make substantial changes \nwhen we move to conference. I hope that the parties involved will \ncontinue to work together so this win-win bill can made it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we have not had \nthe opportunity until now to debate the minimum wage amendment. On \nApril 1, it will be 5 years since the last time the minimum wage was \nincreased.\n  We are now at the lowest point we have been in nearly 40 years with \nregard to the purchasing power the minimum wage provides. That is \nunacceptable, at a time when we see CEO incomes going up by 23 percent \nto an average in the country today of $990,000--something we do not \ndeny to them and something we certainly would not want to preclude. \nMany of them certainly deserve it.\n  There ought to be recognition, however, as we consider welfare reform \nand all of the other legislative measures that we are contemplating, \nthat we need to provide more opportunity for people to go to work, and \nwe ought to give them an economic incentive to do so.\n  People do not have the economic wherewithal, working full time at the \nminimum-wage today, to stay out of poverty. That is unacceptable. \nSooner or later, we will have a vote on the minimum wage. Sooner or \nlater, it has to be resolved. Sooner or later, this minimum wage \nincrease must pass. We can do it sooner or we can do it later. Our \npreference is to do it sooner. This vehicle affords us the opportunity \nto do that. Whether it is this vehicle or any other bill, I certainly \nhope that we can do it soon.\n  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just heard from the majority leader a \nfew moments ago that we were not going to be able to have an \nopportunity to debate and take action on the minimum wage.\n  We are required now to use whatever parliamentary means we can to try \nand permit working families to see a judgment about whether this body \nis going to make a statement about increasing the minimum wage. The \nmajority leader had been a leader in 1989 when we restored the minimum \nwage up to the small increase in its purchasing power. If we could \ngather from the majority leader--I see that he is moving into the \ncloakroom at the present time, so I guess that is an indication of what \nthe answer would be.\n  We were going to try and get at least some agreement as to when we \nmight be able to bring this up. We are denied even that opportunity to \ndo so, in spite of the fact that there was an indication from the \nRepublican leadership that we were going to have the minority leader or \nhis designee be recognized to offer an amendment. And we understood, \nsince that was not a fixed order, that that was the intention of the \nRepublican leadership at that time. We were denied the opportunity to \nhave the bill before us.\n  Now we have the bill before us, and we were denied the opportunity to \nbe able to debate that, or at least get a short time agreement. We are \nquite prepared to do it, as has been pointed out by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, and Senator Wellstone.\n  This is not a new issue. We were prepared to enter into a short time \nperiod, or at least have the opportunity to set a date for \nconsideration of it. If the majority leader would let us have a fixed \ndate for discussion on it--we were able to persuade the majority leader \nearlier on the health care bill to set a time for debate on it--we \nwould certainly accede to the leader's recommendation, if we would have \na precise time when we would be able to debate it. So if we were able \nto get a time definite, we would certainly respond to a request by the \nleader to have a time definite to be able to vote on this.\n  Mr. President, raising the minimum wage has broad support among the \nAmerican people. The question is whether it has the support of the \nRepublican leadership here in the U.S. Senate, Senator Dole and the \nrest of the Republican leadership.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Senator Dole supported this in the past. So \nthe question is whether he is willing at this time to give an \nopportunity for us to vote on this measure now, or in the very near \nfuture.\n  We believe that working families deserve a raise. Minimum-wage \nfamilies deserve a raise most of all. Nobody who works for a living \nshould have to live in poverty.\n  It is basically the leader's decision that is going to make all the \ndifference as to whether we are going to be able to act together, as we \nhave in the past. We saw Republican Presidents, like Eisenhower, Nixon, \nBush, who all supported that increase. And Republicans here, with some \nexceptions, supported that increase in 1989. All we are waiting for--\nand I think what the working families in this country are waiting for--\nis the majority leader to indicate that he, like others in this body, \nis on the side of working families. I hope that we will have a chance \nto do this because, as we have said, this issue is not going to go \naway. We understand the full agenda that is necessary for action.\n  I would certainly ask the minority leader if the time could be \nestablished definite, if he would work out a precise time with the \nmajority leader so that working families in this country would know \nwhen the Senate was going to debate this issue. We will have to try to \ndo the best we can under the circumstances that we have, but I deplore \nthe fact that we are effectively denied the opportunity to debate this \nissue and to take action. I think it is an issue of fundamental \nfairness and justice. It is an issue involving families, women, and \nchildren, and the Senate should not turn its back on those families \nthis afternoon or in these next days.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE and Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will defer to my colleague from Massachusetts. I \nwill take 1 minute.\n  I have been in the Chamber since this morning with my two colleagues. \nThis amendment is simple and straightforward. It would increase the \nminimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 over 2 years--90 cents over 2 \nyears. I will say it one more time. Senators and Representatives gave \nthemselves, a few years ago, a very hefty salary increase from about \n$100,000 a year to about $130,000 a year. It seems to me we can give \nheads of working families the same kind of increase.\n  I do not think this is too much to ask. I think this is very much \nabout economic fairness. While we are putting off a vote on this, there \nare many people who have to live with this minimum wage. This is \nextremely important to 200,000 working families in my State, much less \ntheir children, and I believe this effort to just block having an up-\nor-down vote goes against the grain of what is called accountability. \nWe will bring this amendment up over and over and over and over again \nuntil there is a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we came to the floor this morning with the \nunderstanding that, while not as an official order, the minimum wage \namendment was going to be offered. The minority leader was going to \nhave time and the minority leader's designee was going to have an \nopportunity to submit the amendment. Senator Kennedy was the designee \nand, indeed, the Senator intended to offer the minimum wage amendment.\n  We were blocked this morning from doing that, and now this afternoon \na parliamentary process of what is called filling up the tree, putting \nin two amendments behind each other, which locks in the debate again, \nprecludes a debate on the minimum wage at this time. But Senator \nKennedy has submitted an amendment to the underlying amendment, and I \nhave submitted a second-degree amendment to that not because we are \ntrying to tie up the Senate and not because we are trying to delay the \nprocess of resolving this other legislation but simply because, as \nSenator Kennedy has said, we would like to have an answer. We would \nlike to have a time.\n  We work this out in the Senate all the time. We have an agreement \nwith respect to the health care bill. We know there will be a time \ncertain for debate on an issue of major importance to the American \npeople. All we are asking for is some kind of bipartisan agreement and \nunderstanding as to when we can have a vote, a debate and a decision, \non whether or not we are going to give working people at the lowest end \nof the income scale a pay raise. Corporate America has had a pay raise \nalmost every day of the year last year. The stock market went up 34 \npercent in 1 year. The chief executive officers of companies are \nwalking away with, what, 200 times the salary of workers. It used to be \nonly 50 times and now it is 200 times.\n\n  The stark reality is that in the United States of America in 1996, \nthe minimum wage earns you a record 40-year low, or is about to earn \nyou a record 40-year low. It is a 25-percent reduction over what it was \nin 1979. Through the 1950's, the 1960's, the 1970's, and finally even \nin the 1980's, as the minimum wage gap got bigger and bigger between\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nwhat you earned working and the poverty level, we lifted it. All we are \nsuggesting is that when a worker on the minimum wage earns three-\nquarters of the level of the poverty rate in this country, let us at \nleast lift it up to permit them to get out of poverty.\n  If you are going to give meaning to the notion of work and you are \ngoing to give meaning to the notion of welfare reform, if you are going \nto give meaning to the values we talk about in this Chamber, you have \nto give meaning to work and the money that people earn for working. \nNothing is more fundamental, and we hope that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to have a bipartisan vote on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, the pending issue before \nthe Senate is now the Kerry amendment. I was just wondering whether the \nSenator, my colleague and friend, would be willing to vote on this so \nthat we are not going to delay this with the idea that we would vote \nat, say, 4 o'clock with the time evenly divided between those who \nsupport this measure and those who would be opposed. Would the \nSenator----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say in answer to my colleague, I \nwould be delighted to have any fair amount of time on both sides. I \nthink it would be good if we could have that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat we have a vote at a time certain and have a vote on my underlying \namendment on the minimum wage at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOLE. I object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the regular order is----\n  Mr. DOLE. With no intervening action, I ask for recognition.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, are we going to get taken off our feet \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator going to be taken off his feet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Senator from \nMassachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was going to yield for a question of my \ncolleague. I believe he wanted to ask me a question. I yield for the \npurposes of answering the question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just ask my colleague then if we are \nnot able to get a time definite, which the Senator requested of the \nSenate--there was objection to that--has the Senator reached the \nconclusion that it is those who are objecting who are filibustering \nconsideration of the minimum wage legislation? Would that be his \nconclusion, as it is mine?\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me answer the question of my colleague \nbefore I draw a conclusion. I wonder, since the majority leader is in \nthe Chamber, if, without yielding my right to the floor, I could ask \nthe majority leader if he believes it would be possible for us to work \nout some kind of agreement as to time for a vote.\n  The majority leader was not in the Chamber, but I did say while he \nwas out in the Cloakroom that this is not an effort to try to tie up \nthe Senate. This is not an effort to try to delay the progress on this \nimportant legislation that we need to debate. This is simply an effort \nto try to see if we could reach a time certain for a vote on the \nminimum wage issue. I would ask the majority leader, without losing my \nright to the floor, if he would be willing to answer a question with \nrespect to setting a time certain?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate I would be happy to discuss it. I am not \ncertain we could reach an agreement. But, obviously, this bill, this \namendment will, in effect, defeat the Presidio bill. There will not be \nany vote on the amendment today. There will be a cloture vote tomorrow. \nI assume cloture will not be invoked. Then the bill will come down, and \nI assume then there will be an effort to offer it on the next measure \nsometime this week. But I assume with the AFL-CIO in town and with \ntheir pledge of $35 million, it is probably a fairly appropriate time \nfor Democrats to discuss this measure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, without yet responding to the last comments \nof the majority leader, I again might ask, again without losing my \nright to the floor, I wonder if I could inquire of the majority leader \nwhy it might not be possible to set a time certain sometime in the \nfuture, perhaps a week or 2 weeks so that we could have at least a \nconsideration of this issue on the floor of the Senate. I wonder if the \nmajority leader might be willing to commit to that?\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, again, I will be happy to explore it. I have always \nbeen willing to explore any possibility. Maybe we could couple it with \nsomething we would like to do on this side of the aisle, something the \nmajority leader might like to have happen. We could work some agreement \nlike that. But, again, I have not--nobody has made a proposal except \nthe amendment has been offered.\n  I assume that sooner or later the issue will be voted upon, directly \nor indirectly, but not today and not tomorrow and hopefully not this \nweek, because we have a number of issues before us and this will take, \nas everyone knows, considerable debate. It is an unfunded mandate. It \nis subject to a point of order, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. We all voted to end unfunded mandates, and here we are about to \nimpose, or would like to impose, at least some would like to impose, \nanother unfunded mandate on the very political subdivisions we said we \nwould not mandate different costs and expenditures, whatever. Unless \nsomebody has a proposal to make, now there is an amendment pending, and \nmy view is that we should debate it. If there is to be debate, that is \nfine. There will be no vote. We will just wait and have the cloture \nvote tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Massachusetts has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield for a question to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the leader be willing to find an agreeable time \nwith the minority leader, the two leaders find an agreeable time, say, \nby June 10, to consider this legislation in the Chamber?\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, I would be happy to discuss it with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. I am not certain I \nwould make that agreement.\n  I know it is important on that side of the aisle. It may be important \nto some on this side of the aisle. But it is also important to many \nsmall businesses in America. It is very controversial.\n  I just do not believe it should be on this bill unless the intent is \nto kill this bill. Maybe it is. I happen to support it. There are 23 \nStates involved in this legislation: West Virginia, Massachusetts, \nCalifornia, Louisiana, Tennessee. I do not think the State of Kansas is \ninvolved, but there are a number of States--Colorado.\n  So I hope we might dispose of the pending legislation and then \ncomplete action on a number of conference reports this week and get the \nomnibus appropriation bill passed and the debt ceiling extension. That \nwould just about complete the week.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I reiterate? We were able to work \nout, obviously, a very agreeable approach to the question on health \ncare which stymied us in a similar way for a period of time. I want to \nreiterate to the majority leader, we are not trying to kill this bill, \nat least for this reason. And we are not attempting to delay.\n  Would it be possible to have an agreement that we will vote on this \nissue on a date certain between now and, say, the beginning of June? In \na discussion with the majority leader, the minority leader and majority \nleader could arrive at a date certain for a vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, I am always willing to try to resolve some of the \nproblems. This is not going to be an easy one because, as I recall, the \nfirst 2 years of the Clinton administration, when the Democrats \ncontrolled Congress, we did not have any votes on minimum wage. The \nDemocrats did not bring it up. They controlled everything. They \ncontrolled the White House and the House and the Senate.\n  Now, suddenly, after the AFL has their meeting and pledges millions \nand\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nmillions of dollars, we want to bring it up on the floor. I can imagine \nwhat would happen in the liberal media if the corporations came to town \nand said we are going to put $35 million in the Republican campaigns. \nThere would be headlines in all the papers. All the talk shows would \nstop in midair to get it on the air.\n  I think there is also a very logical argument. There are going to be \na lot of young people who lose their jobs. Many are black teenagers and \nmany are young people whose parents live below the poverty line. So I \nthink, if we are going to have this debate, it ought to be a lengthy \ndebate. It ought to be on the merits. In my view, it cannot happen--I \ndo not see how it can happen this week.\n  Obviously, the Senator is entitled, as he did, to offer an amendment \nto the underlying bill. That was our mistake. We should have taken care \nof that. It will not happen again.\n  But notwithstanding that, we can prevent a vote and we will prevent a \nvote because we do not believe it belongs on this legislation. There \nare 23 States that have an interest in the pending legislation. I do \nnot believe even the Democrats, who have very important projects in \nthis legislation, are very excited about having the two Senators from \nMassachusetts offer this minimum wage adjustment to their legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say, in all respect, in response to \nthe majority leader, we had a vote in the U.S. Senate last year and 51 \nU.S. Senators voted that we should take up the minimum wage before the \nend of the last session. We did not do that.\n  Now we are back. I did not even know about the AFL. I am glad you \ntold me. Maybe I can arrange to get to the meeting. But I did not even \nknow they were in town. We announced our intention to offer an \namendment some time ago--Senator Kennedy, who has been leading on this \neffort, together with Senator Wellstone, a group of us--this has been \nsomething we have been trying to do for a number of years. The fact is, \nit is getting more necessary, not less, as a consequence of the fact \nthat the wage each day is worth less.\n  So, I say to the majority leader, we can always find a group that is \nin town at some period of time when some legislation is on the floor, \nand we all know Republicans collect far, far more money from interest \ngroups than Democrats ever do. If we want to start pointing fingers at \nwhose money comes from where, that is a different debate.\n  The fact is, working people do not get the kind of money any of us \nget from anywhere, even from their work. That is what this debate is \nall about. Folks who are working and cannot even pay for medical \ninsurance, let alone rent, let alone food.\n  So I regret the majority leader will not say we can have a vote on \nthis, will not even say we could have one by June. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I move to table my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is the question on the motion to table the Kerry amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. The yeas and nays have been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let's have the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Kerry amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3654 to amendment No. 3653.\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\n       Strike all after the first word in the amendment to the \n     instructions to the pending motion and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``report back by April 21, 1996 amendments to reform welfare \n     and Medicaid effective two days after the effective date of \n     the bill.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are prepared to vote on this motion at \nthis time. Medicaid reform and welfare reform are high on everyone's \npriority list in America, particularly the voters and the taxpayers, \nand we would be prepared to vote on this motion, say, at 6 o'clock or 5 \nafter 6 or 6:15, or whenever.\n  But I do believe now we are back on an issue that the American people \nare really concerned about: how we can save maybe $50 billion on \nwelfare over the next 7 years by sending it back to the States, and \nmaybe as much as $85 billion over the next 7 years on Medicaid by \nsending it back to the States, all in accordance with the 10th \namendment to the Constitution, which says unless the powers vested in \nthe Federal Government are denied to the States it belongs to the \nStates and the people.\n  That is what we will debate at this time, unless there is a \nwillingness to accept the amendments, or we can debate tomorrow after \nthe cloture vote, whichever the Democratic leader prefers.\n  But I am prepared and now ask that we stand in recess until 9:30 \ntomorrow morning.\n\n\n                            Motion To Recess\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I now move the Senate stand in recess until \nthe hour of 9:30 a.m., Wednesday, March 27, 1996.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.
