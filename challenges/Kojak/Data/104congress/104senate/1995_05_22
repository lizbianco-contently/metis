How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to \ntalk some about the budget considerations that we will have this week. \nWe have had a good deal of discussion about it prior to now, both in \nthe discussion of a balanced budget amendment and more specifically on \nthe budget resolution that is before this Congress. We have talked, of \ncourse, in great detail and should and will continue to do that.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also useful perhaps to take a moment \nduring the course of this discussion and go back to the real basic \nissue, and that is the question of whether or not it is morally and \nfiscally responsible for this Congress and this country to operate \nunder a balanced budget, whether or not we can continue to go forward \nwith endless budgets that are $200, $250 billion in arrears.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just like to talk a minute about the basic \nissue. Americans, it seems to me, quite clearly voted in 1994 for \nchange. They voted for many changes. I think they voted with the notion \nthat this Federal Government is too large and costs too much. I do not \nthink there is any question about that. I think they also voted in \nterms of change for a balanced budget. We have not had a balanced \nbudget for a whole generation, 25 years at least.\n  So I think people say, why should the Government not be fiscally \nresponsible as we are expected to be in our families or in our \nbusinesses? Americans voted for change in 1994 and they want us to be \nfiscally responsible. Some say, ``Well, the deficit does not matter, it \nis just a small percentage of the total.'' It does matter. It does \nmatter to each of us. It matters to us currently. It matters to us in \nterms of the cost of interest which will soon be the largest single \nline item in the budget, interest on a budget that will soon be \nexpanded to $5 trillion, and each of us each day must pay the interest \non that debt.\n  It matters because it takes dollars out of the economy to finance \nthis debt, dollars that could otherwise be spent for investments in \nbusiness and [[Page S7028]] in jobs to strengthen the economy. So it \ndoes matter.\n  It matters to us in that what we do now has great impact on our \nchildren and on our grandchildren and who is going to pay the bill. Our \ncredit card is maxed out and we are passing it on to somebody else to \npay for the things that we want now. Those are the large questions that \nare there. We can have a smaller, less expensive Government, and to me \nthat is the most exciting part.\n  Of course, the dollars are the issue, the budget is the issue, but \nthe exciting part is we have an opportunity for the first time in many \nyears to really take a look at how Government functions, what functions \nthe Government is involved in, how we might better provide those \nservices in a more economic, more efficient way, and I do not think \nanyone would argue with the fact that most of the services could be \ndelivered more efficiently.\n  We have an opportunity for the first time in a long time to move \nGovernment closer to people, to move it closer to the States where you \nand I as citizens have more input into the decisions made, where the \nprograms that are designed to be used over the country are applied \ndifferently in Cheyenne, WY, or in Greybull, WY, than in Pittsburgh and \nthey should be and we need to have the flexibility to do that.\n  For the first time, we have a chance to do that. For the first time, \nfrankly, in my memory--I came from the House where one party had been \nin charge for 40 years and there were not many opportunities to \nevaluate programs and to change programs. If a program was not working, \nthe solution was to put more money in there, put more money in the \nprogram, that will fix it. Of course, it does not fix it. You have to \ngo in and see if there are some other kind of changes. For the first \ntime in a very long time we have an opportunity to do that. That is all \npart of this budget issue.\n  So it is time to keep our promises. I am talking about a basic \nconcept, and it is tough. It is tough. No one suggests balancing the \nbudget is an easy matter, no one suggests it is not going to cause \npain. No one suggests that all of us are going to have to make some \nsacrifice or, indeed, some change, and change is not easy. But that is \nwhat it is all about.\n  I hope we do not forget the bottom line, and that is the real goal is \nto become financially and fiscally responsible, and that is what we are \nseeking to do. The goal is to change Government so that, indeed, we can \ncontinue to carry out those functions that are proper for the Federal \nGovernment, but carry them out in a manner that is efficient and \neffective and, indeed, goes to providing services.\n  The problem, of course, is runaway spending. Spending is much easier \nthan reducing spending. It is great fun to spend. In our State in the \nlate seventies and early eighties, we had a great economic boon with \nthe oil industry and the mineral industry.\n  Being in the Wyoming Legislature was great fun. When we had a \nproblem, we just gave them more money, tons of money. That has changed, \nof course. I went in the legislature in the mid-eighties. It was not \nnearly as much fun. I was on the Appropriations Committee and instead \nof saying, ``Oh, yes, we can fix your problem, here is more dough, we \ncan do that,'' we had to say, ``I am sorry, we have to set some \npriorities and we do not have bucks for everything that everybody would \nlike to have.'' But we did well and continue to do well and continue to \nhave to set those priorities and decide what we think are the most \nimportant things that Government should do.\n I think that is even more important at the Federal level. It is \nawfully easy to move away from those things that most people would \nagree are fundamental to the Federal Government and move into things \nthat more properly belong somewhere else.\n\n  So the question will be, as we hear it in just a few years, where \nwill we be as we go into the next century, the new millennium? Will we \nhave increasing debt out as far as we can go? Or will we be able to say \nto ourselves in 5 or 7 years that, yes, it was tough, but we were able \nto change the course of the Federal Government and the spending \npatterns to where we are moving or have attained a balanced budget? \nWill we be able to say we are doing what most people seem to think is \nreasonable, that is, not to spend more than we take in. You do that on \nyour allowance, with your earnings, and in your family. Of course, \nthere are times you borrow and you repay. Of course, there are times \nfor special things. But, overall, you have to keep your spending where \nyour income is.\n  If we do not do something, the projected deficits will be in the \nneighborhood of $275 billion--more than they are now--out as far as we \ncan see. Is that what we want to happen?\n  By the year 2000, if we do not do something, we will have a $7 \ntrillion debt. So we need to do it. We need to stand up now and we need \nto say come to the snubbing post and make some decisions. There are \nalways reasons not to act. You have heard over the last few days, and \nlisten to the next 3 days, the litany will be that we are all for a \nbalanced budget. Yes, I want to balance the budget. But we will go \nthrough 10 or 12 reasons why you cannot do it this way or that way. The \npolitical reason, of course, is to be able to stand up and say that I \nam for that thing everybody is for--in this case, balancing the \nbudget--but then have a number of reasons to justify voting no. And \nthat is what you will hear all week.\n  Now is the time to stand up and say, yes, the basic issue is that we \nhave to become fiscally responsible. How do we do it? Sure, there is a \nlegitimate argument as to how you do it, a legitimate set of priorities \nfor argumentation, and I understand that. But the fact is that you have \nto do it. It is one of those things that is morally and fiscally \nresponsible to do. We are not asking for draconian changes. We are \nasking that instead of increasing spending at 5.5 percent over time, to \nincrease spending at 3.2 percent over time. Only in Washington would \nthat be considered a cut.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton administration and the other side of the \naisle do not address the problem. They simply say, yes, we want to \nbalance the budget. We do not like what you are doing, but they do not \nhave a solution. So we need to move forward and commit ourselves to the \nnotion that we can balance the budget--and we can. We can do that over \na period of time, and we can do that in 7 years, as proposed--a 7-year \nglidepath to balancing the budget and fixing things like Medicare.\n  There is not really a question as to whether we have to do something \nwith Medicare. The point is, you do something or it goes broke. In 2 \nyears, it begins to pull out of reserves, and in 7 years it is broke. \nThe basic question there is, do we want to continue a program like \nMedicare to have health care for the elderly? Of course, we do. But in \norder to do that, you have to make some changes. Medicare has grown at \na rate of 10 percent a year. We are suggesting that, as in the case of \nthe other medical programs of delivery, we can make it more efficient. \nThis weekend, I met in Cheyenne with the TriCare group. It is health \ncare for active duty military or retired military and their dependents. \nThey are changing TriCare, their program, which includes managed care; \nthey are changing the way they have delivered the system. We have done \nthat in the private sector. For the first time, health care costs have \nstabilized and in some cases have gone down--everywhere except Medicare \nand Medicaid. We can do that not by taking away benefits but by \nchanging the delivery system and continuing to grow at 7.1 percent \ninstead of 10 percent. Some will say there is growth in numbers. Keep \nin mind that this projected spending goes from now $4,600 per capita in \nMedicare, approximately, to $6,400 per capita. That takes into account \nthe growth. So we are talking about fixing something that each of you \nwants to continue to go forward with.\n  So, Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate the chairman of the \nBudget Committee for his very tough work and leadership in bringing \nforth a proposal. Is it perfect? Of course not. Does it get us there? \nYes. Does it solve the basic issue of balancing the budget? Yes. We \nhave to keep our eye on the ball and say what is most important to us \nover time, to be fiscally responsible or to argue about the details? We \ncan argue about details but we should not. I hope we are committed to \nchanging the course of this Government, that we are going to make the \nchanges that the voters asked for and bring forward to \n[[Page S7029]] the Appropriations Committee a balanced budget amendment \nwhich will put us on a glidepath in 7 years to financial and fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, the time to be \ncharged to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As manager of the bill and controller of the time, I \nyield to the Senator from Arizona, who is now on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me speak for a few minutes as well. Mr. \nPresident, I noted with interest your comments of just a little while \nago using some Wyoming phraseology to explain why we need to get on \nwith this job. I think that is the thinking of most people in this \ncountry that kind of wonder why back here in Washington, DC, the people \nwho have the responsibility for managing our financial affairs of the \nU.S. Government cannot quite see it the way they do, the way they have \nto manage their lives every day.\n  During the Easter recess, I traveled all around my State of Arizona, \nand I talked to people just like the folks you were referring to. They \nget up early in the morning, get their kids off to school, work hard \nall day long, come home tired, and they wonder why the Federal \nGovernment is asking them to give more and more of what they have \nearned to the Federal Government so that people back here in Washington \ncan make decisions about how that money should be spent. They wonder \nwhy the Federal Government cannot balance its budget like they have to \nbalance their own families' budgets every day.\n  They understand that the Government is different than an individual \nor a family. They understand that there are tough decisions, that from \ntime to time we are asked to spend money on things that have large \npolitical constituencies. They understand those things.\n  However, they have also come to the conclusion that by and large \nGovernment is not a really great buy. That all of these years they have \nbeen asking Government to do things for them they have, in effect, \nhired the Government to solve problems, it has not been a very good \nbuy.\n  We have spent $5 trillion on welfare, and we have more people who are \nbelow the poverty line today than we did when the Great Society began, \nand a host of problems that clearly the welfare system has not solved.\n  They see a Federal debt that is now approaching numbers that no one \ncan even comprehend--approaching $5 trillion, a number that none of us \ncan really comprehend. They see annual deficits, and they wonder why \nafter the politicians a couple of years ago promised them that we would \nachieve a balanced budget, at least the budgets would be submitted that \nwould get America on a path to achieving a balanced budget, they see \nthe President's budget this year that does not even try. It just gives \nup. It says, I understand that the American people want a balanced \nbudget, but President Clinton says I am going to be spending, or \nrecommend that the Congress be spending, about $200 billion each year \nmore than we take in. So at the end of his 5-year budget we have added \n$1 trillion to the national debt.\n  They ask why this cannot stop, why the Congress cannot get its act \ntogether. In the very last election on November 8, I think they sent a \nvery strong message which has been responded to in both the House and \nthe Senate, at least by the Republicans. In the House, just about 5 \ndays ago, a budget was passed which achieves balance in 7 years, the \nsame amount of time that was called for under the constitutional \namendment that failed by only one vote.\n  It says that by the year 2002 we will have a balanced budget, and at \nthat time we begin actually paying off our national debt. It is too \nmuch of a task to be resolved in 1 year. It would be like asking people \nto pay off their home mortgage in 1 or 2 years. It is too big for that. \nBut over 7 years, we can restrain the growth in spending to such a \ndegree that even though most programs will continue to grow, it will \ngrow at a slower rate, enabling the Government to save enough money, \nabout $1 trillion over that 7 years, that by the end of the 7 years we \nwill be in balance.\n  What does this mean to the average American? They know instinctively \nit has to be done. They know what happens when they do not balance \ntheir budget. They realize that their standard of living, and more \nimportantly, their children's and grandchildren's standard of living is \nbeing threatened as a result of this huge deficit.\n  One of the problems, of course, caused by the deficit, is that it \nraises interest rates. By crowding out the market for money, interest \nrates go up. We have estimates that if we could get the budget balanced \nit would reduce interest rates by about 2 percent. Think what a \nreduction of 2-percent interest rates would mean on the average home \nmortgage or the car purchase, or anything else that we buy on time.\n  Of course, having a big deficit requires citizens to pay more in \ntaxes. For one thing, we have to pay $200 to $300 billion interest on \nthe Federal debt every year. Until we begin to pay that debt off, we \nwill continue to have the interest expense every year. Not only is that \nmore taxes we have to pay, but it is money that we cannot spend on \nother things that people would like Government to spend on.\n  There have been a lot of speeches particularly on the other side of \nthe aisle during the last week that say, look what will happen if we \npass this budget. Look what will happen if we balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, look what will happen if we do not balance the budget. \nThat is the question. It reminds me of the true story one of my \ncolleagues was telling me about. An oil rig was burning in the North \nSea. It was 1,200 feet from the rig down to the North Atlantic. It was \npitch black, except for the fact there was oil burning on the surface \nof the water. One of the people who was working on the rig jumped off \nof that platform, over 1,200 feet into the water. He survived.\n  A television person interviewing him in the hospital asked him the \nquestion, Why, knowing that it was 1,200 feet down, you could not see \nanything, it was pitch black except for the oil that was burning on the \nwater, why did you jump in the water? And his answer was, of course, \nbecause there was so much fire at my back, I knew that if I did not, I \nwould be burned alive.\n  In other words, the question was not might something bad happen to me \nif I jump off; the question is, most certainly something bad will \nhappen to me if I do not.\n  The question is not, will something bad happen if we pass the \nbalanced budget; the question is, what will happen to this country if \nwe do not?\n  I think almost everyone recognizes that while there may be some \nconcerns about the restraining of the growth in spending if we do pass \nthis balanced budget, that the alternative is far worse, an alternative \nthat relegates our future generation to a lower standard of living than \nwe have been able to enjoy in this country. That is why we have to pass \nthe balanced budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, one of the concerns that I have had is that we \nhave not gotten a lot of leadership on the other side. There is no \nalternative budget. We put the President's budget on the floor last \nFriday, and said what about this? Do any Members think this is a good \nidea? Nobody did. It failed, 99 to 0. One of the reasons, of course, \nwas that it did not even attempt to restrain spending and achieve a \nbalance. Instead, it has deficits at the rate of about $200 billion \neach year, for the next 5 years.\n  Right now, the national debt is approaching $5 trillion. It is $4.8 \ntrillion to be exact. That is about $18,500 for every man, woman, and \nchild in the country. I just had a new grandchildren born about 12 days \nago. His share of the national debt, right now, is $18,500. That is \nunfair to him.\n  In the last election, people were saying it is important we do \nsomething about the debt, because they saw for the first time in \nhistory that future [[Page S7030]] generations did not have the same \nopportunity that we did, that the American spirit of optimism that each \nsucceeding generation would do better than the last was not necessarily \ngoing to come true.\n  When they gave that message, they also gave a mandate to do something \nabout it, to eliminate that $18,500 of debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in the country. That is an average of about $74,000 of debt for \nthe average family of four.\n  Even if Congress balanced the budget this very moment, the average \nAmerican family would still be stuck with that bill of $74,000. Of \ncourse, that rivals the mortgage on most homes in this country. In \norder just to pay the interest on that, the average family will have to \npay about $5,000 a year annually.\n  Mr. President, stop and think about that for a moment. What we are \nsaying is, just to pay the interest on the debt, every family has to \npay about $5,000 in taxes. This is one of the reasons we have to get \nthe debt down, and why balancing the budget will help the average \nAmerican people, because every year that that debt remains at the level \nit is that $5,000 in taxes goes to pay the interest on the debt. It \ncannot be used for other expenditures and we cannot reduce the tax \nburden. At least it said we cannot reduce the tax burden, because, \nobviously, the interest on the debt has to be paid.\n  Now, this $5,000 in taxes annually is about $430 a month, just in \ninterest payments. That assumes no other payment. So, that is what the \naverage American family is spending every single month with the debt we \nhave today.\n  As I said, put this into perspective for every year in which the \nFederal Government runs these $200 billion deficits. The average young \nperson will pay an additional $5,000 in taxes over his or her lifetime. \nRight now, a child born this year will pay about $187,000 in taxes \nbecause of this debt. That is what my brand-new grandson is relegated \nto if we cannot get this debt under control.\n  This $5,000 in taxes, increased taxes for every year that we run \nthese deficits, is not only a fiscal matter, Mr. President, but it is a \nmoral matter. I think we can get bound up in all the numbers but we \nhave to realize what we are doing to future generations. It is immoral \nto be spending money in our generation and not be willing to pay for \nit. It is as if we were running up credit card debt, and as we exit the \nscene we hand that debt to our children and say, ``Will you please pay \nthe bill for the excesses during our lifetime.''\n  The $1 trillion in new debt that is proposed by President Clinton's \nbudget over 5 years represents an additional $25,000 in taxes for every \nfamily, or I should say for every individual. That is $25,000 for every \nyoung man, woman, and child in this country. There is not a whole lot, \nMr. President, that we can do worse for the future generations than to \ncontinue to run up this debt, because it guarantees a lower standard of \nliving for future generations.\n  So, as we discuss the plans for achieving balance over the course of \nthe next 5, 6, 7 years we have to examine the arguments pro and con \nthat are being made here. A lot of arguments against this balanced \nbudget from the other side expressed concerns about what will happen if \nwe do not do it. They attack particular parts of the budget. They \nrepresent no alternatives.\n  The amendment that is pending on the floor right now, as a matter of \nfact, accepts the fact that we are going to achieve balance, and it \nsays with the $170 billion that we are going to save as a result of \nthat because of reduced interest rates, the so-called dividends that \nwill result by doing the job we are supposed to do, the amendment on \nthe other side says we will spend that money.\n We have a way of spending that money. So not only do many of the \nSenators on the other side of the aisle here object to balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002 and raise arguments against balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002, but they are very willing to take the savings \nthat result from what we are willing to do by biting the bullet here, \nand spend that money before it has even been saved.\n\n  That is not being very constructive about solving these problems when \nwe know we have a big deficit, we know we have to solve it, the \nPresident's budget was defeated by 99 to 0, there is no alternative \nbudget on the other side, all that the Senators on the other side, most \nof them, have done is to carp about the fact that some segment of our \nsociety is not going to get quite as much money as they have been \ngetting over the years if we balance the budget by the year 2002. \nNotwithstanding the fact that spending is going to go up in most \ncategories, it will simply go up at a lesser rate than it would \notherwise, the arguments are that somebody is going to suffer because \nthey will not get quite as much money as they otherwise would have \ngotten; just negative criticism of what we are trying to achieve.\n  And, at the same time that negative criticism is coming out with no \nconstructive alternative, the amendment on the floor now says, ``By the \nway, with the money you are going to save by what you are willing to \ndo, we would like to spend $100 billion of that.''\n  That is not very constructive to this debate. So, as I said, during \nthe next 3 days as we debate this and we consider the arguments back \nand forth, I think the primary thing we have to consider is the future \nof our grandchildren and our children. That is why it is important for \nus to accomplish this. It is important because of the savings, it is \nimportant because of what we can do with that money today, but more \nimportant, what it means to their future, what it means to the future \nprosperity of this country and the opportunity to create a better \nliving in this country for those future generations.\n  If we do not accomplish our goal of achieving balance in our budget \nwithin the next 7 years, we will not deserve the title of Senator. We \nwill not deserve to be serving in this body because we will have failed \nin our obligation to those future generations. And that ultimately is \nwhy most of us sought election in the first place and are so privileged \nto serve in this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar).

Mr. President, my understanding is that by prior \nunanimous agreement, at 9:15, Democrats were to speak; is that correct? \nIf not--is there no such understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states there is no agreement to that \neffect.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator from Florida wants to speak now and that \nis absolutely fine with me. I just ask unanimous consent, after the \nSenator from Florida speaks, that the Senator from Minnesota have up to \nhalf an hour to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, at this time, let me yield to the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, during the next several days, as during the \npast few days, we are going to hear a lot of discussion about the \nnumbers within the budget and a lot of statistics in the debate about \neconomics. But the underlying reality of what we are debating is not \nreally economics, and it really does not directly relate to numbers. \nWhat we really are talking about is the future of this great Nation. We \nare talking about the futures of our children and our grandchildren. We \nare talking about the futures of our moms and dads and our \ngrandparents. And we are talking about the futures of working men and \nwomen in this country.\n  This comes to my mind, frankly, because over this weekend I had the \nopportunity to speak both to my mom and dad and to my grandchildren. My \ndad is 82 years old. My mother is 80. And I had the opportunity, \nbelieve it or not, to speak to the youngest of my grandchildren, who is \n2 years old.\n  I thought about this earlier this morning. Some things never change. \nBecause my little grandson said to me as we were chatting on the phone, \n``I am going to go watch baseball.'' You can imagine that out of a \nlittle 2-year-old, he said--``I am going to go watch baseball.''\n  Talking with my mom and dad and to my daughter and my grandchildren \nover the weekend made me realize that what we are focusing on is the \nfuture of our Nation and the people of this great country of ours. My \ndad still volunteers over at one of the hospitals in my \n[[Page S7031]] community--if you can imagine that--at the age of 82. He \nhelps lift people out of their hospital beds, and puts them on a \nstretcher to take them down to the X ray or to the operating room. \nPeople from all over my hometown come up to me and tell me that my dad \nhelped them when they were over at the hospital. The interesting thing \nis my dad just got out of the hospital a few weeks ago. My mother just \nreturned from some 3, 3\\1/2\\ weeks in a nursing home.\n  In a sense, they represent the elderly of our Nation and their \nreliance on health care. Virtually every family in America experiences \nthe same kind of thing I am talking about--the need of our elderly to \nlook to health care. And the question we must consider is what their \nfuture going to be like if we do not address the question of Medicare.\n  The trustees of the Medicare trust fund have said now for 2 years in \na row that Medicare is going to be bankrupt in the year 2001 or the \nyear 2002, depending on what set of economic assumptions one uses. How \nwill other folks' moms and dads and grandparents be able to rely on \nMedicare if we do not act? Frankly, this is not a Republican problem. \nThis is a problem for the entire Nation. This is one where the \nPresident of the United States should be taking the lead. There should \nbe a bipartisan plan.\n  Frankly, when you look at the trustees' report and you see the \nhesitancy on the part of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nand the President, to lead, we do not have any choice than to take the \nlead ourselves. We must act because 6 or 7 years from now there will \nnot be a Medicare fund capable of paying the beneficiaries. We cannot \nallow that to happen. So I am proud to be part of this effort to solve \nthe overall budget crisis and to address the question of Medicare, \nbecause we have to preserve Medicare for others in the future.\n  As I said, this is an American problem. It is one to which there \nought to be a bipartisan response. Let me share some of the numbers \nwhich suggest the extent of the problem. Some of the reports indicate \nthat the average retired couple today will receive back in benefits \nfrom the Medicare health system $126,700 more than they pay in. Common \nsense suggests this cannot continue. Common sense suggests that as long \nas you do have a system like that, it makes sense that it could go \nbankrupt. And that is exactly what the trustees have said.\n  Our response has been to recognize that we need to slow down the rate \nof growth in the Medicare system. It is growing now at over 10 percent \nper year. We are suggesting its growth should be slowed to 7.2 percent. \nWhat does this mean to the average beneficiary? Today, that average \nbeneficiary is receiving about $4,800 per year from Medicaid. Under the \nproposal, it would go up to somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,800 to \n$7,000 per year. Certainly, we ought to be able to put together a \nMedicare system that can operate with those kinds of numbers.\n And that growth, by the way, is still 1\\1/2\\ times faster than the \nprivate sector. Certainly we can find a way to accomplish this task. \nAnd in the end what will we have done? We will have improved, \nprotected, and preserved the Medicare System.\n\n  I think frankly the people in the country want this to happen. I \nwould much rather this be a bipartisan effort. But, frankly, we cannot \nwait for the other side, if they are not going to be involved in \nsolving the problem with respect to Medicare.\n  I mentioned earlier about trying to put this discussion within the \nframework of real people, and I know we have heard a lot from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about the tragedy that will \noccur if some proposal like this budget resolution is put together. As \na matter of fact, I heard over the weekend that Laura Tyson, Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisers to the President, said, if this \nbalanced budget plan were to go into effect, that it would create a \nlarger divide between those who have and those who do not have. She \nstates that cutting down on education we will deprive the next \ngeneration of education benefits which will widen the gap.\n  Mr. President, I think most people in this country clearly understand \nthat education is the responsibility of the local communities. In fact, \nmost could make the claim that the larger the Government role in \neducation, the worst off the education system in this country has \ngotten. And, our children are not receiving the kind of education that \nis necessary to enhance their ability to be able to compete in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I think that this comment by the Chairman is incredibly misleading, \nand I think it is important that we focus on what the benefits really \nare.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the kinds of people for whom this \nbudget was drafted. I am thinking about the couple that gets up at 4:30 \nin the morning to begin their commute to work, whether that be by train \nor by car. Both work all day long, and by the time they get back home \nat night in the dark they are exhausted. And they do that 5 days a \nweek, some 6. What about them? How much more are we going to ask them \nto provide to Washington to fund a set of programs that frankly they \nfeel, and I feel, have failed us?\n  If one could make the argument that all of these programs have worked \nand have improved the lives of so many people, that would be a \ndifferent story. But what do we see? We see the number of people who \nare relying on these programs is growing year after year, which is an \nindication, frankly, that we have failed to provide them opportunities. \nWhat we have done is to develop a trapdoor of dependency, and that \nneeds to change. We ought to start thinking about those families whose \nmoms and dads are working all day long struggling to take care of \nthemselves and their children, to provide for their future. It is these \nfamilies, frankly, who are getting tired of seeing more and more of \ntheir income taxed away by a Federal Government that continues programs \nthat have proven to be a failure.\n  I also think about the young family, married couple with a young \nchild, the husband has two jobs, works all week long at those two jobs, \ncomes home for the weekend, and takes care of the child while the wife \nand mother goes to her job over the weekend. What about their future? \nWhat about developing a society and economy that provides them a \nfuture, one filled with opportunity and hope? Nobody seems to talk \nabout those. All we hear about is the harm that may be caused by \nproposals that are put forward.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about those hard-working men and women \nwho have been taxed year after year after year. Those are the kind of \npeople on whom I think we ought to keep focused; or the family whose \nhusband has to be away from home 3 or 4 or maybe 5 days a week \ntraveling around his sales territory while his wife is at home. Many \nsuch wives having to manage a job and having to raise the children as \nwell.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I say there is a debate which is much more \nabout people and their futures as opposed to just hard statistics and \ncold numbers.\n  But we do have to talk about numbers. I would like to relate a story \nabout the first budget hearing that I attended as a Member of the \nCongress. It occurred back in February 1982 during the Reagan \nadministration. Stockman, Regan, and Feldstein, Director of OMB, \nSecretary of the Treasury, and Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers all came to the Congress in February 1983 and told the \nCongress that if we did not change the spending patterns of this Nation \nthat we would see deficits out into future as far as one can see--$200 \nbillion plus.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, this Congress, controlled by the other party, \nthat entire time did nothing to address their spending habits. Their \nresponse to a continuing deficit over and over and over again was to \nsay to those families that I have just spoken about that you just are \ngoing to have to give up a little bit more of those hard-earned dollars \nfor which you have been working. Well, frankly, in November of this \npast year the people of this country said enough is enough. And they \nsupported the ideas of less taxing, less spending, less Government, and \nmore freedom. That is what this debate is about as well.\n  Again, for the last 12 years, after being told we were going to see \ndeficits of $200 billion plus out into the future, nothing was done by \nthe Congress of the United States. [[Page S7032]] \n  So what did we get from the President of United States for his budget \nproposal? We got a budget that was referred to by a member of the \nadministration at the time as a source of shame. Frankly, he was right. \nIt is a source of shame. And I suspect that is why our colleagues on \nother side of the aisle--every single one of them--ran from it, would \nnot vote, not one as far as I can recall, not one voted for the \nPresident's budget proposal.\n  That is an abdication of leadership. I would say that our colleagues \nfind themselves, frankly, in somewhat of an embarrassing position. I \nmean, after all, they told us during the debate for the balanced budget \namendment that were for a balanced budget. Many said that they really \nbelieved that we ought to get to a balanced budget just not with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I think that the President's actual words were something like ``We \ndon't need the balanced budget amendment, all we need is will.'' We are \nstill waiting to see that will.\n  We know that they are opposed to our plan. We now know that they are \nopposed to the plan put forward by the President. But we see no plan at \nall from the other side; no plan at all when we are talking about the \nfuture of this Nation and the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren. I can understand why they did not support the \nPresident's plan because, frankly, in today's environment, today's \ndebate, it was not serious. It simply was not serious. In fact, it did \nnot even stand up to the objectives that were established by the \nadministration itself.\n  The one economic argument that Laura Tyson placed on why that was a \ngood proposal was that, over a period of 5 years, it was showing a \nreduction in the deficit as a percentage of GDP. And after all, that \nwas a worthwhile economic goal, and, frankly, a number of economists \naround the country support the concept that a reduction of the deficit \nas a percentage of GDP is a good goal. But guess what happened?\n  As a little interesting side comment here, I remember in the State of \nthe Union Message a couple of years ago the President of United States \nsaying to us we are not going to use OMB to establish our budget \nnumbers, the economic data. We are going to use the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office. We do not want anyone to say we are \nrecalculating our way out of this deficit.\n  So we started out in 1993 and 1994 using the Congressional Budget \nOffice. But now that we have entered into this debate about this \nbudget, the President has moved back to the Office of Management and \nBudget, to use the numbers from the OMB. And when the CBO recalculated \nthe President's budget, guess what happens? It is not a national $200 \nbillion deficit for the next 5 years. It grows from $177, or $176 \nbillion, to something like $276 billion.\n  In other words, it is a growing deficit, not a deficit that is \nstaying still or declining. It is a growing deficit. And by their one \nmeasure, that is, as a percentage of GDP, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says it goes from 2.5 percent of GDP up to 3.1 percent. So by \ntheir own measure, their own budget does not meet that target.\n  And so I think it is very unfortunate that we find ourselves in a \nsituation where a budget has been proposed by Republicans without the \nhelp or support of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle. \nFrankly, I think that this budget is based on courage, commitment, and \nconviction and I am proud to be a part of that effort, to get us to a \nzero deficit in the year 2002. And again I think it is unfortunate that \nan alternative approach has not even been offered by our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  We ought to ask ourselves the question, what happens if we do not \nact? I remember I made some comments during the balanced budget \namendment debate a few months ago about the potential consequences for \nnot acting. I have often thought it was quite interesting, as I \nlistened to my constituents in the State of Florida and my colleagues \nhere in the Congress, that there is an attitude which honestly believes \nthe United States is so powerful and we are so right we would never \nhave to pay the consequences associated with bad economic policy.\n  If you recall, the debate on the balanced budget amendment was taking \nplace about the time that Mexico was going through some very difficult \ntimes. There was this feeling that somehow or another the United States \nwould never have to pay for the consequences of bad economic policy, \nand I think that is fundamentally wrong. I would encourage people to \ntake a look at what happened to the value of the U.S. dollar when this \nbody defeated the balanced budget amendment.\n  I would also say take a look at what has happened to the U.S. dollar \nsince this administration has come into power: a whole series of \nmisdirected economic policies--higher tax rates, more regulation, more \nFederal spending, no constraint. People around the world have lost \nfaith in U.S. currency.\n  Now, some people say, why should I worry about the value of the \ndollar? If I go to a local store, does that dollar not buy me the same \nthing? The drop in the value of the dollar, if it affects me in my \npurchasing power, does it not affect the value of the product as well? \nI do not see anything that has happened to me as a result of it.\n  Think of the currency of our country as being the common stock of our \ncountry, and what has happened in the last 2 years is we have lost one-\nthird of the value of our common stock of this country because of \nfailed economic policy.\n  There is an opportunity here to change that devaluation of our \ncurrency. Just to give you again an idea of what the consequences are \nfor not acting, when interest rates, for example, go up by half a \npercent with the FHA fixed-rate mortgages, applications drop 27 \npercent. A half a point change, a 27-percent decline in the \napplications for FHA mortgages. In the conventional mortgage, we saw \nthat where interest rates moved up 1.5 percent, somewhere around \n200,000 to 300,000 people no longer could afford to buy a home.\n  Job creation: The rate of growth in job creation in this recent \nrecovery is roughly half of what it has been in previous recoveries, \nand statistical data indicates to us that probably for the fourth year \nin a row we are going to see a decline in real median income earnings \nof America's families. And that will just continue to get worse, not \nbetter, if we do nothing. It appears this is what is being proposed by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or would result if we \nwere to follow the plan that has been put forward by the President.\n  Now, we have some conflicting feelings with respect to what will \nhappen economically. Again Laura Tyson tells us that it would be a \ntragedy to balance the budget. But Chairman Greenspan has said--and he \nhas said this many times in the past--he never really has to worry \nabout the Congress coming up with too much in the area of spending \ncuts. Chairman Greenspan has, in fact, embraced what we are doing. If I \nhave to make my choice about which one of those economists to focus on \nand pay attention to, I think it is pretty obvious it would be Chairman \nGreenspan over Laura Tyson.\n  So again, the consequences are dramatic. We have an opportunity here \nto do something to change the direction of this Nation. We have an \nopportunity to provide for more jobs, more business formation, and \ngreater opportunity for our children and our grandchildren if we pass \nthis budget proposal. I would ask my colleagues to cast a vote in favor \nof this budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I was going to ask my colleague from Florida to yield \nwhile he was speaking, but I did not want to break into the flow of \nwhat he had to say, so some of what I say in my remarks will be a \nresponse to my colleague from Florida. I do not know whether he will be \nable to stay or not, but I wish to let him know.\n  Mr. President, sometimes we do not know what we do not want to know. \nAnd as I was listening to my good friend from Florida speak, it \noccurred to me that that was an example of not knowing what he did not \nwant to know.\n  There actually is a proposal out on the floor right now, and I will \ntalk more in this overall debate about deficit reduction as I go \nforward with my remarks today, and that particular proposal is a \nDemocratic amendment to restore some of the funding to Medicare and \nMedicaid using money that is [[Page S7033]] currently slated to pay for \ntax cuts for, in the main, wealthy and high-income people. That is the \nproposal. We are not quite clear how much on the Senate side yet, but \non the House side it is about $350 billion.\n  (Mr. MACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So there is a proposal in the Chamber right now. And I \nwould say to the Presiding Officer, as I was saying earlier before he \nwas presiding, I did not want to break up the free flow of his remarks, \nand I was hoping he would respond while he was in the Chamber. But he \nis in the chair, and I will be kinder because he will not be in a \nposition to debate me. I do not want to go after my good friend since \nhe has no chance to respond.\n  There is a proposal and there will be a number of alternatives \nproposals over the next few days to this budget resolution. The \nDemocratic amendment is to restore funding to the Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms using the money currently slated to pay for tax cuts for, in \nthe main, wealthy, high-income citizens. It is that simple.\n  Mr. President, as I was listening to my colleague, the Presiding \nOfficer, I thought to myself how ironic that those who fiercely blocked \nhealth care reform and took cost containment off the table in the 103d \nCongress now are willing to slash Medicare and Medicaid to pay for tax \ncuts for the wealthy and to balance the budget on the backs of elderly, \nlow income, and, I would argue, students. And later on in this budget \ndebate we will be talking about the very working families about which \nmy colleague spoke.\n  Mind you, in this proposal there is no focus on all of the subsidies, \ntax breaks, loopholes, and deductions that go to some of the largest \ncorporations of America. There is a commitment to several hundred \nbillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy. Some of the largest \nPentagon contractors are not asked to tighten their belts. But when my \ncolleague talks about the future of our children, let me just tell you \nthat slashing some of the nutrition programs or saying to students you \nwill not get an exemption on the interest that you pay on your loans \nwhile you are in school--though, by the way, many of us did--does not \nstrike me as being a very wise investment in the future of our country.\n  (Mr. LUGAR assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as long as medical inflation increases \nat a faster pace than general inflation, health care costs are going to \ncontinue to be the challenge for us, continue to be the Pac Man of both \nhousehold budgets and the Government's budgets. That was precisely the \nproblem we were trying to address last year.\n  And that is the flaw in my colleague's analysis--I am sorry he is not \non the floor now to respond to this--that the President had no \nproposal, the Democrats had no proposal.\n  Mr. President, we have yet to hear exactly how the Medicare Program \nis going to be restructured to generate more than $250 billion in \nsavings over the next 7 years. Actually, we have not heard anything in \nspecifics. And the reason we have not heard anything in specifics is \nthat there is no way to make these current cuts, massive cuts, easily \nand quickly without causing the current system to unravel. The public \nknows it, businesses know it, and the providers of our care know it, as \ndo many elderly and other recipients.\n  Similarly, we have yet to hear whether or not the formula for \nMedicaid funding will adjust for population growth or how it is going \nto be divided among the States.\n  Two-thirds of Medicaid expenditures pay for long-term costs for the \nelderly and the disabled--two-thirds. So what we do know is that these \ncuts will be most devastating for the frailest of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, again my colleague says there is no proposal on the \nfloor. Sure, there is a proposal on the floor. We have an amendment \nthat says do not go forward with massive tax cuts flowing \ndisproportionately to the wealthiest, highest income citizens of \nAmerica. Instead, take that money and use that money to make sure that \nwe continue to provide adequate funding for Medicare and for long-term \ncosts through Medicaid. That is the tradeoff.\n  I have been a little bit dismayed about the debate, because I do not \nthink we need to get into sound bites. I think we can get into sound \npolicy analysis. Let me talk a little bit about some of the numbers \nthat have been put out here on the floor, and I will be as rigorous as \npossible in my analysis.\n  When we hear about ``No, no, no, we are not cutting; we are going to \nlimit it to 5 percent of overall growth,'' what is misleading when we \nare talking about this, when we are talking about Medicare and \nMedicaid, since most of those Medicaid expenses go to nursing home \nexpenses for the frailest and poorest of our elderly citizens, is that \nthese projections that we are hearing on the floor do not take into \naccount population growth.\n  In case anybody has not noticed the demography of our country, more \nand more people, citizens in the United States of America, are 65 years \nof age and over. And more and more of our elderly are 85 years of age. \nThat is why the costs continue to go up. There are more and more people \nthat are elderly.\n  My colleague said these programs have been a failure because more and \nmore people are dependent on them. Of course, more and more people are \ndependent on Medicare and, for that matter, Medicaid expenses for \nnursing home expenses, because the program has been a victim of its own \nsuccess. More and more are dependent because more and more people, \nthank God, live to be 65 years of age and over and our policy goal is \nnot to make sure that fewer people live to be 65 years of age or older. \nI mean, it is sort of a preposterous argument. By definition, more \npeople are eligible for Medicare because we have a larger percentage of \nour population that are elderly, and that is what I think we desire.\n  That has been one of the real pluses of having the Medicare Program, \nthat we have been able to provide health care assistance to elderly \npeople, whereas before 1965--please remember, Mr. President, this is \nnot a price on each senior's head. This is not some sort of check we \ngive people and say, ``Go out wherever you want and purchase care.''\n  We know all the problems the elderly people have with preexisting \nconditions. We know what happened prior to 1965; when people were \nretired, they did not have health care coverage.\n  This is a benefits program. This is an insurance program. Why not ask \nthe Medicare recipients and ask their children and ask their \ngrandchildren. It has made the United States of America a better \ncountry.\n  So, Mr. President, let us just look at the demography and the \nfigures.\n  On Medicare, the current system--and I am talking about per person \ngrowth rates, CBO figures--the current system, with the private health \ninsurance coverage, is going up 7.2 percent per person and Medicare 8.3 \npercent per person. These are budget proposals, Republican proposals, \nbetween now and 2002. I do no damage to the truth. I am willing to \ndebate anybody on the floor on these figures. With the Republican \nproposal, the private will go up 7.2 percent and Medicare will go up \n5.8 percent per person.\n  That is what you have to look at. That is what you have to look at.\n  By the way, there is an interesting point to be made. Since we are \ncovered under the private health insurance plan, that means that we \nmake allowances to make sure that our per person expenditure for each \nSenator goes up 7.2 percent but, for those people over 65, it is 5.8 \npercent. I may have an amendment to address that inequity later on in \nthis debate.\n  But with Medicaid--I said this to my colleague from New Mexico last \nweek, and I am still waiting for a response--these figures about, ``Oh, \nno; it is going up 5 percent,'' I say to my colleague from North \nDakota, these figures are a bit misleading because these figures do not \ntake into account the number of individuals, as you just look at the \ndemography, who will be eligible.\n  More and more a percentage of our population are aged. I do not know \nwhy colleagues are surprised about this.\n  Now with Medicaid, we are looking at Medicaid, and now unfortunately \nwe see not only this related to an explosion of people that are over 65 \nyears of age, but also the poor and the children. What we have here, \nalthough, again, two-thirds of Medicaid expenses are for nursing homes, \nthe current system, private per-person coverage 7.2 percent, been going \nup; Medicaid, 7 percent.\n  Now, again, using the CBO baseline Health Care Financing \nAdministration [[Page S7034]] projections with the Republican \nproposals, private goes up 7.2 percent, Mr. President, and 1.4 \npercent--1.4 percent --per person under Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to ask this question: What does that \ntranslate into in human terms? If you are going to limit between now \nand 2002 the increase of Medicaid reimbursement to a 1.4-percent \nincrease per person, what is going to be that impact on those elderly \ncitizens who receive Medicaid assistance for catastrophic care? And \nwhat will be that impact on those people who struggle with disability?\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Florida spoke about some of his \nmeetings back home. On Friday night, Jill and I went to a ball that was \na wonderful celebration with the developmental disabilities community. \nI met a man--I can barely read the type--Robert Gregory. He cannot \nspeak but, through new technology, he was able to type this out for me. \nAnd what he wrote out for me was this: ``Please, will you tell the \nRepublicans, don't set the disabled back 18 years. We are happy at how \nfar we have come.''\n  Now, the Chair cannot respond, and I know that he would respond \nbecause I know he has a real commitment to the community, but I have to \nsay--and I am waiting for someone to respond in debate, and I will be \nback later on today--if you are going to limit per person, that is the \nonly way you can be rigorous in these figures; do not give me all these \naggregate figures. They do not take into account the dramatic increase \nin the number of citizens that will be 65 years of age and over.\n  If you are going to limit it on Medicaid--which is frail, low-income \nelderly nursing home expenses, in the main, and also key to men and \nwomen and children with developmental disabilities--to 1.4 percent, and \nyou are not doing a darn thing to control medical inflation systemwide, \nwhat happens to these people? That is my question. And so far in the \ndebate, the silence has been deafening. What happens to these people?\n  Now, are fewer of them going to be, let us take, first of all, the \ndisabilities community. Are fewer people going to be eligible? Less \nreimbursement for personal attendance? Where are you going to make the \ncuts? How are you going to do it?\n  I say to my colleague, somebody, somewhere, sometime, someplace, tell \nme. Come out here on the floor and tell me in debate how you intend to \nmake these kind of cuts and limit per person expenditure to 1.4 percent \na year without devastating consequences for some of the most vulnerable \ncitizens in the United States of America and I will vote with you. You \njust come out here, be rigorous, and present the evidence.\n  Mr. President, there are no specifics about $250 billion in \nrestructuring Medicare because it cannot be done. Well, I mean you \ncould do it in a couple of different ways. You can, of course, provide \nless reimbursement for the providers, but right now the reimbursement \nis, roughly speaking, 58 percent of what is in the private insurance \nreimbursement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a number of statements \nfrom a number of different citizens and caregivers in rural Minnesota \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       A couple from Detroit Lakes, Minnesota write: Dear Senator \n     Wellstone: My husband and I are concerned about Medicare \n     cuts! When we reached 65 we were advised to sign up for \n     Medicare--so we did, also taking out Medigap insurance. We \n     pay over $3,000 for Medigap insurance plus the Medicare that \n     is withheld from our social security * * *. Medicare is a \n     great help to decent tax-paying people* * *. The GOP have a \n     contract for the American people--we feel that social \n     security and Medicare is also a contract with the American \n     people.\n       A woman from Coon Rapids writes: We paid into both Social \n     Security and Medicare all the working years of our life. \n     Reducing the deficit must be done in a fair and balanced way* \n     * *. They did not ask our wealthiest citizens and \n     corporations to share the burden by giving up their tax \n     loopholes.\n       And finally, a woman from Watertown, MN: I am writing to \n     you about the proposal to cut Social Security and Medicare. I \n     hope you will say ``no'' to these unfair and irresponsible \n     cuts. I am 86 years old. My husband and I worked hard all our \n     lives. He died eight years ago after being in a nursing home \n     for 5 years. That took all of our savings. I receive $489 a \n     month from Social Security and think I have saved enough for \n     my funeral. We never wanted to be a burden to our children or \n     anyone else. I recently had to go on medical assistance. I \n     have enjoyed good health and am a foster grandparent to a \n     child care center 3 mornings a week. We never missed voting \n     and really worked hard for conservation and the betterment of \n     our country. I hope this has not inconvenienced your time. \n     Perhaps you never did find time to read it, but I surely hope \n     you will vote ``no'' on that proposal.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just tell you something right \nnow, if you are going to cut down on reimbursements, which, of course, \nyou will have to do with Medicare, let us get real and honest about it, \ntwo things will happen. Either, I say to my colleague from North \nDakota, the providers will be in a position to just simply transfer the \ncost, shift the cost, in which case--the Presiding Officer knows health \ncare policy well--in which case then what happens is private health \ninsurance premiums go up and then what happens is businesses either no \nlonger can afford to cover employees or the premiums of everybody go \nup, and then what happens is we get into what is called a death spiral, \nwhich means premiums go up and yet fewer people are covered.\n  Every year, 1 million people less in the United States of America are \ncovered by employment-based insurance. That is what you are going to \nset off. Get real. Let us debate health care policy. Our legislative \nproposals have consequences in people's lives. Do not give me these \naggregate budgets unless you can explain to me what you, in fact, \nintend to do. For any colleague to come out on the floor and say the \nPresident has no proposal, the President has no alternatives, Democrats \ndo not have any alternatives, welcome to health care reform. The \nreality of it is staring you in the face. We need to do systemwide cost \ncontainment, and let us do that, but for God's sake, let us not target \nthe elderly, the poor, and the disabled.\n  Now, Mr. President, if the providers cannot shift the cost, which \nwill be the case all too often in rural America, in greater Minnesota \nand in North Dakota, then many of them will go out of business. It is \nthat simple. Do not take my word for it. Just ask the caregivers--\nnurses, doctors, you name it--all across rural America what the \nconsequences of these cuts will be. Or you can just simply raise the \ncost of this for seniors. But please remember--I do not have the \nfigures right in front of me--but please remember, I say to my \ncolleagues, that right now elderly people 65 years and older are paying \nfour times out of pocket already than citizens under 65 years of age. \nAnd please remember, I say to my colleagues, that about 85 percent of \nMedicare expenses go to households with incomes of under $25,000 a \nyear.\n  So do not have the illusion that these benefits are going to people \nwho have a lot of income. Please remember, I say to my colleagues, that \nthe median income for a male 65 years of age and over is about $15,000 \nand the median income for a woman is about $8,500. So do not have any \nillusions that you can put this cost back on many of the senior \ncitizens within this country.\n  Again, the real question on the Medicaid front is here we have a \nsituation in our country where every year 1 million less citizens have \nemployment-based coverage, and the only reason we have been able to do \nbetter on some of the statistics on infant mortality, the only reason \nwe have been able to cover some of our citizens, many of whom are \nworking poor who do not receive that coverage, is through the expansion \nof Medicaid, much less the ways in which we cover the way people who \nare elderly and ultimately wind up in nursing homes. If you want to get \nserious about the cost, do something about home-based care. Let us get \nback to health care policy. Now we are going to cut this 1.4-percent \nper person?\n  Mr. President, Minnesota is in a particularly precarious position \nwhen it comes to Medicare and Medicaid cuts or, what my colleagues like \nto call, capping the rate of growth of the programs.\n  HMO's that enroll Medicare beneficiaries in Kings County, NY, get \n$646 per month per enrollee, whereas HMO's in Hennepin County, MN, get \n$362 per month per enrollee. We have already kept our costs down. We do \nnot get the high payments that other States get. So a slash-and-burn \napproach for [[Page S7035]] States like Minnesota that have done an \nadmirable job of already keeping costs down ends up punishing us. We do \nnot have any fat in our system. We are already penalized by the current \nreimbursement system. And now for recipients, they will be facing about \n$3,200 more in copayments and deductibles and premiums over 7 years; \nabout $1,028 more in 2002.\n  By the way, I am assuming that in order to make up these cuts, there \nwill be a 50-50 split between what older people will have to pay out of \npocket and further cuts in reimbursement for the caregivers. Mr. \nPresident, after all we have heard on Capitol Hill lately about \nMedicare costs, it would be very easy to forget what the Medicare \nProgram is all about. It is a health insurance program established in \n1965 to provide benefits to those who need them the most. It is not a \nright to a certain dollar amount. It is not just a price tag on the \nhead of every senior, and it is not a check to go shopping.\n  This Medicare Program provides the foundation of our health care \nsystem, especially in rural areas, and it provides support and protects \nthose populations that would have the most trouble purchasing coverage \nin the private insurance market. Mr. President, I smile when I hear \nsome of the proposals about vouchers and then go out and purchase \nhealth insurance. We have preexisting condition. It has gotten to the \npoint where you have to prove to the private health insurance companies \nin this country you will never use it in order to obtain it. And my \ncolleagues think that elderly people who are sick, struggling with \ndifferent illnesses, are going to go out with vouchers and purchase \nhealth insurance from these companies? Welcome to health care policy. \nLet us get substantive.\n  When Medicare was enacted 30 years ago, most elderly citizens were \nuninsured. They lost their health insurance coverage when they retired, \nand currently even with Medicare coverage, as I said before, seniors \nspend about four times as much out of pocket as individuals under 65. \nAs I said before, 85 percent of Medicare expenditures pay for care for \nseniors with household incomes of less than $25,000.\n  Mr. President, I just simply do not understand how my colleagues \nintend to restructure to the tune of $250 billion on the Medicare and \n$150 billion, or whatever, on Medicaid without doing serious harm to \nmany citizens in the State of Minnesota and all across this land.\n  So then the question, and it is a fair question to ask, is why is \nMedicare so costly?\n And the simple answer--as a matter of fact, this answer is so simple \nthat the evidence is irrefutable and irreducible, and I would be \npleased to debate any colleague on this proposition--the simple answer \nis that Medicare is costly because it covers very sick people and \nbecause health care costs for all Americans, whether privately insured \nor covered by Medicare or Medicaid, have risen rapidly over the last \ntwo decades. And increasing enrollment--I cannot say this too many \ntimes, because sometimes we do not know what we do not want to know. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle turn their gaze away from \nthis truth. Increasing enrollment, especially for the over-age 85 \npopulation, and the renal-diseased beneficiaries, and increasing \nmedical inflation account for the bulk of the Medicare's Program's \nincreasing costs. It is simple--kidney transplants, dialysis, people \nliving to be 85 years of age--people need more assistance. What is the \npolicy proposal? To have fewer people living to be 85? Of course not. \nNobody proposes that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, since Medicare is a victim of its own success and \nwe cannot do anything about more and more people living longer lives, \nall of which I think we are grateful for--and we hope it for ourselves \nand for our parents and grandparents and other citizens--then what we \nought to do is focus on medical inflation, systemwide.\n  Medicaid provides a safety net for pregnant women, children, as well \nas critical long-term services for the elderly. Already, as I pointed \nout, it is projected per person to grow at a slower rate than the \nprivate sector. What are we going to do about these citizens, Mr. \nPresident? You know, they do not have as powerful a constituency. But \nwhat do we intend to do? Women who are expecting children, and \nchildren, and elderly, who, by definition, have to go to the poor \nhouse, figuratively, to become eligible for Medicaid assistance, to \nreceive nursing home coverage, and we are going to make draconian cuts \nin per-person expenditures--draconian.\n  I challenge any of my colleagues on this proposition. What is going \nto happen to those citizens? Is North Dakota going to pick up the cost? \nIs Minnesota? It is a shell game. We are not going to walk away from \nthem. So nobody should have any illusion. I hear my colleagues say how \nwe are going to reduce expenditures and let us get fiscally \nresponsible. Yes, let us control costs systemwide. This simply shifts \nthe costs. In this particular case, it is back to the States and local \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I am waiting for a discussion about health care \npolicy. I will make two proposals. Colleagues do not have to accept \nthem, but both are important. One proposal in the last Congress was \nthat if you put some limit on insurance company premiums, as you \nremember the Congressional Budget Office said, by the year 2002, I say \nto my colleague from North Dakota, we would have saved $100 billion, in \n1 year alone. That is systemwide. Maybe it is too controversial for \ncolleagues. Sure, insurance companies are very powerful. Maybe that is \nnot the proposal. But you have to contain the cost systemwide. You \ncannot just pick out one segment of the population. You target them, \nyou hurt them, you shift costs, you do irreparable damage to some of \nthe underserved communities, including rural America; you do not \nprovide the assistance that we now provide for teaching hospitals; you \ndo not provide the necessary assistance for the disproportionate share \nof payments for those hospitals who treat the poor citizens in this \ncountry. It does not work at all. You just shift costs. Someone pays \nfor it. You make it a shell game if you do not do it systemwide. So let \nus get real and do it systemwide.\n  That is how you really begin to get some handle on the Medicare and \nMedicaid costs. If you do not do that, you scapegoat all too many \ncitizens in this country.\n  Mr. President, the other thing that you can do, if you are serious \nabout substantive policy--not just slash-and-burn, not just cut, cut, \ncut--invest in home-based care. For God's sake, why should elderly \npeople not--I had a mother and father with Parkinson's disease. We \nlived this. Why should elderly people or people with disabilities not \nbe able to live at home in as near as normal circumstances as possible, \nwith dignity? Last Congress, we were debating health care policy. We \nwanted to expand home-based care. We wanted to control costs \nsystemwide. We wanted to have more of a focus on primary care, \npreventive care out in the communities. But this Congress it is slash \nand burn.\n  Where is the voice of my colleagues who, when we talked about cost \ncontainment systemwide last Congress, we talked about rationing and \nlimiting choice, and now they want to ration and limit choice among \nelderly, low-income, disabled people, and there is not a word? Their \nsilence is deafening. Why are you not out on the floor talking about \nrationing and limiting choice now? We have an alternative. Our \nalternative is--there is no credibility to broad-based tax cuts going \nin the main to the wealthiest citizens of the United States of America \nwhile you proceed with a slash and burn approach toward the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs. Believe me you, we will have alternatives \ndealing with loopholes and deductions in corporate welfare. We will \nhave a whole lot of other alternatives on the floor.\n  Mr. President--and I will conclude--again, my colleague from Florida \nis not on the floor right now, but the debate is not about deficit \nreduction--going forward deficit reduction. The debate is about where \nis the standard of fairness. The debate is about responsible economic \npolicy. Some colleagues think 2002 is the date. I have always felt that \nwas a political date, not a realistic date.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I heard so many of my colleagues \nin the course of this debate over the last several months say, ``We \nwill balance the budget by 2002. We will have broad-based tax cuts, and \nwe will increase the Pentagon budget.'' Some of it is on \n[[Page S7036]] record. I heard colleagues say that, ``We will not make \nany cuts in Medicare. Do not worry, veterans, do not worry students, we \nwill pay the interest on the debt and we will do all of it.'' Well, Mr. \nPresident, I do not think it turned out to be credible. So we are not \narguing about deficit reduction, but what we are arguing about is where \nis the standard of fairness. Mr. President, there is no standard of \nfairness to the tax cuts for the wealthy and these kinds of cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying we have 2 days of debate on \nthe budget. I think we finish up Wednesday night. But as far as I am \nconcerned, this debate just begins. My good friend from Florida said \nthat people in the last election voted for change. They did. But it \nbegged the question, what kind of change? Did people vote for this kind \nof slash-and-burn approach, not based on substantive, I think, policy \nanalysis about what we need to do in health care reform in the Medicare \nand Medicaid area? Did people vote for these kinds of cuts? We will \nhave a debate about the role of Government. And I will conclude with \nthe remarks made by a great Senator from Minnesota, Hubert Humphrey. I \nhave said it before on the floor of the Senate. I think I am going to \nsay it over and over and over again. Senator Humphrey said: ``The test \nof a society is the way in which we treat people, dawn of life \nchildren''--I will have an amendment about children--``the way we treat \npeople in twilight of their lives, the elderly, and the way we treat \npeople in the shadow of their lives, struggling with a disability, \npeople struggling with an illness and people who are needy or people \nwho are low-income.''\n  By that standard, I think this budget proposal falls way short of the \nmark, and we can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will be going into this kind of \nspeaker rotation, their side and ours. Senator Cohen will speak for 15 \nminutes, and I understand Senator Dorgan seeks to speak after that.\n  If we establish it now, Senator Cohen will be followed by Senator \nDorgan, who will have 30 minutes, and of course if he needs more, his \nside can yield it to him, and we will find a Senator who desires to \nspeak immediately after Senator Dorgan. We will continue down that \nline.\n  I will leave Senator Cohen in charge of the floor for the next 15 or \n20 minutes and follow along the lines just agreed to here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici for yielding me \nthese 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, last week I had occasion to listen to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Robert Kerrey. I thought he made a very passionate \nand thought-provoking presentation.\n  He called for the return of some sense of civility during the course \nof the debate on this budget issue. Frankly, I find myself in great \nempathy with what Senator Kerrey had to recommend. I think things have \ngotten out of control. Certainly they have around the country, in terms \nof the rhetoric we are hurling at one other, back and forth, not only \nacross political aisles, but indeed, between regions and interest \ngroups.\n  I took Senator Kerrey's call for return to civility and responsible \ndiscourse to heart. I think he is quite on the mark. I think we would \nall do well to follow his example.\n  In that light, I would like to commend Senator Domenici from New \nMexico. Frankly, Mr. President, I do not know a more decent human \nbeing, certainly in the Senate and maybe this country, than Pete \nDomenici.\n  I have heard charges leveled against him that as chairman of the \nBudget Committee he wants to wreak havoc against the elderly, he wants \nto plunder their savings, he wants to deprive them of hospital and \nmedical attention.\n  I doubt very much whether many people in this Chamber, or indeed the \nother Chamber as well, could claim the kind of support that he has \nenjoyed over the years from our senior citizens' communities. I doubt \nvery much whether many Members have, in fact, the kind of compassion \nthat he has demonstrated over the years toward those who are less \nfortunate than ourselves.\n  He is concerned about senior citizens. He is concerned about the \nmiddle aged, certainly. But also he is concerned for children. He is \nconcerned deeply about children. He has eight of his own. In fact, I \nthink one is going to be married this coming Saturday.\n  I think if we look at what Pete Domenici has been focusing upon--this \nspiraling debt--and it affects all the age groups from the very young, \nto those who are aspiring business men and women, to the labor force, \nto those in middle age, and to our elderly community.\n  I really think that we do a great disservice to him when we see the \nkind of attacks leveled against his efforts by saying that he is simply \nout to finance tax cuts for the rich by pulling money out of the \npockets of the elderly and the poor. I think it does a tremendous \ndisservice to him and also to the entire debate surrounding this issue.\n  I remember reading a column a couple years ago that David Broder \nwrote for the Washington Post. He is a respected syndicated columnist. \nHe said he had just finished reading President Clinton's budget. There \nwere two figures--after going through that 1,400-page document--that \nMr. Broder thought were missing: The number of $1 trillion and the \nsecond number of 58 cents. He looked throughout that entire, massive \ndocument and could find those two numbers nowhere in the document.\n  He said the $1 trillion figure came from the fact that if we were to \ngrant President Clinton's assumptions in the budget, that is, that we \nhave sustained growth during his 4 years in office, that we have low \ninflation, and that the recommended tax increases and budget cuts play \nout as budget analysts had projected--assuming all that were to occur--\nat the end of that first term, we would have increased the national \ndebt by $1 trillion.\n  That is the rate at which we are adding to the debt in this country. \nGive President Clinton the benefit of the doubt. Assume everything will \nwork out as he projected, and we were still going to add another $1 \ntrillion to the national debt.\n  That is a number which, I think, should prove frightening to most \npeople. It means that we are going to be sacrificing the future for the \npresent, that we are going to encumber our children with debts for \nwhich they have not been responsible. We are going to tie a ball and \nchain around their necks, as such, and throw them off into this void of \ntrillion dollar debt increases every 4 years.\n  Then the other number that was missing from the budget was 58 cents. \nThe projection was that 58 cents of each $1 that we as individuals \npay--everybody in this Chamber, and the citizens who are watching from \nthe gallery and from around this country--58 cents out of every $1 paid \nin personal income taxes would go not for the defense of the country, \nnot for education in the country, not for Medicare or Medicaid, not for \nhighways and bridges, not for science and technology, not for \nSuperfund, not for any of these programs--but rather exclusively to pay \ninterest on the debt.\n  Since interest on the debt compounds, that will climb exponentially \nin the coming years unless we do something dramatic to reduce that \nescalating debt.\n  Those two figures, I think, should be recalled. They are precisely \nwhat Senator Domenici, as chairman of the Budget Committee, has tried \nto come to grips with. It is time, I think, for us to stop politicizing \nthe debate to such an extent that we camouflage the issues and the \nimportance of what those issues mean to the American people.\n  More recently, the same columnist, David Broder, wrote another piece \nin the Washington Post, now, some 2 years later. He said really this \ndebate [[Page S7037]] is all about what Government should do in today's \nsociety.\n  Americans are starting now to reevaluate exactly what Government \nshould do on behalf of its people. Not only what should it do, but at \nwhat level should Government act. Should it be at the local community \nor municipal level? Should it be at the State level? Or should it be \nhere in Washington?\n  These are legitimate issues that we have to work our way through. \nThere is a reassessment taking place through the country. People are \nnot too sure. They have an anger, we are told. Certainly, a high level \nof anxiety about political events and political policies. There is, as \nwe have witnessed, a good deal of anger that can in fact prove to be \nexplosive in this country. We saw it in what one writer called Beirut, \nOklahoma:\n a form of domestic terrorism taking over that I think poses a severe \nthreat to our security in the coming months and years.\n\n  So, this is a legitimate issue for us to debate and, in fact, come to \nlegitimate disagreements. But let us not resort to the kind of class \nwarfare that we see taking place here in this Chamber. Time and time \nagain, every time the Republicans try to come to grips with the budget \nthose on the other side of the aisle accuse Republicans of being \nmiserly, of being mean-spirited, of being cruel, of being heartless \nbecause we are trying to protect the future for future generations.\n  I recall the debate several years ago when the then-majority offered \nan amendment to tax and somehow punish the rich. We passed a luxury \ntax. It sounded great. We were really going to go after those people \nwho had the money to buy luxury cars, furs, jewels, and boats. We \nimposed a luxury tax on boats.\n  Do you know what it did? Do you think it hit the rich? It was aimed \nat the rich. It did not hurt the rich. It hit the pocketbooks of the \nmiddle class. People of my State got hurt. The workers, the craftsmen, \nthe people who build these boats, these luxury boats, were put out of \nwork.\n  The same thing will take place as long as we try to wage class \nwarfare. The attack is: Republicans are only concerned about the rich, \nthe wealthy. They could not care less about the middle class. They \ncould not care less about the poor.\n  Those are unfounded charges. I think they are outrageous charges. And \nI think all that these charges have done is to pollute the atmosphere \nin which we have to conduct this debate to such a degree that the \nAmerican people are confused about the issues and simply are responding \nout of fear.\n  So let us not engage in class warfare. There are some legitimate \ndifferences of opinion in terms of how we go about trying to achieve a \nbalanced budget. It may be that those on the minority side do not care \nabout balancing the budget. It may be that the debt is an issue too \nabstract for the American people to grasp, and therefore they see no \npolitical benefit in joining in this effort. Not all, but some, may try \nto exploit this issue. Back in 1981-82--President Reagan had just come \ninto office in 1981--the trustees of the Social Security System came to \nCongress and said the Social Security System was in trouble. Payments \nout to the beneficiaries were exceeding its revenues. Unless Congress \ntook action, it would become bankrupt relatively soon.\n  I recall at that time President Reagan came into office and he made \nsome recommendations for changing the Social Security Program. I, \nfrankly, did not think it was a wise course of action. We supported the \nPresident because it was an effort made to reform the system, to save \nit and make it solvent. I also understood the risks that were involved \npolitically. Whenever you talk about Social Security, that has been \ndescribed as the hot rail of politics. Touch it and you invite your own \nmortality, at least politically speaking.\n  Nonetheless, we voted to reform that system in 1981, and guess what \nhappened. During the 1982 elections, prominent members of the \nDemocratic Party went on television. They held up a facsimile of a \nSocial Security card and they said, ``Here is the card. Here is your \nSocial Security card right here. Do you know what Republicans want to \ndo? They want to just tear it up. That is what they want for your \nSocial Security card.''\n  It proved to be dynamite politically. It was very effective. We lost \nelections at every level of government all across the country, from \nState legislatures to gubernatorial races, to House and Senate races. \nIt was very, very effective. So they exploited the issue during the \n1982 campaign. And then what happened? Guess what happened. Immediately \nafter the elections were over the same people who were tearing up the \nfacsimile of a Social Security card came back and said, ``Do you know \nsomething, we have a problem. Social Security is in trouble. Why do we \nnot form a bipartisan commission to see if we cannot fix it?'' And that \nis precisely what happened. We formed a bipartisan commission to fix \nit, after the politics were taken out of it by the election.\n  It seems to me the same line of argument is being offered right here \ntoday and will be offered throughout the debate on this budget. The \nMedicare trustees have advised us that Medicare is going broke; that \nthe revenues coming in will be less than the payments going out; that \nby the year 2002, a short time away--6\\1/2\\ years--there will be no \nmoney at all left in the trust fund to pay for anyone's hospital or \ndoctor bills. The system will be absolutely broke at that time; nothing \nwill be paid.\n  In either today's paper or yesterday's paper, a front-page article in \nthe New York Times said, ``Those in the heartland are worried about \nMedicare, what this budget might do to Medicare.''\n  It is ironic. Of course people are worried about what is going to \nhappen to Medicare. But if we do nothing it is going broke. There will \nbe no money in 6\\1/2\\ years. No one will receive payments, no hospital, \nno community health service, no doctors--none of them will receive \nanything. And all the people who will need assistance at that time will \nbe left to look at their Government and say, ``Why did you not do \nsomething about it? Why did you wait these 6\\1/2\\ years? Why did you \nwait until after the 1996 elections were over before you came forward \nand said let us work together to try to save the Medicare System?'' But \nthat is what is going on right now.\n  We have not heard one single proposal during the deliberations in the \nBudget Committee on how the minority would like to see the trust fund \nprotected and preserved and saved. Not one. All they can do at this \npoint is point to the Republicans and say, ``Look, you are trying to \ngut the Medicare Program.'' We are trying to save it. It is growing at \na rate of 10 or 10.5 percent a year. We cannot sustain 10.5 percent a \nyear growth in the Medicare Program. President Clinton recognized this. \nWhen he submitted his health care reform proposal he said we cannot \nsustain this. Mrs. Clinton did, too. They said we cannot sustain 10.5 \npercent growth each and every year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes of the Senator from Maine has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COHEN. I ask I be permitted an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. So, on the one hand we had the President and the First \nLady talking about the need to reduce the growth rate in Medicare. And \nI have taken pains over their 2\\1/2\\ years in office to praise them in \ntheir effort to focus attention on health care reform. I think we need \nit. It is as necessary today as it was 2 years ago. It will be even \nmore important tomorrow than it is today. As a matter of fact, I have \nintroduced health care reform legislation on three occasions so far \nthis session. So I think they were right in trying to focus our \nattention on the need to reform the health care system.\n  I did not agree with the solution they proposed but they deserved \ncredit for putting it on the front burner. Once this budget resolution \ndebate is over, we will put it back on the front burner where it \nbelongs.\n  But you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand we \ncannot sustain 10-percent annual growth and then, on the other hand, \ncriticize Republicans for saying you are right, we are going to try to \nsustain a 7- or 7.5-percent growth. To label that as a savage cut when, \nin fact, that is precisely what they themselves had in mind for their \nown reduction in the growth of Medicare, seems to me to be rather \noutlandish. [[Page S7038]] \n  I believe there is a moral dimension to the argument we are having \nhere today, the debate. I think there is a moral imperative to \nresolving the dispute on the national debt, on the annual deficits of \n$200 billion. Right now we are spending roughly $235 billion a year \njust in interest payments on the debt. Soon that sum will exceed what \nwe spend for our entire National security effort. Interest payments are \nlikely to climb well above $300 billion, $325, $340 billion a year if \nwe do nothing.\n  So I think there is a moral dimension to this entire debate. There is \na moral imperative that we take action that is responsible, that is not \nfilled with smoke and mirrors, as has been done in the past; that we \nlook to Senator Domenici, a man, as I indicated, of great decency and \ncourage, for putting forth a budget blueprint which will put us on the \nroad to a balanced budget by the year 2002. Maybe there are some who do \nnot want that. Maybe there are some who say just let us continue doing \nwhat we have been doing because it pays political dividends. That is \nthe way you stay elected in this country, just keep saying yes. Just \nsay to every group that comes in, you want more? How can we help you? \nRather than dealing with the future of this country.\n  We have had Jefferson quoted many, many times. One of my favorite \nquotes of his that I call upon is this: he said, ``Whenever one \ngeneration spends money and then taxes another to pay for it, that \nfirst generation is squandering futurity on a massive scale.''\n  What we have been doing is squandering the future of our children on \na massive scale and the time has come for us to reverse this. The time \nhas come for us to stop borrowing from our children, to start paying \nour own debts, to have something for them available for a better way of \nlife than we are leaving them if we continue on this course.\n  I also recall the words of Walter Lippmann, who spoke on a different \nsubject some years ago. It was in 1940, on the eve of our involvement \nin World War II. He was giving, I believe, a speech to his classmates \non the 30th anniversary of their graduation from Harvard. What he said \nat that time, I think, has relevance to what we are doing here today.\n  Lippmann was concerned about how the country had allowed itself to \ndegenerate into a slothful, wasteful, cowardly Nation, that we had \nfailed in our responsibilities to measure up to the great heritage we \nhad at that time, that we were squandering the present, and certainly \nthe future, because we took the easy way out whenever there was a hard \nchoice to make.\n  Lippmann said at that time:\n\n       Upon the standard to which the wise and honest will now \n     repair, it is written. You have lived the easy way; \n     henceforth, you will live the hard way * * * you came into a \n     great heritage made by the insight and the sweat and blood of \n     inspired and devoted and courageous men; thoughtlessly and in \n     utmost self-indulgence you have all but squandered this \n     inheritance. Now only by the heroic ventures which made this \n     inheritance can you restore it again.\n\n  It is written:\n\n       You took the good things for granted. Now you must earn \n     them again * * * for every right you cherish, you have a duty \n     which you must fulfill. For every hope you entertain, you \n     have a task you must perform. For every good you wish to \n     preserve, you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your \n     ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer.\n\n  Mr. President, that is precisely what the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has said to all of us. ``There is nothing for nothing any \nlonger.'' He deserves our support for the effort he has undertaken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota yield \nfor 1 moment?\n  I yield myself 1 minute. Then I understand it is Senator Dorgan's \nturn.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cohen for his excellent \nremarks. I think he is right on with the notion of shared sacrifice now \nthat we are in this position. It kind of weaves its way through his \nremarks.\n  But I also want to thank him particularly for the kind remarks he \nmade about the budget that I have worked for for a long time on \nnumerous task forces; a lot of them. A lot of people participated, and \nI think it is a good and fair, well-rounded budget.\n  I thank him for his compliments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I designate Senator Judd Gregg to manage \nthe time on our side until I return to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin, as my colleague from Maine \ndid, by complimenting the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nand complimenting my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nExon.\n  Senator Domenici has a long and distinguished career in the Senate, \nas does the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee. I view the \nwork of both of them as very good work for this country, and I think \nthat they are among the two most trusted Members of this body, as a \nmatter of fact. They bring to the floor of the Senate different views \nabout how you achieve the same objective.\n  There is no disagreement I think in this Chamber about whether the \nobjective of a balanced budget is a worthy objective. Of course, it is. \nAnd it is not only an objective. It is in my judgment a priority. The \nquestion then is not whether; the question is, how do we achieve a \nbalanced budget?\n  The Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen, indicated that he agreed with \nthe previous speaker about the need for more civility in our discourse \nhere in the Senate and in the country. I certainly agree with that. We \nneed to debate ideas. We need to be respectful of disagreements and \ndiffering viewpoints. There has been a tendency in recent years in this \ntown to try to tear things down, to tear people up.\n  I have stood on the floor several times and read the list of words \nthat one Member of Congress suggested to members of his party that they \nshould use against their opponents. He said, ``When you are running \nagainst somebody, use the word `traitor' to define your opponent. Call \nyour opponent `pathetic'. Use the word `lie.' Use the word `sick.''' \nAgain, ``Use the word `traitor.'''\n  That kind of counsel is counsel that demeans politics in our country. \nWe must turn away from all of that. Our democratic system is better \nthan that, and our politics should be better than that.\n\n\n                           Budget Priorities\n\n  As we debate this budget resolution, I am going to be critical of \nsome part of Senator Domenici's budget. But I will do so with respect. \nI am going to talk about its impact. He probably disagrees with how I \nassess the impact of parts of the budget, but I do not do this with \nmalice. I do this because I think this is precisely where we ought to \nhave a vibrant, spirited debate about what we believe the priorities of \nthis country should be.\n  If 100 years from now historians could look back at us and try to \nevaluate what we stood for, what we found important, what we held dear, \nthey would almost certainly be able to look at the Federal budget. And \nby determining what we invested in, or what we spent our money on, they \ncould determine what our priorities were. This is the time and the \nplace for a spirited debate about what we believe is important.\n  Some years ago I was with a couple of my colleagues traveling in \nCentral America. I think I have told my colleagues this before. I was \non a helicopter that ran out of gas in the mountains near the border of \nHonduras and Nicaragua. When you are in a flying machine that runs out \nof gas, one of the immutable laws of the air is you will be landing \nsoon. And we did.\n  We were out of radio contact, sort of in a jungle clearing area where \nwe came down. And the campesinos from around the region came walking up \nto find out who had landed there. We were not injured at all. Hours \nlater we were hauled out by other helicopters that found us. But as the \npeople walked through the underbrush, the campesinos, to find out who \nhad landed in this mountainous terrain near the border of Nicaragua and \nHonduras, I was able to talk with some of them through an interpreter.\n  I found what I have found in every other region of the world. You \ntalk to people about what their life is like, and [[Page S7039]] what \ntheir hopes and dreams are. Almost universally, they say they would \nlike to come to the United States of America. Almost all over the world \nyou will find people that answer. ``We would like to come to United \nStates of America.'' When you ask why, they say, ``Because the United \nStates of America provides hope and opportunity.'' You will find that \nall over the world.\n  I simply say that today because I think sometimes we lose sight of \nthe advantages and the strengths in this country. We spend so much time \ndebating the problems that we sometimes forget the strength of this \ncountry.\n  The problem we are talking about today is a problem with respect to \nthe Federal deficit. Year after year we spend more than we take in, and \nit adds to the Federal debt, and the Federal debt requires us then to \npay interest on the debt each year. Those interest payments consume an \never-growing portion of the Federal budget.\n  I would observe with some measure of interest that the Republicans in \nthis Chamber always win a debate they have with themselves. Even then \nit may take a little while. But they always win a debate that they are \nhaving with themselves. Now they say, ``We are for a balanced budget \nbecause we know it is good for America, but we are not so sure any \nDemocrats are for a balanced budget.'' Just to put all of their minds \nat ease, I know I am not alone on this side of the aisle in saying that \nmany of us believe it is a priority. The question is not whether. It is \nhow?\n  What priorities do we choose? Where do we cut spending, and how do we \nraise revenue? Who are the winners and who are the losers? In other \nwords, who gains, and who does not? When we talk about that, it is not \nclass warfare. Do not ever let me hear people say it is class warfare \nwhen we talk about who are the winners and who are the losers under \nthese budget proposals, because that is nonsense.\n  The proposal that is brought to the Senate floor has provisions in it \nthat I support in many, many areas. Senator Domenici, for example, \nwould choose to cut spending in a range of areas that I would \nabsolutely agree with. I support them. They make a lot of sense. But \nsome of the larger choices in this budget I do not support, and I think \nthere are alternative ways of achieving the same goals with different \nresults.\n  I have a couple of charts on the floor that describe this budget, not \nfrom my perspective, and not from the perspective of the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Exon or others, but from the perspective of Kevin \nPhillips, a Republican author and columnist, a person of some note.\n  He wrote a wonderful book incidentally about the 1980's, but I wish \nto share with my colleagues what Kevin Phillips has to say about the \nRepublican budget proposals. One could hardly say that Kevin Phillips \nis some liberal, pointy-headed Democrat who is trying to undermine \nCongressional Republicans. I do not know Kevin Phillips hardly at all, \nbut I am interested in his comments because as I looked at this budget \nin terms of who wins and who loses, I sensed the same thing that Kevin \nPhillips does.\n  Let me read some excerpts of an address that Kevin Phillips gave on \nthe radio last week. Again, a Republican political analyst says the \nfollowing about this budget.\n\n       Spending on Government programs from Medicare and education \n     to home heating oil assistance, is to be reduced in ways that \n     principally burden the poor and the middle class, while \n     simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways that predominantly \n     benefit the top one or two percent of the Americans.\n\n  That is not me. That is a Republican, who says the fact is the losers \nare the folks on Medicare, people who need help for education, home \nheating assistance, and so on. And the winners, well, those are the top \n1 or 2 percent of Americans. But he went on.\n\n       If the budget deficit was really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice, with business, Wall Street \n     and the rich, the people who have the big money, making the \n     biggest sacrifice. Instead, it's senior citizens, the poor, \n     students and ordinary Americans who'll see the programs they \n     will depend on gutted, while business, finance and the \n     richest one or two percent, far from making the sacrifice, \n     actually get new benefits and reductions.\n\n  Again, Kevin Phillips, says:\n\n       In short, aid to dependent grandmothers, children, college \n     students, and city dwellers is to be slashed, while aid to \n     dependent corporations, stock brokers, generals, and assorted \n     James Bond imitators survives or even grows.\n       If the deficit is substantially reduced under a program \n     like this, there will be a second stage of further upward \n     income redistribution from upper bracket profits in the stock \n     and bond markets.\n\n  And finally again from Mr. Phillips' remarks last week:\n\n       If the U.S. budget deficit problem does represent the \n     fiscal equivalent of war--and maybe it does--then what we are \n     really looking at is one of the most flagrant examples of war \n     profiteering this century has seen.\n\n  Maybe Mr. Phillips overstates it. Let me go to a previous chart where \nhe talks about winners and losers, because that is the purpose of my \ndiscussion today.\n  The first chart I showed you indicates Mr. Phillips' analysis of this \nbudget is that the burden on the poor and the middle class will be \nincreased substantially, while taxes shall be cut in ways that \npredominantly benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of the American people. \nThat is why I began saying this is really a debate about priorities. \nThe question in this budget is who wins and who loses, who gains and \nwho does not. And that is why we ought to have a full and thorough \ndebate and then make our own individual choices about how we balance \nthis budget, not whether but how we balance this budget.\n\n\n                         Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  There has been a substantial amount of discussion about Medicare and \nMedicaid especially because they represent the recommendations for the \nlargest proposed reductions in the budget plan.\n  Now, if you divide the question some: Should we be controlling the \nrate of increase or the rate of growth in spending on Medicare and \nMedicaid? The answer clearly is yes. Everyone in this Chamber has known \nthat is a requirement for some long while. It was widely discussed last \nyear and will be even more widely discussed this year, I am guessing. \nBut the budget proposal comes to the floor with a giant cut in both \nMedicare and Medicaid with no plan for dealing with its impact on the \nmost vulnerable in our society. And we are told by some--the Speaker of \nthe House among others--that the Medicare cut will be painless.\n  That is an interesting assertion, but it does not contribute much to \nthis discussion because everyone knows the Medicare cut will not be \npainless. The proposed cuts Medicare and Medicaid in this budget will \nmean higher health care costs and lower quality of care for the elderly \nand the poor.\n  In fact, recently we heard some testimony before the Senate Finance \nCommittee from the new head of the Congressional Budget Office, who was \njust appointed by the Republican leadership. She was asked: As a result \nof these cuts, what will happen to quality of health care?\n  The head of the Congressional Budget Office said:\n\n       What is provided by the Government within this amount is \n     not likely to be the same level of quality.\n\n  Let me read that again because it kind of reminds me of the op-ed \npiece in today's Post that says, ``Beltway Babble.''\n\n       What is provided by the Government within this amount is \n     not likely to be the same level of quality. To maintain \n     similar quality--\n\n  Dr. O'Neill said--\n\n     seniors will pay more for it.\n\n  Stripped away, the question is, if we have this kind of a budget cut \nin Medicare and Medicaid, will you have the same kind of health care \nquality? The answer is no. Will health care cost more for the elderly \nand the poor? The answer is yes.\n  Now, what are the other consequences? Well, the other consequences \nwill be that we will see rural hospital closings across rural America. \nIn my home State of North Dakota, you will see I think a dozen rural \nhospitals close. You will see the elderly with chronic health problems, \nwho are struggling now with respect to access to health care, struggle \neven more.\n  All of us have talked to the 80-year-olds at town meetings who tell \nus they have heart problems and diabetes, and the prescribed medicine \nfor these life-threatening problems they cannot afford, so they take \nhalf the dosage so it lasts twice as long. That is the only way they \ncan do it because they cannot eat and pay the rent and buy the \nmedicine. They do not have the money. All [[Page S7040]] of us \nunderstand that. That is what is happening today and that problem will \nbe exacerbated by these cuts.\n  Now, the budget also says we ought to make substantial cuts in \neducation. It says let us raise some revenue by asking college students \nto pay interest that begins accruing immediately when they get a \ncollege student loan. The effect of this is to significantly increase \nthe payments they will be required to make especially from low- and \nmoderate-income households. So, through this budget, we are saying to \npeople, we want to make it harder for you to send your kids to school.\n  Well, it seems to me that the first investment you make, if you care \nabout the future, is the investment in your kids. The first investment \nis an investment in education. What investment in this country pays \nbigger dividends than the investment in kids? None. There is not one.\n  I told my colleagues before about walking into the office of the \noldest Member of Congress when I came here, Claude Pepper from Florida, \na wonderful gentleman. He was then in his late eighties. He had come \nduring Franklin Delano Roosevelt's term in office. He was a bright, \ninteresting guy. On the wall behind his chair he had two pictures. One \nwas Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight, \nautographed to him by Orville Wright: ``To Congressman Claude Pepper, \nwith deep admiration,'' and beneath it an autographed picture of Neil \nArmstrong standing on the Moon.\n  What does that mean? What is the difference between those two \npictures? Massive investment in education and the enormous dividends \nthat education yields in technology and progress. It is from the ground \nto the air to the Moon. That is what education is. It is about our \nfuture. It is about dividends.\n  And this budget says, ``Well, let's decide that that is not a \npriority. Let's decide that we cannot afford the full, good-quality \nhealth care for the elderly and the poor, and we cannot afford the full \nmeasure of investment in education for our young people.''\n  Now, why cannot we afford to do that? Because we have designs on \ngiving tax relief. Kevin Phillips says it--the burden on the poor and \nthe middle class increases, while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in \nways that predominantly benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of Americans.\n  Why can we not provide a full measure of help to somebody that wants \nto send their kids to college? Because they want to give tax cuts. Oh, \nit is cleverly placed in this budget. It is sort of off to the side as \na footnote. But they have reserved $175 billion specifically for the \nFinance Committee specifically for a tax cut so that what is done on \nthis side will mirror what was done on in the other body in its \nContract With America.\n  Now, the tax cut is called a middle-class tax cut. The tax cut, at \nleast in the House of Representatives, does the following. It says, if \nyou are a family with under $30,000 of family income, you get a \nwhopping $124-a-year tax cut. But if you are a family with over \n$200,000 in family income, God bless you, we are going to give you a \nbig old tax cut of $11,200 a year, because you are important to us, \nthey say.\n  They want the delivery truck to stop at the middle-class home where \nthey are going to send their kids to college and pick up some money \nfrom them, because they said we need a little money from you. Then they \nwant the delivery truck to stop at some home for the elderly and pick \nup some of their money and some of their Medicare benefits. Another few \nstops collects money from low-income families health assistance and \neducation assistance, because we cannot afford that any more.\n  Then what does the Republican delivery truck do we do with all that \nmoney? It makes other stops in Hometown, USA after picking up all that \nmoney from all those folks. Yes, it drops the money off at the banker's \nhouse and the big businessman's house. And the driver says: You know \nsomething? We've been making the rounds here in our hometown. We've \ngathered up some money from the folks here--the folks who were going to \nuse it to send their kids to school, going to use it to heat their \nhouse in the winter, going to use if because they were poor and needed \nhealth care. And we gathered up all that money and now we are knocking \non your door because we think you, the richest man in our town, really \ndeserves a little more.\n  So we are going to drop these bags off at the front door and hope you \ndo a good thing for our community. We hope you will go out and spend \nit, and spend it here at home, if you will, so that all that money \nsomehow will trickle down to all these folks and that family that \nwanted to send their kids to school might someday see some small \ndividend from your wild spending spree as a result of this tax cut.\n\n  Well, that is sort of putting it in a hometown context. If this were \na hometown decision instead of a country, do you really think we would \ndo that? Do you really think we would say to the families: ``You're \nhaving trouble sending your kid to school, so let's make it harder and \nlet's use the money to give a tax cut to the richest person in our \ntown''? I do not think so.\n  Class warfare, my colleagues say. Is it class warfare to talk about \nthe priorities, if you think the priorities are wrong? I do not believe \nthat is class warfare. I believe it is appropriate to quote even a \nRepublican commentator who says this is a massive shift of income from \nthe poor and middle-income families to the rich and the big \ncorporations.\n  Did you know, as we are talking about all these choices and \npriorities, that the other body, in its Contract With America tax bill, \nthey decided they wanted to eliminate the alternative minimum tax for \ncorporations? This is the device by which we prevented big corporations \nfrom making billions of dollars in profits and paying zero in taxes.\n  Without the AMT, a corporation can make $3 billion in net profit and \nend up paying zero in taxes. Meanwhile, somebody gets up in the morning \nand goes out and works hard 8 hours a day digging ditches or hard \nmanual labor and pays a tax on it because they cannot get out from \nunder it. They have to pay a tax on the work they do; that is what \npeople do. Businesses in the past would make several billion dollars \nand pay zero, so we decided to stop that. We created an alternative \nminimum tax so that profitable corporations still have to pay something \nin taxes.\n  This is what the other body has just repealed. It means $4 billion \nfor 2,000 corporations. In other words, 2,000 corporations get $2 \nmillion each in tax benefits at the same time that we are saying as a \nmatter of priority that education somehow does not count, education \ndoes not rank near the top of what this country thinks is important.\n  We are also told in recent debate here on the floor of the Senate \nthat the budget proposal to cut Medicare will actually save Medicare \nfrom insolvency.\n  Now, I must say this is kind of a disingenuous argument. It is not \nnew to understand the trustees' report that says that Medicare will at \nsome point face a very serious problem. The year now is 2002. Twenty-\nthree times in the past 25 years the Medicare trustees have issued \ntheir report projecting the insolvency of the Medicare part A trust \nfund. So this is not new.\n  In 1972, the trustees projected insolvency in 1976, and Congress took \naction to solve it. In 1982, they projected insolvency by 1987, and \nCongress took action to solve it. In 1993, the trustees projected \ninsolvency by 1999. And, of course, it was the President's 1993 \nbudget--which I voted for and not one Member of the Republican party \nvoted for--that extended the solvency another couple of years until the \nyear 2002.\n  So this insolvency issue is an interesting one. They apparently have \njust discovered that somehow Medicare is going to be insolvent. We must \nmake Medicare changes. But it seems to me those who suggest let us make \nMedicare changes in order to create large savings from which they can \ngive big tax cuts to the rich, they run into a priority problem with \nsome of us who did not decide they wanted to serve in the Senate in \norder to accomplish that.\n  I would like to, while I am on my feet this morning, ask a couple of \nquestions. In making some observations, I would refer to page 7 of this \nbudget resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 13. I have heard, I \nguess, a dozen members of the majority party say this is a balanced \nbudget. And I am going to ask a few of them when they talk about \n[[Page S7041]] that later today about how they reach that point.\n  Again, I refer back to the op-ed piece in the Washington Post this \nmorning, entitled ``Beltway Babble.'' Only that can explain the moniker \nof ``balanced budget'' attached to Senate Concurrent Resolution 13. Let \nme refer my colleagues to page 7, which is the page on which deficits \nare annotated.\n  And the deficits--I will not read them all--go from 1996 to the year \n2002. And in 2002, the deficit is $113 billion. Now if it is a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002--and I have seen charts in fact brought to the \nfloor in which they say 2002 it is zero. In 2002, it is a $113-billion \ndeficit.\n  The only way that one could get to zero with a chart would be to take \nfrom the Social Security trust fund that money which is dedicated for \nSocial Security purposes only and use it to show a zero.\n  But, of course, they do not do that in this budget resolution because \nthe law prevents them from doing that. This is not a balanced budget, \nshould not be called a balanced budget, and in calling it a balanced \nbudget it is not accurately described.\n  It is a budget document that in the year 2002 leaves a $113 billion \nbudget deficit, and I hope to ask some of my colleagues about that in \nthe coming days. I will ask if they will join me. I have some \nadditional recommendations for them, of some revenue increases and some \nspending cuts that will make a truly balanced budget, and I intend to \noffer them.\n  If you want to bring to the floor a product you call a balanced \nbudget, why do you bring to the floor a budget document that on page 7, \nwhen it talks about deficits for the year 2002, has a $113 billion \ndeficit? I am guessing we will vote in 48, 50, 60 hours from now on the \nbudget amendment. Between now and then, if the majority side continues \nto describe this as a balanced budget, perhaps they can find the $113 \nbillion to make it a balanced budget and, if not, I hope to offer them \nsome recommendations to try to be of some help.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my party has had both the burden and the \njoy over the years of constructing and building a lot of things that \nare important to this country. Medicare is a very important program for \nthis country. It has contributed to the lives of a lot of Americans in \na very important way.\n  It is true that it takes considerably less skill to destroy than it \ndoes to build. Someone who was asked once if you had two houses and one \nyou were to build and one you were to tear down, what kind of people \nwould you hire to do each? The answer is clear. To tear down, you hire \nunskilled people; to build, you hire people with skills.\n  We have been builders over the years, and some of that which we have \nbuilt in this country, I am enormously proud of, and on some we have \nprobably gone too far. But I think what makes this country a good \ncountry, a wonderful country and a compassionate country is still worth \nfighting for.\n  I mentioned on the floor a month or so ago about Stanley Newburg, who \ndied in New York City recently. I did not know him, but I read the \nnewspaper report. He died in his eighties. They opened his will.\n  Stanley was a young man when, with his family, he fled Austria and \nthe persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. He came to New York and \nwalked with his daddy on the lower east side peddling fish. They \npeddled fish. They did well. Stanley went to school, college, found a \njob with an aluminum company. He did so well, he ran the aluminum \ncompany, and did so well he bought the aluminum company. He died \nrecently around 80 years old. They opened his will and he left $5.7 \nmillion to the United States of America, with deep gratitude for the \nprivilege of living in this great country.\n  This is a wonderful place for a lot of reasons, and many of them \nrepresent the priorities that we are going to debate on the floor of \nthe Senate around the circumstances of this budget resolution.\n  Yes, let us be critical from time to time, but let us also understand \nwhat makes this a good country and a great country, the kind of things \nthat make America a great place in which to live.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the able Senator for his kindness.\n  Mr. President, for the first time in many years, this Senate has \nbefore it a blueprint for balancing the budget and reducing the \nnational debt. What a refreshing contrast this budget resolution is to \nthe budgets proposed over the past 2 years by the President. Those \nbudgets called for the largest tax increase in history, continued \ndeficits, a significant increase in the debt, substantial growth in \nnondefense Government spending, and dangerous reductions in national \ndefense spending.\n  Mr. President, I support the overall direction of the proposed Senate \nbudget resolution. I commend the chairman and members of the Senate \nBudget Committee for their efforts in bringing a resolution to the \nfloor which controls entitlement spending, restrains the growth of \nGovernment, and eliminates annual deficits.\n  The next step, while maintaining zero deficit budgets, is to reduce \nspending levels in order to lessen the tax burden on families and \nbusinesses of this Nation. If we are to have sustained economic growth, \nGovernment spending must be restrained. A balanced budget amendment and \nline-item veto authority would do much to bring about fiscal \nresponsibility. While earlier this year the Senate failed to pass the \nbalanced budget Amendment, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass that \namendment this year.\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of this debate, I stated that we have \nthe greatest nation on Earth. It provides Americans more freedom, more \njustice, more opportunity, and more hope than any nation has provided \nany people in the history of the world. I repeat, this great country of \nours will be in jeopardy unless we do at least two things. First, we \nmust provide an adequate defense to protect ourselves against the \nenemies who would destroy democracy and freedom. Second, we must put \nour fiscal house in order.\n  With regard to the level of defense spending in this budget \nresolution, I want to point out a few basic facts. The Budget Committee \nrecommendation endorsed the President's budget submission for Defense. \nI remind my colleagues that the President's budget proposal was \nunanimously rejected by the Senate in an earlier vote. Discretionary \nfunding for defense is reduced by $8 billion from 1995 to 1996 and \ncontinues on this downward slide through fiscal year 1998. It is only \nby fiscal year 2002 that the defense budget is brought back to its 1995 \nlevel. I am concerned that this reduced level of spending will not \nsupport the force structure or preserve our national security \ninterests. The most recent request for defense supplemental \nappropriations should be an indication that the proposed budget will \nnot support the required level of training, maintenance, operations and \nmodernization.\n  A part of our national defense requirement is to provide for those \nveterans who have served their country. Those who have fulfilled their \nobligation of citizenship must not be deserted. I am satisfied that \nthis budget protects veterans' benefits and health care.\n  I recognize that total nondefense discretionary spending is reduced \nin this budget resolution. However, I would submit to my colleagues \nthat providing for the common defense of this Nation must be our \nhighest priority. Other Senators may have different views on spending \npriorities. I can assure you that I will have more to say about defense \nspending, and I look forward to that debate in the near future.\n  Further, Mr. President, this budget resolution is a good step in the \neffort to put our fiscal house in order. It provides for restrained \ngrowth in overall Government spending. Because spending grows at a \nlower rate than projected revenue increases, the deficit will be \nreduced each year, and will be finally eliminated in fiscal year 2002.\n  This budget resolution provides for real deficit reduction without \nraising taxes. American families and businesses have carried a heavy \ntax burden to support the appetite of the Federal \n[[Page S7042]] Government. Under present tax policies, Mr. President, \ncapital investment is punished, earnings of senior citizens are \npenalized, consumption is favored over savings, and America's families \nkeep less and less of their earnings. This resolution says ``no'' to \nbalancing the budget by additional taxes.\n  Mr. President, critics of this budget continue to claim the \nresolution contains a tax cut for the wealthy paid for by cuts on the \naged and poor. I will emphasize what has been stated many times on this \nfloor--this resolution does not contain a tax cut. A reserve fund is \nestablished to protect what has been called the fiscal dividend. That \nfund can only be made available for tax reduction after passage of the \nreconciliation bill. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office must \ncertify the amount of the dividend available for tax reduction.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that there will be a dividend to apply to \ntax reduction and reform. Our tax system is not only an economic \nburden, but also an administrative nightmare. The aggravation level of \nthe taxpayers of this country continues to rise. After bringing our \nbudget into balance, we must work toward a fair and simplified tax \nstructure.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment on this budget's treatment of \nvarious programs which I would categorize as economic security items. \nThis resolution provides for increased spending for Medicaid, Medicare, \nother health programs, various income security programs, and Social \nSecurity. It does not abandon this Nation's longstanding tradition of \nhelping those who are truly in need or cannot care for themselves.\n  Finally, funding for administration of justice also increases in this \nbudget. Additional funds are provided for the violent crime reduction \ntrust fund and other Federal law enforcement functions.\n  Mr. President, the Framers of our Constitution clearly established \nthe priorities of our National Government. While we have adapted to \nmeet current needs and circumstances, the underlying principles remain \nconstant--to provide for our common defense, establish justice, and \npromote the general welfare. While this budget resolution is not \nperfect, it puts us on a course to reap the promises of this Nation: \nliberty for ourselves and our posterity. As Thomas Jefferson once said, \n``And to preserve their independence, we must not let our rulers load \nus with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and \nliberty, or profusion and servitude.'' Mr. President, the choice for us \nis clear--let us choose economy and liberty. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Bryan].\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank my friend, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I rise to support the Democratic leadership's amendment to restore \nfunding to the Medicare Program.\n  I believe it is imperative and in the national interest that we \nbalance the budget. I have supported a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution since first embarking on elected public service as a \nmember of the Nevada Legislature in the 1960's. I continued that \nsupport as the attorney general of my State and later as Governor, and \non at least two occasions as a Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  In my view, balancing the budget is critical for our economy to \nremain viable at home and for us to become internationally competitive \nabroad. Mr. President, this budget proposal that we are dealing with \nfails the most fundamental of tasks, and that is a task of fairness.\n  It is rather ironic that it is this month--Older Americans Month--and \nthe month in which the Fourth White House Conference on Aging was held, \nthat the Senate is considering cutting Medicare to the magnitude of \n$256 billion over 7 years. It is the same month in which the other body \nalready passed $280 billion in Medicare cuts. In my view, Mr. \nPresident, this is an unconscionable way to address Medicare reform.\n  Seniors have always been willing to help our country out when asked \nto shoulder the responsibility. They do not want their children and \ngrandchildren to carry the burden of the financial deficit. They are \nwilling to share it, but not unfairly bear the burden of needed revenue \ncuts to balance the Federal budget. Let us be clear, Mr. President, \nthese are Medicare cuts, and the impact will be devastating.\n  But under this budget resolution, the burden is not being fairly \nshared. Seniors are taking a disproportionate hit, and for what? To \nhelp pay for tax cuts to benefit those in our society who are among the \nmost affluent in our country--those citizens making up to $200,000 a \nyear.\n  Seniors throughout this country are dependent upon Medicare to ensure \naccess to the health care services they need. I can certainly \nunderstand, and I think my colleagues will understand, that their real \nfear is that the health care system upon which millions rely may be \ngutted as a consequence of this budget resolution.\n  In 1993, when Medicare faced a significant cut, I introduced an \namendment to the budget reconciliation package of that year to \neliminate a large part of the additional proposed Medicare cuts by \nrepealing section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the so-called \npharmaceutical tax benefit, which provides a tax cut for companies \noperating and hiring workers in U.S. possessions. The amendment failed. \nThe story was the same. Seniors were asked to suffer an unfair portion \nof the burden.\n  Let us not fool ourselves. Seniors understand very well how these \nmassive proposed Medicare cuts are going to directly affect them. They \nunderstand health care cost shifting. They know how increases in \ncopayments, deductibles and monthly premiums hit their pocketbooks. \nThey know how Medicare health care access can decrease after cuts are \nimplemented. And, most importantly, they know these changes will mean \nthat they are going to pay more to get less health care coverage.\n  Seniors also understand, Mr. President, that Medicare costs must be \nreduced and cuts can be made. We all know there is still a significant \namount of fraud and abuse in the Medicare system that siphons off funds \nfrom legitimate health care. Changes can be made in Medicare to achieve \ninformation savings. No doubt, there are ways to contain explosive \nMedicare's growth, but in a much less devastating way than the proposal \nbefore us.\n  In Nevada, I hear poignant stories from many seniors, particularly \nthose living on fixed and limited incomes, where only Medicare can \nensure health care access. For seniors, the fear is very real that \nMedicare will be impacted to such a degree by these proposed cuts that \nthey may no longer be able to afford their Medicare deductibles, \ncopayments and premiums. These cuts translate into about $900 per year \nper senior by the year 2002 in higher premiums, copayments and \ndeductibles. Over the 7 years until 2002, this means an additional cost \nof $3,200 for a single senior, $6,400 for a couple.\n  My State of Nevada is impacted most severely. Nevada is the fastest \ngrowing State in the Nation. It has also just been named the first \nchoice of seniors seeking a retirement location. Nevada's nearly \n200,000 Medicare recipients will soon be joined by thousands more \nseniors. Nevada leads the Nation with the growth projection of 122.7 \npercent for the number of seniors age 65 and over from 1993 to the year \n2020.\n  Many Nevada seniors have already experienced the difficulty in \nfinding a physician willing to take new Medicare patients. The growth \nin the number of seniors seeking medical care coupled with these \nproposed Medicare cuts will certainly impact their access to Nevada's \nhealth care system even further. This will not be a problem unique to \nNevada but one seniors across the Nation will face.\n  Mr. President, Medicare celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. \nWhat an anniversary present some Members of the Senate are providing \nfor the Nation's seniors. For 30 years, seniors have had health care \nservices and have not had to fear that an illness will devastate their \npersonal finances. But now, 30 years later, they have much cause to \nworry about whether Medicare is going to continue to be there for them \nwhen they need it, or whether they are going to be able to afford the \ncost. [[Page S7043]] \n  We all want to assure that seniors in our States will continue to \nhave health care coverage. We can do that if we take a more reasoned \nand rational approach to reforming Medicare to sustain its financial \nviability. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to \nrestore $100 billion of the proposed Medicare cuts as a step for a \nbetter approach. Our seniors deserve no less from us.\n  I yield the floor and thank my distinguished colleague, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with great interest \nand appreciation to the remarks by my colleague from the State of \nNevada, another former Governor, who understands what is going on in \nthe States, who understands the relationship between the State and the \nFederal Government, and above everything else, recognizes and realizes \nthe obligation that we have to act fairly in our deliberations, \ndiscussions and bill-passing here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Previous to the remarks of the former Governor from Nevada, now \nSenator from Nevada, we heard an excellent presentation by my colleague \nfrom the State of North Dakota.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is a former tax commissioner of that \nState. He knows that State. He knows rural America very, very well. \nSince he has come to the U.S. Senate, we have come to appreciate and \nrespect the dedicated talents that he has with regard to the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the State government.\n  Certainly, I thought that the excellent presentation he made with \nregard to the statements about the budget submitted by the majority in \nboth the House and the Senate deliberations are absolutely a travesty. \nKevin Phillips, a noted Republican columnist and spokesman, hit it \nright on the head.\n  I have some remarks I would like to make, but I recognize that we are \ntrying to move evenly back and forth. I certainly ask the managing \nRepublican on the Senate side now whether or not he is waiting to \nspeak, or is it his desire that the Senator from Nebraska continue on \nhis remarks that I would like to make?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I do intend to speak, but I am happy to \nhave the Senator from Nebraska proceed, and I will speak after the \nSenator from Nebraska has completed his statement.\n  Mr. EXON. I see the Senator from Washington is on the floor. He will \nseek recognition, is that correct, at an appropriate time?\n  Mr. GORTON. At an appropriate time.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say to my colleague, it would only be fair for him \nto proceed at this time, and I will follow. Then he has the disposition \non his side for the next speaker, to keep it in the regular order.\n  Mr. GREGG. If that is the wish of the Senator from Nebraska, that is \ncertainly acceptable to me. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I want to address a couple of comments that have been \nmade here relative to both Medicare and also to tax elements of this \nbudget because I think there have been attempts to address the issue, \nbut I do not think they have been accurate in their reflection of \nexactly what is going to happen.\n  The Medicare trust fund is the issue. Its solvency is the issue. Now, \nthe definition of solvency within the Medicare trust fund was not \ncreated by myself or members of the Budget Committee, but created by \nthe trustees of the trust fund.\n  They have testified, and there have been charts on this floor \nreflecting this fact, and there has been discussion of this, that the \nMedicare trust fund could well be insolvent and is going to go \ninsolvent as of the year 2002.\n  What have we received as a response to this insolvency from the other \nside of the aisle? Essentially, we have seen nothing--no proposals at \nall. We have seen them, however, attack with rather significant \nenthusiasm the proposals coming from this side of the aisle. They have \nattacked the number which we are proposing to address in this budget in \norder to try to correct the trust fund problem as being an outrageously \nhigh number, a number they have never heard of, a number they cannot \nconceive of, $256 billion over 7 years.\n  I think we need to put that number in some context. If we look at the \ntrustees' report, the trustees of the Medicare trust fund, ironically, \nfour of whom happen to be members of this administration, including the \nSecretary of HHS and the Treasury Secretary, that trustees' report says \nthat in order to maintain the solvency of the trust fund on an \nactuarial basis of 25 years, which is the minimum that they suggest, an \nadjustment in the trust fund must occur of approximately $262 billion, \nnot over 7 years but over 5 years.\n  We are talking about $256 billion over 7 years. We are coming in at a \nlevel which is significantly below, significantly below, what the \ntrustees are saying--the trustees being Donna Shalala and Secretary \nRubin--is necessary to obtain actuarial solvency of the trust fund.\n  What does that mean, actuarial solvency? It sounds like a big name, a \ntechnical phraseology. What it means, quite simply, is if the senior \ncitizens of this country are going to have the ability to have health \ncare insurance, they have to have a health care trust fund which is \nsolvent.\n  The trustees have said, as of the year 2002, there will be no more \ninsurance trust fund because there will be no money in the trust fund. \nIn order to have money in the trust fund and to have it for a period of \n25 years, they need to have an adjustment of $262 billion over 5 years.\n  So the number that we have put forward as our goal for adjusting the \ntrust fund is a very reasonable number and is one this is absolutely \nnecessary at a bare minimum to assure that the senior citizens of this \ncountry actually have health insurance, something which the other side \nseems to be just ignoring.\n  They come down here and say we cannot take this money and transfer it \nto that account, and this money from that account. But nobody mentions \nthat the trust fund is going broke. The President's people have said \nthat in their report.\n  What does this number mean, again, in terms of the overall context of \nthe Medicare Program? Does it mean the Medicare Program is being cut? \nThat we are talking about adjusting the trust fund, the funds flowing \ninto the trust fund, and talking about adjusting Medicare by this \namount of $256 billion, does it mean the Medicare Program is being cut? \nThat is a big number. It sounds like it might be. No, it does not mean \nthat at all. It does not mean that at all.\n  What we are talking about with that number is allowing the spending \non Medicare payments in this country to increase by 7 percent over the \nperiod of that 7-year period.\n  A Medicare beneficiary who today receives $4,350 per beneficiary \nwill, in the year 2002, be receiving $6,300 per beneficiary. There is \nno cut there.\n  In fact, in the year 2002, the amount of money that we will spend on \nthe Medicare System in this country will be $96 billion more than what \nwe are spending today. What we are talking about here is the fact that \nthe Medicare trust fund and the spending for Medicare is increasing so \nfast--10\\1/2\\ percent annually--that we simply cannot afford it. It is \nbankrupting itself. As a result, there will be no insurance for senior \ncitizens.\n  So what we are suggesting is we take the rate of growth of Medicare \nspending and reduce it to something we can afford. We are not talking \nabout cutting it. We are not talking about even reducing it to the rate \nof growth of health care in the private sector, which last year \npremiums dropped by 1.9 percent in the private sector. We are talking \nabout allowing an annual increase of 7 percent in the Medicare trust \nfund, which works out to a huge amount of increased spending on \nMedicare over the next 7 years.\n  It works out to a solvent Medicare System, one that is not insolvent, \none where seniors will actually be getting Medicare and have dollars \navailable for Medicare rather than not be getting dollars available for \nMedicare, because the trust fund would be insolvent if it continues to \ngrow at its present rate.\n  So this discussion of the attempts by our side to address the \nMedicare trust fund by putting it into balance and by reducing the rate \nof growth of the Medicare spending in this country and in this \nGovernment is purely political. In fact, it is so political that if we \nlook at the President's own statements from a year ago, we realize that \nhe agreed [[Page S7044]] with Republicans, and today his party and his \nadministration does not seem to any longer give credence to what they \nsaid just a year ago.\n  The President said a year ago today, Medicare and Medicaid are going \nup three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two \ntimes the rate of inflation.\n  My goodness gracious, that is exactly the Republican proposal. We \ntook the President at his word last year. We took his proposal, and we \nhave a rate of growth of Medicare which is two times the rate of \ninflation.\n  But suddenly it is a horrible event. Not only did the President say \nthat, but even Mrs. Clinton said that. She said that the rate of growth \nwas too much and that we had to reduce it. More importantly, she said \nthat cutting the rate of growth was not a cut in Medicare. She agrees \nwith this side. Even Ira Magaziner agreed with.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield for a question, sir.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Hampshire that \nI find these arguments intriguing and, of course, persuasive.\n  He and I have talked in private about this for some time, but I \nwonder if he would, for a moment, take the other half of the question. \nWe have a very specific amendment in front of the Senate, a $100 \nbillion amendment, coming out of the dividends which we firmly believe \nand the CBO says will arise out of balancing the budget because we have \na better economy in the United States.\n  Now, the proponents of the amendment do not want a balanced budget. \nThey have not come up with a proposal for a balanced budget. But they \ndo want to spend most of that dividend in the form of this amendment, \nsome $100 billion, dividing it among part A and part B of Medicare--\npart A the hospital insurance portion being that portion which will go \nbankrupt in the year 2002.\n  Let us assume, I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, that half of \nthat money, $50 billion, just comes in the form of a cash infusion into \npart A of Medicare but without any other changes because we have not \nheard of any other changes the other side proposes. What would that do \nwith respect to the projected bankruptcy of Medicare part A in the year \n2002?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Washington has raised a very \nvalid point. What the Senator from Washington is pointing out is, first \noff, the other side of the aisle has no budget, no proposals at all in \nthe area of entitlement reform. Second, what they are proposing is to \ntake what will be basically a dividend as a result of interest rates \ndropping and just take money and throw it at the system, a system which \nis fundamentally flawed, a system which is growing at twice the rate of \ninflation, and a system which cannot maintain itself.\n  So the practical implications of what they are proposing is it will \nhave no significant impact on the solvency of the trust fund because it \nwill put into place no attitudes or reforms which will reduce that rate \nof growth of the trust fund. And what the trustees told us when they \ntestified before the Budget Committee, of which the Senator from \nWashington is a member, and I know he is an active participant at these \nhearings, was there had to be fundamental reform of the trust fund, in \nthe way we deliver health care, in order to get it into actuarial \nbalance.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, is it not true that \nthe trustees said, ``You can either make changes in the rules with \nrespect to eligibility or, alternatively, you can increase the payroll \ntax?'' Am I correct in feeling that they really did not talk about a \none-time general funded infusion into the system of cash money, without \nany reforms on the other two scores at all?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Washington is absolutely correct. They \ndid not talk about a one-time cash infusion of, say, $50 billion into \nthe fund because they recognized that will do nothing to correct the \nproblems which they were highlighting to us. They were saying there was \nan urgent need for fundamental reform of the manner in which the trust \nhealth care is delivered under the Medicare system, in order to get \nthis into actuarial balance. And a one-time cash payment is not going \nto solve the problem. That is basically, I presume, why they never \nconceived of the idea, because they are charged with correcting the \nproblem, not with just the political response to the problem.\n  Mr. GORTON. So the proposal we have before us at the present time \nwill not cure any of the ills of Medicare part A? And may very well \nunbalance the budget, because it is a contingent amount of money, \ncontingent on our balancing the budget, and certainly will help prevent \nany kind of dividend in the form of lower taxes to middle-class working \nAmericans; is that not correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Washington is absolutely correct in all \nthose statements and assumptions, in my opinion.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia for a question.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It will be a question.\n  Taking off from what the Senator from Washington has indicated, does \nit not strike the Senator, in looking at the amendment of Senator \nLautenberg and myself, that we are not in any way pretending that this \n$100 billion is going to cure the trust fund problem? What we are \ntrying to establish is a matter of priorities. Obviously $100 billion \nis not going to solve the problem, but neither does the Republican \nbudget resolution before us; $100 billion kept in Medicare, kept in \nhealth care funds, is a statement of what is important as opposed to \nputting it into some reserve fund which I believe most people in this \nChamber believe is going to be used for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  So would the Senator not agree that by putting $100 billion back into \nhealth care, we are not so much saying this is going to solve the \nproblem, because obviously it is not--neither does the Republican \nbudget resolution--but is it not a matter of keeping the money in \nMedicare and not spending it on other uses?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would have to say to the Senator from West Virginia I \nwould have two concerns about that representation.\n  The first is this: I do not think, and I believe the numbers prove \nthis to be accurate, that you can get our budget under control, that \nyou can get the budget of the Federal Government under control, unless \nyou address and fundamentally reform the health care function of \nFederal spending. Because 55 percent of entitlement spending, \nindependent of Social Security which we are not going to address, is \nhealth care driven. And, thus, I do not happen to think that you \nresolve this problem unless you take a hard look at it and you do the \nwork and you produce a reform that is going to change the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare spending from 10.5 percent that it presently has in \nMedicaid, from the 10.5 percent which it presently has, to a rate of \ngrowth which we can tolerate which is about 7 percent in Medicare and \nprobably about 5 percent in Medicaid. And those numbers are the numbers \nthat we use in this budget resolution and I think they are reasonable \nfor that reason.\n  The second part of the Senator's assumption would be, ``Well, even if \nthose numbers are reasonable, we should still put this money into \nMedicare and Medicaid, if it is available, if you can obtain it without \ndoing the reform''--which I do not think you can. In other words, I do \nnot think you can get the 2 percent savings in interest rates which \ncomes from getting a balanced budget, unless you address the health \ncare function which produces the balanced budget.\n  But even if you get that transfer, what you are saying is that extra \n$100 billion should go in there and we should have it on top of the \nreform, of what would occur from reform. So you are talking about \nactually encouraging a rate of growth in the health care accounts which \nwould exceed what I think we have to have as a rate of growth in order \nto have balance in the budget.\n  The second reservation I would have about the Senator's point is \nthis. There has been all this talk. I think every person on that side \nwho has gotten up has said we are going to take this $170 billion, \nwhich we are told we are going to get. We are not sure we are going to \nget it. CBO says they will score this if we get to a balanced budget \nglidepath [[Page S7045]] and it results from the fact that interest \nrates go down. It is not a result of any cut in spending. It results \nfrom interest rates dropping. We are going to take this $170 billion \nand we are going to transfer it back to the taxpayers. We are going to \nsay this is your money to begin with. You ought to get to keep it. You \nought to get some benefit out of us balancing the budget.\n  Everybody has gotten up on that side and said that is a benefit for \nthe rich. You are taking from some group--whether it has been--one \ngroup has been children, one group has been unwed mothers and pregnant \nmothers, and another group has been the elderly--and you are giving it \nto the rich.\n  This resolution says that 90 percent of any tax cut--90 percent of \nany tax cut--has to go with people with incomes under $100,000.\n  Maybe there he has a new definition of wealthy in this country, but \npeople with incomes under $100,000 I do not find, definitionally, as \nwealthy. So I believe first we should make the tax cut if we get this \ndividend, because I think it will run to the benefit of people who are \ntoday paying the price of running this Government, which is out of \ncontrol. And, second, since 90 percent of it is going to go to people \nwith incomes under $100,000 I do not happen to believe that is a \ntransfer to the wealthy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say again to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwhat he is suggesting is that we take Medicare money, $256 billion, and \ncuts in Medicaid, and use those health care cuts to pay for tax cuts.\n  Both the Republican CBO Director and the past Democratic CBO Director \nhad a common view on this. The only way to achieve short term savings \nof this magnitude is to cut doctor and hospital payments and make \nseniors pay more. Up to half of a senior's Social Security cost-of-\nliving increase would be used to pay for this increase in the cost of \nMedicare. So you are not only getting them on Medicare but you are \ngetting them on Social Security. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. No. I would say to the Senator from West Virginia that is \nnot correct.\n  First, as the Senator from West Virginia knows, the manner in which \nthese savings are going to be accomplished--remember our savings rate \nof growth is not cut--is up to the Finance Committee. But let me \nsuggest some of the ideas we put forward, those of us working in this \narea, the Medicare area, would have affected not the poor senior but \nwould have affected the wealthy senior.\n  I, for example, have a great deal of problem with the fact that under \nthe part B premium you have a 75-percent subsidy of the rich in this \ncountry by the poor and the moderate-income individuals in this \ncountry. Under the part B premium, as the Senator from West Virginia \nknows, a person who is working 60 hours a week, he or his wife or both \nof them working at, say, the local restaurant, they have to pay into \nthe general fund with their taxes. And then a person, say the top 500 \nretirees from IBM last year, they opt for the part B premium.\n  They only pay 25 or 30 percent, depending on the year of the cost of \nthat premium. And the other 75 or 70 percent is covered by general \nfunds. So John and Mary Jones, who are working 60 hours a week down at \nthe local restaurant, are paying into the general fund, and then their \nmoney is being taken to pay for the top 500 retirees last year from IBM \nwho opted for part B premium.\n  I happen to think that is wrong. I think we should affluence test the \npart B premium. Yes, that means some senior citizens are going to pay \nmore. But I happen to think there are some folks in the senior citizen \ncommunity who are doing quite well, who are quite wealthy, and who \nunder the part B premium, should be paying a fair share.\n  So there are a lot of different ways that the adjustments in rate of \ngrowth can be accomplished.\n  I also happen to support something which I call choice care where we \nencourage seniors to move into a managed care, PPO-type of environment \nwhere I think we can get a fixed rate of cost on the rate of inflation \nin the health care system. In that system, I think seniors are going to \nget more in the way of health care probably for less, and in the \nprocess I believe we can get some controls over health care.\n  But I did want to address one other point. I know the Senator from \nNebraska wants to get started on his speech.\n  Let me mention quickly this tax issue which I think is very important \nto point out, which is that under this resolution--you can talk about \nthe House resolution. We are not going to vote on the House resolution \nright now. Maybe we will in the conference. I do not know what will \nhappen in the conference. I am for the Senate position. I think Senator \nDomenici has done an exceptional job with the budget that leads us to \nbalance for the first time in 25 years.\n  But under our resolution it says that 90 percent of any tax cut \nbenefit will go to people with incomes under $100,000. So I think we \nshould have an end to all of this discussion of, ``Oh, this is just a \ntransfer to the wealthy'' because that is a flawed definition of \nwealthy if the other party is going to suddenly assume that everybody \nunder $100,000 is wealthy. Then we have a new definition of wealthy in \nthis country.\n  But what I wanted to end up on is the reasons we need to have this \nbalanced budget amendment. We have heard a lot about it. We have heard \nit from all sorts of scenarios around here.\n  But I would like to just refer people to an individual who I consider \nto be the leading historian of our time, a man named Paul Johnson. I \nthink he teaches at Oxford. I know he is an English historian. He has \nwritten a number of really extraordinary histories of the 20th century, \nincluding ``Modern Times,'' ``Birth of the Modern,'' and a variety of \njust extraordinary pieces that are incredibly insightful. He wrote a \npiece for the New York Times, some of which I agree with and some of \nwhich I do not agree with. But the basic thrust of it was incredibly \nthoughtful, as he often is on what is wrong with this country if we \ncontinue to run up this debt.\n  Let me just quote a little bit from this.\n\n       The United States is running the most costly welfare state \n     in history, as well as acting reluctantly, not consistently \n     but certainly expensively, as the world's policeman, and even \n     to eliminate the deficit, let alone reduce the debt, the \n     spending will have to fundamentally be reformed. This will \n     mean, among other things, ending the welfare state as it \n     exists today. It may not be as hard as some people think. \n     After all, it is scarcely a generation old.\n\n  The theme of his piece here is if the United States continues to run \nits present debt, it will collapse or it will be in a horrendous \nsituation.\n  He points out that we are now ready to act as a country. He finds \nthis unique, and it is a special time, and the time to do it is right \nnow.\n  He says there are two things that reflect the fact that he thinks we \nare ready to act. The first is sufficient congressional support, and \nthat has already been achieved, he says. And the second is a \nprerequisite of popular consensus. Looking at the United States from \nEngland, he is determined that is the case, and he is a very astute \nfellow. Like de Tocqueville, maybe he has a better sense of where we \nare historically than we have ourselves.\n\n       Congress is ready for reform, and so are the people. But \n     history shows that neither means much without a dedicated \n     leader.\n\n  I am quoting here:\n\n       Normally, one would expect such leadership to come from the \n     President. In the past, the White House has shown a much \n     greater concern for financial probity than Capitol Hill. When \n     Congress passed Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction package \n     during his first year in office, it did so with hardly a vote \n     to spare in both Houses. But Mr. Clinton is not a leader, \n     though he can sometimes be persuaded that it is in his \n     interest to be an energetic follower. No leadership will have \n     to come--\n\n  From the Congress. That is paraphrasing, ``the Congress.'' He uses \nanother phrase.\n  The fact is that we as a Congress have the obligation to do this now. \nWe have the obligation to step up and put forth and present, as we have \nin the past, the budget resolution to come to a balance.\n  I want to congratulate again Senator Domenici for having done that, \nand I believe fervently in doing this we will also reform fundamentally \nthe Medicare system so that it will be solvent, and so that our senior \ncitizens will be assured of first-class health care insurance--not for \nthe next 7 years, but for as far as the eye can see. [[Page S7046]] \n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield such time to myself as I may need.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening with keen interest, of course, \nto this entire debate which we started last week and again this \nmorning. The same theme keeps coming through time and time again.\n  Once again, I would like to correct the impression that my friends on \nthat side of the aisle seem to be giving, or not giving, depending upon \nyour point of view, to what is the majority opinion of those of us on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  Listening to the rhetoric from the Republican side, you would tend to \nbelieve that we were against any balanced budget; that we do not want \nto be players in the game; that we simply do not seem to realize that \nthe Republicans have stepped up to the plate, and they have by bringing \nforth a resolution that I agree took some courage. I have said that \ntime and time again in the Budget Committee and on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The problem that I have with the spin that the Republicans are trying \nto give to this entire proposition is that they and they only are the \nonly ones that care about balancing the budget of the United States of \nAmerica. I think the record clearly shows that there are many of us on \nthis side who have been trying to do that for a long, long time and we \nare simply trying to make some improvements, some improvements, some \nfine tuning, some minor surgery, if you will, with regard to the \ndocument that has been presented to us by the majority through the \nmight and power of the majority in the Congress of the United States.\n  I, therefore, emphasize once again--let me make this statement that I \ndo not think has been made before, and I do not propose to speak for \nall on this side of the aisle--that I believe that the Republican \nsteamroller, the Republican majority has rejected every one of even the \nminor changes that we offered in the Budget Committee, and have every \nindication of saying no, no, no to anything that we even suggest here. \nThey might be surprised if they would simply realize and recognize what \nwe are constructively trying to do on this side of the aisle despite \ntheir protestations to the contrary.\n  What we are saying is that we recognize some significant cuts have to \nbe made, but we simply say to our Republican colleagues, who are in \ncontrol, why not reason together? Why not come out with a bipartisan \nbudget so that we all have to share in the pain, if you will, of making \nsome cuts in many programs that otherwise we would not like to cut.\n  To put it another way, Mr. President, I believe, if the Republicans \nwould accept the amendments, the constructive, well-reasoned, well-\nthought-out amendments not to eliminate the cuts but just to \nredistribute the cuts within their framework, within their totals, \nwithout disturbing the goal of 2002 to balance the unified budget, \nwithout making any major changes to get to that end result, we might be \nwilling to support their budget. We Democrats are simply saying why not \nlisten to us and listen to what we are saying, especially about \nMedicare.\n  Now, the hit that Medicare is taking is unconscionable when you \nrecognize and realize the results of what it will do. I have heard time \nand time again from that side of the aisle, and I heard it again this \nmorning, there has been no proposal from this side. That is simply not \ntrue. Time and time again in the Budget Committee and on this floor--\nand you are going to see more of it in the next couple of days--we have \nhad a whole series of amendments.\n  What the we are basically saying, Mr. President, is that the \nRepublicans should recognize and realize, with all of the difficulty, \nwith all the cuts that we are going to have to make to reach that \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, there is no way that any reasonable \nperson, whether they figure with a red pen or a blue pen or a black pen \nor whatever colored pen, can come to any logical way to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 and have a tax cut. There is no way to make all \nthe painful cuts we are going to have to make--and we are ready to \nstand in support of some of those--if you are going to have a tax cut. \nAnd the tax cut is the tail that is wagging the dog on this Republican \nbudget.\n  I do not wish to call the Republican budget a dog because there are \nsome good things in that budget. I simply say that we can make it a \nwhole lot better if you will simply listen to the reasoned approach and \nproposals we are making.\n  Putting it another way, you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. \nYou cannot reach that deficit reduction proposal and balance the budget \nby the year 2002 if you are going to have the massive tax cuts passed \nin the House of Representatives. It is a sham. It will not work. \nAnybody who knows anything about the budget knows it will not work. And \neven if it should work by the year 2002, which it cannot in my opinion, \nbecause of the magnitude of the huge tax cut passed in the House of \nRepresentatives that benefits the wealthy we would immediately \nunbalance the budget in the next 2, 3, 4, or 5 years beyond that.\n  My colleague from North Dakota pointed out very well what Republican \ncommentator Kevin Phillips had to say about these two Republican \nbudgets, one in the House and one in the Senate. The question that he \nasked is, who are the winners and who are the losers?\n  Well, we are all going to be winners if we get to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002, but there obviously are going to be some losers, and \nalthough some of those losers are the traditional part of society that \nthe Democratic Party has shepherded and protected to some degree, we \nare willing to make those sacrifices.\n  I simply say to my Republican colleagues on that side of the aisle, \nif you would take the $170 billion you have in that kitty for a tax \ncut--and despite the newspaper stories and commentators to the \ncontrary, there is a tax cut in the Domenici package. Senator Domenici \nhimself in the Budget Committee deliberations in public said the $170 \nbillion that likely will come along sometime later as a dividend, if \nyou will, from the cuts that are being made can be used and used only \nfor a tax cut. It is not in the budget right now, but it is in the \nbudget on down the line and it is so identified. I simply say to those \non that side of the aisle, if you would come to reason, if you would \ntry to work with us, if you would give up the $170 billion, or most of \nit, to not eliminate but alleviate what we think is an unfair cut on \nmany programs that affect the most fragile of our society, then you \nwould be surprised how many votes there would likely be when this \nbudget resolution passes the Senate. I would say 60, 65.\n  But I simply say that absent that, absent the ability of the \nRepublicans to give, absent the ability of the Republicans to keep \ntheir house in order and to keep their votes in line, maybe they dare \nnot change the dotting of a single ``i'' or the crossing of a single \n``t.'' I appeal once again as I did when we started this debate. Let us \ntry harder on a nonpartisan position.\n  And then I have heard, Mr. President, this talk about, oh, there is \nnothing wrong with giving the people a $170 billion tax cut as a \nreward, I guess, for the sacrifices that they have to make to balance \nthe budget. I think that is a simple direct case of wanting your cake \nand eating it, too. We should not have to reward the people of the \nUnited States, and I do not believe the people of the United States--\nDemocrats, Republicans, independents, call them what you will--believe \nthey need to be bought off by a promised tax cut to make the hard \nchoices to balance the budget by the year 2002. That is a case which I \nthink has not been made well by those on that side of the aisle, but \nthey say it so many times some people may begin to think they really \nare saying something important.\n  There has been a lot of talk about Medicare. Medicare and the hit \nMedicare is taking is of much concern to those of us on this side of \nthe aisle. There has been lots of talk as evidenced by the recent \nexchange between the Senator from West Virginia and the present manager \non that side of the aisle.\n  The basic point seems to be that you have to go along with their \nrecommendations, with their numbers in their fashion because otherwise \nthe Medicare trust fund is going to go broke by the year 2002. \n[[Page S7047]] \n  We have to do something about it. We all recognize that it is a \nproblem. But if you will look into the details, or lack thereof, of \nwhat the Republican majority is proposing, you will see that even if we \nwould accept their proposal lock, stock, and barrel, the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund would only be extended to the year 2005, or 3 \nmore years.\n  And yet to listen to their rhetoric you would believe, if we accept \ntheir budget proposal lock, stock, and barrel, that we would solve that \nproblem as well. We do not have enough figures to know whether or not \nif their proposal was enacted, because it is so lacking in details, it \nwould continue to make the Medicare trust fund solvent to the year \n2005, 3 years beyond the date that it otherwise is expected to be \ninsolvent.\n  I simply say that no specifics are available to us. But I wish to \nemphasize once and for all, if I can, the fact that even if we accept \nthe Republican budget we have not solved the long-term solvency of the \nMedicare system.\n  Why are we suggesting, Mr. President, without violating the 2002 date \nto balance the budget without raising taxes, without doing anything \nelse that the Republicans would generally think would be harmful, why \nare we saying that the $250 billion to $280 billion cut in the next 7 \nyears would be so devastating? And why is it that those of us on this \nside are saying we recognize some reductions are going to have to be \nmade in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs but we are simply saying you \nare going at this without thoroughly thinking it through?\n  You are going to cause devastation to the system in a whole series of \nareas, primarily in the rural areas of America which, in this Senator's \nopinion, have too few representatives in this body and certainly too \nfew in the House of Representatives.\n  To bring this point home, I would like now to read an excellent \narticle that was referred to originally this morning earlier in debate \nby the Senator from Maine. It was a New York Times article of \nyesterday, May 21, 1995, under the byline of Robin Toner.\n  I want to read this into the Record because it basically proves, \nbeyond any question of a doubt, that the point that myself and others--\nSenator Rockefeller is included in that; and the Senator from New \nJersey has been very active--are trying to say as to what is wrong with \nthe indiscriminate slashing or crushing of the Medicare and Medicaid \nproposals without having thought through just exactly what we are \ndoing.\n  The referenced article that I will now read is headlined ``Medicare \nTalk Brings Anxiety to the Heartland.''\n       To Mike Brown, who runs a tiny county health care center \n     about an hour's drive from here, the $250 billion or so in \n     Medicare savings that Congressional Republicans want to \n     achieve over the next seven years is more than an abstract \n     figure in a Washington budget battle.\n       Like many rural hospitals, his center, Saunders County \n     Health Services, ministers to a population that is largely \n     elderly and exceedingly dependent on Medicare. The health \n     insurance program for the elderly accounts for about 40 \n     percent of hospital revenue nationally but for more than 80 \n     percent of the hospital revenue at the Saunders County \n     center.\n       As a result, Mr. Brown said one cool spring morning this \n     week, he fears that new spending controls on Medicare would \n     have a significant impact on his 30-bed hospital. It lost \n     money last year, hopes to break even this year and has been \n     struggling since the mid-1980's, he said.\n       In a little burst of feeling amid the dry policy talk, he \n     argues that his center has ``real value'' for its aging \n     population, often cared for by aging children, for whom the \n     drive to Lincoln or Omaha for regular treatments would loom \n     large.\n       When planners and politicians talk about potential \n     ``disruptions in the health care delivery system'' from the \n     new Republican budgets, they are often talking about \n     hospitals like this one. But even in Omaha, in the high-rise \n     temples of medicine that dwarf the one-story Saunders County \n     hospital, the Medicare policies being created in Washington \n     instill anxiety and frustration.\n       Hospital administrators say that they are not trying to \n     preserve or defend the status quo and that they recognize the \n     need for restructuring of the Medicare program. But they say \n     they have already taken numerous steps to control their \n     costs, and they bristle at the idea that there is still a \n     great deal of easily identifiable fat to be quickly wrung \n     from the system. Even here in Omaha, a comparative latecomer \n     to the competitive new world of managed care, hospitals say \n     they have felt increasing cost pressures from private payers \n     in recent years.\n       Given all these forces in play, and the expectation of new \n     constraints on Medicaid at least as tough as those proposed \n     for Medicare, several hospital administrators here said they \n     feared that Congress was moving too far, too fast.\n       ``I'm confident that we can come up with a better system \n     for caring for Medicare patients and doing it in a more \n     economical fashion,'' said Charles J. Marr, president and \n     chief executive officer of Immanuel Medical Center, a \n     nonprofit hospital sponsored by the Lutheran Church of\n      America. ``But they shouldn't throw us into a tailspin and \n     force that change over a short period of time.''\n       John M. Fraser, chief operating officer of Methodist \n     Hospital, across town, noted more than once during an \n     interview that he is a Republican and said both deficit \n     reduction and a Medicare overhaul were valid issues.\n       ``But you don't do this in six months on Capitol Hill,'' he \n     added.\n       Republicans, of course, maintain that extracting these \n     savings from Medicare is essential to insuring the continued \n     solvency of the 30-year-old program. Under their plans, they \n     note, spending on Medicare would continue to grow, just at a \n     slower rate than the current average of about 10 percent a \n     year.\n       Representative Jon Christensen, a Republican freshman who \n     represents Omaha, and who voted for the House Republican \n     budget this week, declined an interview request. But he \n     issued a statement defending the plan.\n       ``The simple fact is that Medicare is going bankrupt,'' he \n     said. ``Would it hurt Nebraska's hospitals less to let the \n     Medicare program collapse?''\n       Many health planners dispute Mr. Christensen's argument \n     that this level of reduction projected spending is necessary \n     for the sake of the Medicare system. Democrats, for their \n     part, assert that Republicans are simply using Medicare as a \n     piggy bank to pay for their political promises of a balanced \n     budget and a tax cut.\n       Nobody yet knows how these spending reductions will be \n     achieved or how much they will affect payments to hospitals; \n     that will be resolved later this summer.\n       What is clear, away from Washington, is not only how \n     enmeshed Medicare is in the health care system but also how \n     vulnerable that system is to large-scale changes in the \n     program.\n       Here in Nebraska, state officials say, it is the rural \n     health care system that is most ``fragile,'' as Dr. Mark \n     Horton, the state director of health, put it. Eighteen \n     percent of Nebraska's rural population is over 65; many of \n     the hospitals in rural areas, and many of the primary care \n     physicians there, are exceedingly reliant on the Medicare \n     program. Tinkering with its complicated reimbursement system, \n     which some hospital officials say already makes it hard for \n     them to recover the cost of rendering care, can thus have a \n     major effect on the overall health system, officials say.\n       ``You could argue that maybe some of these hospitals should \n     close,'' said Dr. Horton. On the other hand, he added, these \n     small community hospitals are often the most cost-effective \n     places to treat common ailments like pneumonia.\n       Mr. Brown's center, which also depends on a county levy, \n     includes a small attached nursing home, an outpatient clinic \n     and a home health care agency. Its hospital beds are \n     generally filled with patients suffering from pneumonia and \n     other heart and lung ailments that afflict the aged, he said. \n     There is little flexibility in his budget. ``When you don't \n     have any private paying patients to speak of,'' he said, \n     ``there's no place to shift the cost to.''\n       Harlan M. Heald, president of the Nebraska Association of \n     Health Systems, said of the expected round of spending \n     reductions, ``The more Medicare patients you have in your \n     mix, the more it's like that old Nebraska farm joke: if \n     you're not making back your costs, you're not going to make \n     it up in volume.''\n       C. Edward Schwartz, chief executive officer of the \n     University of Nebraska Medical Center, works at the opposite \n     end of the spectrum from Mr. Brown. Mr. Schwartz runs an \n     academic medical center that prides itself on its liver, \n     bone-marrow and pancreas transplant programs. Yet he too \n     describes Medicare as ``absolutely crucial'' to his \n     institution's future, in part because the program recognizes \n     and helps subsidize the cost of medical education at such \n     centers.\n       Mr. Schwartz argues that the people who should be most \n     alarmed about new controls on Medicare are private employers, \n     because of the prospect that hospitals will be driven to \n     renewed cost shifting. ``We have to be honest with \n     ourselves,'' he said, adding, ``I thought business was well \n     past the point of wanting to pay the taxes Congress didn't \n     want to collect.''\n       The great debate over Medicare, in short, looks decidedly \n     less abstract at the grass roots, a fact that opponents of \n     the Republican proposal are counting on in the months to \n     come.\n       Diana Smalley, chief executive officer of Midlands \n     Community Hospital, a 208-bed center south of Omaha, said she \n     was looking forward to putting together a health forum for \n     Representative Christensen, whom she met at a recent function \n     of the local Chamber of Commerce, As head of the chamber, \n     Mrs. Smalley is more than able to brief her Congressman on \n     the importance of her hospital to the community's economy. It \n     is the largest civilian employer in the county, she noted.\n       ``I'd rather work with him if I can,'' she said. ``I \n     admire, I guess you could say, the zeal that we see to get \n     things done. I just worry about the time frame.''\n\n   [[Page S7048]] That is the end of that excellent article which sums \nup the disastrous effect that the size of the Medicare cuts, as \nrecommended by the Republicans, would have not only on Nebraska but \nevery other State in the Union that has a sizable rural population.\n  Mr. President, I will have other things to say with regard to what I \nthink is an ill-advised policy. I offer, again, to try and sit down \nwith the Republicans and work something out. I think it would be far \nbetter if we had a bipartisan compromise that embraced many of the hard \nchoices that the Republicans are making.\n  I will simply say that if the Republicans can come and reason with us \ntogether, even though we are in the minority, if the Republicans will \nrenounce lock, stock, and barrel any kind of a tax cut until we \nactually balance the budget in the year 2002 then we would take a giant \nstep toward a true bipartisan and a tough budget that is going to hurt.\n  I appeal once again for the Republicans simply to recognize and \nrealize that the proposals we are making in the amendment before us do \nnot eliminate the cuts to the Medicare system. The amendment simply \nreduces those cuts and makes them barely palatable by alleviating $100 \nbillion of those cuts and taking that money from the $170 billion tax \ncut kitty that is clearly represented in the Republican budget.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield myself such time \nfrom Senator Domenici's time as I may use.\n  First, by direction of the leadership, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote now scheduled for 3:15 p.m. be advanced to 3:10 p.m.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have no objection to that and agree to \nthat on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, too far too fast. That now is what we \nhear. We are going too far too fast in our quest to balance the budget \nand to save the Medicare trust fund.\n  Only here, this budget, if passed and enforced, promises a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002. As I count, that is 7 years from now, but too \nfar too fast, we are being told. Better perhaps the proposal of the \nPresident for budget deficits of $200 billion to $300 billion a year, \nall the way through the year 2002, with no promise of any reduction? \nThat, presumably, is not too far too fast.\n  But, Mr. President, it is too disastrous for our country and too \nimmoral for the children and grandchildren who will have that bill \nloaded on their backs.\n  Too far too fast to save a Medicare trust fund for hospital insurance \nscheduled to be bankrupt in the year 2002? Too far too fast to do that \nnow? Will it be easier next year or 3 years from now or when the \nbankruptcy actually arrives?\n  This amendment is consistent with the view that we are going too far \ntoo fast. This proposes to cut $100 billion out of the reduced spending \ngrowth in one particular program, and then it will be followed by \namendments to cut back on spending reductions or a slowing in spending \ngrowth of additional tens or perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars, \nall consistent with the view that we are going too far too fast. That \nwhile a balanced budget may be desirable someday, please, Lord, do not \nlet it take place in our day, send that responsibility on to someone \nelse.\n  This particular amendment is of a rather interesting nature, because \nthis $100 billion of spending over what would be authorized by this \nbudget resolution is not balanced by increasing the amount of money \ngoing into the hospital insurance trust fund from payroll taxes at all. \nIn fact, we do not know how much of it would be used to stave off this \nbankruptcy of that fund.\n  If we assume, however, that half of it would go for that purpose, it \nwould postpone that bankruptcy by about 6 months, Mr. President--6 \nmonths of time during which presumably there would be no attempt to \ndeal with the fundamental causes of that bankruptcy, no attempt to deal \nwith the 10.5-percent increase in expenditures for Medicare each and \nevery year.\n  This money simply comes out of a reserve fund. What is the reserve \nfund, Mr. President? The reserve fund is the economic dividend for \nbalancing the budget. We are told by our Congressional Budget Office \nthat at least this year, we are all using its figures and estimates--we \nare told by the CBO that if we put laws in effect which reform the \nspending patterns of the assistance, which preserves that Medicare \ntrust fund, among other things, but which get us to balance in the year \n2002, the economy of the United States will react so positively and so \naffirmatively, interest rates will go down, people will be better off, \nthat we will actually be $170 billion ahead.\n  So we have said in this budget resolution that if in fact we take \nthis hit, if a number of programs do spend less money--no question \nabout that--the American people ought to be entitled to a dividend, a \nmodest tax reduction, 90 percent of which will go to middle-class \nworking Americans under the provisions of this budget. Oh, no, the \nother side says, we could not possibly do that. We have to spend it. \nBut, of course, they are spending it before they get it. If you put \nanother $100 billion of spending back into this budget, you do not get \nto a balance. I presume under CBO's figures, you do not get the reserve \nfund of the dividend at all. So we are spending money not only before \nwe get it, but before there is any assurance that we are going to get \nit at all. That is the nature of the proposal that we have before us \nright now.\n  Now, there is no way that I can fault the sincerity or devotion of \nthe senior Senator from Nebraska to a balanced budget. He was one of a \nrelatively small number of Members of his party who voted for a \nbalanced budget amendment which, Mr. President, would have required the \nbudget to be balanced by the year 2002. We could not have argued too \nfar, too fast had that amendment been a part of the Constitution. But \nmost unfortunately, he seems to speak for very few Members on his side \nof the aisle. Even by his own estimate, we only get 54 votes on this \nside of the aisle and 60 votes if we do it his way. That assumes that \neveryone on this side agrees to forego even the remote possibility of \nany tax cut for a 7-year period, even for middle-class working \nAmericans.\n  But as we have listened to debate on this specific amendment, it has \nnot been limited to a complaint that we should spend more than the \nbudget resolution authorizes on Medicare. Oh, no. We have heard it on \nmoney for agriculture, not just for Medicare but for Medicaid, for \neducation, for veterans, and for other health programs. Lord knows, I \nhave been here all the time, perhaps for all kinds of other programs, \nas well. We could spend that dividend three or four times, Mr. \nPresident, and not have satisfied the spending desires of the great \nbulk of the opponents to this budget resolution.\n  So I ask myself, should we pass this amendment? Will we suddenly have \na budget resolution supported by a wide range of Members on the other \nside? Will it suddenly become almost unanimous? Not from what we have \nheard so far, Mr. President. This will be only the beginning. There is \nno way that we will be able to satisfy the desire for spending and have \na balanced budget without having a very large increase in taxes, which \nI may say to this point has not been proposed.\n  Now, my good friend from West Virginia says that this amendment is \nreally just a symbol, a symbol of our need for health care. I agree \nthat it is a symbol. But I believe with what is going to follow on with \nit that it is a symbol for the need to spend far more money on a wide \nrange of programs than can possibly be accommodated, not only in this \nbudget resolution but in any budget resolution which leads us to a \nbalance by 2002. So ``too far, too fast'' really is the slogan that we \nare hearing from the other side during the course of this debate.\n  But this amendment goes at our very desire to put Medicare on a path \nunder which spending will increase not only overall in Medicare, but \nfor each individual beneficiary by close to 50 percent--35 to 50 \npercent--during this 5- to 7-year period. And also it will result in \nthis country's getting all of the dividends from the point of view of \ngreater [[Page S7049]] opportunities, more jobs, higher incomes, that \nwill come out of the fact that we balanced the budget.\n  The trustees of the Medicare health insurance system have told us \nthat it will go bankrupt. They have told us that we need to do \nsomething about it. They have not suggested that we just take more \nmoney out of the general fund, which does not have any more money, and \nput it into it. They have told us we need to do something. We propose \nin this resolution to do exactly that.\n  Yet, Mr. President, even that is not a totally consistent view from \nthe other side. We have had one of the Senators from North Dakota here \nin the course of the last couple of hours bringing up that argument \nthat was made, and ultimately defeated the balanced budget amendment, \nthat we are not really balancing the budget at all because we are \ncounting Social Security trust funds and expenditures as a part of a \nunified budget, and that we will still be more than $600 billion out of \nbalance.\n  Now, it may be that the Senators from North Dakota have promised us a \nbudget resolution which will save another $600 billion in some respect \nor another, though we have not seen it yet. I can only say at this \npoint that when that position was first put forth by the Senators from \nNorth Dakota, the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said \nthis:\n\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington in a judgment call \n     anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare in Washington and not a judgment \n     call at all.\n\n  Why does he make that point? He makes it for the simple reason that \nfrom the perspective of this country and society as a whole, a budget \ndeficit is a very simple proposition. It is the amount by which the \nnumber of dollars expended by the Federal Government in any year for \nany purpose exceeds the number of dollars that are brought in by taxes \nor fees or anything else. That difference is the amount of money that \nmust be borrowed by the Federal Government for one purpose or the \nother. That is the amount of money that drives up, or if it goes down, \nwill lower interest rates. That is the amount of money that is taken \nout of the savings of the country as a whole.\n  Under that definition, with a perfect security for the Social \nSecurity trust fund, this budget, the budget which is before us now, \nwill by its best figures lead to a balance in the year 2002. It will \nprevent the bankruptcy of the Medicare health insurance trust fund by \nthe year 2002. Appropriate reforms will see to it that it can go on \nindefinitely. That, Mr. President, is why this budget resolution has \nalready had positive impacts on the value of the American dollar and on \nlowered interest rates, and why it will have far more if it is actually \npassed and enforced.\n  Without changing, that will turn it from something that is real to \nsomething which is a mere fiction.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator from Washington yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington will be happy to engage in a \nconversation with the Senator from West Virginia on his time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, just a short minute.\n  I would have to say to my good friend from the State of Washington \nthat he did mischaracterize what I said. I think it is important for \nthe Record that the mischaracterization be straightened out.\n  I did not at all suggest $100 billion was symbolic. What I suggested \nwas that we were not obviously going to be able to create a solution to \nthe long-term trust fund problem by the $100 billion, but that we sure \nas heck are not, as is the case in the budget the Senator proposes, \ndoing this massive cut in Medicare, thus causing seniors to have to pay \nout of pocket and dip into their Social Security cost-of-living \nadjustment.\n  In no sense did I mean it was symbolic. It is anything but symbolic. \nWe would be bringing relief to senior citizens, and for that matter \nalso to Medicaid.\n  I really must object to the use of the word symbolism because I never \ndid say that. I used the word priorities. It is a question of \npriorities. I want the Record to be clear on that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I stand corrected by my friend from West \nVirginia. I understood him to say that the amount of money was symbolic \nof the problems that he felt this budget resolution created. Symbolic \nin the sense that even were it restored, it would not solve all of the \nproblems the Senator from West Virginia saw in the health care portions \nof this budget.\n  I am delighted to have him characterize his position in his own way.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the time \ncontrolled by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment that is \noffered by my colleagues from West Virginia and New Jersey, Senators \nRockefeller and Lautenberg, and in doing so, as the debate here in this \nChamber goes from side to side, I want to point out what may be missed \nin all of this, which is that there is remarkable--some might say \nhistoric; I would say necessary and appropriate--agreement between and \namong the various parties to this debate about the problems we face and \nthe need to take action.\n  The Budget Committee proposal brought up under the chairmanship of \nthe Senator from New Mexico--we use the word cut but what we really \nmean here is slowing the growth in spending for Medicare and Medicaid \nby $431 billion.\n  This amendment, offered by Senators Rockefeller and Lautenberg, will \ndiminish that slowing of the rate of increase in spending on these two \nhealth entitlements by $100 billion. The result, if the amendment \nshould be passed, would be that the increase in spending on Medicare \nand Medicaid would be cut by $331 billion.\n  Now, Mr. President, as the debate goes back and forth I think it is \ncritically important that all Members stop and appreciate the consensus \nthat is found here.\n  I would guess that very few in this Chamber would have predicted a \nyear ago that we would be here debating whether to cut $331 billion \nfrom the increase in growth of Medicare and Medicaid, or $431 billion. \nThose are numbers well beyond what was thought to be politically \npossible. But not well beyond what most experts and what most Members \nin this Chamber certainly acknowledged privately was fiscally and \ngovernmentally responsible if we were to save the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, certainly save Medicare from the bankruptcy that has been \npredicted, in 2002, by the fund's own trustees. And in that sense, to \nprotect the Medicare benefits of millions of Americans, including about \nhalf a million that live in the State of Connecticut.\n  I give the Senator from New Mexico, the Budget Committee chairman, a \nlot of credit for shaping this debate both on the question of the need \nto take hold of the Medicare program, to save it; and second, on the \noverall national imperative to bring our books into balance by a date \ncertain.\n  It is interesting that all of the amendments put in by the Democrats \nhere still accept the goal of a balanced budget by a date certain, \nwhich in this case is 2002.\n  Mr. President, it is not only fiscal necessity and the desire to \navoid the bankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund, certainly part A, and \nthe deprivation of health insurance benefits for all those who benefit \nfrom that fund, but it is the acknowledgment--and I need not speak at \nlength on this but just to note--the acknowledgment that the health \nentitlements are growing out of proportion to the rest of our public \nspending, have experienced double-digit increases in spending.\n  In a very real way, they are threatening to swallow up--if we let \nthis growth go unchecked--so much of what we consider to be the Federal \nGovernment, and not just to swallow it up but to make it impossible for \nMembers and those who follow the debate here in Congress and the White \nHouse to deal effectively with the Nation's problems, and putting in \njeopardy--because we simply will not have the money--our \n[[Page S7050]] ability to provide for our Nation's security, with an \nadequate defense abroad, and a decent, tough, and comprehensive war \nagainst crime here at home. Making it impossible to invest in our \nfuture through programs of education, basic research, child \ndevelopment, training, job creation. Making it ultimately very \ndifficult, if not impossible, to reform the welfare system, because \nmost people who have looked at this acknowledge we cannot do that \nwithout investing a little money in getting people off of welfare.\n  This growing bipartisan consensus, which may be lost as the debate \nshifts back and forth on these amendments, is real and is based on a \nbipartisan understanding that unless we grab ahold of entitlement \nspending we are not only going to lose the benefits that these programs \nprovide, we will lose our ability to provide for the future of our \ncountry, the future of our children, and the future of our work force.\n  However, Mr. President, I think it is very important, acknowledging \nthe historic steps that we have taken on both sides to try to control \nthe growth in Medicare spending, to say that this simply cannot become \na debate of numbers, a debate of accountants.\n  If all we are talking about, and all we are arguing about, is how \nmuch we are going to cut Medicare, the growth in Medicare spending, we \nwill have not fully carried out our responsibility. If all we do is to \ncut the existing system, we will not have dealt fundamentally with our \nproblem and we will, in fact, create severe difficulty for the \nbeneficiaries of these programs and for the providers.\n  People have talked about three ways to achieve reductions in \nincreases in the Medicare program: increase payments for the fund by, \nfor example, increasing premium contribution for wealthier Americans; \nwe can decrease payments to providers for their services; or we can \nreform the basic structure of the Medicare system so that it delivers \ncare more cost effectively.\n  That, Mr. President--reforming the basic structure--is what I hope \nthe majority in this Chamber will be committed to. That is the road to \ntruly protecting and saving the Medicare system and saving the rest of \nthe Federal Government that will be eaten up by health entitlements, as \nwill the future of our children and our Nation.\n  There are interesting ideas around about reform. Some, for example, \nhave suggested that we make preferred provider plans available to \nMedicare recipients and that such plans can deliver care more \nefficiently while maintaining choice.\n  Others are discussing more dramatic changes. I must say these are the \nones that appeal to me most, such as moving toward a voucher system in \nwhich the Government provides a fixed amount of money by way of a \nvoucher to those who are eligible for Medicare, enabling them to go out \ninto the private markets and purchase their own health care coverage. \nThat is the way to truly empower the recipients, to break them free \nfrom a lot of the complexities of the current system and to bring \ncompetition into the Medicare Program, which is so significant a part \nof our health care apparatus, just as competition is coming in so \neffectively to the rest of our health care system.\n  The pace of change to the Medicare Program should be determined by \nour ability to maintain: confidence in the program; the credibility of \nthe program financially; and, the quality of the services delivered \nunder the program to those who are the beneficiaries.\n  Let me talk briefly about two comments that have been offered, two \npositions taken, as to how to proceed down the road to reform. The \nBudget Committee majority has proposed establishing a bipartisan \ncommission to advise Congress on how best to meet the level of cuts set \nforth in the budget. Some of my colleagues, on the other hand, have \nargued that we simply should not pursue Medicare reform outside of the \ncontext of broad-based health care reform.\n  I am not truly comfortable with either of these positions. It may be \nin the end that a commission is necessary to deal with these problems. \nBut it takes time, and I believe we know what our options are now. I \nwould sure like to see this Congress, led in this Chamber by our \nFinance Committee, take a first crack at seeing whether we can, not \njust cut Medicare spending increases, but whether we can reform the \nfundamentals of the program.\n  When it comes to the argument that Medicare reform must be part of \noverall health care reform I would say this: in the best of all worlds \nthat would be the way to proceed. But if we learned any lesson from the \nfutile attempts to adopt universal and comprehensive health care last \nyear, it is that if we wait to reform the Medicare system until we can \nhave overall health care reform we will not have Medicare reform, and \nwe will probably not have overall health care reform either. We simply \nshould not postpone Medicare reform because the problems facing \nMedicare are too critical for us to delay.\n  The fact is, recent innovations in health care delivery in the \nprivate market have created a revolution without governmental direction \nand paved the way for new approaches to deliver care to the elderly \nthrough Medicare reform. We should take advantage of those private \nsector innovations and try to apply them to the Medicare Program. The \nprivate sector reforms that are going on now are driving change. It \nwould be a strange result indeed if the private markets reform \nthemselves to more efficiently and cost-effectively deliver health care \nand the governmentally operated health care programs are left to run \nwithout the benefit of competition and without the benefit of reform.\n  So it is with these thoughts in mind that I will be supporting the \namendment offered by Senators Rockefeller and Lautenberg, acknowledging \nand expressing some appreciation for the consensus that is here beneath \nthe debate. We are on the road to a balanced budget by a date certain. \nWe all acknowledge that we have to limit the growth in health \nentitlement spending to save those programs for the beneficiaries.\n  Finally, I hope we will come to a similar consensus that cutting the \ngrowth just in dollar accounting terms is not enough. We have to reform \nthe fundaments of the program to save it, empower the beneficiaries of \nthe program, and take full advantage of the marketplace competition \nthat is being so productive and beneficial to people in the private \nsector today.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the \namendment and I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with the consent of the majority leader \nand at the suggestion of the manager of the bill on the other side, I \nask unanimous consent the period of time in this debate between 2 p.m. \nand the vote at 3:10 p.m. be equally divided and be under the control \nof the Senators from Nebraska and New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, looking for leadership on the budget from \nthe opposition these days is a little like playing ``Where's Waldo?''\n  If you look long and hard, you may eventually spot it, but there is \nnot much there and it is certainly not easy to find.\n  This important debate over this year's budget resolution very clearly \ndemonstrates my point.\n  For years, the Democrats have passed budgets which increased taxes, \nincreased spending, and gave us the massive deficits which have dragged \nthis Nation nearly $5 trillion in debt.\n  In 1993, President Clinton continued that trend, and even went a stip \nfurther. His budget contained the largest tax increase in history, $275 \nbillion, and spending increases, and more deficits.\n  But the Democrats praised it up and down. ``It is going to take this \ncountry in the correct direction, in a good direction, in the right \ndirection,'' said one of my Democrat colleagues.\n  Over and over again, the President and the Democrats in Congress \nchallenged Republicans to offer up an alternative.\n  Listen to the words of my good colleague, Mrs. Boxer, the junior \nSenator from California:\n\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\n       So I say to my fellow Republicans: Where is your budget? \n     Show it to us. I want to see it. Don't give me amendments \n     that do something here and there, because that is not \n     constructive.\n\n  We delivered an alternative budget--one which reduced the deficit \nthrough spending cuts, not tax increases.\n  I, in fact, drafted an alternative of my own--Families First--which I \nintroduced in the House and which was carried here in the Senate by my \ndistinguished colleague, Mr. Coats of Indiana.\n  Our budget not only cut spending, it cut taxes for families and moved \nthe Federal Government in an entirely new direction.\n  Away from the Washington Beltway, Families First was praised by the \ntaxpayers.\n  But here on Capitol Hill, with the Democratic majority in charge, it \nnever had a chance.\n  In August 1993, under the leadership of the President and a Democrat \nHouse and Senate, the largest tax increase was passed into law.\n  Now the tables are turned. Under the guidance of our distinguished \nbudget chairman, Republicans have offered up an historic plan which \nwould balance the budget within the next 7 years.\n  I am proud of the work of the Budget Committee.\n  Yet, those same Democrats of 1993 who called so loudly for a \nRepublican budget alternative, have failed to offer up any alternative \nof their own this time around, just a lot of little amendments that do \nsomething here and there.\n  In fact, the only Democrat to offer up an alternative is President \nClinton, and he is required to do that by law. But the President's \nbudget was so far from what the people called for in November that not \none Senator voted for it--Democrat or Republican.\n  That is some serious back-peddling. Two years after passing the \nlargest tax increase in history--and boasting they reduced the deficit \nwithout a single Republican vote--Senate Democrats joined Republicans \nin rejecting the President's fiscal policies by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  Unlike Mr. Domenici's balanced budget, the President's budget would \nnever balance. In fact, his budget plan calls for another $1.2 trillion \nin deficit spending over the next 5 years.\n  Under the President's budget, the deficit will continue to rise every \nyear, until it reaches nearly $300 billion in the year 2000.\n  Kings can abdicate their thrones, generals can wave the white flag of \nsurrender, a chess player who gets backed into a corner can forfeit the \ngame, but the President of the United States is not supposed to just \nthrow in the towel when the going gets a little rough.\n  Times have changed. So if President Clinton is not serious about \nreducing the deficit and balancing the budget, I ask the Democrats here \nin the Senate the very same question they asked us 2 years ago, using \ntheir very own words: ``Where is your budget? Show it to us. I want to \nsee it.''\n  In 1993, Republicans did put up alternative budgets that we did \nsupport and that we did vote for. But it is not the case this year.\n  The distinguished Democrat leader says he accepts the goal of \nproducing a balanced budget by 2002. But he is not willing to actually \ndo anything about it, because, and I quote, ``We don't have the votes, \nso there's no point for us to lay out a comprehensive substitute.'' We \ndid not have the votes in 1993. But we did lay out a comprehensive \nsubstitute alternative budget.\n  Well, I certainly hope we can count on his vote for Mr. Domenici's \nbalanced budget.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: how do you plan \nto improve, preserve, and protect the Medicare Program from going \nbankrupt, as it would under the President's plan?\n  If you are intent on spending as wildly as you have in the past, how \ndo you plan to balance the budget within 7 years? With new taxes? If \nso, which taxes are you going to raise? The people have a right to \nknow.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats may find that it is easy to complain \nabout the Republican's budget, but you cannot beat something with \nnothing. And that is what the Democrats have given us: nothing. It is \nclear, Mr. President, that they do not want to tell us how they are \ngoing to balance the budget without tax increases, because they have \nabsolutely no intention of ever doing it. So I make one suggestion to \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Being in the minority \ndoes not give you license to simply gripe and complain. It does not \nfree you from the responsibility of representing your constituents.\n  If you vote no on the budget resolution, then you had better find \nsomething on which you can vote yes for. We did it in 1993. Or else, \nthe voters will have every reason to vote no themselves when you turn \nto them in November.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time does my friend and colleague \nfrom Nebraska seek?\n  Mr. KERREY. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I must tell the Senator that I have nine Senators who wish \nto speak between now and 2 o'clock. I am cramped for time. How about 8 \nminutes?\n  Mr. KERREY. Eight minutes will be fine.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  May I ask the senior Senator from Nebraska, does he intend, on the \ntime he controls, to respond to the statement of the junior Senator \nfrom Minnesota just made earlier that there are no Democrats willing to \nparticipate in deficit reduction; that this whole problem was created \nby wasteful spending on the part of Democrats?\n  I intended to come to the floor to talk about something else, to try \nto say some things that might forge a bipartisan consensus. But I find \nmyself being provoked by the comments of the junior Senator from \nMinnesota. I am wondering if the Senator intends to respond.\n  Mr. EXON. I certainly say to my good friend from Nebraska that I \nassumed he was here to talk about the amendment at hand. Maybe he is \nnot. I simply say I would really appreciate it if he could make \nwhatever comments he feels disposed to make at this time. I have been \nanswering the charges that has been made over and over again that were \njust echoed like an echo chamber by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Would it be possible for the Senator to make those appropriate \nremarks now, and then after the vote today, we could use additional \ntime for going into some other things that I suspect he might have on \nhis mind?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will pleased to. I will confine my remarks to the \namendment at hand, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I must say, I have some difficulty with the amendment \nat hand because it seems to me what we are basically saying is we want \nto take the $170 billion that probably will not materialize. In order \nto get $170 billion in savings, this Congress would have to come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion for 7 straight years, and each \ncommittee reconciling out and voting the savings. We would have to \nfollow the 7-year blueprint before the money appears. I must say, I \nfeel somewhat uncomfortable, to say the least, taking savings created \nfrom cuts that I do not like anyway to mitigate the impact of cuts that \nI do not like.\n  So what I choose to do instead is talk again about one of the \nfundamental weaknesses that I see in this budget resolution, because it \nis nonbinding and because, as I see it--I have added a couple without \nthe use of the calculator, so I may have this wrong--$519 billion of \nthe reconciliation instructions go to the Finance Committee.\n  So I will have, as well as others, the opportunity to go to the \nFinance Committee and challenge some of the underlying assumptions, not \nthe least of which is that we are not going to do anything about \nretirement this year.\n  I appreciate the difficulties that the Budget Committee had in \nputting together this set of nonbinding instructions.\n  So those of us who, like Senator Simpson, believe that retirement \nshould be on the table, that unless and until we have addressed that, \nit is going to be difficult for us to actually get our budget balanced, \nwe will have that opportunity to do it at some later date. \n[[Page S7052]] \n  The Senator from Washington earlier made the point, when apparently \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota was down on the floor \nearlier taking about this problem. I alert colleagues again: I think \nthe effort on the part of both the chairman and the ranking member to \nproduce this document is quite an extraordinary accomplishment.\n  I point out, nonetheless, that inside the budget document, it calls \nfor the deficit to go from $240 billion down to $114.9 billion, if I \ncan read my own writing, in the year 2002.\n  What we do is basically use what the law says. The law says we use \nthe unified budget. The Social Security revenues are separate. But in \nterms of adding everything up, we bring Social Security into the \nequation. It is only because Social Security generates some $48 billion \nin surplus this year to a $114 billion surplus in the year 2002.\n  Again, I have not run the numbers on this. But I guess since we go to \n2013 and start paying out more than we are taking in, my guess is that \nmay be the peak; that $114 billion may be the peak. It may start \ndeclining after that, which is going to put additional pressure on all \ndomestic spending.\n  I say to my colleagues that one of the things which has stayed \nconstant in this town obviously is not political rhetoric. That blows \nhot and cold. But the one thing that stays constant in a very \nimpressive fashion throughout all the imaginations about taxing is not \nenough, too much; that except for World War II and Vietnam, we have \npulled from the United States economy about 19\\1/2\\ percent of GDP in \nthe form of taxes. It stayed relatively constant over that period of \ntime.\n  The underlying thing on our budget, and driving larger and larger, \nare these mandated items. They include retirement, they include health \ncare, they include both the means-tested programs, such as AFDC and \nfood stamps, as well as the non-means-tested programs, such as the \nagriculture program which, I might point out, is a relatively small \namount, Medicare, Social Security, and other kinds of retirement \nprograms.\n  The law says, as a consequence of either contribution or deciding \nthat eligibility is deserved, you pay it out and you do not have to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and vote on it.\n  What is happening is that mandated account, plus that interest, is \ndriving higher and higher. And, I regret, it may be that the Democrats \nwere not as aggressive as we should have been. It may have been that it \nis too controversial. As we obviously see, it was retirement. But I \nregret that we do not see a change in that in the budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution requires us to go to about 25 percent \ndiscretionary spending in the year 2002 down from 34 percent today.\n  I note with interest that the senior Senator from Oregon has an \namendment to come down and restore some costs and protect NIH. I notice \nthe Senator from Iowa has an amendment to do the same in education.\n  The problem is that little amendments to the budget resolution will \nnot fix this problem. When the senior Senator from Oregon came to the \nU.S. Senate, 70 percent of the budget was controlled by the \nAppropriations Committee; 70 percent was appropriated, 30 percent was \nmandatory spending, and then interest. This year, as I indicated, it \nwill be 34 percent. By the time a baby born this year is a senior in \nhigh school, it will be zero, even with this budget resolution passed.\n  So I urge my colleagues, regardless of how this resolution shakes \nout, I hope that the alternative that a group of us will present, as I \nindicated in a previous speech, will be accepted because I think we are \ngoing to need a lot of bipartisan support not just this year but the \nnext year and the year after to explain to the American people what \nneeds to be done to bring the cost of these mandated programs in line.\n  I heard it said that these cuts in Medicare are going to have a \nterrible impact. Indeed, I suspect they could, depending upon how the \nFinance Committee wrote the legislation. But I say to those who are \nreally alarmed by the prospects of those cuts, according again to the \ndocument--I unfortunately have read Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, \nwhich is relatively small--we start with budget authority this year of \n$171.9 billion for HI, and $61.2 billion for supplemental medical.\n  So I have $230 billion this year, growing to $370 billion. We will \nhave $370 billion authorized in the year 2002.\n  So, if anything, one has to, even with this budget resolution, take a \nlook at overall health care spending and say, ``My gosh, yes.'' The \nBudget Committee has been very bold and very gutsy in putting this \nnumber out. But, if anything, Mr. President, we may not have gone far \nenough.\n  I do not suggest that we need to necessarily cut any more, but I do \nthink we have to ask ourselves the question, are we subsidizing people \nwho do not need to be subsidized? We will have $230 billion this year \nin Medicare. We will have another $80 billion in Medicaid. That is $310 \nbillion. We have $90 billion going out in the form of tax deductions.\n  I notice that when people get really excited about going after tax \nentitlements and I come and say, let us look at the deductibility of \nhealth insurance, they get sort of pale and drop that off their list. \nWith another $15 billion going out to the VA, another $15 billion going \nout to Army, Air Force, and Navy health care, a substantial amount of \nexpenditures, well in excess of $400 billion, going out for health \ncare, I do not think the problem here is that we are not spending \nenough. I think one of the biggest problems we have is whether or not \nwe have the courage to say to those who do not need to be subsidized, \nyou may need to pay some more.\n  I noted earlier that one of my colleagues--I saw the dueling charts \ngo on back here, and I saw in the Democratic Cloakroom the chart \nshowing the comparative analysis between what Members of Congress get \nin the way of health care and what Medicare beneficiaries get in the \nway of health care, the suggestion being that Medicare beneficiaries \nalready get less than what Members of Congress do.\n  If somebody wants to bring an amendment striking Congress down to the \nlevel of Medicare, I would vote for it. But the problem is we have a \nlot of employees we have hired on and we are looking to try to provide \nthem with health care benefits, and it is their health care benefits we \nare talking about here.\n  If anybody wants to come and say that people ought to pay according \nto capacity to pay, I am ready to vote for that. I do think one of the \nmost difficult things that we have going with health care today is that \nwe may have 20 million or so people in the work force going to work, \nsometimes working two or three jobs, doing all they possibly can, but \nthey are not generating enough output to get paid enough to be able to \nafford high-quality health care. We have subsidies in place for people \nwho can afford it.\n  So when the Finance Committee gets down to looking at the \nreconciliation of numbers, I think there will be plenty of opportunity \neven with the money allocated for us to do the right thing. The \nquestion is, are we going to have the capacity either politically or in \nour own guts to come to the American people and say that this is not \ngoing to be an easy thing; it is not a free lunch involved.\n  I say in conclusion, I appreciate very much the leadership \nparticularly of the senior Senator from Nebraska who over the years has \nbeen voting with Republicans, has been doing the right thing when it \ncomes to deficit reduction. This has not been somebody who comes down \nwith knee-jerk votes against every single spending cut. This is a man \nwho has been down here for the entire 18 years that he has served the \npeople of Nebraska, as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has as \nwell. I think we are fortunate to have them leading us on this budget \ndebate. We have a lot of very difficult decisions to make if we are \ngoing to reduce the size of this deficit and get it in balance and get \nus to a point where we not only restore the confidence of the American \npeople in us as an institution but do as we all say we want to do, \nwhich is to provide a better economic future for our children and for \nour grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nebraska has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  [[Page S7053]]\n  \n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank very much my friend and colleague \nfrom Nebraska for his kind remarks with regard to not only myself but \nour mutual friend, Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee. \nThis is a very difficult task. I think the Senator from Nebraska, my \ncolleague, knows very, very well we have been reaching out. I \nappreciate very much the dedicated leadership he has provided in a \nwhole series of areas with regard to deficit reduction.\n  Senator Graham is in the Chamber. I will yield to him.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we have no one on our side requesting time \nat this particular moment so I would like to yield the floor back to \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, that side would be next. I simply might say, if I can \nat this time, there are several Senators who had indicated they did \nwish to address this matter on the Senate floor before we vote. We are \nquickly running out of time, and if there are any Senators who wish to \nmake remarks up to 5 minutes, their staffs should advise them we are \nquickly running out of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. As I said, Mr. President, I have no one on this side who \nrequests time at this moment, so I will yield the floor back to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I should like to make two points in the time available \nto me. The first is the context in which this debate over the specifics \nof Medicare and Medicaid should take place and then, second, some \nparticular concerns about the proposal that is before us in those two \nareas.\n  There is no golden road to budget balance. There are many means by \nwhich to get to that common destination. We are going to be discussing \ntoday one aspect of a proposal to get to a balanced budget and the \nconsequences of selecting that particular route. But I want no one who \nhears this debate to be misdirected that we are not as committed to the \ngoal of getting to a balanced budget by a date certain, ideally with a \nbipartisan consensus of the Congress and the American people.\n  There is a word that appeared on the chart we have just seen which I \nthink is important to this context, and that is sustainability.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not believe that cuts of the level being \nproposed in Medicare and Medicaid are sustainable. They might have \nenough energy to get through this round of the budget process. That is, \nthey may be able to appear in the final budget resolution. I think they \nwill encounter significant difficulty when they reach the Ways and \nMeans Committee and the Finance Committee, and these large amorphous \nnumbers, $256 billion out of the Medicare Program in the next 7 years, \n$175 billion from Medicaid in the next 7 years, when those are \nconverted into the specific impacts on people, they will encounter \nsignificantly greater difficulty.\n  I believe that even if they should get past that hurdle, the chances \nof these cuts lasting the full 7 years as they are converted into \nservices, cost shifting, impact on States, impact on the private \nsector, is very unlikely. So I am concerned as to whether the path that \nhas been laid out for us, which is clearly not the only path, is a path \nthat has the staying power to get to the destination of a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Let me talk about some of the implications of the proposal for a $256 \nbillion cut in Medicare, the program that provides health care \nfinancing for older Americans, and $175 billion of cuts in Medicaid, \nthe program that provides funding for indigent Americans, which I might \nsay, Mr. President, includes a substantial number of older Americans, \nolder Americans who thought they had made adequate provision for their \nretirement years and find that because of some unexpected cataclysmic \nhealth collapse, they have used up their resources and they become \nmedically indigent Americans.\n  Let me just discuss what the implications of this will be first on \nbeneficiaries. The materials which have been provided indicate that one \nof the first means of financing this $256 billion cut on Medicare will \nbe cost shifting. Hearings before the Senate Finance Committee \nindicated that speaker after speaker who supported cuts of this level, \nwhen asked where would you propose to go in order to achieve this, gave \nas their first answer to increase the share of cost paid by \nbeneficiaries.\n  It is estimated that the increased cost to a couple, man and wife, in \nmy State between the year 1996 and the year 2002 will exceed $9,000. \nThat represents, for instance, Mr. President, about half of what that \ncouple would anticipate to receive in cost-of-living adjustments over \nthe period from 1996 to the year 2002. So the real implication of this \nis that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living \nagainst increased cost of living because such a high share of their \nincome will now be going to meeting the additional cost of paying for \ntheir health care.\n  Another important area of Americans who will be adversely affected \nwill be the providers of health care services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the generosity of my \ncolleague from Nebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  According to the Prospective Payment Review Commission, a commission \nestablished by Congress to consistently analyze Medicare programs, the \ncommission states and I quote:\n\n       The ability to use cost shifting to fill the revenue gap \n     where Medicare cost increases exceed payment increases varies \n     across hospitals.\n      Facilities that treat a large share of Medicare, Medicaid \n     and the uninsured patients have a lesser ability to cost \n     shift to the private sector. In view of growing price \n     competition in the marketplace, these facilities will face \n     a greater risk of declining margins, which eventually \n     could threaten their financial viability and their ability \n     to care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not surprising in my State, which has the \nlargest proportion of persons over the age of 65 in the country, that \nthere are some 87 hospitals in our State where the Medicare patient \ndays exceed 60 percent of total patient days, which is to say that in \nStates like mine and particularly in rural areas such as those \nrepresented by the Senator from Nebraska, the risk of a serious \ncollapse of the health care system, not just for Medicaid and Medicare \nrecipients but for the total population, is a very real one, a collapse \nbecause those facilities are so dependent upon the Medicare and \nMedicaid patient that, if the Federal Government does not provide \nadequate resources with which to at least pay the costs of provision of \ndirect services, those institutions will face the prospect of either a \nsharp decline in the quality of service for their Medicare \nbeneficiaries or closure.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Another area at risk is State government. We are \nproposing to take the Medicaid Program, the program that delivers \nservices for indigent Americans, take the current formula of \ndistribution of funds, convert that into 50 block grants--51 block \ngrants, actually, since the District of Columbia will also \nparticipate--and direct the money to those 51 political entities. There \nis a suggestion of an annual cost-of-living increase but no increase \nbased on demographic changes. What are the consequences of that?\n  According to the CBO baseline study, currently the Medicaid Program \nis providing a 7 percent increase per capita for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. That, I might say, compares to a 7.2 percent increase in \nspending per capita in the private health care system. Medicaid today \nis slightly below, on a per capita basis, the rate of increase of the \nprivate sector, in spite of the fact that Medicaid is treating some of \nthe most vulnerable of our population, including children at risk and \nthe elderly at risk.\n  Under the proposal that we are debating, the increase per capita will \nnot be 7 percent, Mr. President, but it will be 1.4 percent as against \na projected continued 7.2 percent in the private sector. That is the \nconsequence of a system which purports to create greater flexibility to \nthe States by giving them only a constrained 5 percent increase with no \nrecognition of the tremendous demographic shifts in States \n[[Page S7054]] such as that represented by the Presiding Officer and in \nStates such as mine which have a fast-growing population, particularly \na fast-growing population of older Americans. This is a prescription \nfor disaster for the beneficiaries affected and for the State \ngovernments which will be asked to pick up a bigger and bigger share of \npaying these costs.\n  Another area which will be adversely affected will be children. It is \nprojected that 5 to 7 million children currently lack insurance \ncoverage and unless States can find a way to make up that difference, \nthere will be either a denial of health insurance coverage for those \nyoung Americans or another major cost shift, an unfunded mandate \ndirected at the States to pick up a cost which in the past has been a \nshared responsibility through Medicaid of the States and the National \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that his 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, our manager is not here. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator does that, might I say that \nimmediately following the Senator from Florida, I would like to yield \nto Senator Bennett to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida will have 2 additional minutes, and when he \nhas concluded, the Senator from Utah will be permitted to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I quoted a moment ago from the Prospective Payment Review Commission, \nand I do so again from their March 1959 report, which states:\n\n       Medicare and the private sector account for approximately \n     equal shares of hospital spending, 40 percent and 39 percent \n     in 1992. Consequently, every percentage point of Medicare \n     cost increase not reimbursed by the Medicare payment increase \n     will, all else equal, translate into a percentage point of \n     additional revenue needed from the private sector.\n\n  So we are facing the prospect by carving out these two programs--\nMedicare and Medicaid--and treating them as if they were in isolation \nfrom the rest of the health care system. We are about to construct a \nsystem in which there will be significant cost shifting to the private \nsector resulting in increased costs for private employers, private \nindividuals, for the providers of health care services because they \nwill be underfunded.\n  Mr. President, I believe in the importance of reaching the goal of a \nbalanced Federal budget, and I believe that the date of 2002, while \ndifficult, is not an unreasonable standard. I would go further by \nsaying that we should have as our goal reaching, as soon after the year \n2002 as possible--and I would suggest 2005 or 2006 --a balanced Federal \nbudget which does not depend upon the masking of the Social Security \nsurplus in order to reach a balanced budget. But we must do so in a \npattern which will be politically and publicly supportable and \nsustainable over the next 10 years that will be required in order to \nreach a balanced Federal budget without relying on Social Security.\n  It is my considered judgment that the impact that this approach on \nMedicare and Medicaid, as has been suggested, will have on the \nbeneficiaries, particularly the old and the young, on providers, on \nStates, and on the private sector, will be so severe that it will not \nbe sustainable and that we will face the prospect of losing this \nopportunity to achieve that goal of a balanced Federal budget.\n  So I urge the adoption of the amendment which is before the Senate at \nthe present time, which I think brings reasonableness to this process. \nAnd I urge the Senate's serious consideration of a comprehensive \namendment which will be offered later this week which will achieve the \ngoals of a balanced Federal budget without relying on these savage cuts \nin Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had the pleasure and opportunity of \nbeing in the Chamber when the Senator from Florida began his \npresentation, and I would like to rise and comment on it.\n  I think the position the Senator has taken with respect to Medicare \nis entirely correct if you make one assumption, and that is that the \ndelivery of services under Medicare would not change in its estimate or \nin the way they are paid for. If there is no change in the way Medicare \nis administered and no change in the way these services are paid for, \nthe Senator from Florida is exactly correct. Unfortunately, from my \npoint of view, however, Mr. President, that is the problem; that is, \nthe assumption that there will be no change in the way Medicare is \nadministered.\n  The Senator from Florida says these cuts will have to be converted \ninto service cuts, they will have to be converted into cost shifting, \nthey will have to be converted into increases in premiums that are not \nsustainable over the long term. And, again, if there is no change in \nthe way Medicare is administered and no change in the way it is paid \nfor, the Senator from Florida is entirely correct.\n  The thing I hope we will address as a body is this fundamental \nquestion of Medicare as it is currently constituted and recognize that \nthe word which the Senator from Florida picked out, ``sustainable,'' \nis, indeed, the keyword because what we are learning as we get into \nthis circumstance is that the present system of Medicare is not \nsustainable regardless of what we do.\n  We could take all of the money that we are talking about cutting out \nof the rate of increase and leave it as it is, and what would happen to \nMedicare? It would go broke. The trustees have told us that. The \npresent system is not sustainable. We could say, ``All right, let us \nadd money.'' Where is it going to come from? We will leave that aside \nfor a minute, but let us add money to the present system to prevent it \nfrom going broke, and all we do is delay the inevitable for a few more \nyears, and then we will be back on the floor of the Senate, or our \nsuccessors will be, debating the same issue.\n  I have an analogy, Mr. President, that helps me understand this. I \nwill do my best to lay it out in a fashion that might be clear to some \nothers, because some people, when I start, say, ``Oh, that doesn't have \nto do with anything.'' But bear with me. This is an analogy that I \nthink illustrates the point.\n  Back in the 1960's, when we first started--we as a nation--discussing \nMedicare, my father was in the Senate and I was acting as his campaign \nmanager. I have mentioned this here before. At the time, if I wanted to \ntalk to my father from the campaign headquarters in Utah, I would pick \nup a telephone and dial zero. Yes, you had to dial; there were no \ntouch-tone phones. An operator would come on the phone and say, ``What \nnumber, please?''\n  I would say to her, ``I want 224-5444.'' It happens to be the same \nnumber that connects you to my office now.\n  She would say, ``Do you want person-to-person or station-to-\nstation?''\n  If I wanted absolutely to talk to my father, I would say, ``Person-\nto-person.'' If I was willing to talk to anybody on the staff, I would \nsay, ``Station-to-station,'' and then I would wait there on the phone \nwhile she placed the call.\n  If I had said person-to-person, she would say, ``Is Senator Bennett \nthere?''\n  And they would say, ``Just a moment, we'll find him.'' And then when \nthey found him, when he came on, then and only then would she go off \nthe line and I could start to talk to my father.\n  The system worked great. It was simple, certainly easy for me to \nunderstand, certainly convenient. All I had to do was tell her what I \nwanted and let her handle all of the details of placing the call.\n  There was one problem with it, however, Mr. President. As the demand \nfor long distance service grew in this country, we reached the point \nvery quickly where there were not enough operators in the country to \nhandle all the calls. Indeed, if you projected it out into the future, \nwe would be looking at a point where there were not enough people in \nthe world to handle all of the telephone calls that people would make \nrequiring an operator to come on, listen to the request, and handle it. \nWe were forced, whether we wanted to or not--we wanted to--whether we \nwanted to or not, we were forced by the rising demands to leave a \nsystem that was working well and invent a new one. Now, of course, \n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\nwe have a new one where the number of operators handling long distance \ncalls has gone down and the number of long distance calls has exploded \nexponentially.\n  This, frankly, Mr. President, is the problem we are facing with \nMedicare. The number of people on Medicare is going up and going up \ncontinually and inevitably. I say somewhat facetiously, Medicare, as \npresently constituted, will work just fine if the elderly would only \ncooperate by dying at the same rate they died in 1960, when this was \ncreated. But I do not want the elderly members of my family to \ncooperate in that fashion, and I am sure that is true of everyone else \nhere. So Medicare has to be restructured around the new realities, and \nthe new realities say it can no longer be, as it is now, the last \nbastion of fee-for-service indemnity insurance for the United States. \nThere has to be some changes and the changes have to be cost driven.\n  As chairman of the Republican health care task force, I got a lot of \npeople calling on me and giving me information. They inaccurately \nassume I hold a legislative power in this circumstance and can do \nsomething beyond recommend, but it makes for a great education.\n  I had a session with a number of the Nation's leading employers, and \nwe were talking about health care. They said, ``Fee-for-service \nindemnity insurance will be gone within 5 years as an option for \nAmerica's employees.'' I was a little startled at that prediction. I \nhad not been prepared for that.\n  One of them said, ``We put in a series of options for our employees \nabout 3 years ago, and fee-for-service was one of the options. Roughly \n50 percent of our employees accepted that option. The others picked a \nform of HMO or PPO, some kind of managed-care circumstance.''\n  He said, ``Fifty percent fee-for-service indemnity insurance, 50 \npercent some sort of managed care. Without any pressure from us,'' he \nsaid--this is the employer speaking--``we have watched the marketplace \ntake hold. Today, just 3 years later, 15 percent of our employees \nchoose the fee-for-service option.'' He said, ``We have cut our health \ncare costs''--not Washington-style cuts, where you simply grow more \nslowly than you did before; real cuts, where you spend less than you \nspent before by providing these options--``and our employees, in terms \nof the questionnaires they give us back, are happier with their health \ncare options than they were 3 years before.''\n  So, Mr. President, what we are really talking about, if we can take \nthe big view here, is restructuring Medicare around the new reality and \nsaying, ``What will the numbers be to make Medicare rational from the \nstandpoint of those who are paying for it,'' those who are paying for \nit being the taxpayers. And we are saying we are going to allow \nMedicare to continue to grow, indeed we are going to allow the \nindividual contribution per year to go from $4,400 per year, roughly, \nto $6,300 per year.\n  We are going to allow this thing to go up almost 50 percent in that \nperiod, but that is the number that those of you who are involved in \nfiguring out how to restructure it have to shoot at.\n  I am not on the Finance Committee. As I say, I have no legislative \nauthority to do this. But I am on the health care task force, and we \nare looking at these options. We are confident, Mr. President, that we \ncan come up with a restructuring of Medicare around this new reality \nthat will ultimately go back to the lesson learned in long-distance \nphone calls--that is, that something can be created around the \ninformation and the experience we are getting out of the private sector \nthat says to us we can provide better service for our elderly within \nthe price constraints that we are looking at. But if the option is to \nnot try to change the system, just pay for it, whatever it costs, then \nwe are in the black hole that the Senator from Florida so accurately \npointed out to us.\n  So I hope that as we conduct this debate, we will do so with the \nunderstanding that we, as a Congress, have a great deal of unfinished \nwork to do with respect to Medicare, and it is in the restructuring of \nthe system around the new realities. And I am one who believes we can \nmeet that challenge.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I first want to compliment the Senator on his very \nenlightening remarks. I hope he continues with his level head and good \nreason as the chairman of the task force.\n  Some are suggesting that we have to wait around for entire reform of \nthe health care system, that which the President recommended last year, \nwhich failed rather overwhelmingly in both Houses of the Congress. Is \nit the Senator's opinion, based on what he knows, that we have to wait \naround for that day--which I do not know will ever come--when the U.S. \nGovernment reforms--so-called ``reforms''--all of the health care \nsystem before we can do the restructuring to give our seniors choice \nand a delivery system that will meet their needs for less taxpayer \nmoney?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his question. It is my opinion \nthat restructuring the entire health care system in this country with a \nsingle bill in a single Congress proved in the 103d Congress to be an \nimpossible task. To attempt to do it again and again would be to say to \nthe world that we had learned nothing from our experience in the 103d \nCongress, we are just going to go back to the same mistake that \nCongress made--in all good faith. I do not accuse anybody of \napproaching that task in bad faith in the previous Congress. But the \nexperience just told us that to try to do everything simultaneously \nultimately meant we did nothing. I believe we should break it up--the \nPresident himself used the phrase in his State of the Union Message, \n``a step-by-step approach''--break it up into acceptable components, \nand the one that is the most pressing and the most urgent is the \nrestructuring of Medicare around the new realities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The senior citizens of the United States have two \ndistinct benefits with reference to health care. One is the health care \ntrust fund, the so-called HI fund, the hospital fund, which is the one \nthat is entrusted, that the workers of America, the men and women pay \ninto with wage withholding, which is supposed to be for hospitals. That \nis one of the delivery systems. The other is part B, where the seniors \nof America are the only ones that the Federal Government pays a \nsignificant portion of an insurance policy for their primary care; that \nis, everything except hospital is the way I would define that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not find people in America buying a hospital \ninsurance policy and saying, well, I am covered for hospitals, and then \nhaving another company insure them for doctor visits and treatment that \nthey may need if they do not have to go to a hospital but they break \ntheir leg or get asthma, or whatever it may be. So we have these two \nthat are kind of the result of the way it started. We started one, and \nthen under Eisenhower we started another.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is correct. This is a relic of the 1960's \nand not consistent with the way health insurance is offered in the \nprivate sector today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, when the Senator spoke of restructuring, inherent \nin that and part of that thinking would be that we would look at both \nof these coverage systems together in an effort to give the seniors a \nbetter, more compatible with modern times system; is that correct?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Correct. Restructuring would have to address part A and \npart B. It is actually time for a clean sheet of paper and to say, we \nhave approximately $5,000--we will take a median figure--per person per \nyear to spend on health care for our elderly. Now, what is the best way \nto spend that $5,000 to produce the greatest possible benefit for the \nelderly and avoid the evils of cost shifting and tax increases that the \nSenator from Florida was talking about?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. Once again, I compliment him for \nhis remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I also yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I know the Senator just yielded the floor. Would he \nretake the floor for the purpose of a question?\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida for that question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like the Senator from Utah to take the floor for \nthe purposes of a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to respond in any fashion on the time of \nthe Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator's analogy of the telephone system is \na superb one. I would draw, in addition to the conclusion he did, \nanother conclusion, and that is the importance of having an integrated, \nstrategic approach to the structure of change for our communication \nsystems in America. If, for instance, in Hialeah, FL, they were still \nusing the system you described of the dial phone, whereas other parts \nof the country were using push button phones, and if there had not been \nan organized, consistent movement in an industry which has many \nproviders, we would not have arrived so rapidly at the benefit the \nSenator has just described.\n  My concern is that what we seem to be about here is saying that each \nsector of the health care system can be looked at as if it were an \nairtight compartment and changes made there did not have to take into \naccount changes in the rest of the system. I am concerned that we are \nabout to make a judgment that over the next 7 years, we can restrain \nMedicaid increases to 1.4 percent per capita against a history in which \nthey have been running in excess of 10 percent per year per capita and \nwhere the projection is that the private sector is going to be \nincreasing at 7.2 percent per capita, in spite of the deficiencies you \nhave outlined. Yet, we do not seem to have a specific plan of how we \nare going to achieve changes of that magnitude, cuts of $175 billion in \nMedicaid, the health care program for the indigent, and $256 billion in \ncuts in Medicare, a program for the elderly. Are you not concerned that \nwe are reaching the end result without, from the bottom up, having a \nclear plan of how we are going to do it, particularly how we are going \nto do it in a way that will be compatible with the rest of the health \ncare system, just as there was concern for the rest of the \ncommunications and telephone systems when we made those kinds of \nchanges?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Responding to the question, I point out that the slowing \nof the rate of growth in the health care costs that we are talking \nabout for Medicaid and Medicare is already going on in the private \nsector,\n and there is much we can learn from the private sector. It is the \nattempt to turn the public programs into an airtight compartment where \nthey are immune from the kinds of changes that are occurring in the \nprivate sector that has produced some of this.\n\n  I would suggest that the Senator take a long look at what has \nhappened in the State of Tennessee. He mentioned Medicaid. In the State \nof Tennessee, as I understand the numbers from the Governor of \nTennessee who called on me, Medicaid costs were increasing at the rate \nof 20-percent per year for over 8 years running. The then Governor of \nTennessee, a member of the Senator's party, decided that that would \nbankrupt the State and something had to be done about it.\n  Tennessee, as of January 1, 1994, moved to a system more compatible \nwith that which is normal in the private sector, and in calendar 1994, \ninstead of increasing at 20-percent per year, Tennessee increased their \nMedicaid costs at .12 percent--less than 1 percent. Almost .1 of 1 \npercent.\n  The TennCare solution in Tennessee has problems. I will not stand \nhere on the floor and say it does not. But it has demonstrated very \nclearly that moving towards the solutions already tried in the private \nsector can, and in that State's case, has produced a significant cost \ndifference.\n  When I talked to the current Governor of Tennessee, who happens to be \na member of my party, building on the actions of his predecessor, he \nsaid, if we are allowed continued waivers from the Federal guidelines, \nwhich waivers were granted to his Democratic predecessor, we can prove \nthat we can keep the growth of Medicaid in our State within the \nconstraints that are outlined in this budget resolution.\n  There are examples out there of how these changes are occurring in \nthe private sector. As the Senator says, not in isolation. They can \nmove into what has been the watertight compartment of Medicare and \nproduce the same results if we work together for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has consumed 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator from Utah responding to my \nquestions. I hope that this will be just one phase of a continuing \ndialog. We all share in the awareness that this is a critical issue in \nachieving not only health care objectives, but also the fiscal \nobjectives of a Federal Government that we in our future generations \ncan afford.\n  The question that we are debating here is one of method and the \ndegree in which this can be accomplished within individual programs, as \nopposed to requiring a more comprehensive approach in order to achieve \nthose results without unintended adverse consequences.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am more than happy to continue the \ndialog after I vote for the budget resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know we will return now to the \nDemocratic side.\n  While Senator Graham is on the floor, could I comment about the \nTennessee plan. I am clearly not the Senator from Tennessee. Senator \nFrist obviously knows a lot more about it than I do, and we are very \nproud of having him on our side as one of America's most renowned \nsurgeons.\n  Essentially, I went to a full 3-hour field hearing, Senator. Just to \nmention some of the facts that this transition in their State yielded, \nthey have 12 or 14 competing major HMO's in the State of Tennessee that \nnow cover all of the Medicaid people in the State.\n  Some of those HMO's have a small part, some have a big part. There \nare some where they overlap. There are some that do rural, and have \nmerged rural with urban to get a delivery system.\n  As Senator Bennett said, it is not a utopia yet and it may never be, \nbut interestingly enough, those people that run HMO's came to the \nhearing. At least the leaders of about five of them. They said it is \nworking. We are competing. The prices are not going up. They have \nleveled. In fact, in some instances, they are coming down.\n  They also indicated that more people are being covered for the \nMedicaid funding than ever before. And we stand worried about telling \nthe States precisely who to cover. We have heard that debate.\n  Should we put all the strings on because we are worried about \nGovernors? When we send them Medicaid we are saying, will they take \ncare of children, pregnant women, those that have mental illness? Some \nwant to go back with the same list of specificity, and Governors are \nsaying ``We will do that. We will match what we have been paying and we \nwill do that.''\n  I think it was a very good dialog. Maybe when there is an amendment \non Medicaid we can have more discussion about what is in this budget \nversus what are savings. Some are saying we should have assumed that \nMedicaid could grow at 10 percent every year ad infinitum. They say we \nwill have less Medicaid money, must be assuming the program would go \nunchanged, or perhaps a couple more decades.\n  I believe we would never have been able to afford that. I think we \nwould have changed it one way or another. Now we are changing it in \nsort of an orderly manner as part of this process.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \ninteresting dialog that just took place. I simply say to all within the \nsound of my voice that exactly what has been said is exactly what many \npeople on this side of the aisle are trying to get done.\n  That is, simply to say that while we think the general direction is \nacceptable, we happen to feel that the cuts are excessive, especially \nwhen we keep hearing about the possibility of a tax cut.\n  With that, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think that generally across the country, \nparticularly here in Washington, people if they are not careful often \ntend to lose the forest for the trees.\n  I am afraid that might be what we are doing just now on Medicare. The \n[[Page S7057]] previous discussion was on Medicaid, low-income health \nprogram that is a joint program financed by Washington, DC, and by the \nStates. I would like to focus my remarks on Medicare, the medical \nprogram for senior citizens.\n  As we look at the budget proposal, Mr. President, with its \nunprecedented reduction in health services for senior citizens, I think \nwe should start by remembering what life was like for older Americans \nbefore Medicare.\n  The fact is before we created Medicare our senior citizens lived in \nfear. Everyone over 60 knew that private insurance was shaky and \nexpensive at best, and would cost them more every year. A serious \nillness or even a common ailment that required treatment but did not \nthreaten life was not only a health problem but something that could \nreduce a whole family to poverty.\n  Today, Medicare has removed that fear from our lives. Those with \nthose memories have forgotten it ever existed. This month I visited the \nsenior citizens center in Great Falls, MT. The people at that center \nknow exactly what Medicare and Social Security mean to their lives. It \nmeans a little financial security, some faith that illnesses will be \ntreated, and that families will not be wiped out by costs.\n  Mr. President, 125,000 Montanans are eligible for Medicare, out of a \ntotal population of 856,000. Each knows exactly what Medicare means.\n  Listen to Margaret and Frank Jackson of Billings, MT, who wrote me \nthis statement last week:\n\n       Social Security and Medicare are not only necessary, they \n     are absolutely essential to our survival in Montana. Higher \n     costs such as higher property tax, increases in school \n     levies, fuel in a cold climate, and medicine take a toll. \n     There is just too much mouth at the end of our money. \n     Needless to say, additional cuts would put a great burden on \n     us.\n\n  The leadership now proposes something like $250 billion in Medicare \ncuts. It is staggering. This will reduce Medicare services nearly a \nquarter by the year 2002--reduce services by a quarter by the year \n2002. To add insult to injury, the House of Representatives would do \nit, in part, to pay for tax cuts for Americans who are already very \nwealthy. Think of it, Mr. President, a 25-percent cut in services to \nthe elderly to pay for tax cuts for Americans who are already very \nwealthy. Some in the Senate would do the same and go even further.\n  What would it mean if this happens? Montana Medicare beneficiaries \nwould pay up to $900 more a year in premiums, copayments and \ndeductibles. This will come out of their own savings and from their \nchildren, who are now scraping for money to send their children to \ncollege and to pay property taxes.\n  We would see thousands of operations and hospital stays put off. \nThousands of people would decide to go without home health care. All \nthat means, of course, is that they will suffer more serious, more \npainful, more expensive illness later on that early care could have \nprevented.\n\n\n                       effects on rural hospitals\n\n  And, as the Federal Government cut reimbursement, more rural \nhospitals would be pushed to the edge.\n  Some Montana hospitals will be forced to choose between serving their \npatients and remaining solvent. Others will simply close. Two Montana \nhospitals get nearly 80 percent of their revenue from Medicare, and \nmany are at 60 percent. This plan would hit them like a wrecking ball, \ncosting jobs and forcing people who need care to make long winter \ndrives to the cities. We have vast distances out in the country, and \nthis will be a big burden on them.\n  So overall, we can already tell what this plan would mean. It is \nsimple: less access to health care for senior citizens; for people with \ndisabilities; for Montana and all of rural America.\n  Now, it may well be that we need to make changes in the Medicare \nProgram. We must be realistic.\n  The answer is not, however, to simply approach Medicare reform as a \nbudget-cutting exercise, because we are talking about preserving \nessential health services for 125,000 senior citizens in Montana and 30 \nmillion seniors across America. We are talking about good, middle-class \nAmericans like the Jacksons. And above all, we must not use Medicare as \na piggy bank. Do not take money that buys health care for senior \ncitizens and use it for a tax break for rich individuals and big \ncorporations. That is disgraceful.\n  Perhaps some changes lie ahead. But if they do, they should be made \nfor one purpose, preserving essential health services for senior \ncitizens and people with disabilities. That is where we must draw the \nline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the Senator \nfrom Montana for his remarks and also, previous to him, the Senator \nfrom the State of Florida, the former Governor of Florida, who \nbasically as a Governor understands the matter of choosing fairness, \nequal sacrifice, shared sacrifice--call it what you will.\n  Certainly the Senator from Montana has simply emphasized very vividly \nand very well, in my opinion, the remarks that this Senator made \nearlier about the tremendous hit that this extraordinary cut in \nMedicare and Medicaid will have on rural America. Rural America needs \nto be heard, too.\n  I have heard a great deal in this Chamber during the budget debate \nabout shared sacrifice. We have to do this, and we have to do it in a \nfair manner of shared sacrifice. So that supposedly that term embodies \nthe thought that everyone is sharing and sharing equally in the \nreduction in spending to get us to the balanced budget by the year \n2002. I think earlier today, in the remarks made by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota with regard to what Republican commentator Kevin Phillips \nthought of fairness--who are the winners and who are the losers in this \nproposition?--Kevin Phillips, as well as any other national spokesman, \nhighlighted the unfairness of the Republican budget that is being \nattempted to be sold here as an instrument of shared sacrifice.\n  How fair is it and how fair are the sacrifices? I submit the \nRepublican budget gets a total of $431 billion in cuts from Medicare \nand Medicaid. Let me repeat that. Under this shared sacrifice budget we \nare being asked to approve and we will be asked to vote on upcoming, we \nwill be asked to vote down the reasonable proposal to make relatively \nsmall changes in the Republican budget, not changing balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002, I emphasize, and not changes with regard to \nraising any taxes. We are simply saying since the Republican budget is \nnot an instrument of shared sacrifice we should at least alleviate a \nportion of the hit on Medicare and Medicaid--and only a portion of it--\nin the interests of shared sacrifice.\n  I repeat, the Republican budget gets a total of $431 billion in cuts \nfrom Medicare and Medicaid. That is two-thirds of the Republican cuts \nin all entitlements. That is nearly 40 percent of the total spending \ncuts that the Republicans make in all programs.\n  Essentially being repetitious, the proposals by the Republicans that \nare being described here as necessary shared sacrifices are being \nshared primarily by our senior citizens and our least fortunate on \nMedicare, including those being adequately provided for in our nursing \nhomes.\n  I again repeat, the shared sacrifice we are being asked to approve \nhere, shutting out even reasonable proposals to reduce the hit on \nMedicare and Medicaid by $100 billion over 7 years, and taking that \n$100 billion out of the $170 billion tax cut pot that is part and \nparcel of the Republican budget that everybody likes to continue to \nignore, that is not equally shared sacrifice. That might be shared \nsacrifice, but it is not equally shared sacrifice.\n  I appeal once again to Members on both sides of the aisle to \nrecognize the proposal made by the minority is a reasonable one. It \nmakes a major step toward true shared sacrifice rather than meaningless \nwords that have been used here to allude to the Republican budget in \nthis regard.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from the State of Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the Republican budget now before the \nSenate makes severe cuts in some essential programs. I would like to \ndirect your attention to, first, the cuts in Medicare.\n  Medicare, of course, is the health insurance program that is provided \nfor our senior citizens. The Republican plan cuts $256 billion from \nthis program. This cut is three times larger [[Page S7058]] than any \nother Medicare cut in history, without any attempt to reform the health \ncare system which drives up the cost of Medicare.\n  What does this Republican cut mean to the average senior citizen who \nis on Medicare? It will mean about $900 per year in higher premiums, \nco-payments and deductibles--$3,200 over 7 years. For a senior couple \nthat totals an extra $6,400 in out-of-pocket costs. There are 641,000 \nMedicare enrollees in Alabama. Over the 7-year GOP budget, Alabama \nwould lose around $6 billion in Medicare funding.\n  Medicaid is different from Medicare. Medicaid is the program that \nprovides health care services to the poor and also provides nursing \nhome care for those who are not able to pay for it. The Republican plan \nwould cut $175 billion in Medicaid funding. Without Medicaid money \nfamilies could face nursing home bills of between $20,000 and $45,000 a \nyear. It is estimated that without Medicaid funding nursing home bills \nwould average $38,000 per year.\n  The Republican budget would raise taxes on low-wage, working families \nby increasing the average of such families' taxes by $1,400 a year. \nThere are 12 million working families that would be hit by this \nRepublican tax increase. This tax increase affected what is known as \nthe earned income tax credit. Former President Ronald Reagan once \ncalled the working family tax credit program the ``best pro-family, the \nbest job-creation measure to come out of the Congress.''\n  This tax increase would affect 309,328 working families in Alabama. \nNext, the Republican budget severely affects educational programs. It \nwould cut $1 billion in aid to fight guns, drugs, and violence in \nschools, known as the Safe and Drug-Free School Program; 39 million \nstudents and 94 percent of all school districts benefit from the Safe \nand Drug-Free School Program. One million college students per year \nwould lose their financial aid or have their aid cut dramatically--40 \npercent--under the Republican plan to freeze Pell grants, the basic \nopportunity educational grants.\n  The Republican budget would increase college loan costs for 4 million \nstudents each year. The average student could pay between $3,000 and \n$4,900 more for his or her education, depending on how long it takes to \nrepay the loan. Graduate and professional students likely would be \npaying as substantial amount, on average for their advanced education. \nIn Alabama the Republican cuts in college loans would affect 55,778 \nstudents.\n  I am working with several Senators on alternatives to the Republican \nbudget proposal. We can reduce spending and balance the budget in the \nsame time frame the Republicans have targeted--the years 2002--by \nfreezing most programs at 1996 levels and cutting less essential \nprograms than Medicare, Medicaid, education, and other essential \nprograms. A balanced budget can be achieved without having such a \ndramatic tax increase on those families in American that earn less than \n$28,000 a year.\n  I point out that the budget on the Republican side has $170 billion \nin the fund which is reserved for tax cuts. I do not feel that we can \nsacrifice the senior citizens, those in need of education, and the \nworking poor at the expense of a proposed tax cut that is coming down \nthe road at some later time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Alabama \nfor once again stating the concerns that many of us on this side of the \naisle have. Once again, his knowledge of the system, his understanding \nof what we should and should not do, and his dedication to make shared \nsacrifices means something fair was well taken.\n  Mr. President, I am about to yield to my friend and colleague, the \ncosponsor of the amendment before us, the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I remind all that in 5 minutes, or thereabouts, we will be going into \ncontrolled time per the previous agreement.\n  So I yield at this time 12 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, \nwith whatever time he uses after 2 o'clock within those limits be \ncharged to the time allotted to this Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, on Friday I had some comments to make about the \namendment that is pending before us and the budget resolution \ngenerally.\n  I am privileged to sit on the Budget Committee, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee is on the floor. As I said before, \nwhile we do not always agree, I always respect his intellect and his \ncommitment to try to do what he sees is right.\n  We have now a difference on approach, because I understand also that \nafter my comments it was suggested that I want to divide this country, \nand that perhaps my tactic is along those lines. I would raise a \nquestion. I mean, why is someone who takes one position harmonious and \nfor a unified approach, and someone who takes another position out to \ndivide? There are sides in this debate. The question about whether or \nnot we are going to cut spending is long past. It is a question of how \nwe are going to cut spending, and who is going to win and who is going \nto lose. Whose side will Government be on? It is a fair question, it is \na reasonable question, because there are choices being made.\n  One only need look at what is proposed by the House Republicans, and \nintimated by my friend in the Senate on the Republican side that \nsomeone is going to get a tax benefit, a lot of tax benefit, especially \nif you are in the substantially higher income brackets. So someone is \ngoing to have to pay for it, we know that, whether it is education, or \nhousing, or Medicare, as the discussion currently develops.\n  The Republican budget reflects a party philosophy, and a \nconstituency. The Republicans generally believe the answer to society's \nproblems is to make sure that the powerful have enough power, and more \nmoney goes to millionaires. That is evidenced by the fact that, if you \nmake $350,000 in a year, you get a $20,000 tax reduction. That is \npretty hefty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to finish, and then I will be happy to \nyield.\n  It is reflected here in this chart. It says the winners, $20,000 tax \nbreak; corporate subsidies still protected. I come out of the corporate \nworld, and I respect and appreciate what corporations have done by way \nof helping this country build, my corporation as well. But if you look \nat the earnings statements around the country these days, they look \npretty good. If you look at the stock market, it is pretty good. It \ndoes not look as if the corporations are starved for profits. Look at \nthe automobile companies. But we are protecting subsidies for oil and \ngas and others. And tax loopholes are still protected.\n  So even as we do this, we are asking those who are Medicare \nrecipients and those who, because of a situation in life, may be \nsubjected to having Medicaid, a program for the poor, be the only \ndevice by which they can get medical attention.\n  So what we look at is on balance, and we have heard the debate about \nreducing the growth and not cutting the programs, reducing the growth. \nThe fact of the matter is that, if there is to be a similar level of \nservice with the same options preserved, it is going to cost $6,400 for \na senior couple over the next 7 years as we pursue a balanced budget; \n$6,400 may not be a lot to the guy who makes $350,000, but to the \naverage couple, 75 percent of the senior citizens who are making \n$25,000 a year, whose income is $25,000 a year or less, $6,400 is an \nawful lot of money, and especially when on top of the--may I have the \nChair's attention; thank you--especially on top of the fact that the \naverage senior citizen is also paying over 20 percent of their income \nfor health care needs that are not provided by Medicare.\n  We know that there is a cut in education funding, that it is going to \ncost those who have to borrow to go to college substantially more as a \nresult of the cuts there and the elimination of the earned income tax \ncredit.\n And it is going to be a terrible penalty for families making $28,000 a \nyear or less--$28,000. Why, that is almost as much as, slightly more \nthan the refund that someone earning $350,000 is going to get by a \nlower tax rate.\n\n  So that is the situation. That is what we are looking at--a tax \nincrease for working families, more cost to go to \n[[Page S7059]] college, senior citizens being burdened with extra costs \non programs for which they have paid and paid handsomely for a lot of \nyears.\n  There is no getting around the concept that there are winners and \nlosers in this resolution. And the American people have a right to know \nhow they will be affected. But some Senators on the other side of the \naisle obviously do not like a discussion of winners and losers. Some \neven suggested, as I said earlier, that somehow the Democrats are \ntrying to divide the country. It is an outrageous charge and has to \nhave a response.\n  Mr. President, the way to unify this country is to treat everybody \nfairly. It is not to take away quality health care from our senior \ncitizens and use it to pay for tax cuts for the rich.\n  The way to unify the country is to relieve the financial burdens \nwherever possible on working families. It is not to increase taxes on \nthese families and then again to give it to the wealthiest.\n  The way to unify the country is to give all Americans a chance to get \nan education. It is not to increase costs for students to pay for tax \ncuts for the rich.\n  If our country is going to pull together, Government must stand with \nordinary Americans even if they are not rich, even if they do not have \nlobbyists representing them and even if they do not have the strong \npolitical connections.\n  When our friends on the Republican side say we are trying to divide \nthe country, I suggest they take a look in the mirror and see whether \nor not trying to take from one group that can least afford it to help \nrelieve the tax burden on the wealthier group is unifying. I do not \nthink so.\n  It is obvious that ordinary Americans, already furious at the \nGovernment, think they are being ignored. They think Government does \nnot care about them. Some even see the Government as an enemy. To \nreverse this disturbing trend, Government has to do a better job of \nstanding up for ordinary Americans.\n  That is what we Democrats are trying to do. We want Government to \nstand with middle-class families, with seniors, and with our young \npeople. If we invest in our young, we are investing in the next \ncentury, trying to provide the leadership that is going to make this \nthe competitive Nation we once were. It is going to give us a health \ncare standard we once had that led the world. We are not among the top \nfew nations with longevity. We are not among the top few nations with \nhealth care facilities that deal with mental illness. We are not where \nwe used to be. And that is what we are trying to do, we the Democrats. \nWe want Government to stand with middle-class families, with seniors, \nand with our young people. These are the people who are the backbone of \nthis great country of ours. To a great extent they are the country, and \nit is time for them to be treated that way by their Government and in \nthis debate.\n  Mr. President, the pending Rockefeller-Lautenberg amendment reflects \nthis approach. Its message is simple. It says let us eliminate tax cuts \nfor the rich and apply the savings to Medicare and Medicaid. And once \nagain I remind my colleagues who benefits from Medicare: 75 percent of \nthe beneficiaries have incomes of $25,000 or less; 35 percent of them, \n$10,000 a year or less; 25 percent of those people rely solely on their \nSocial Security checks. On top of this, Medicare recipients pay 21 \npercent of their income in out-of-pocket health care costs--21 percent. \nSo if an average income is $25,000, they are paying over $5,000 in out-\nof-pocket health care costs. They have worked their entire lives, these \nsenior citizens, and paid into the Medicare Program. In turn, they have \nbeen promised health security through Medicare.\n  The budget resolution breaks that promise, and it does so, again, to \nmake sure that it is balanced off with tax cuts on the other side.\n  The final chart rather sums it all up. Senior couples on fixed \nincomes get a $6,400 tax increase for every senior couple, and on the \nother side it is a $20,000 tax break for people earning $350,000 a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, it is not fair to our Nation's seniors. It is also \nunfair to millions of middle-class families, and as we all know, there \nare millions of working parents in America who help out their own \nparents who are retired. These parents are struggling hard enough to \nmake ends meet for their own children. And this budget will shift \nanother heavy financial burden on their shoulders. They will have to \npay more of their hard-earned money for health care expenses for their \nparents. It is not right.\n  We have heard a lot of denials from the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Time yielded to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I ask the manager for another minute, please?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield a minute. I say to all of my \ncolleagues, for every moment that I yield, you are taking time away \nfrom the 10 minutes for which the minority leader has asked, but I \nyield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. One minute, and I will be finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is pretty simple. The Republicans cannot have it \nboth ways. They cannot claim the budget resolution is going to balance \nthe budget when it leaves out the Social Security trust fund, but we \nare not in that debate right now.\n  Well, if so, then it also will provide for the tax cuts. If some now \nclaim the resolution does not include a tax cut, they must be saying \nthat it will not really balance the budget.\n  For all practical purposes, this resolution does include a tax cut, a \ntax cut that will almost certainly provide disproportionate tax breaks \nfor millionaires and other wealthy individuals.\n  Nobody ought to be fooled by these denials.\n  Mr. President, this is what my Democrat colleagues stand for. It is \nthe right thing to do for our country, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My recollection is that there were two Democrat \nSenators who spoke in a row. I wonder if I might do that now. I will \njust speak for 4 minutes and then I will yield 10 minutes, 15 minutes \nto the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I think that is fair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey said you cannot have it both ways. I think he was referring to \nus, the Republicans. But, as a matter of fact, it is better referring \nto the Democrats and in particular the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey. He cannot have it both ways, either. They cannot have it both \nways.\n  Now, the theme song is we are all for balancing the budget. We are \nall for balancing the budget. The days are long past when we are \nworried about balancing the budget. We are all for it, right. But any \ntime we propose something that will get us there, it is not the right \nway.\n  Where is their way? Where is the way of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey? He does not want to touch Medicare, I assume. He does \nnot want to touch Medicaid, I assume. He does not want to touch \nanything we touch, I assume. Where is their balanced budget? You cannot \nhave it both ways.\n  Mr. President, in addition, let me suggest these are the facts about \nMedicare. What the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is talking \nabout in Medicare is somebody's set of facts, somebody's assumptions. \nSomebody, somewhere, somehow--probably the White House or the OMB--who \nis against this budget, they have come up with all these scare numbers \nfor the senior citizens.\n  But senior citizens, Americans--not just senior citizens--Americans, \nwe want to preserve the Medicare system. We want to preserve it for you \nwho are on it, for seniors yet to come, and for hard-working, middle-\nincome people who are 45 years old. And, yes, if we could, we would \nlike to protect it for our children.\n  And so we recommend that we fix it precisely the way the trustees--\nfour of whom work for the President, two of whom are citizens--told us \nwe ought to [[Page S7060]] do it. No more, no less. No Republican \ninventions, just pure, basic facts as given to us by six trustees who \nsay it will not be here for long unless we fix it.\n  Now, unless you want to cross America and go to every senior citizen \ncenter and say, our plan is to preserve it for the next 3 or 4 or 5 \nyears and we just do not know what is going to happen after that, but \nfor now we are against what Republicans are doing because we want to \nscare you to death, well, if that is the case, more rhetoric of the \ntype we are hearing today may do it, excepting seniors have caught on.\n  They have even caught on to mailings that this group, formerly known \nas the Roosevelt Group, the Committee for the Preservation of Social \nSecurity and Medicare--if you have ever seen a scandal sheet, look at \nthat. Do you know what they do, Mr. President? They wait for us to say \nwe need to fix something for seniors and they say, ``We found a big, \nbig bank account. We will send these pretty papers out,'' $10 a head \nfor seniors. ``Man, send it in. We'll save you.''\n  Do you know how much they are apt to get just from that little \nthing--2 million Americans at $10? Just do the arithmetic. How much is \nthat? Twenty million dollars--while they feed and prey on American \nseniors.\n  Well, we are not going to do that. We are just going to tell you that \nyou cannot have it both ways. You cannot have it both ways, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey; you cannot have it both ways, the Senator from West \nVirginia; you cannot have if both ways, Democrat Senators. You either \ntell us how you will fix this budget --unless you decide it is not \nworth fixing, $275 billion deficits are OK, let our kids pay for it, \nlet our salaries suffer, let our standard of living suffer, but we will \nnot take a stand on anything that is difficult.\n  Now, these are the facts: Medicare per capita growth rates in the \nSenate budget resolution, per capita Federal Medicare spending, will \ngrow from about $4,350 in 1995 to about $6,300 in 2002. I say to my \nfriend from New Hampshire, my arithmetic says that is a 50-percent \nincrease. No. Well, no, let us be right, a 49-percent increase, an \naverage per capita growth of 5.4 percent.\n  Under current law, Medicare spending will grow from about $4,350 in \n1995 to $7,800 in 2002. This is a 7-year increase of 80 percent, while \nwe think we can deliver health care to seniors with a 50-percent \nincrease. I do not think that is a cut. And, frankly, all those numbers \ncited both by my distinguished and dear friend, Senator Heflin from \nAlabama, and Senator Rockefeller on how much each senior is going to \npay is pure, utter speculation. I would call it worse than that, but I \nunderstand the Senate rules, so I will call it speculation. Because it \nis not necessarily the case. We have had Senator after Senator that are \ninformed on this explain why it is not the case, why it does not have \nto be the case.\n  Now, frankly, let me close by saying, you cannot have it both ways, I \nsay to the Senator. You said, how are we going to cut is the real \nissue. And I say, ``How are you going to cut?'' That is the real issue. \nNot how we are going to cut; how you are going to cut.\n  So to just stand here and talk about what we are doing and at the \nsame time try to confuse the American people that you are for a \nbalanced budget just will not work. I am sure the American people will \nnot buy it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, has the Senator from New Mexico yielded?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yielded 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I want to compliment the Senator \nfrom New Mexico on his summary of the debate and especially the \narguments made on the other side, because it really is a they-want-it-\nboth-ways argument that they have been making here and, unfortunately, \nin the process they have left the senior citizens holding the bag.\n  Because, as the trustees have pointed out to us and as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico pointed out, this is what we are worried about. This is \nthe bankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund. It occurs. It occurs as a \nresult of the fact that we will be taking more out of the fund than is \nbeing put into the fund or that the benefits are increasing, the costs \nof it are increasing so fast that we cannot maintain the fund in its \npresent structure. And we have to address this if we are going to \naddress the solvency of the trust fund and if we are going to have the \nsenior citizens of this country have an insurance plan.\n  Now, the proposal from the Democratic Members is to take $100 billion \nof projected interest savings that we may get as a result of getting to \na balanced budget, which they will not vote for, and somehow just throw \nthis back at the plan. Well, that has not worked in the past.\n  The trustees told us rather specifically that if you are going to get \nthe trust fund into solvency, you have to fundamentally reform the \nMedicare health care system. We can look at the history of these \nvarious let's-tinker-at-the-edges approaches of throwing money at the \npresent proposal.\n  Under the Democratic proposal we see that this line here, which is \nthe chart of spending under Medicare as compared to the estimated \nsavings that we would get from different action than has been taken \nover the years. We have not in any way limited the rate of growth of \nspending in the Medicare trust fund. The Medicare trust fund continues \nto expand after we do this ``let's-throw-some-more-money-at-it'' \nproposal such as the Democrats have proposed today.\n  The fact is, unless you control the rate of growth of spending in the \nMedicare trust fund by fundamentally reforming the way that health care \nis delivered for seniors and giving seniors more choices in the area of \nhealth care, you are never going to get to this chart, which is the \nchart that we are concerned about, where the line levels out so that it \ndoes not go into bankruptcy.\n  And that has been told to us not by Republicans or Democratic Members \nof the Senate but by the trustees of the trust fund speaking to us \nabout their concern about where the trust fund is going.\n  And this leads to the second point that I want to make, which is that \nthe reason the Medicare trust fund is in such trouble is because of the \nfact that Medicare is a 1960's health care system going into the year \n2000 and beyond. It is not relevant any more to the way that health \ncare is efficiently and effectively delivered, with quality, in this \ncountry. That is shown by this chart which reflects the fact that \namongst the private sector where health care costs have stabilized and \nin fact the health care premium costs have come down, 64 percent of the \nprivate sector individuals today are now in managed care; whereas, 94 \npercent of senior citizens remain in fee for service.\n  Well, that is reasonable from a cultural standpoint, because seniors \ngrew up with fee for service. They grew up with the concept of having a \nspecific doctor that they could go to. In the fifties and sixties, that \nwas the only type of health care delivered in this country.\n  But as we move through the nineties, as we move through the years \n2000 and beyond, it is very clear that health care delivery, to be \nefficient and to be of high quality, is shifting gears in this country, \nand in the private sector the people are opting into a fixed-cost \nsystem where they go to a provider, either a group of doctors or a \nconsortium, an HMO or PPO, and, as a result, the cost of health care \nhas dropped dramatically, as is shown by this next chart.\n  We have seen that in the private sector, as HMO's and the managed \ncare, fixed-fee cost insurance approach have been pursued by the \nprivate sector and increased in participation, as was shown earlier, \nthe cost of health care has dropped precipitously in the private sector \nby more than 50 percent.\n  We are not talking about cuts here again. We are not talking about \ntaking the Medicare Program and cutting anything, as the Senator from \nNew Mexico pointed out so eloquently. We are talking about dramatic \nincreases in the Medicare system, but what we are talking about is less \ndramatic increases than are projected. We are talking about a system \nthat is now growing at 10.5 percent annually and trying to get its rate \nof growth down to 7 percent annually.\n  What does it mean in dollar terms? It means this year on a per capita \nbasis, a Medicare recipient will receive $4,300. In the year 2002, it \nwill be $6,300. Those [[Page S7061]] are significant increases. And $96 \nbillion more will be spent on Medicare in the year 2002 than is being \nspent in this year. So we are not talking about cutting anything. We \nare talking about slowing the rate of growth of Medicare.\n  What we have seen in the private sector is by going into managed care \nproposals, they have slowed the rate of growth. They have gotten their \ninflation rates down dramatically just in the last 3 years.\n  Will we realize those types of savings in the Medicare system? No, \nobviously not. But will we realize significant savings, significant \nenough to get that 3-percent difference that we are looking for from 10 \npercent rate of growth down to 7-percent rate of growth? Yes, we will, \nby going through the reform programs we are talking about.\n  On our side, we are not talking in generalities and we are not \ntalking in terms of politics, we are talking in terms of substance, \nsubstantive reforms in the Medicare system to ensure its solvency, and \nwe are making proposals in this area, something we are not hearing from \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  As we just saw on that last chart, we see that the premium costs as a \nresult of going into HMO have dropped dramatically so we can realize \nthat 7-percent cut. They dropped from a 10.5-percent rate of growth of \npremiums in the private sector in 1992 down to a minus 1.2 percent last \nyear in the private sector. What a huge drop. We do not have to go that \nfar in the public sector, we just have to get the 10-percent line down \nto 7 percent and we have a solvent system and a responsible system, and \nwe will have made the savings and will have given seniors some \nopportunities they do not have today in the area of health care.\n  Some people say, ``Well, if seniors go into managed care, they are \ngoing to be treated more poorly.'' As a practical matter, the history \nis actually managed care is doing a better job of some of our chronic \nillnesses than fee for service is. Right here, managed care is doing a \nbetter job in diabetes, a better job in heart conditions, a better job \nin high blood pressure, a better job in high cholesterol, a better job \nin weight problems. Why? One of the things is in a managed care \natmosphere, they look very hard at preventive and wellness programs and \nseniors can benefit significantly from these types of programs.\n  What we are going to say to seniors is you do not have to go into \nHMO's, PPO's or managed care. We are not going to say they have to go \nthat route. We are going to create what is known as an economic \nincentive, market incentive. For some on the other side, the concept of \nmarketplace is an anathema, and they do not want to hear it in relation \nto health care.\n  If we use the marketplace, we can encourage seniors who are \ntraditionally in fee for service to move from fee for service into \nHMO's and PPO's and get better health care in the process and get the \nlower cost for the Federal Government in the process, a double win as \nwe go down that road.\n  This, I think, reflects the fact that we have also heard a lot about, \n``Well, if seniors go into the managed care system, you are going to \nfind that they have more difficult problems, that they have more \nsignificant problems than the population generally and therefore the \nsystem will be skewed and you can't do it.''\n  Well, that is old numbers, No. 1. That is old, old numbers before \nHMO's that they are using to cite those, before HMO's were effective \nand used a lot. Today, if we look at the current numbers we are seeing \nthat the HMO enrollees are diagnosed at an earlier stage than the \npeople who are in the fee-for-service system and in addition, that HMO \nenrollees generally have the same type of breakout of health care \nproblems as fee-for-service people.\n  So you do not have the creaming concept that you hear of this \nargument where HMO's are only going to take people who are well and all \nthe sick people will stay in fee for service. Our plan does not allow \nadverse selection, period, so it is not an issue. The fact is the \nnumbers are now showing us HMO systems are not adverse selecting \nanyway. So as a practical matter, that is not a problem.\n  So what we are suggesting is that, No. 1, look at the trustees' \nreport. Look at the trustees' report. It says that this system is \nfundamentally broke and that it has to be reformed, that you can no \nlonger take the Band-Aid approach and that you certainly can no longer \ntake a whole bunch of money and throw it at the system, as is proposed \nby our colleagues on the other side of the aisle by this amendment, \nthat it needs fundamental reform.\n  Second, what we are saying is we are proposing such reform. We are \nnot proposing such reform in the context of just budget savings, we are \nproposing such reform in the concept of delivering better care to our \nsenior citizens by giving them the opportunity to have the same type of \nplans that we as Members of Congress have.\n  That is basically what it comes down to. By saying to them we will \ngive you the opportunity to go out and purchase a fixed-cost plan, an \nHMO or a PPO and move out of fee for service and if you do that we are \nactually going to give you a percentage of the savings that you obtain \nfor yourself, let you keep it and, as a result, we are going to reduce \nthe cost, in the long run, to the Federal Government from 10 percent \ndown to 7 percent, a very attainable goal.\n  More importantly, we are going to make the trust funds solvent and we \nare going to give our seniors choices which they do not have today and, \nat the same time, we are going to give them the opportunity to go out \nin the marketplace and find health care in a variety of ways which the \nprivate sector is now using which helps us control costs.\n  So we are talking substance here is what it comes down to and, \nregrettably, on the other side of the aisle they are talking politics. \nWe are talking about reforming the Medicare system so it is solvent, \nthey are talking about politics of the next election. It is \nunfortunate, but that is the way it is broken out.\n  We are talking about balancing the budget so that our children are \nnot stuck with a country which is bankrupt, they are talking about \npolitics. These are our answers and our proposals and they are \nsubstantive. We await and hear a deafening silence for the proposals \ncoming from the other side, either on how you balance the budget or how \nyou correct the Medicare insolvency. We wait.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will hold my time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President I think we heard just an amazing discussion. \nObviously, the shared sacrifice provides and directs the senior \ncitizens into HMO's whether they want to be there or not. This side of \nthe aisle will not vote for that kind of a proposition.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the ranking member of the budget committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to continue my comments on the need to \nmake intelligent reforms to Medicare as part of an overall strategy not \nonly to keep the Medicare hospital insurance fund solvent, but also \nbecause of the impact Medicare has on our Federal budget deficit.\n  I very much want to participate in a bipartisan effort to balance our \nFederal budget by 2002, and as I said a few days ago, I believe \nMedicare must be on the table as we seek ways to reach that goal.\n  In my comments, I listed a number of Medicare reforms that I would be \nwilling to consider as part of a balanced package, and indicated I \nwould certainly be willing to look at other reforms as well.\n  Mr. President, it bears repeating that if we are to achieve a \nbalanced budget by 2002, or indeed by any target year, we need to make \nchanges to Medicare.\n  Put even more directly, the failure to include Medicare as part of a \nbudget package almost certainly dooms such an effort to failure, if not \nin the short term, then certainly in the long run.\n  As I also noted, I strongly prefer to make significant changes to \nMedicare as part of a broader effort to reform our health care system.\n  In that larger context, not only could we make more significant \nprogress in [[Page S7062]] stemming the increasing costs of the \nprogram, we would be far better able to address the underlying forces \nthat are increasing the costs of health care both in the public and \nprivate sector.\n  But, Mr. President, we do not have that luxury.\n  We apparently will not be debating and passing comprehensive health \ncare reform in the near future, and the failure to do so is not only a \ntragedy in human terms, it is also a lost opportunity for significant \ndeficit reduction.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, we must still make changes to Medicare, \neven without comprehensive health care reform.\n  Deficit reduction and a balanced budget require it.\n  However, Mr. President, two features of the proposed Medicare cuts \nput any effort to balance the budget at risk.\n  The first is an issue on which I commented a few days ago, namely the \nfailure to deal honestly with the American people on this subject.\n  This is being done in a number of ways--for example, by minimizing \nthe potential impact of the cuts or by suggesting that the proposed \nsavings can largely be achieved simply by moving to a managed care \napproach.\n  But a deliberate deception that is particularly troubling to me is \nthe representation that the reason we need to make changes is to \nMedicare to keep the program solvent.\n  The clear implication that is intended by that description is that \nany savings realized from cuts to Medicare will remain in the program.\n  Mr. President, that is a deliberate misrepresentation.\n  Yes, we need to make changes to Medicare, and yes part of the reason \nis that the trust fund that pays for one part of Medicare--the hospital \ninsurance program, known as part A--will be insolvent in 2002.\n  But that is not the whole story.\n  Changes are also needed to Medicare because of the impact that \nprogram has on the entire Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, this country is ready to sacrifice to reduce our \ndeficit.\n  In fact, I am struck by the willingness of so many to forego so much.\n  There is almost a physical need to do so.\n  I have seen this in the widespread opposition to the proposed tax \ncuts that both parties have offered.\n  And with respect to Medicare, I have seen it in the recognition by \nseniors that reforms are needed.\n  But, Mr. President, that willingness to sacrifice will evaporate if \nwe do not deal honestly with the American people.\n  We need to be straight with the American people, and especially our \nseniors as we ask them to support changes to Medicare.\n  If we do that, we will have that support.\n  Mr. President, the other feature of the proposed Medicare cuts that \ntroubles me is the potential for harm to one of the most vulnerable \ngroups in this country--the frail elderly.\n  Mr. President, to the credit of this body and our colleagues, for the \nmost part we have not heard the greedy geezer arguments made as a \nrationale for cutting Medicare.\n  But that argument is certainly made by some.\n  And it is true that there are retirees who are well off.\n  After a lifetime of hard work, there are seniors who have acquired \nsignificant savings, and have comfortable pensions.\n  Some of their assets come from equity in their homes, which they have \nlived in for decades.\n  But that is not the whole story. Millions of elderly are among the \npoorest of our country.\n  The median income of elderly households is less than half that of \nnonelderly households.\n  According to the Public Policy Institute, in general incomes rise \nfrom age 15 to age 50, and then\n decline steadily.\n\n  And incomes for the oldest old are by far the lowest of any age \ngroup.\n  Households headed by someone aged 75 or older had annual median \nincomes of less than $13,622 in 1992--$4,000 lower than the next lowest \nincome group, those of households headed by people between age 15 and \n24.\n  And over one-fourth of the elderly households have incomes of less \nthan $10,000 per year.\n  Mr. President, while the elderly are disproportionately poor, they \nalso spend far more on health care as a group than anyone else, and \nthis should not surprise us,.\n  What may be surprising to some, however, is just how much our seniors \ndo pay already even with the coverage provided by Medicare.\n  In 1995, the average older beneficiary will spend about $2,750 out-\nof-pocket for premiums, deductibles, copay- ments, and for services not \ncovered by Medicare.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that these costs do not include the \npotentially crushing costs of long-term care which can total nearly \n$40,000 in some areas for nursing home care.\n  Over the next 7 years, it is my understanding that even without the \nMedicare cuts being proposed as part of this budget resolution, \nMedicare beneficiaries can expect to spend more than $25,000 out of \npocket for health care costs.\n  This budget proposal before us could add $3,200 more to the total.\n  Mr. President, Medicare has done much to improve the lot of seniors.\n  According to the Public Policy Institute, prior to Medicare, only \nabout half of older Americans had any health insurance compared to 75 \npercent of those under 65.\n  Employer-provided health coverage was the exception, and most of \nthose with that coverage lost it once they retired.\n  If you wanted to buy private insurance, you were often denied \ncoverage on the basis of age or pre-existing conditions.\n  And those policies that were available were often unaffordable.\n  Without coverage, many simply did not seek care even when they needed \nit.\n  With the passage of Medicare in 1965, that picture changed \ndramatically.\n  The Public Policy Institute reports that the share of the elderly \npopulation not seeing a physician in a given year dropped from 32 \npercent in 1958 to 21 percent in 1976.\n  And there was a significant increase in access to hospital services.\n  Let me say a few words about this issue of shared sacrifice, which \nthe Senator from New Hampshire was just addressing.\n  Even with Medicare, though, for the\n   average senior citizen, often an older woman living alone, health \ncare is still very costly.\n\n  Our seniors spend about four times as much out of pocket on health \ncare as their younger relatives.\n  And those out-of-pocket costs consume an enormous portion of their \nincome.\n  For the average older American, out-of-pocket costs still use up $1 \nin every $6 of income.\n  And for those over age 85--the fastest growing segment of the \npopulation--$3 of every $10 of their income goes toward the cost of \ntheir health care.\n  Mr. President, if we did not have Medicare today, and older Americans \nwere forced to buy health care coverage from insurance companies, they \nwould have to pay much higher premiums.\n  The Public Policy Institute estimates that premiums for those aged 65 \nto 74 would range from $6,400 to $8,500, or, on average, up to half of \ntheir annual income.\n  Mr. President, the numbers that describe this issue are so impressive \nthat it is easy to frame our arguments around them.\n  But as many of my colleagues have noted, there is a human side to \nthose numbers, and as important as they are, they do not tell the whole \nstory.\n  I have received hundreds of letters on the proposed Medicare cuts.\n  Mr. President, they are not from well-to-do, retired corporate \nexecutives.\n  Many are older women, often living alone.\n  One older woman wrote to me from Merrill, which is in the northern \npart of Wisconsin.\n  Her letter is typical of many I have received.\n  She told me that she lives alone, and gets $573 per month from Social \nSecurity.\n  With that she pays the taxes and insurance on her home, as well as \nthe other costs of day-to-day living. She told me that she just does \nnot have enough money left over to pay for more health care.\n  For that woman, across-the-board increases in premiums or copayments, \n[[Page S7063]] Mr. President, will be brutal. She will be forced to \nmake terrible choices. She may have to ask herself if she can afford to \npay for prescription drugs or food. What about repairs to her home, \nlike fixing a leaky roof? What about the heating bill, Mr. President? \nMr. President, you know as well as I do, being from the northern part \nof this country, it gets very cold in Merrill, WI, and that is a brutal \nchoice to have to make.\n  Another older woman wrote to me. She lives in Milwaukee. She \nexplained that her memory is impaired because of various illnesses. She \nis sick and totally dependent on Medicare for health care. She did not \nsay what her income is, but if she is average, it is about $17,000 per \nyear.\n  At the level proposed here in the Senate, the cuts to Medicare could \nmean that she will pay another $3,200 in out-of-pocket costs over the \nnext 7 years, nearly $500 per year in additional health care costs on \ntop of the $2,500 she now pays. Mr. President, this was reflected as \nwell when I met with a delegation from Wisconsin at the White House \nConference on Aging. We visited about a number of items, including the \nabsolutely critical importance of long-term care reform. We talked \nabout the prospects of cuts to Medicare. Mr. President, those delegates \nto the White House Conference on Aging agreed that we do need to make \nsome changes to Medicare. They agreed, though, that we need to ``cut \nsmart'' but not ``cut mean.''\n  Mr. President, the risk with this level of Medicare cuts is that we \nwill ``cut mean,'' and those who are the least able to afford it, the \nmost vulnerable of our adult population--the frail elderly, will be \nasked to carry the bulk of our deficit reduction load.\n  Mr. President, I am willing, as I have said many times, to \nparticipate in a bipartisan process of which the primary goal will be \nto actually produce a balanced budget by the year 2002, or earlier. \nSome Medicare cuts should be part of that process; indeed, they have to \nbe part of that process.\n  But, Mr. President, I cannot support a plan that weakens the health \nsafety net for our poorest and frailest elderly--the very safety net \nMedicare was designed to provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 14 minutes to the cosponsor of the \namendment, the Senator from West Virginia, and the remaining time \nfollowing that to the minority leader for closing our section of the \ndebate when his turn comes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, let us review the record, the whole record.\n  When reckless Wall Street unrestraint brought this Nation to the edge \nof financial ruin, Republicans insisted that an ``invisible hand,'' \nAdam Smith's invisible hand, would help families, and restore their \njobs, their homes, their children and their savings. But alas, the \n``invisible hand'' was very much invisible. Unemployment lines snaked \nblocks long, banks went belly-up, plants were boarded up, homes and \nfarms went on the auction block. Bad times, hard times--nowhere harder \nthan in my State of West Virginia.\n  After the crash, Democrats took action to repair the all too visible \ndamage done by the Republican's stubborn refusal to address the needs \nof working families. Democrats worked to undo neglected banking \nregulation, disinvestment in education and training, lack of emphasis \nand lack of attention to national infrastructure building, to unstick \nstagnant wages, and pay down the staggering mountain of debt.\n  I could be talking about Franklin Roosevelt's redress of Herbert \nHoover's wrongheaded economics. But, no, I am recalling the reckless \nexcesses of the 1980's and the work we Democrats began in the last \nseveral years to undo that horrible damage done by the Republicans.\n  Our colleagues across the aisle have spent the last few days wringing \ntheir hands and gnashing their teeth over the debt that now hangs over \nour children. Oh, no curse ever visited upon the human race is worse, \nto listen to them talk one after the other. You cannot have it both \nways. They talk about the depletion of the Medicare trust fund, about \nthe need for pain and sacrifice.\n  I wonder how they failed to see the danger during the 1980's, when \nmassive tax cuts for the wealthiest fraction of the Nation tripled the \nnational debt. I will say that again--when massive tax cuts for the \nwealthiest fraction of the Nation, corporate and private, tripled the \nnational debt. ``You cannot have it both ways,'' they said. They sure \ntried in 1980, when billions were borrowed against the next generation \nto finance savings and loan bailouts. Did they forget about that one? A \nlittle oversight on the part of the Republicans. And we are still \npaying for it. People out there do not forget about that. It is a \nRepublican legacy. When tax loopholes were opened for junk bond binges, \nwhere was their concern about the debt being passed on to the next \ngeneration all during that period?\n  I think the greatest scandal of my time in Congress was the S \nbailout period, courtesy of the other side. Talk about passing on debt \nto future generations. I never heard a word about that in the 1980's or \nearly 1990's, or even up until last year. I wonder where the urgency \nand concern last year and the year before was when Democrats were \ncutting the first trillion off of that deficit. The first deficit \nreduction in decades, and not one Republican in either House voted for \nit. You cannot have it both ways, they say. Not one Republican was for \nlifting a trillion dollars in debt off of the next generation.\n  I wonder where was the passion and the compassion for the next \ngeneration when we had a chance last year to pass health care reform. \nWe had a chance to stop cost shifting and all of the things that have \nexploded our health care system out of sight. The Republicans could not \neven wait to savage that one, because it was put forward by Bill \nClinton. They called it socialized medicine and Government medicine. We \nheard it all the time. I will not pull out my Blue Cross/Blue Shield \ncard like I usually do. But Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage, which is \nwhat most Members of Congress have, is not a Government-run health \nprogram. But we are paying the price now. They overwhelmingly condemned \nhealth care reform. Where were they then? Health reform that would have \nreined in costs without slashing services and quality.\n  Instead we heard all of those passionate speeches denouncing price \ncaps, which they now propose. ``You cannot have it both ways,'' they \nsaid. Denouncing limits on choice of a doctor, which they now are ready \nto force on seniors. Oh, yes, if seniors pay more, it will be \ndifferent. Those who can afford it, will have a choice. Those who can \nnot afford the extra costs will not be able to keep their lifelong \ndoctor. But the fee-for-service system which the Republicans so \nglorified last year, they could not stop talking about the glory of \nchoice, the glory of choice, it will not be available to all seniors \nunder their Medicare budget.\n The glory of choice. We do not hear it this year. You have to pay more \nfor it, if you are a senior.\n\n  They talk about 90 percent of their tax cuts going to families \nearning less than $100,000. I would like to bring up a point on that. \nThey talk about $100,000 and where their tax cut would go once they \nhave the $170 billion left over, after this is all over. I would like \nto point out two things: First, the average West Virginia senior has an \nincome of about $10,700 year. To him or her, $100,000 is rich. Real \nrich.\n  Second, and I hold up the Republican bill here, there is not anything \nwritten into a bill. It is a sense of the Congress. A sense of the \nCongress that 90 percent of the recipients of any tax cuts--think that \nmeans something--``any tax cuts?'' Think they are thinking about tax \ncuts for the rich which must go to the middle class?\n  A sense of the Congress. Mr. President, you and I both know that \nanything that is a sense of the Congress or a sense of the Senate is \nnot worth the paper it is written on.\n  But most of all, I wonder how anyone can look at this budget proposal \nand call its authors courageous? A budget scheme which asks everything \nof seniors, of students, of children, and the disabled, and gives more, \nand so much more, to the most secure, the most well off, the biggest \ncompanies and the most powerful interests.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a very quick question?\n  [[Page S7064]]\n  \n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator will complete his remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say to the Senator from California that I \nhave only 14 minutes, and I have a lot to say.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is so fast. I wonder if the Senator would yield, \nbecause he has just hit such a strong point.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Please proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I went home and met with my seniors in \nhospitals.\n  And when we say, whose side are you on, this is the question of the \nmoment. They looked at me and they said, Senator, this is where my \nquestion comes in, did we not have a consensus, an agreement, in the \nnational Government, that we wanted to make sure our elderly were \ntreated with respect and dignity, and we would not have bag ladies \nwalking around the streets? And we would not have sick people, elderly \npeople, because we, in fact, respected them.\n  So when the Senator asks, whose side are you on, I ask my friend this \nquestion: Does this Republican budget not repeal a national consensus \nthat we should treat our elderly with dignity and respect and not force \nthem to choose between buying food and going to the doctor?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It not only does that, it not only repeals that \nnational compact, but I have here the Social Security law. These are \nthe Social Security laws.\n  If we turn to page 625 of the Social Security law, title 18, Medicare \nis called ``Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled.'' Senior \ncitizens are going to have to pay out of their Social Security COLA the \nincreased costs of Medicare because of what the folks on the other side \nof the aisle are proposing.\n  They say it has nothing to do with Social Security. This is a Social \nSecurity cut, because they will not be able to spend it on anything \nelse but higher Medicare costs. This is the Social Security law. This \nis the health insurance for the aged and the disabled. That is called a \ncut in Social Security in any West Virginians' home who is elderly, \nthat I know of.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from California.\n  How can it be courageous to ask those with the least to pay the bills \nracked up by those who already have so much?\n  Yes, we all want to balance the budget. Yes, we all want to balance \nthe budget. And, we have offered amendments that would still balance \nthe budget by 2002. This amendment does not subtract one single thing--\nnot one dime--from the effort to balance the budget.\n  In 1993 we went to bat when we were in charge. Now they are in \ncharge. Let them go to bat, but not take the bat and crush so many \nvulnerable people in our country.\n  We have seen this before. Economic voodoo that asks working families \nin places like West Virginia to shoulder the load while providing a \nwindfall for the well-heeled.\n  Mr. President, I would just insert and would ask this be included in \nthe Record the piece of paper, which we have not talked much about, \nMedicaid. This has been a Medicare debate. But Medicaid is included in \nthis amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Who loses if Medicaid is dismantled into a block grant?\n       Low income children. About 18 million of them will lose \n     their health insurance coverage.\n       Low income women. About 8 million of them will lose their \n     health insurance coverage.\n       Low income disabled. About 6 million of them will lose \n     their health insurance coverage.\n       Low income elderly. About 4 million of them will lose their \n     health insurance coverage.\n       Community spouses. The wives or husbands of nursing home \n     patients covered by Medicaid will no longer be protected \n     against impoverishment.\n       Private practice (fee for service) physicians. States will \n     no longer have to pay for physician services at rates that \n     give Medicaid patients access to private physicians. Instead, \n     states will channel all of their payments for physician \n     services to managed care plans, which may or may not contract \n     with physicians now servicing Medicaid enrollees, and which \n     may or may not pay the physicians with whom they contract \n     adequately.\n       Community health centers and rural health clinics and their \n     workers. States will no longer be required to reimburse them \n     for their costs of treating Medicaid patients. Instead, \n     states will channel all of their payments for outpatient \n     services to managed care plans, which may or may not contract \n     with these clinics, and which may or may not choose to pay \n     adequately those with whom they do contract.\n       Teaching hospitals and their workers. States will no longer \n     be required to pay them at ``reasonable and adequate'' rates \n     for treating Medicaid patients. Instead, states will channel \n     all of their payments for hospital care to managed care \n     plans, which may or may not choose to contract with teaching \n     institutions, and which may or may not choose to pay \n     adequately those with whom they do contract.\n       Children's hospitals and their workers. States will no \n     longer be required to pay them at ``reasonable and adequate'' \n     rates for treating Medicaid patients. Instead, states will \n     shift all of their payments to managed care plans, which may \n     or may not choose to contract with children's hospitals, and \n     which may or may not choose to pay adequately those with whom \n     they do contract.\n       Public hospitals and their workers. States will no longer \n     be required to pay them at ``reasonable and adequate'' rates \n     for treating Medicaid patients. Instead, states will shift \n     all of their payments to managed care plans, which may or may \n     not choose to contract with these hospitals, and which may or \n     may not choose to pay adequately those with whom they do \n     contract.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Republicans are clearly headed toward a Medicaid \nblock grant. On Wednesday in the Finance Committee we are meant to be \nmarking up a welfare reform bill that will be all block grants. It will \nall be block grants. They will say it is not, but it is. They are all \nfor it. Some of them who were not last year are this year.\n  Let me list a few of the consequences of a Medicaid block grant. No \nlonger will 18 million children have a guarantee of health insurance. \nNo longer will 8 million low-income women have a guarantee of health \ninsurance. Sure, some States may do it, other States will not. About 6 \nmillion low-income disabled will lose their health insurance coverage.\n  Moving back to Medicare. Medicare is a critical element of a senior's \nSocial Security. Millions of seniors depend on their monthly Social \nSecurity checks to buy food, to pay the rent, to buy prescription \ndrugs, and pay their utilities.\n  Those same Social Security recipients depend on the Medicare Program \nfor health insurance coverage, Medicare coverage that they contributed \nto all of their working lives.\n  Now we are going to say that seniors who worked hard all their lives, \nand planned their retirements taking into account their Social Security \nand Medicare benefit, that we will pull the rug out from under them.\n  We cannot have it both ways, they say. Boy, are they making a case \nagainst themselves.\n  Republicans have promised not to touch Social Security.\n  In fact, before last year's election, the Republicans also said they \nhad no intention of cutting Medicare benefits. I quote Majority Leader \nDole:\n\n       President Clinton and Vice President Gore are resorting to \n     scare tactics * * * falsely accusing Republicans of secret \n     plans to cut Medicare benefits.--Washington Post, November 6, \n     1994.\n\n  And from the head of the Republican National Committee, Haley \nBarbour:\n\n       The outrage, as far as I'm concerned is the Democrats' big \n     lie campaign that Contract with America would require huge \n     Medicare cuts. It would not.\n\n  Republicans were not going to cut Medicare. That is what they said. \nBut that is certainly not what they are doing. The Senate budget \nresolution cuts Medicare by $256 billion and the Contract With America \nbudget resolution cuts Medicare by $270 billion.\n  And, because of the way they plan to cut Medicare benefits--by \nshifting health costs to seniors--seniors are going to see their Social \nSecurity COLA's reduced by half. My colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, referred to this last Friday as a stealth Social \nSecurity cut. And, I could not agree more.\n  We do not yet know how the Senate Republicans plan to cut Medicare, \nbut we do know what the House Republicans are thinking about. I will \noutline just a few of their ideas to cut Medicare by making seniors pay \nmore. [[Page S7065]] These proposals are all taken directly from the \nHouse Republican Budget Committee document.\n  First, there is a mandatory managed care proposal. Under this \nproposal, seniors would have to pay more if they went to a hospital or \ndoctor that was not in the Medicare network. Under this plan, seniors \nwould not have a choice of signing up for managed care. Their \nenrollment in this Medicare managed care program would be automatic and \nmandatory.\n  Another Republican proposal would increase premiums for new Medicare \nbeneficiaries who choose fee-for-service. New Medicare beneficiaries \nwould pay a part B premium that is $20 a month higher if they choose \nMedicare fee-for-service.\n  Under another Republican proposal, the Medicare deductible for \nphysician services would be doubled, from $100 to $200 and then indexed \nfor inflation.\n  And, there has been a lot of talk about handing out Medicare \nvouchers. Under the Republican plan, Medicare would be capped and \nvouchers handed out. The government would make a standard contribution \nand seniors would have to make up any price differences between the \ngovernment voucher and the price of their health insurance. The House \nBudget Document says ``Medicare could continue to offer the traditional \nMedicare benefit plan * * * [but] most likely, the beneficiary would \nhave to pay an amount in addition to the voucher.''\n  Next, the Republicans want to require new copayments for home health \ncare, lab services, and skilled nursing home care.\n  Finally, the Republicans favor an across-the-board hike in every \nsenior's part B premium which is currently $46.10 a month.\n  Day after day, the Republicans have come to the Senate floor and \ndenied that they are cutting Medicare.\n  Mr. President, when I talk to seniors in West Virginia about the \nabove proposals and the increased costs that they are going to have to \npay, they understand that their Medicare benefits are going to be cut. \nThey see cuts in their Social Security benefits.\n  The Republicans can talk about the billions of dollars that they are \ngoing to allow Medicare to increase by, but I want to talk about the \naverage West Virginia senior getting by on a fixed income of about \n$10,700 a year.\n  Under the Republican budget resolution, seniors living on fixed \nincomes are going to see half of their Social Security COLAs get eaten \nup by new Medicare charges--that is a cut.\n  When half of the seniors in West Virginia who live in rural areas \nrisk having their rural hospital shut its door--that is major cut in \nservices.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ntremendous discipline when it comes to staying on message. They can \nrepeat, and repeat, and repeat that these Medicare cuts are not really \ncuts at all. They can say over and over and over again that there are \nno tax cuts in their budget resolution. But anyone who reads this \nbudget resolution will see the $170 billion that has been set aside for \ntax cuts and the $256 billion cut in Medicare and the $175 billion cut \nin Medicaid.\n  My amendment will put money back into the pockets of senior citizens. \nMy amendment says that we are not going to balance the budget and pay \nfor tax cuts by gutting Medicare and making seniors pay more.\n  This amendment is about setting priorities. If this amendment was \nadopted, the budget resolution would still achieve balance by 2002. \nThis amendment says that health care and long-term care for seniors, \nand health care for children and the disabled, should not be destroyed \nso that we can hand out tax cuts to the wealthy. This amendment would \nmake sure that millions of working families and retirees who depend on \nMedicare and Medicaid for their health care and long-term care needs \nwould not be left out in the cold and swamped with huge health bills.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment and tell \nthe American people loud and clear that we in the Senate have our \npriorities right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired. The 8 remaining minutes has been given to the minority leader.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, Senator Coats. I assume that would be followed by \nthe minority leader with his time, and I would wrap up with the \nremainder of the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think the Senate's debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment a few moments ago was a turning point in this session \nof Congress--perhaps and hopefully, a turning point in the economic \naffairs of our country. It was important not for its disappointing \nfinal vote but for the issues that it clarified.\n  During that debate, opponents of the balanced budget amendment again \nand again challenged those who supported it: If we really want a \nbalanced budget, they would say, propose one. One Member of this body \nput it like this: ``Let Senators get to work, to show Americans we have \nthe courage this amendment presumes that we lack.''\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment pressed that argument as \nhard and as far as they could. They threw down a gauntlet before a \nwatching Nation. Mr. President, this week, Republicans have picked it \nup. And those who made that challenge have fled from the field--\nproposing nothing of their own. They revealed that their point in the \nbalanced budget debate was not a conviction but an alibi.\n  It is a terrible, disturbing thing, to have your bluff called before \nan entire country. That is precisely what has happened to the \nDemocrats. Their bluff has been called. Their call for ``Go ahead and \npropose one,'' was taken up by Republicans. We have proposed one.\n  Thanks to the Republican 7-year budget, we can now see our way clear \nto a balanced budget. After 40 years of wandering in the desert of \ndeficit spending, we are finally destined for the promised land of \nbalanced budgets.\n  There is courage in this budget--courage we have not seen for \ndecades. Courage that makes this a historic moment. But, if we are \nhonest, it is courage without alternatives. The status quo may be \ncomfortable, but it is not sustainable. Because the road we are on, \nwhile it may seem wide and easy, ends with a cliff, and the fall will \nbe disastrous for our economy, disastrous for our people, including our \nseniors, disastrous for our children and for the Nation's future.\n  Mr. President, we have come to the beginning of the end of deficit \nspending in America. We have come to this place because there is no \nalternative. Two decades of promises, two decades of rhetoric, budget \nproposals, budget deals, tax increases, unfulfilled promises, and \nspending cuts, all these have failed. This is the best argument for a \nbalanced budget amendment, defeated for the moment by just one vote.\n  So we turn to this effort, this courageous effort, let me say to the \nSenator from New Mexico, the only effort, the only game in town is the \nRepublican budget proposal.\n  No one has proposed anything different. If you do not like this, you \nare walking away from the debate. The President has abdicated his \nleadership on this most critical of all issues facing our Nation. \nLikewise, Democrats have abdicated leadership on this, the most \ncritical of all issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Indiana has \nexpired.\n  The minority leader is recognized for 8 minutes, the time remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana. If you listened, you heard one \nthing that is completely unrelated to what is addressed in this \namendment. To listen to the Senator from Indiana, you would think that \nthis amendment was going to add somehow to the deficit; that it was \ngoing to somehow change the parameters of this budget resolution; that \nsomehow it was going to move back the date of the balanced budget goal \nto a time beyond 2002.\n  Mr. President, that has nothing whatsoever to do with what we are now \nconsidering in this amendment. There is no disagreement on a balanced \nbudget. There is no disagreement, at least for most of us, on what date \nwe ought to set for a balanced budget. But there are fundamental \ndisagreements.\n  The President has laid down his budget. The Republicans, as is their \n[[Page S7066]] right now, have laid down an alternative. These two \nbudgets are 60 percent the same. But there is a fundamental difference \nin priorities in the remaining 40 percent of this budget. This \namendment and, indeed, this entire debate, is about modifying this \nbudget to reflect those priorities. It is about a fundamental \ndifference in how and where we ought to invest our resources.\n  What the Republicans are suggesting is that, if we do the things the \nchairman has proposed, somehow there will be a $170 billion pool from \nwhich to provide a tax cut at a later date. There is no doubt about \nthat. Everyone has acknowledged that is what we are talking about, a \ntax cut that will substantially benefit those at the upper end of the \nincome scale.\n  We are saying that we cannot accept that tradeoff. We are saying that \nit is wrong for seniors to pay $6,400 per couple in additional out-of-\npocket health expenses to finance a tax cut for upper income Americans. \nWe are saying that it is wrong for working families to pay $1,400 more \nfor this tax cut. We are saying that it is wrong for students to pay \n$3,000 more over the course of their college careers to pay for a tax \ncut. These are the issues our amendment addresses.\n  The people who are the hardest hit and who are going to feel it the \nmost are the senior citizens. A $256 billion cut in Medicare over the \nnext 7 years will affect 37 million people, resulting in $900 a year \nmore in additional health care expenses per beneficiary, $3,200 over \nthe course of the 7 years. For what? So that the wealthiest 1.1 million \npeople in this country can get a $20,000-a-year tax cut. Those people \nmaking more than $350,000 a year will get $20,000 back in taxes.\n  This graph says it clearly. We are not talking about increases in the \ndebt. We are not talking about altering the glidepath or our balanced \nbudget goal. We are talking about the fact that the Republicans want to \nprovide a tax cut for wealthy citizens, while the Democrats are \nconcerned about paying for that tax cut with Medicare cuts. This is the \nessence of the difference between their approach and our approach, \nespecially when you consider the fact that 97 percent of those who are \ndependent upon Medicare make less than $50,000 a year.\n  We cannot accept that Medicare cuts will pay for tax cuts for \naffluent Americans. The $256 billion Medicare cut, resulting in a $900-\na-year increase in out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, is especially \ntroubling when you see how limited most seniors' economic resources \nare. Nonseniors, people under the age of 65, only spend about 8 percent \nof their income on health care. Seniors, on the other hand, pay 21 \npercent of their income on health expenses. In other words, they pay \nalmost three times more each year on health care than nonseniors.\n  There is a lot of debate about how we are affecting the growth of \nMedicare spending. Let's be clear about this. The Republicans say they \nare allowing Medicare costs to increase--that all they are doing is \ncutting back on the program's growth. I hope everyone understands the \neffect their proposal will have on the Medicare program. It is very \nimportant that everyone appreciate the reasons for Medicare's explosion \nin costs. There are two basic reasons.\n  First, the demographics of our country continue to change in positive \nways. We are seeing more and more people over the age 65, more and more \npeople who are living long enough to enjoy their retirement. Therefore, \nmore and more people are relying on Medicare. That is not some \nmanagement problem. This represents a tremendous new opportunity for \nour older Americans to enjoy the benefits of their retirement years. \nAnd more Medicare beneficiaries are living longer and longer. The over \nage 85 group is the fastest growing population of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Second, more and better health care technology is allowing people to \nlive longer and healthier lives.\n  The Medicare program is expected to grow about 8.3 percent per year, \ntaking into account these demographic trends, new technology, and \ngeneral increases in the cost of living. In the private sector, which \nhas a younger, healthier population that needs fewer health care \nservices, we see slightly lower total growth in health care costs. What \nthe Republicans would like to do through this budget is dramatically \ncut back the growth in Medicare while private sector health care costs \ncontinue to grow at a rate of 7.2 percent.\n  The impact that will have on seniors could not be more clear. \nMillions of seniors today depend upon Medicare for their health care \nand can now walk into a hospital or clinic with the confidence that \nthey are going to be treated when they are ill. Under this budget, they \nwill no longer have the confidence that Medicare will be there when \nthey need it. A lot of people are not going to have the care they \ndeserve, in large measure because of the dramatic reduction in the \navailability of resources for Medicare. We simply cannot allow that to \nhappen.\n  The situation is much the same with respect to Medicaid. The \ndemographic trends and new technology affect Medicaid much as they \naffect Medicare. I think we all have to realize that, unless we are \nreally prepared to tackle meaningful health reform and address the \nproliferation in technology, the ramification of these demographic \ntrends in our Nation, and the explosion in general health care costs, \nit is extremely difficult to do anything meaningful to produce the \nkinds of savings that the Republicans are proposing.\n  The bottom line is this. Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of \nsenior citizens? Are we on the side of kids? Are we on the side of \nworking families? Or are we on the side of those who want to raise more \nmoney so we can cut taxes for the wealthy by $20,000?\n  This could be one of the most, if not the most, important votes on \nhealth care in this session of Congress. The decision we will make in \nless than 10 minutes is about whose side we are on, about whether or \nnot senior citizens are going to be confident in their ability to get \nthe kind of health care they need for as long as they live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time for debate is now in the \ncontrol of the Budget Committee Chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what time are we scheduled to vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 3:10, in 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  First of all, I do not expect an answer, but it would be good to know \nwhether the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, who spoke with such passion on this subject and talked \nabout how wonderful his amendment is for seniors, I wonder if we might \nfind out someday whether he would vote for a budget resolution if this \namendment passed? I have serious doubts the Senator from West Virginia \nwould, for putting back $100 billion into Medicare seems to me to be \nfar less than that which he and many on the other side of the aisle \nreally have in mind. Essentially, they have found this contingent fund \nof $170 billion so they can now start spending it; so this is another \neffort to paint us one way when they do not really have a solution.\n  But let me just talk about what is going on, in terms of the \nRepublicans, what we are suggesting.\n  Whose side are we on? Make no bones about it. We are on the side of \nall Americans. There are those in politics who would like to make us \nchoose sides.\n  They would like to split the United States of America as if all \nAmericans are not interested in America's future.\n  Whose side are we on? We are on the senior citizens' side because we \nwant to make the trust fund that pays for their health care solid, \nimprove it, make it better, and make sure that it is there for them for \na long time.\n  We are on the side of the working men and women in America who are \npaying that bill because they, too, would like to know that when it \ncomes their turn to get Medicare, it will be there. We propose that it \nwill be there for them.\n  We are on the side of the children of America, the young children \nthat we so much love, that we have so much affection for. We are on \ntheir side, too.\n  Because, Mr. President, and fellow Americans, if we do not fix the \nFederal budget where it stops hemorrhaging at $275 billion a year, all \nAmericans--seniors, children, middle-aged Americans, \n[[Page S7067]] young couples who are just entering the work force, with \none child, or two children, or just married and starting their life--we \nare on all their sides, because we would like the fruits of their work \nto give them a good paycheck, not a deflated paycheck that goes down \nwhile it sounds like it is going up because they are paying incredible \namounts of what they work for to the Federal Government to pay our \nbills.\n  I believe the seniors in America want a future for their children, \nfor their children who are out there working, and their grandchildren \nthat they are hoping will get an education and benefit and prosper in \nAmerica.\n  So we answer that question. Whose side are we on? We are on every \nsingle American's side. We are for helping every American have a better \nlife and asking that some sacrifice now so that there will be a better \nlife, especially for our children.\n  What are we saying about Medicare? Let us talk about it again. There \nis no need--nonetheless, we cannot prevent it--to frighten Americans. \nThe Medicare system is bankrupt. That is not Republicans talking. It is \nsix trustees, four of whom work for the President. They said you ought \nto reform it. And they told us how much was needed to reform it short \nterm. They said $163 billion over 5 years.\n  We have asked the committees in the U.S. Congress to make it solvent \nover 7 years by finding a way to reform, to add opportunities to senior \ncitizens, to change the system that is essentially about 30 years old, \nand, say, let us modernize it and make it better for seniors, and in \nthe meantime let us save money. Instead of 10 percent growth, let it \ngrow at 7.\n  Who is the principal advocate of the proposition that when you let \nsomething grow at 7 percent instead of 10 that you are not cutting it? \nLet me ask one more time who the best advocate of that is. I will quote \nquickly. October 5, 1993, President Clinton speaking to the AARP:\n\n       Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times \n     the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two \n     times the rate of inflation.\n\n  That is the President saying that. He proposes in the yellow on this \nchart:\n\n       That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut . . . only in \n     Washington do people believe that no one can get by on twice \n     the rate of inflation.\n\n  And then there is some laughter.\n\n       So, when you hear all this business about cuts--\n\n  Said the President,\n\n     let me caution you that that is not what is going on. We are \n     going to have increases in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  Exactly the same thing happening, except it is the Republicans \nproposing that we do it and do it now and carry it out over a 7-year \nperiod.\n  Now the Republicans, the President, and the Democrats said let us \nleave Social Security off the table, with some exceptions. Some have \nsaid you ought to reform it, too. But that has been the basic proposal. \nWe even hear on the floor of the Senate today that we are not living up \nto that commitment because we are trying to reform Medicare.\n  Let me remind everyone that the current law with reference to Social \nSecurity checks and Medicare payments holds seniors harmless from any \ncut in their Social Security. If Medicare premiums were to go up, you \nhold them harmless; they cannot have a cut in their Social Security. We \nstated the same thing in this budget resolution, and those who are \nfamiliar with the hold harmless law know that. And to now say we are \ncutting Social Security, when everybody understands it has been written \nabout, it has been promulgated across this land that we took it off, we \nlet it stand on its own as many said we should.\n  Mr. President, let me say that the minority leader was wrong on a \ncouple of things. He said the President's budget and the Republican \nbudget are going in the same direction, they are about 60 percent \nalike. Nothing could be further from the truth. The President's budget \ngoes in one direction, perhaps south; the Republican goes north, or \nvice-versa. The President's budget would let the deficit go back up to \n$275 billion and reforms no entitlement program which is breaking the \nbank for our people for years to come. We get it into balance in 7 \nyears, and we do address entitlements that we could not afford to pay \nfor, and everybody knows we cannot afford to pay for them. We are \nsaying reform them. We are asking for a commission to help us reform \nthem. And we will get on with the task of answering the question. Who \nare we for? We are for every single American. We are for the dream of a \nsenior citizen that their children succeed in life. And we think we are \ngoing to make that dream come true.\n  We are for a senior who says, ``I want Medicare to be around in 10 or \n15 years. I do not just want it right now.'' We are for seniors who are \nsaying, ``We would even like for it to be around for our son or \ndaughter, who is 45 or 50 years of age.'' We are for that senior, too. \nWe are for that 22-year-old couple, 26-year-old, or as this weekend I \nwill have a new couple in my family, that 28-year-old couple. We are \nfor them because we want their paychecks to grow. We want their \nstandard of living to go up.\n  What will prevent it? What is the most objective way of preventing \nour children from having success? Let the deficit continue to roar, put \nmore and more taxes on the next generation, and on the 28-year-olds, \nand the 20-year-olds across America--taxation for the children without \nrepresentation, for they are not even able to vote and we are putting \nhuge taxes on them. Yes. Huge taxes, as we ask them to pay our bills \nout of their work and their effort. That is what it is all about.\n  And, Mr. President, finally, every time an opponent of the Republican \nplan in the U.S. Senate puts up a chart, they cannot resist talking \nabout we are going to give tax cuts to the rich. We are going to give \n$20,000 to somebody earning $320,000 or $350,000.\n  Mr. President, it is particularly--particularly--offensive to this \nSenator when a member of the Budget Committee comes to the floor and \nsays that. It is offensive because by a vote of 21 to 1 the Budget \nCommittee proposed in this budget resolution an amendment by Senator \nBoxer and Senator Brown of Colorado. What did it say? It said, if we \nhave a tax cut--if we have a tax cut--90 percent of it shall go to the \nAmerican people earning $90,000 or less. Even in that score we are for \nmiddle-income Americans. We are for the working Americans.\n  What does this amendment try to do? This amendment says from that \nside of the aisle--and let me pay my friend, Senator Exon, a compliment \nfor his hard work. Nonetheless, when he finishes saying that I have \nbeen successful with my hard work, he then proceeds to tell me what I \nhave done wrong.\n  So, let me just suggest for all his hard work here is the essence of \nthe Democrat plan. First of all, there is no plan. But this particular \namendment says after you balance the budget with cuts that we do not \nwant--Democrats speaking--with cuts that we do not want, after you \nfinish doing that, and we have not helped you a bit, then we suggest \nthat whatever economic dividend there is for the American people, we \nare suggesting that we tell you how to spend it. For today, they are \nsaying to us, take $100 billion of the hard-earned economic dividend \nthat we say, if it occurs, we want to go back to middle-income \nAmericans as a moderate tax cut, they would now say we did not help you \nwith it, the cuts are not cuts we want--we have heard that all day \nlong, they are not the cuts we want--but now we would like to tell you \nhow to spend it. We would like you to spend it--this one will be \nMedicare, then there will be one on education, and then there will be \none on something else.\n  Essentially, I hope the American people see through all that, and I \nhope that overwhelmingly the amendment is turned down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are more than 20 hours into the debate \non the budget resolution. By midweek, the Senate will likely approve a \nbudget which projects a balanced budget in the year 2002, although the \nRepublican budget continues to rely on the Social Security trust funds. \nHowever, the proposed budget resolution which is before the Senate and \neven more so the resolution approved by the House are not balanced in \nanother even more important way. In an effort to reach a balanced \nbudget by the fixed target of the year 2002, while keeping the \nPentagon's budget off the table, providing for an ill-advised, and if \nthe House's proposals are any guide, inequitable tax cut, the \n[[Page S7068]] resultant budget blueprint represented here penalizes \nthe middle-income working families, neglects the need to invest in our \nNation's future, and penalizes our senior citizens, all while providing \nfor a tax reduction which will benefit mostly the wealthiest of \nAmericans.\n  The Rockefeller amendment which we are now considering takes a \ncritical step in the right direction by providing additional funding \nfor Medicare while cutting back the funding for an ill-timed, and \ninequitable tax cut for the most well-off Americans for which the \nbudget resolution before us reserves $170 billion.\n  The tax cut laid out by the House provides more than half of its \nbenefits to people making more than $100,000 a year and gives a $20,000 \ntax break to those who make $350,000, while the budget takes the \nlargest bite out of the Medicare Program relied upon by older \nAmericans; 78 percent of those who receive Medicare benefits are making \nless than $25,000 a year. Those dependent on Medicare will experience \nthe largest cut in Medicare's history costing on average by 2002, a \n$900 per year increase in premiums, deductibles and copayments, \napproximately $3,200 over the next 7 years--$6,400 for couples by the \ntime 2002 rolls around.\n  Several of my colleagues over the past several days have quoted \nRepublican commentator Kevin Phillips, but his recent public remarks \nsum up the problems with the Republican budget proposal very well. He \nsaid:\n\n       Spending on government programs--from Medicare and \n     education to home heating oil assistance--is to be reduced in \n     ways that predominantly benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of \n     Americans.\n\n  Mr. Phillips goes on to say:\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice, with * * * the people who \n     have the big money making the biggest sacrifice. instead, \n     it's senior citizens, the poor, students, and ordinary \n     Americans who'll see programs they depend on gutted while * * \n     * the richest 1 or 2 percent--far from making sacrifices--\n     actually get new benefits and tax reductions.\n\n  Mr. Phillips says it all, Mr. President. The debate is not really \nabout whether we should be moving to a balanced budget. It is about how \nwe attempt to get there over the next 7 years. It is basically about \nfairness. The Rockefeller amendment is a first step toward making this \nbudget more equitable.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have to keep our eye on the problem. \nThe problem is that the Medicare Program is going broke. And this means \nthat out-of-control spending in the program must be addressed. We \ncannot address out-of-control spending by spending more.\n  Medicare spending is growing rapidly. The part A Program, which pays \nfor the hospital care of beneficiaries, will grow 8.3 percent annually \nfor the forseeable future. Part B, which pays doctor bills, will grow \nat 14.1 percent per year. The overall program will grow at 10.5 percent \nper year.\n  Evidence of the difference between income to the program and spending \nby the program is the pending bankruptcy of the part A program. Under \ncurrent estimates, this program will not be able to pay its bills in \nthe year 2002. The trustees of the fund, the Secretaries of the \nTreasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services recently addressed the \nfinancing shortfall of the trust fund. They said: ``the projected year \nof exhaustion for the HI Trust Fund is 2002.''\n  The situation is really no better, probably worse, for the part B \nprogram. The part B program doesn't present the crisis aspect that the \npart A program presents, but only because 70 percent of the funds for \nthe program come from general revenues. Surely we cannot tolerate 14 \npercent annual growth in a program of this size.\n  The public trustees of the Medicare Program have tried to bring the \nsituation facing the Medicare Program to the attention of the Congress \nand the general public. The public trustees serve as trustees of the \nprogram together with the Cabinet Secretaries I mentioned a moment ago. \nOne is a Democrat, one a Republican. Their terms have just expired. \nThey have no axe to grind. They both have long experience in \ngovernment. They worked in leadership positions in agencies with \nresponsibility for retirement programs. They are substantial people, \nwhose views must be taken seriously.\n  They said, in the 1995 Trustees' Report, that ``the Medicare program \nis clearly unsustainable in its present form * * * it is now clear that \nMedicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct \nlegislative initiative''. The administration officials serving as \ntrustees, the Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, Health and Human \nServices, together with the Commissioner of Social Security and the \nHealth Care Financing Administrator, said in the 1995 Report that ``the \ntrustees urge the Congress to take additional actions designed to \ncontrol HI program costs.'' They also said that ``the trustees believe \nthat prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary.''\n  The budget resolution we are considering attempts to address the \nserious problems in the Medicare Program identified by the trustees. In \nthis budget, the Medicare Program will continue to grow at 7.1 percent \nper year. Over the 7 years covered by the budget resolution, the \nprogram will grow 59 percent from $161.1 billion in 1995 to $256.7 \nbillion in 2002. This will be a per capita increase of 49 percent. The \naverage annual per capita growth rate is 5.4 percent. This is a real \nper capita increase of 2.4 percent per year.\n  Some have argued that the real per capital change in\n   spending must be calculated using the medical CPI. And it is true \nthat, were we to use this index to measure the change in per capita \nMedicare spending, there would be a real decrease in that spending. \nYet, the Congressional Budget Office stopped using the medical CPI \nseveral years ago. They concluded that that measure was seriously \nflawed. Among other things, it cannot adequately account for the \nincreases in quality of health care services. In addition the index \nuses list prices rather than actual transaction prices. And, these \ndays, list prices have little to do with the actual cost of services.\n\n  I am not trying to argue that the spending slowdown will not be \ndifficult and painful. As a Senator representing a rural, Medicare-\ndependent State, with high-quality and relatively low-cost medical \ncare, I realize this all too well.\n  But, there are two additional steps in the budget process during \nwhich the impact of the Medicare spending slowdown on vulnerable areas \nof the country can be cushioned. First, the resolution calls for a \nCommission to suggest how this spending slowdown might best be \nachieved. I am confident that this Commission will take into \nconsideration the special circumstances of vulnerable regions and \nvulnerable groups when they develop their recommendations.\n  Second, the Committee on Finance, of which I am a member, will make \nthe critical decisions about how to change the Medicare Program so as \nto realize savings. As a member of that committee, I intend to work \nhard to ease the impact of the spending slowdown on the most \nvulnerable. Medicare expenditures in rural areas are considerably \nsmaller than are expenditures in nonrural areas. For instance, the part \nA expenditure in rural areas is only about 13 percent of total part A \nexpenditures. Total program payments in nonmetropolitan statistical \nareas is about 23 percent of total program payments. In the past, this \ndifference has made it possible to cushion the impact of reconciliation \nbills on rural areas. Thus, I think that it should be possible to \ncushion the effects on rural areas of the spending slowdown without \nadverse effects on other areas. Mr. President, I am concerned about the \nMedicare Program and all those who depend on it. I do not believe that \nthis budget resolution, with all the sacrifice it calls for, will \njeopardize the health care services on which older people depend. I am \nconcerned, Mr. President, that if we do not act to put the Medicare \nProgram on a sound footing, Medicare-dependent States like my own will \nsuffer the most when the day of reckoning ultimately comes.\n  I am also concerned about the future of our country. If we do not \nact, we will be faced with Federal deficits into the indefinite future. \nIf we do not act, interest on the national debt will reach $300 billion \nannually be the end of the decade. That is larger than the Defense \nbudget. That is larger than the Medicare Program. That is larger, in \nfact, than any item in the Federal budget [[Page S7069]] except the \nSocial Security retirement program.\n  Surely, Mr. President, we cannot go on like this.\n                  the future of medicare and medicaid\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the American public became well versed \nduring last year's debate on the health care system and the need to \nstem rising health care costs. In the last year or so, we have seen the \nhealth care market begin to change and costs beginning to go down. \nUnfortunately, in the two largest Federal health care programs, \nMedicare and Medicaid, this has not been the case. Annual costs \ncontinue to rise by nearly 10 percent. As we attempt to balance the \nFederal budget, we simply cannot continue to sustain this rate of \ngrowth in our Federal health programs.\n  The pending amendment would take the savings or economic dividend \nexpected from a balanced budget in 2002 and apply it to Medicare and \nMedicaid. While I am reluctant to even support a broad-based tax cut \nusing these savings, at this time I do not believe these anticipated \nsavings should be used to increase Medicare and Medicaid funding \nwithout addressing fundamental reforms in these two programs. After \nall, the savings are anticipated and may or may not be there when the \nbudget is balanced in 2002. By using these anticipated funds to get us \nto a balanced budget or to sustain the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, \nwe are kidding ourselves and reverting to budget tricks used during the \n1980's. Therefore, I will oppose the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The recent report by the Medicare trustees describes the crisis we \nwill face as a nation if we continue to allow costs to grow at their \ncurrent rate. The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be \nbankrupt in 2002. Yes, we have known about this for a number of years \nbut the day of reckoning is upon us. As soon as 1997, Medicare \nexpenditures will exceed incoming revenues.\n  Before we begin to pour money into the trust funds, we must look at \nthe substantive problems with the program which lead us down the road \ntoward insolvency. Allowing Medicare expenditures to continue to grow \nat their current rate by applying the projected balanced budget savings \nto the trust funds will merely extend the insolvency date a few more \nyears. Instead we must recognize that changes must be made to guarantee \nthe long-term solvency of the program. That is why I have cosponsored \nlegislation introduced recently by my colleague from Oregon, Senator \nPackwood, to require the Medicare trustees to provide Congress with \ntheir recommendations for solving the short-term and long-term Medicare \nsolvency issues.\n  Some States, including my own State of Oregon, are far down the road \ntoward building cost efficiency into our health care system. A recent \nstudy of hospitals nationwide concluded that if the 1993 U.S. average \nhospital expenditures per capita had been the same as Oregon's age \nadjusted expenditures per capita, the United States would have saved \nover $66 billion of its $267 billion in hospital expenditures that \nyear. We must continue to look at States like Oregon as we grapple with \nreforms in both Medicare and Medicaid. There are innovative reforms \nunderway in our States which can provide concrete examples of how to \nreduce costs without adversely impacting access to quality health care \nservices.\n  Balancing the budget will not be easy but it is necessary. It will \nrequire a shared sacrifice by all Americans. In order to assure that \nthis is accomplished we must be willing to address inefficiencies in \nprograms such as Medicare which simply could not be imagined in the \n1960's when the program was originally passed. I will work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to assure that this occurs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposed \nMedicare and Medicaid amendment, and would like to take a few minutes \nto explain my reasons for taking this position.\n  We all know that Medicare and Medicaid spending cuts are necessary.\n  There is no argument that Medicare and Medicaid must be reformed, \nthat the Medicare trust fund must be restored to balance, and that \nentitlement spending must be slowed. Let me give you just a few \nexamples of the need for reform:\n  The current cost of Medicare alone is a staggering $176 billion, and \nthe program increases about 10 percent annually.\n  At over $803 billion, Medicare, Medicaid, and other entitlement \nprograms already eat up over 50 percent of our annual budget.\n  The current Medicare Program pays out much more in benefits than it \nis taking in from premiums and payroll contributions.\n  Without reform, Medicare will continue to grow out of control. Costs \nfor new technologies and procedures continue to increase rapidly, there \nare about 1 million additional Medicare participants each year, and \nmanaged care efforts for Medicare and Medicaid participants have not \nyet yielded significant savings to the Federal Government.\n  For those reasons, I have supported deficit reduction efforts and \nchanges in Medicare in the past, and believe that we must all be \nwilling to enact health care reform legislation, including measures \nsuch as means-testing the Medicare part B premium, raising the age of \neligibility for new Medicare enrollees over time, and expanding a \ncompetition-based managed Medicare Program.\n  However, $400 billion in cuts from Medicare and Medicaid is a huge \namount, which goes too far, too fast, without any assurances that our \nhealth care system won't be significantly undercut.\n  The real questions are how much to cut, how to make sure the cuts are \ndistributed fairly, and how to make sure the cuts can work?\n  The proposed resolution cuts over $400 billion out of Medicare and \nMedicaid over the next 7 years--almost a third of the entire $1.3 \ntrillion in cuts. These health care cuts include $256 billion from \nMedicare and $176 billion from Medicaid, along with cuts in other \npublic health areas.\n  What exactly do health care cuts of this size really mean? Well, no \none really knows, but health care experts tell us that the options for \ncuts of this size are few, and estimates by the Health Care Finance \nAgency, which runs these programs, have projected these fiscal impacts:\n  First, $256 billion in Medicare cuts will almost certainly increase \nseniors' out-of-pocket health care costs for premiums, deductibles, and \ncopayments.\n  This will lower seniors' Social Security checks, because that is \nwhere the Medicare part B premium is deducted. Medicare premiums and \nSocial Security checks are linked together because under the integrated \nSocial Security check-issuing system, Medicare premiums are \nautomatically taken out of Social Security checks. An increase in the \nMedicare premium leads directly to a decrease in the Social Security \ncheck.\n  Second, in addition, $176 billion in Medicaid cuts will force States \nto spend more, undercut the efforts of our safety net hospitals, \nincrease the numbers of uninsured persons, and shift even more costs to \nthe private employer-based health care system.\n  Do we really want to cut Medicare and Medicaid by $400 billion, based \nupon what we know about the effects of these cuts?\n  The impact of these cuts on would affect California enormously--more \nthan almost every other State.\n  California will be particularly affected by these cuts because it has \na large and growing population of 31 million residents, a high--20 \npercent--Medicaid rate, a high--23 percent--uninsurance rate, an \nextremely large--2 million--population of illegal immigrants, and high \nhealth care costs despite the spread of managed care and the tremendous \nsuccess of group purchasing alliances.\n  For California, $256 billion in Medicare cuts could cause $34 billion \nin total cuts to California hospitals and patients over the next 7 \nyears, according to the Health Care Finance Administration. Despite \nhaving only 9.5 percent of the Nation's Medicare population, California \nwould pay for over 13 percent of the Medicare cuts.\n  These cuts could include a $4,300 increase in out-of-pocket costs--\npremiums, deductibles, and copayments--to each of the 3.6 million \nMedicare recipients in California, according to the Health Care Finance \nAdministration.\n  Out-of-pocket costs are a critical issue for Medicare recipients, who \nalready pay an extraordinary 23 percent [[Page S7070]] of their incomes \non health care--compared to an average of 8 percent for those under 65. \nThis increase would be 40 percent higher for Californians than cost \nincreases to the rest of the Nation.\n  For California, $176 billion in Medicaid cuts could cause $15 billion \nin lost Federal funding--12 percent of the total cut, second only to \nNew York, which can afford to spend thousands more than California on \neach Medicaid patient.\n  In reality, cuts of this size are only necessary to help pay for a \nRepublican tax cut.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that balancing the Federal \nbudget will create an economic dividend of $170 billion.\n  If the budget is balanced and the dividend is certified by the\n   CBO, Republicans plan to use this dividend for tax cuts. Over $345 \nbillion in tax cuts have already been included in the House version, \nand a similar proposal will soon be debated here in the Senate.\n\n  But the dividend could equally be used to soften the cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid, which is what the Rockefeller amendment proposes, and how \nI believe it should be used.\n  This amendment would direct the Finance Committee to restore $100 \nbillion, of the proposed $400 billion cut, to Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms in order to ensure that 36 million Medicare recipients, our \nsystem of world-class hospitals, and those who still have their own \nprivate insurance are not adversely or disproportionately affected.\n  Here is the impact of the Rockefeller amendment on California:\n  While the budget resolution is projected to cut $34 billion in \nMedicare from California seniors and hospitals over the next seven \nyears, the Rockefeller amendment would restore roughly $13.4 billion of \nthat $34 billion.\n  While the budget resolution is projected to increase each of \nCalifornia's 3.6 million Medicare recipients' out of pocket costs as \nmuch as $4,300 per person over the next seven years, the Rockefeller \namendment would specifically direct the Finance Committee to lower \nthose increases.\n  While the budget resolution would cut $15 billion in Medicaid \npayments to California, the Rockefeller amendment would protect the \nmost vulnerable populations, lessen the burden on state resources, and \nsupport the safety net of California hospitals.\n  Medicaid funding is included not only because it protects poor women \nand children, but also because so many seniors receive long-term health \ncare and other supplemental ``safety net'' services from Medicaid, \nalong with doctor and hospital coverage from Medicare.\n  This amendment is fully paid for. It does not lessen the deficit \nreduction in the budget, and still leaves significant cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid. It is paid for out of the same bonus that Republicans \nwould use for a tax cut. If CBO does certify a $170 billion bonus when \nthe budget reconciliation bill goes through, then those funds would go \nback into Medicare, not into tax cuts.\n  Without this Medicare and Medicaid amendment, the budget resolution \nmakes huge amounts of cuts, with no real assurance that they can be \nachieved in 7 years without destroying our health care system or \nimposing a crushing burden on seniors. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my \ncolleague from West Virginia's amendment on Medicare. This amendment \nwould take $100 billion from the reserve fund that my friends on the \nother side of the aisle have reserved for tax cuts, and put it back in \nMedicare and Medicaid. This is an important amendment because millions \nof Americans depend on Medicare and Medicaid to help them shoulder the \nburden of an increasingly expensive health care system.\n  This amendment is about fairness and shared sacrifice. It will still \nput us on a glide path toward a balanced budget but it will put less of \nthe burden on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This amendment is \nneeded because the budget resolution is Draconian and unfair. This body \nshould consider a budget that restores fiscal discipline and balances \nnot only the numbers on each side of the ledger but also the priorities \nof this Nation. Unfortunately, this budget does not accurately portray \nthe Federal budget or the interests of the American people. This budget \nresolution is about numbers. I guess some believe the end justifies the \nmeans. Unfortunately, the human side of the equation has been all but \nignored. The last time I looked, this Government still had an \nobligation to serve all of its citizens. That includes the old, the \nsick, the young, and the poor--not just the prosperous.\n  Let us take a moment to discuss what $256 billion in cuts to Medicare \nand $175 billion in cuts to Medicaid really mean.\n  It means 1.6 million Illinoisans who are covered by Medicare would \nhave to pay an additional $2,770 over 7 years in out-of-pocket costs. \nAlready the elderly spend nearly 21 percent of their income on health \ncare, compared to 8 percent for nonseniors.\n  It means Illinois would lose $9.3 billion in Medicare funds over the \nnext 7 years and over $6 billion from Medicaid--a 30-percent cut.\n  It means payments to providers will be cut. And as June O'Neill, \nDirector of the CBO, said recently ``no pain, no gain''. Well it is \ntrue that we must share the sacrifice as we say, but let us take a look \nat that pain. And then let's consider whether or not we need the \ninvasive and expensive, in terms of human costs, prescriptions ordered \nby Dr. Domenici's committee.\n  Cuts of this magnitude implemented this quickly will:\n  Close rural and inner-city urban safety net hospitals. These \nhospitals bear a disproportionate share of the cost of uncompensated \ncare. They do not have the ability to cost shift and large cuts hit \ntheir bottom line directly. In Illinois we know of at least 10 \nhospitals that would close, most of them in areas that are already \ndesignated as health professions shortage areas.\n  It means medical education will suffer. Academic health centers that \nnow train this Nation's residents will have to reduce the number of \nresidents trained and the quality of that training may suffer. \nRemember, each and every one of us benefits from well-trained \nphysicians.\n  It means hospitals and doctors will no longer treat Medicare \npatients, because it will be cost prohibitive to do so. And this means \nseniors lose choice and access to quality care.\n  Large cuts in Medicaid funding are no less devastating.\n  It means more babies will be born without prenatal care and will not \nreceive well baby care. One-third of all births are funded by Medicaid.\n  It means between 5 and 7 million kids would lose coverage and the \nphase-in of coverage to the children of the working poor would be \njeopardized.\n  It means millions would lose benefits. This means the loss of \nbenefits not only for poor children, but for the elderly and disabled \ntoo. What many forget is that two-thirds of Medicaid costs go to \nprovide services for the indigent elderly and severely disabled.\n  HHS estimates that all preventive and diagnostic screening services \nfor children, home health care, hospice, and dental services would be \neliminated.\n  It means more middle-class families will be responsible for paying \nfor costly nursing home care for their elderly parents. Nursing home \ncare averages $38,000 per year.\n  Clearly, changes to Medicare and Medicaid are needed. These programs \nare costly entitlements that gobble up more and more of our Federal \nbudget and contribute more and more to our Federal deficit. We must not \nbe resistant to change. Change is inevitable if we are to ensure that \nMedicare remains a viable program not only for our generation but for \nour children. But as Secretary Shalala recently cautioned the finance \ncommittee: ``Don't kill Medicare to save it.''\n  Changes to Medicare and Medicaid must be made in the context of \nhealth care reform. The budget resolution does not propose a solution \nto reduce health care inflation. Not only does it raise the cost of \nhealth care to older Americans--83 percent of Medicare users have an \nannual income of under $25,000--but it will reduce access and choice. \nOn top of that, it will produce a big cost shift onto the rest of us. \nHHS estimates that if only one-third of Medicare cuts are shifted to \nother payers, businesses and families would be forced to pay a hidden \ntax of $40-$50 [[Page S7071]] billion. We have difficult choices to \nmake, but this budget fails. It is time to try again.\n  We can balance the Federal budget, but we have to set some priorities \nhere. We cannot, indeed must not, balance the budget on the backs of \nchildren and the elderly. It is not right and it is not the American \nway. This amendment seeks to reduce the burden of this budget on those \nwho need it most. I offer my wholehearted support.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7027-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7071-S7078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               REPUBLICAN BUDGET PLANS AND MEDICARE CUTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe the current debate in Congress on \nthe budget is the most important action Congress will take this year. \nThe Republican budget proposals are indeed monumental. The debate over \nhow we balance our Federal budget will have repercussions to State and \nlocal governments for years to come.\n  I agree with several things in the Republican budget plans. I agree \nwe need to continue to reduce the deficit and achieve a balanced \nbudget. The Federal deficit and its resulting interest payments on the \ngrowing national debt put a heavy drag on our economy. In 1990 and \n1993, I cast politically unpopular votes that cut about $1 trillion \nfrom the projected deficit. Since 1992, the deficit has been reduced \nfrom $290 to $176 billion this year--a drop of one-third. And more \nsavings must be made.\n  But as Ross Perot would say: ``The devil is in the details.'' How we \nbalance the Federal budget is just as important as balancing it.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the Republican budget would reduce \nMedicare spending by the largest amount in history--$256 billion in the \nSenate version and $288 billion in the House.\n  These numbers are big, but what do they really mean to Vermonters? \nUnder the Senate Republican budget proposal, the average Medicare \nspending per Vermont beneficiary would be reduced from today's level by \nover $4,000 over the next 7 years.\n  Over the next 7 years, Vermont will lose $339 million in Medicare \nfunding, $79 million in the year 2002 alone. If this loss of funds is \nsplit 50-50 between Medicare recipients and providers, in the year 2002 \nMedicare beneficiaries will be paying about $500 in increased \ncopayments, premiums, and deductibles. Hospitals, doctors, and other \nhealth care provides will be receiving $500 less from each Medicare \nrecipient.\n  These reductions result from slowing the projected growth of Medicare \nto 7 percent a year instead of the projected increase of 10 percent a \nyear. Some claim that these reductions are not really cuts. I fail to \nunderstand that logic.\n  For the 83,000 Vermonters on Medicare and in particular the 12 \npercent of Vermont seniors who live below the poverty level, does it \nmake any difference what we call these reductions? Over the next 7 \nyears, Vermont seniors, or the hospital, or the doctor will have to \ncome up with over $4,000 to maintain their current level of benefits.\n  Ask the elderly couple that is retired and living on a fixed income \nif they can afford this slowing of growth? Ask the family down the road \nthat has a grandparent who was just diagnosed with Alzehiemers whether \nthey will be able to afford this slowing of growth? Ask the rural \ndoctor who is already having trouble covering costs whether he or she \ncan afford this slowing of growth?\n  Ask the typical rural hospital that currently receives only 91.5 \ncents on the dollar for the cost of each Medicare participant whether \nit can afford this slowing of growth. Ask the Vermonter with private \nhealth insurance that is currently paying that remaining 8.5 cents on \nevery dollar on hospital costs alone due to cost shifting whether they \ncan afford this slowing of growth?\n  The scariest part about the Senate Republican budget resolution is \nthat it ignores the fact that it is not just Medicare costs that are \nrising. All health care costs are rising. And by just cutting \nMedicare--and Medicaid for that matter--a huge cost-shift of medical \nexpenses will result and make sure that all Vermonters pay more for \nhealth care.\n  Vermonters need to realize that the magic number of $256 billion in \nthe Senate and $288 billion in the House will do nothing for the long-\nterm solvency of the Medicare trust fund. It extends the trust fund's \nlife another 3 years from the current projection of it going broke in \n2002. Since the first trustees' report in 1970, there always has been a \ndate certain for the trust fund's insolvency. It is interesting to note \nthat last year the insolvency date was projected at 2001, yet \nRepublicans at that time saw no such urgency in shoring up the trust \nfund or dealing with the real problem of overall health care costs.\n  The Republican Medicare cuts are short-sighted. Simply cutting \nMedicare does not make its problems go away. To reduce Medicare costs, \nwe must reduce health care costs throughout the system, which can only \nbe achieved by true health care reform. But the Republicans have no \nplan to curb Medicare costs except to cut the program.\n  I hope in the coming months that Members from both sides of the aisle \nhammer out a plan to deal with the issue of comprehensive health care \nreform. But in the meantime, simply cutting Medicare is not the answer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this Republican budget sets the wrong \npriorities. The goal is right--steady movement toward a balanced \nbudget--but how the Republicans propose to get there is wrong. More \nthan half of all the cuts in this budget come from just two programs--\nMedicare and Medicaid. Specifically, the Republican budget would cut \n$256 billion from Medicare over the next 7 years and another $175 \nbillion from Medicaid, about $58 billion of which would come from long-\nterm care for the elderly. This would be, without a doubt, the largest \nMedicare cut in history--three times larger than any previous cut.\n  This was not part of the Republican Contract With America. In fact, \nsome have forgotten about an earlier contract--the contract we made \nwith the senior citizens of America--those who worked hard and played \nby the rules. Cutting health care for those who are at an age when they \nneed health care the most is simply wrong. To cut Medicare as much as \nthe Republicans are proposing violates the long-standing contract with \nAmerica's seniors.\n  And, why? So that the wealthy can be guaranteed a tax cut and so that \nrich billionaires can continue to renounce their U.S. citizenship in \norder to avoid paying taxes.\n  I believe we should have a tax cut--one that is targeted to middle-\nclass families for the cost of education. And, I will discuss that \nissue in more detail later. But, the Republicans in the House have \nalready passed their tax cut. Families making less than $30,000 would \nget a tax cut of $124--less than 50 cents a day--while families making \nover $200,000 would get a tax cut of over $11,000.\n  I am not saying we should raise taxes on the wealthy. And I am not \nsaying that we should give a tax cut to everyone but the wealthy. But, \nMr. President, do our richest 1 percent, or 5 percent, need a tax cut \nmore than our retirees on a fixed income need protection against \nskyrocketing health care costs. I do not think so. I do not think we \nshould provide a tax cut for guys like me--and I am the poorest one \naround this place--while we are increasing my mother's health care \ncosts. And, I certainly do not believe that billionaires who renounce \ntheir American citizenship should have priority over the seniors who \ngave so much to this country.\n  I know what the Republicans are saying. They are claiming that they \nare not cutting Medicare and Medicaid--only reducing the rate of \nincrease. Technically, true. But, for those seniors whose costs go up \nbecause Medicare pays for less, is that not a cut? For those seniors \nwho have less access to health care services because Medicare providers \nrefuse to take new Medicare patients, is that not a cut? For those \nseniors who may no longer qualify for Medicaid nursing home care \nbecause Medicaid payments\n to States are restricted, is that not a cut? Call it what you want. \nThe fact is, seniors will pay more--much, much more.\n\n  Assuming that half of the Medicare cuts will come from seniors \nthemselves, this Republican budget means that the average senior \ncitizen will pay between $800 and $900 more in out-of-pocket costs--\npremiums, deductibles, and copayments--in 2002 than they would \notherwise pay. Over the course of the next 7 years, the elderly would \n[[Page S7072]] have to pay a total of about $3,200 more in out-of-\npocket costs. That is on top of the average senior already expecting to \npay about $25,000 in premiums, copayments, and deductibles for Medicare \nbetween now and 2002. The Republican budget would result in a 13-\npercent increase in out-of-pocket Medicare payments by America's \nseniors. And, on average, seniors already pay 21 percent of their \nincome on health costs.\n  I know what else the Republicans are saying. They are claiming that \nwe need to cut Medicare in order to save it. They argue that Medicare \nwill go bankrupt in 2002, and they just want to protect the program for \nposterity. Mr. President, this budget does not reform Medicare; it cuts \nMedicare. Not one single proposal has been offered to save Medicare. \nInstead, the budget establishes an arbitrary number of $256 billion and \nsays that is how much is going to be cut regardless of the actual cost \nof medical services or the total number of people who qualify. Between \nnow and the year 2002, the number of seniors eligible for Medicare will \nincrease by 4 million--15,000 in my State of Delaware. The Medicare \nfunds will not keep pace. Someone gets cut.\n  If the Republicans were interested in saving Medicare, they would \nattack the causes of why Medicare is going bankrupt. But, they do not. \nIf the Republicans were interested in saving Medicare, they would come \nto the table with the goal of saving Medicare. Instead, they want \nDemocrats to come to the table after they have pulled an arbitrary \nnumber out of thin air.\n  And, where have the Republicans been? We have known since 1985 that \nthe Medicare trust fund would become insolvent near the turn of the \ncentury. And, yet, for 7 years, Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush \nnever proposed saving Medicare from bankruptcy. In 1993, not one single \nRepublican in either the House or the Senate voted for President \nClinton's proposal to shore up the Medicare trust fund. And, last fall, \nRepublicans were so concerned about saving Medicare that they forgot to \ninclude it as part of the Contract With America.\n  Let us stop the charade. Republicans are cutting Medicare to balance \nthe budget and to provide tax cuts to the wealthy. That is their \npriority. They are wrong. Democrats have alternatives that will achieve \nthe same goal--a balanced budget in 2002--without taking this much from \nMedicare. For example, Senators Rockefeller and Lautenberg have an \namendment to return part of any economic dividend that results from a \nbalanced budget back to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. We ought to \nadopt the Democratic amendments and fulfill the original Contract With \nAmerica--the contract with America's seniors.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, to restore $100 billion of the $426 billion proposed cuts \nin the Medicare and Medicaid programs over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, virtually everyone--Members of Congress, the \nPresident, program administrators and even current beneficiaries of the \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs--agree that changes, including slower \nspending, need to be made to the current system. The cost of health \ncare is growing too fast and too high. Medicare, for example, currently \nis expanding by more than 10 percent per year, or three times CPI. \nThese escalating costs simply are unsustainable.\n  President Clinton and many of us here in Congress spent 2 years \ntrying to deal with this problem in a responsible, comprehensive way. \nHad we been successful, the Medicare Program would be more secure and \naccess to affordable health care would have been a reality for all \nAmericans, young and old alike. But at the time, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle were not interested in working with us to help \nmake the Medicare Program secure. We heard repeatedly that there was no \ncrisis, no need for Congress to act.\n  So here we are, with the Medicare Program in real trouble and the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee proposing to save it by cutting \nthe program $256 billion over 7 years. Along with the Medicare cuts are \n$170 billion in cuts to the Medicaid program, which often serves as a \nlong-term care safety net for seniors and the disabled.\n  My first question is ``What do cuts of this magnitude mean to my \nhomestate of New Mexico?'' Unfortunately, Mr. President, States like \nNew Mexico are going to be hit especially hard. This is due to a \ncombination of factors:\n  First, New Mexico has a growing senior population.\n  Second, New Mexico has a high poverty rate; a high rate of seniors \nliving in or near poverty; and low per capita income level.\n  Third, New Mexico's hospitals and providers are heavily dependent on \nMedicare and Medicaid revenue, more so than most other States.\n\n\n               senior population--dependency on medicare\n\n  In New Mexico, more than 212,000 seniors, disabled children, and \ndisabled adults currently depend on Medicare. By 2002, more than \n257,000 New Mexicans are anticipated to be eligible for the program. \nLooking at seniors alone, New Mexico's over-65 population grew by 37.8 \npercent between 1980 and 1990. The senior population is expected to \ngrow by another 11 percent by 2000--to 204,000--and by more than 21 \npercent by 2010--to 247,000. Our over-65 growth rate, which is \ncurrently at 11 percent, is one of the highest in the country.\n  What do the proposed cuts mean to these seniors? According to an AARP \nstudy, to the average Medicare beneficiary in New Mexico it means \n$3,237 more in out-of-pocket expenses over the next 7 years, or $462 \nper person per year. This is $462 per person more in higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, higher copays, and more services not covered.\n\n\n         seniors in poverty--tie between medicare and medicaid\n\n  A cost shift of this type is especially tough on New Mexico's seniors \nand their families because so many in my State are living at or near \npoverty. In fact, at 22.4 percent, New Mexico has one of the highest \npoverty rates in the country. One in every five New Mexicans--including \nabout 26,000 seniors--lives in poverty.\n  Mr. President, the majority of my constituents are barely making ends \nmeet today. And then along comes the majority in Congress with an \nsignificant increase in the obligation of beneficiaries--all \nbeneficiaries, regardless of income level--to pay more out-of-pocket \nfor their health care. How can poor, elder New Mexicans possibly come \nup with an additional $3,200 for their health care? The simple answer \nis that they will not be able to.\n  Through the Medicaid Program, the State typically would pick up the \nextra cost. But to do so, the State must raise additional revenue, \neither by cutting services elsewhere or by raising taxes. Under the \nbudget plan before us today, the situation is even more grim for the \nStates: before even beginning to address the new costs they will face, \nStates must first come up with revenue to cover the initial shortfall \nthey will face from the $170 billion in proposed cuts to the Medicaid \nProgram itself.\n  If New Mexico or any other State will not or cannot raise the revenue \nneeded to keep the safety net in place without Federal assistance, the \nresults will be tragically clear: hundreds of seniors will have to go \nwithout health care; and hundreds of families will be forced to \nshoulder even more of the costs and burdens of providing long-term care \nfor an elderly parent or relative. Those least able to afford it and \nmost vulnerable among us--the very poor, frail elderly--will be hurt \nmost.\n  The very bad news does not end there, however. I want to turn for a \nmoment to the situation facing seniors with income levels above the \npoverty line. In New Mexico, our per capita income is $14,709, or more \nthan $5,000 below the national average. Per capita income for New \nMexico's seniors is even lower, estimated at around $12,000 per year by \nAARP, with between 20-25 percent being spent on health care.\n  If Senator Rockefeller's amendment does not pass, the message to New \nMexico's seniors will be that they will have to spend even more on \ntheir health care. The Senate will be telling New Mexico's seniors that \nthey must spend more of their $12,000 to $14,000 annual income on \nhealth care. To many, this will simply be impossible.\n  I have just described the impact of the proposed Medicare cuts on New \nMexico's Medicare beneficiaries. The adverse impact on our State does \nnot stop there. Just as the cuts hurt New [[Page S7073]] Mexico seniors \nmore than seniors in many other States--because many of our seniors are \nliving at or near poverty and our per capita income level is low--the \ncuts will also hit New Mexico's hospitals and health care providers \nharder than hospitals and providers in other States.\n\n\n                  new mexico's hospitals and providers\n\n  The proposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts will be tough on our \nhospitals and providers, particularly in rural areas, because they are \ndisproportionately dependent on Medicare and Medicaid for their \nrevenue. Most NM hospitals/providers depend on the programs for 70 to \n80 percent or more of their revenue. Nationally, 60 percent or less of \nall revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid.\n  A hospital with a 60 percent or lower Medicare revenue share can \ncompensate for lost Medicare-Medicaid dollars by cost-shifting to \nprivate insurers. NM hospitals and providers cannot. They depend on \nreimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. Even a slight cut to rural \nproviders could represent a serious financial threat to the providers \nand a very real threat to health care for rural New Mexicans.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can find a more equitable way to achieve \nthe kind of savings and fiscal accountability we need. We can agree, \nfor example, that we can develop ways for fairly changing many \nvariables contributing to higher health care costs. Fraud, waste, and \ninefficiency can all be identified, targeted, and changed. We can \nimprove case management, increase use of cost-effective, quality \nmanaged care where appropriate, and focus more on prevention and early \ndetection.\n  I believe the amendment put forth by Senator Rockefeller represents a \nmore equitable, more reasonable approach to the challenges we face. I \nwill support it, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in crafting this budget resolution, the \nRepublican majority has made a great show of its pledge to protect \nSocial Security. But when the American people look behind the rhetoric, \nthey will find that the Republican budget plan is a sneak attack on \nSocial Security, and a violation of our Government's compact with its \ncitizens.\n  As every senior citizen knows, the Medicare part B premium is \ndeducted directly from their Social Security check. When that premium \ngoes up, Social Security benefits go down. The Republican budget will \nraise those premiums and reduce Social Security checks by more than \n$1,750 per senior over the life of this budget plan. For an elderly \ncouple, the reduction in the Social Security check will be $3,500. Next \nyear alone, as a result of this Republican budget, seniors will see a \npremium increase of $134 compared to current law. In effect, that will \neliminate more than half the average COLA increase of $237. Lower \nincome seniors will lose 83 percent of their COLA.\n  Senior citizens rely on their annual cost of living adjustments to \npay for the increased costs of food, housing, fuel, and clothing that \nthey face every year. But under this Republican budget, the majority of \nthat COLA will be stolen to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. The last \ntime the Republicans tried to cut the Social Security COLA they were \nforced to back down. Now they are trying to do it by stealth--but it is \nnot going to work.\n  It is not only through the increase in the Medicare premium that the \nRepublicans are attacking Social Security. In the House budget, the \nRepublicans have arbitrarily assumed an unprecedented, unilateral \nreduction of the CPI of .6 percent. That change is designed to cut \nSocial Security COLA's by another $23 billion over the next 7 years.\n  At the most basic level, the harsh cuts in Medicare contained in this \nbudget resolution are a repudiation of our historic commitment to \nSocial Security, because the distinction between Medicare and Social \nSecurity is a false one. Medicare is part of the same compact between \nthe Government and the people as Social Security. That compact says \n``Contribute during your working years, and we will guarantee basic \nincome and health security in your retirement years.''\n  Any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a \nserious chronic illness knows that there is no retirement security \nwithout Medicare; the cost of illness is too high. A week in an \nintensive care unit can cost more than the total yearly income of many \nsenior citizens.\n  It is the low- and moderate-income elderly who will suffer most from \nthese Medicare cuts. Eighty-three percent of all Medicare spending is \nfor older Americans with annual incomes below $25,000; two-thirds is \nfor those with incomes below $15,000.\n  How can any budget plan that purports to be part of a Contract With \nAmerica break America's contract with the elderly? It is bad enough to \npropose these deep cuts in Medicare at all. It is even worse to make \nthese cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax cut for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  The cuts in Medicare are unprecedented--$256 billion over the next 7 \nyears. By the time the plan is fully phased in, the average senior \ncitizen is likely to pay $900 more a year in Medicare premiums and out-\nof-pocket costs. An elderly couple would have to pay $1,800. Over the \nlife of this budget, they have to pay $6,400 in additional costs.\n  The part B deductible could double under this Republican plan, \nraising the amount a senior citizen would have to pay before they can \nsee a doctor by an additional $100.\n  A typical senior citizen needing home health services could have to \npay an additional $1,200. Anyone who is sick enough to need the full \nhome care benefit could have to pay $3,200.\n  Seniors could lose the freedom to select their own doctor, or face \nunaffordable costs if they refuse to give up their family physician.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Because of gaps \nin Medicare, senior citizens already pay too much for the health care \nthey need. Average elderly Americans pay an astounding one-fifth of \ntheir income to purchase health care--more than they paid before \nMedicare was even enacted 30 years ago. And the reason we enacted \nMedicare then was because the elderly faced a health care crisis then.\n  Lower income, older seniors pay even more than a fifth of their \nincome for health care. Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs. Its \ncoverage of home health care and nursing home care is limited.\n  Unlike private insurance policies, Medicare doesn't have a cap on \nout-of-pocket costs. It doesn't cover eye care or foot care or dental \ncare. Yet this budget plan piles additional medical costs on every \nsenior citizen--while the Republican tax bill that has already passed \nthe House gives a tax break of $20,000 to people making more than \n$350,000 a year.\n  It is interesting to compare the generous benefits that the authors \nof this resolution enjoy under the FEHBP plan available to every Member \nof Congress to the much less adequate benefits provided by Medicare to \nsenior citizens. Medicare has no coverage at all for outpatient \nprescription drugs, but they are fully covered under Blue Cross-Blue \nShield Standard, the most popular FEHBP plan. The combined deductible \nfor doctor and hospital services under Blue Cross/Blue Shield is $350. \nFor Medicare, the combined deductible is $816. Blue Cross/Blue Shield \ncovers unlimited hospital days with no co-payments. Under Medicare, \nseniors face a $179 per day copayment after 60 days and $358 after 90 \ndays. After 150 days, Medicare pays nothing at all. Medicare covers a \nfew preventive services, but it does not cover screening for heart \ndisease, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer--all FEHBP benefits. \nDental services are covered for Members of Congress--but not for senior \ncitizens. Members of Congress are protected against skyrocketing out-\nof-pocket costs by a cap on their total liability, but there is no cap \non how much a senior citizen has to pay for Medicare co-payments on \ndeductibles.\n  Members of Congress earn $133,600 a year. The average senior's income \nis $17,750. For the limited Medicare benefits they receive, seniors pay \n$46.10 a month, but for their comprehensive insurance coverage Members \nof Congress pay a grand total of $44.05 a month--$2.00 less than \nseniors must pay out of incomes one-eighth as large.\n  The Republican sponsors of this resolution do not seem to understand \nthat the average senior citizen has an income of only $17,750 a year. \nBecause of this budget, millions of elderly Americans will be forced to \ngo without the health care they need. Millions more will have to choose \nbetween food on the [[Page S7074]] table, adequate heat in the winter, \npaying the rent, and paying for medical care. These proposals are \ncruel--and they are unjust. Senior citizens have earned their Medicare \nbenefits, they have paid for them, and they deserve them. Yet our \nRepublican friends would deny them.\n  How do they explain this to senior citizens? This is a budget that \nMarie Antoinette would love--let them eat cake.\n  The Medicare cuts in this resolution harm more than senior citizens. \nThese proposals will strike a severe blow to the quality of American \nmedicine, by damaging hospitals and other health care institutions that \ndepend heavily on Medicare.\n  These institutions provide essential health care for Americans of all \nages, not just senior citizens. Progress in medical research and \ntraining of health professionals depend on the financial stability of \nthese institutions. Academic health centers, public hospitals, and \nrural hospitals will bear an especially heavy burden. As \nrepresentatives of the academic health centers that guarantee our \nworld-renowned excellence in health care said of this budget, ``Every \nAmerican's quality of life will suffer as a result.'' Health care \nproviders from the American Hospital Association, to the American \nMedical Association, to the Catholic Health Association have warned of \nthe devastating effects of these cuts on the quality of care.\n  In addition, these massive cuts will inevitably impose a hidden tax \non workers and businesses, as the National Association of Manufacturers \nhas warned. The private sector will face increased costs and higher \ninsurance premiums, as physicians and hospitals shift even more costs \nto the non-elderly. According to recent statistics, Medicare now pays \nonly 68 percent of what the private sector pays for comparable \nphysicians' services; for hospital care, the figure is 69 percent. The \nproposed Republican cuts will widen this already ominous gap.\n  During the course of this debate we have heard a number of arguments \nthat attempt to defend this fundamentally indefensible proposal. We \nheard them over and over again during the course of this debate--as if \nrepetition would somehow make them right.\n  The first argument is that deep cuts are needed to save Medicare from \nbankruptcy. The hypocrisy of this claim is astonishing. Just a few \nweeks ago--before they began to feel the political heat on Medicare \ncuts--the Republicans passed a tax bill through the House that took \nalmost $90 billion in revenues out of the Medicare hospital insurance \ntrust fund over the next 10 years--and brought it that much closer to \ninsolvency. We did not hear a word then about the impending bankruptcy \nof Medicare.\n  We also did not hear about it when last year's Medicare trustee's \nreport was issued. Republicans were too busy last year blocking health \nreform and pretending there was no health care crises at all.\n  This year's trustees report actually shows the Medicare trust fund to \nbe in a stronger financial position than last year. The newfound \nRepublican concern for the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is a \nsham--a convenient pretext to rob Medicare to pay for tax breaks for \ntycoons. Medicare is nowhere near as bankrupt as Republican priorities.\n  It is true that the April 3 report of the Medicare Trustees projects \nthat the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will run out of money \nby 2002. But few if any Republicans would be talking about Medicare \ncuts of this magnitude, absent the need to finance their tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. As the Medicare Trustees themselves noted in their report, \nmodest adjustments can keep Medicare solvent for an additional decade--\nplenty of time to find fair solutions for the longer term.\n  Similar projections of Medicare insolvency have been made numerous \ntimes in the past, but adjustments enacted by Congress were able to \ndeal with the problem without jeopardizing beneficiaries. Now is no \ndifferent. For example, an estimated 20 percent of all Medicare \nhospitalizations could be avoided with better preventive services and \nmore timely primary and outpatient care. As much as 10 percent of all \nMedicare expenditures may be due to fraud, and could be reduced or \neliminated by better oversight. A simple technical change that would \nshift primary responsibility for home health services from the Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund to the Supplementary Insurance Fund would keep the \nHospital Insurance Fund solvent until 2008, without reducing benefits \nor increasing Government costs. This single adjustment would actually \nkeep the Trust Fund solvent a year longer than all the draconian \nRepublican cuts put together.\n  Some Republicans have accused Democrats of attempting to scare \nAmerica's senior citizens. Senior citizens do have reason to fear what \nthis budget resolution will do to their Medicare benefits. But the real \nfear-mongers are those who attempt to cloak their unfair, misguided \nbudget in phony dire warnings about the bankruptcy of Medicare.\n  We don't have to destroy Medicare in order to save it. Congress will \nnever allow the Medicare Trust Fund to become bankrupt. I know it. The \nMembers on the other side of the aisle know it. And the American people \nknow it.\n  Another false Republican argument in defense of Medicare cuts is that \nthey are not really a cut, because the total amount of Medicare \nspending will continue to grow. The fact is that the Republican plan \ncalls for spending $250 billion less on Medicare that the Congressional \nBudget Office says is necessary to maintain the current level of \nservices to the elderly.\n  Every household in America knows that if the cost of your rent, the \ncost of your utilities, and the cost of your food go up--and your \nincome stays the same--you have taken a real cut in your living \nstandard.\n  Only in Washington could someone contend with a straight face that \nmaking senior citizens pay $900 a year more for their medical needs is \nnot a cut in their benefits. Every senior citizen understands that.\n  Republicans speak of a cut in defense, even though defense spending \nhas stayed stable. Apparently, the same Republican logic doesn't apply \nto senior citizens that applies to spending on guns and tanks. Well, I \nsay to them--a cut is a cut is a cut--whether it's in Medicare or \nSocial Security or national defense.\n  To try to defend their no cut argument the Republicans have even \nresorted to quoting President Clinton speaking in favor of his health \nreform plan. This plan included a reduction in Medicare growth as part \nof an overall reform that slowed cost growth throughout the system. \nWhat they have conveniently ignored is that the Clinton plan put every \ndollar taken out of Medicare back into expanded benefits to senior \ncitizens. This Republican budget takes money from senior citizens to \nfund tax cuts for the wealthy. And under the Republican budget, the \nalready dangerous gap between what Medicare pays and the private sector \npays for comparable services will continue to widen, while under the \nClinton plan total Medicare spending would actually have increased at a \nfaster rate than private sector spending.\n  The third specious Republican argument is that Medicare costs can be \ncut by encouraging senior citizens to join managed care. True, such \ncare may help bring Medicare costs under control--in the long run. \nEnrollment by senior citizens in managed care is already increasing \nrapidly. it is up 75 percent since 1990. But no serious analyst \nbelieves that increased enrollment in managed care will substantially \nreduce Medicare expenditures in the time frame of the proposed \nRepublican cuts.\n  In fact, according to the General Accounting Office, Medicare now \nactually loses money on managed care, because the healthiest senior \ncitizens tend to enroll in managed care and the payment formula is too \ngenerous. This kind of problem can easily be worked out, and will help \nto restore the fiscal stability of the program. But the only way to \nsave serious money in the short-term on managed care is to penalize \nthose who refuse to join. This option has already been suggested by the \nRepublican health task force in the House of Representatives.\n  But I say right now to my Republican colleagues--it is wrong to force \nsenior citizens to give up their freedom to choose their own doctors \nand hospitals. It is wrong to penalize them financially if they refuse \nto enroll in managed care. [[Page S7075]] \n  The American people will never accept a policy that tells senior \ncitizens they have no right to go to the hospital and doctor of their \nchoice, or that puts unfair financial pressure on senior citizens to \ngive up that right.\n  The fourth Republican argument is that deep cuts in Medicare are \nnecessary to balance the budget. That argument refutes itself. All it \nproves is that Republican priorities are wrong. Democrats favor a \nbalanced budget, and under President Clinton, we had been making real \nprogress toward that goal. There is a right way to balance the budget, \nand a far-right way. And unfortunately, the Republicans have picked the \nlatter.\n  It is true that we need to bring health care spending under control. \nBut that applies to all health spending, not just Medicare and \nMedicaid. As President Clinton told the White House Conference on Aging \nlast week, 40 percent of the projected increase in Federal spending in \ncoming years will be caused by escalating health costs.\n  But what this Republican budget fails to recognize is that the \ncurrent growth in Medicare spending is a symptom of the underlying \nproblems in the entire health care system--not a defect in Medicare.\n  In fact, Medicare has done a better job than the private sector in \nrestraining costs in recent years. Since 1984, Medicare costs have \nrisen at an annual rate that is 24 percent lower than comparable \nprivate sector health spending. As a result, Medicare now pays only 68 \npercent of what the private sector charges for comparable physicians' \nservices; for hospital care, the figure is 69 percent.\n  Slashing Medicare unilaterally is no way to balance the budget. It \nwill simply shift costs from the budget of the Federal Government to \nthe budgets of senior citizens, their children, and their \ngrandchildren. That is not a real saving.\n  Moreover, senior citizens will also face greater discrimination from \nphysicians and hospitals less willing to accept them as patients, \nbecause Medicare reimbursements are already much lower than the \nreimbursements available under private insurance. Previous cuts in \nMedicare have already led to serious cost shifting, as physicians and \nhospitals seek to make up their reduced income from Medicare patients \nby charging higher fees to other patients. The result has been higher \nhealth costs and health insurance premiums for everyone, as cost \nshifting becomes a significant hidden tax on individuals and \nbusinesses.\n  The right way to slow rising Medicare costs in the context of broader \nhealth reforms that will slow health cost inflation in the economy as a \nwhole. That is the way to bring Federal health costs under control, \nwithout cutting benefits of shifting costs to working families. In the \ncontext of broader reform, the needs of academic health centers, rural \nhospitals, and inner city hospitals can also be met. Unilateral \nMedicare cuts alone, by contrast, could reduce the availability and \nquality of care for young and old alike.\n  The President has said that he is willing to work for bipartisan \nreform of the overall health care system, but the Republicans have said \nno. The only bipartisanship they seem to be interested in is the kind \nthat says, ``Join us in slashing Medicare.'' That is not the \nbipartisanship the American people want or the elderly deserve.\n  The cuts in Medicaid proposed in this budget are equally unfair--a \ntotal of $175 billion over 7 years--a devastating 30-percent reduction \nfrom the current spending levels. The double whammy of huge Medicare \ncuts and huge Medicaid cuts will hit hospitals and other health care \nproviders even harder than Medicare cuts alone. Struggling State \ngovernments and State and local taxpayers will also face heavy burdens. \nMassachusetts would lose $4.4 billion in Federal matching funds over \nthe next 7 years. By the year 2002, we would need to increase State \nspending by 26 percent to maintain current program levels.\n  Other States with higher Federal matching rates would be hit even \nharder. New Mexico would lose $1.3 billion, and would have to increase \nprogram spending by a massive 87 percent. Nationally, State and local \ntaxpayers would have to increase program spending by 35 percent by the \nyear 2002 to maintain program levels.\n  States cannot afford these huge increases. And the impact of these \narbitrary cuts on real people is even more disturbing. Medicaid is a \nkey part of the safety net for senior citizens, the disabled, and \nchildren. Two-thirds of all Medicaid spending is for senior citizens \nand the disabled. If an elderly American becomes sick enough to need \nlong-term nursing home care, Medicaid is the only source of funding \nafter personal savings are exhausted. Cuts in Medicaid will mean that \nneeded care for senior citizens is denied. Heavy additional burdens \nwill be imposed on their children and grandchildren.\n  Children also depend on Medicaid. Eighteen million children--more \nthan a quarter of all children in our country--receive health care \nunder Medicaid. More than half of these children are members of working \nfamilies. Their parents work hard--most of them 8 hours a day, 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year. Without Medicaid's help, all their hard work \nwill not buy their children the health care they need.\n  We often hear that the reason to balance the budget is for America's \nchildren. A budget that denies health care to millions of children is \nthe wrong way to express concern for their future.\n  The recent V-E Day ceremonies reminded us that today's senior \ncitizens have stood by America in war and peace. America must stand by \nthem now. Senior citizens have worked hard. They've played by the \nrules. They contributed to Medicare. They have earned their Medicare \nbenefits, and they deserve to have them. Yet this Republican budget \nproposes to take those benefits away.\n  The amendment we are offering will restore a large part of these \nunfair cuts. I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will take a step \nback from this debate and examine what these cuts in Medicare and long-\nterm care would mean in real terms for real people. I believe that \nthese reductions are simply wrong. They violate our American values of \nfairness.\n  These are not just numbers on a page. We are talking about injecting \nfear into the lives of people who deserve to spend their retirement \nyears in peace. The cuts seem all the more callous given that they are \nbeing made to finance tax cuts for the most affluent Americans.\n  Let us talk about people, not programs, for a moment. The people we \nare discussing fought the wars, paid the taxes and built the wealth \nthat all of us here have enjoyed. We just marked the 50-year \nanniversary of V-E Day. Many of the people who won that war for us are \nnow on Medicare. The least they deserve is to live their last years in \ndignity. In their twilight years, they deserve better than this budget \ngives them.\n  There is no way these cuts would not hit people of modest means. \nMedicare is not a program for the rich. Today, Medicare serves 35 \nmillion seniors, who have a median income of $17,000. Seventy-eight \npercent earn less than $25,000 a year. The typical senior already \nspends 21 percent of his or her income on out-of-pocket health costs. \nThat compares to 8 percent for non-seniors. Should we really be jacking \nup those out-of-pocket costs to pay for a $20,000 tax cut for people \nmaking over $350,000 a year?\n\n\n                         Cuts Would Be Painful\n\n  Despite all the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, these cuts \nwould be painful. This is what Robert Reischauer, the highly respected \nformer director of the CBO, had to say about the reductions:\n\n       There's no way to do this without imposing real sacrifice \n     and real pain, and both beneficiaries and providers will feel \n     it. The notion that this can be squeezed out of the system \n     with greater efficiencies is wishful thinking.\n\n  Taking a hacksaw to medicare, as this budget proposes, would be \ndevastating. Recipients of care would pay $3200 more over the next \nseven years. That is an enormous hardship for seniors living on modest, \nfixed incomes.\n  Businesses and workers who have private insurance would be hurt, too. \nWithout overall reform, cutting medicare would not necessarily cut the \nactual cost of visiting a doctor or hospital. So doctors and hospitals \nwould in all likelihood try to shift costs of $40 to $50 billion from \nmedicare patients to privately insured businesses and workers. That is \nnothing but a hidden tax [[Page S7076]] that private businesses and \ntheir employees neither deserve nor can afford.\n\n\n                             Long-Term Care\n\n  The cuts in this budget resolution would also decimate the long-term \ncare protection that Medicaid provides seniors. Working families with a \nparent who needs long-term care would face nursing home bills of an \naverage of $38,000 a year without Medicaid's long-term care protection. \nWhere will our seniors who have spent down all their savings and now \nrely on Medicaid to pay for their nursing home care go without such \nprotection?\n\n\n                          Impact On Hospitals\n\n  These cuts would particularly hit rural and innercity hospitals with \nlarge concentrations of elderly and low-income patients. In my own \nstate of Connecticut, home to many urban hospitals, Medicare makes up \n40 percent of all hospital revenue. Half of the hospitals in \nConnecticut are teaching hospitals, which rely heavily on Medicare to \ntrain tomorrow's physicians.\n  Many of these hospitals already operate on the edge: some may have to \nclose their doors if such an important source of financing is slashed. \nNearly 10 million Medicare recipients live in rural America, where \nthere is often only one hospital serving a county. Draconian Medicare \ncuts like those proposed by the Republicans could force many of those \nrural hospitals out of business.\n\n\n                           A Different Course\n\n  We must do something to control Medicare spending, but we cannot do \nit in isolation. The problems of Medicare are the same problems facing \nthe entire health care system. To focus only on Medicare puts its \nrecipients at risk and would have unintended consequences for the rest \nof the health care system.\n  We need honest, thorough health care reform, and I invite our \nRepublican colleagues to begin a dialogue with us on this important \nsubject. But I also ask them to step back from the draconian cuts in \nMedicare and long-term care. I hope my colleagues will support the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nvery serious concerns about the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid which are \ncontained in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues across the aisle have stated repeatedly \nthat they are not touching Social Security. But at the same time over a \nthird of the cuts which they have proposed, including over 40 percent \nof the cuts in the year 2002, come from Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing what the \nproposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts will mean to our most vulnerable \ncitizens. As I discuss these impacts, I would like my colleagues to ask \nthemselves how they can credibly claim that this budget does not reduce \nthese people's security.\n  Let me start with Medicare. This budget cuts spending for the \nMedicare program by $256 billion over 7 years. I would like to spend a \nminute discussing what these numbers mean in human terms. They mean \nthat seniors will have to find an average of $3,447 more to pay for \ntheir health care over the next 7 years. In my home State of New \nJersey, seniors will have to come up with an additional $932 in the \nyear 2002 alone just to pay for the additional Medicare costs which \nthis budget imposes on them. For many seniors across the country, these \nnew costs will be extremely difficult to bear. In 1992, the median \nincome of seniors in this country was only about $17,000 a year, and \nabout a quarter of elderly households had incomes under $10,000. Of \nthese incomes, seniors already spend more than one of every five \ndollars on medical costs. For the millions of seniors across the \ncountry who live on fixed incomes, finding an additional $3,447 over 7 \nyears will mean having to give up something else which is important to \nthem. It is estimated that there are already nearly 8 million seniors \nnationwide who are forced to choose each month between paying for their \nmedications and paying for food. I can't help wondering how many \nmillions more seniors will be faced with this horrible choice once the \nproposed cuts go into place.\n  An increased financial burden on seniors is only one of the negative \nconsequences which will result from the proposed Medicare cuts. Along \nwith having to pay more, seniors will likely find that their ability to \nchoose their own doctor is restricted--perhaps not explicitly, but \nbecause financial limitations leave them with no choice but to join a \nmanaged care plan. Also, doctors, hospitals, and others providers are \nall likely to face reduced payments. They already receive far lower \npayments from Medicare than from private insurers, and if\n Medicare rates are reduced much further some may find that they can no \nlonger afford to take Medicare patients. Those who do keep accepting \nMedicare will be forced to shift even more costs onto their privately \ninsured patients, creating a hidden tax on employers and individuals.\n\n  And that's just Medicare. In addition, this budget cuts Medicaid by \n$175 billion. That's an 18 percent cut, relative to what spending would \nbe if there were no change in law. I think it is very important that we \nall understand exactly who these cuts will affect. Medicaid now insures \nabout one of every four American children. It pays for roughly one of \nevery three births in this country. And it pays for over three-fifths \nof the people who need long-term care services, either in nursing homes \nor at home. Over half of Medicaid funds go for persons who are either \nelderly, blind, or disabled. Most elderly recipients of Medicaid are \npeople who spent their whole lives as members of the middleclass. But \nwhen faced with nursing home costs averaging almost $40,000 a year, it \ndoesn't take long for their entire life savings to disappear. Once they \nreach this point, these people have nowhere else to turn. Thank \ngoodness Medicaid has been there to provide a safety net for them.\n  This resolution caps Federal Medicaid spending at an average annual \ngrowth rate of 5 percent. We all know that Medicaid spending is \nexpected to grow much faster than that in the future. By setting a 5 \npercent cap, the Federal Government is essentially saying to the \nStates: ``It's all your problem now. We can't figure out how to deal \nwith the growing number of uninsured and the rising costs of health \ncare, so you do it. We wash our hands of any responsibility to help you \ndeal with these critical needs.'' But, if we are honest with ourselves, \nwe must admit that States can't cope with these problems alone.\n  So, Mr. President, let me tell you what is expected to happen once \nthese proposed Medicaid cuts go into effect. By the year 2002, the \nnumber of uninsured children in American is predicted to rise by more \nthan 6 million. By that same year, there will be an additional 3 \nmillion persons who need--but can not get assistance with--the costs of \nlong-term care. These will be people who will be required to leave \nnursing homes, or will never be able to enter one, despite the fact \nthat they need more care than their family and friends are able to \nprovide, either financially or physically. As I stated earlier, many of \nthese people are now members of the middle-class, but the astronomical \ncosts of long-term care will impoverish them rapidly. For those persons \nwho are able to enter and remain in nursing homes the picture is not \nmuch brighter. Medicaid now pays significantly less than the private \nsector for long-term care. When Medicaid cuts these payments even \nfurther--as it will have to do in response to the budget cuts--nursing \nhomes will have to do even more with less. This means that staff will \nbe stretched even thinner, and each resident will receive even less \npersonal attention. The proposed cuts will mean that the quality of \nlife of nursing home residents will deteriorate even further.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my remarks have helped put a human face on \nall the numbers which have been floating around the floor of this \nchamber the last few days. I recognize that reducing the deficit will \nrequire painful choices. But in making these choices, we can not ignore \nhow these decisions, will impact the persons whom we have been elected \nto represent. My colleagues across the aisle claim that they are \nconcerned about the impact of deficit reduction on our oldest and most \nvulnerable citizens. They have stated repeatedly that Social Security \nis ``off the table'' -- that it has not been cut. To them I respond: \nMedicare and Medicaid are vital parts of our social security system. \nThey provide security at a time when people are most vulnerable--when \nthey are sick. To [[Page S7077]] take over a third of your proposed \ncuts out of Medicare and Medicaid is to deny security when it is most \nneeded.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe amendment offered by my colleagues, Senators Rockefeller and \nLautenberg, to restore critical funding to the Medicare Program.\n  In order to provide a significant tax cut to the very wealthy, Senate \nRepublicans have proposed a budget resolution which includes draconian \ncuts in many important programs, including a substantial cut in \nMedicare. In my view, drastic cuts on the spending side, in order to \ncreate room for a tax cut, are not appropriate and do not reflect the \npriorities of this Senator. I oppose the Senate Republican budget \nproposal and feel very strongly that the resolution before us directly \nthreatens the health and well-being of our Nation's seniors citizens.\n  Over half the people who receive Medicare are older Americans with \nincomes below $15,000 a year. The Republican budget with its deep \nMedicare cuts lay the basis for tax cuts for the very wealthy. This is \nthe situation before us.\n  The proposed Senate Republican budget resolution would cut Medicare \nby $256 billion over the next 7 years. I know it is asserted that the \nactual dollar amounts for Medicare will not drop, but rather will \nincrease gradually over the next 7 years. However, if the proposed \ndollar increases are not proportional to increases in Medicare \nenrollees and increases in the costs of medical care, the end result is \nmassive cost shifting and cuts in services for beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, in my view, it is essential that we recognize that \nMedicare is not a system unto itself. The Medicare Program is, instead, \na large component of our Nation's health care system and it is \nillogical to assume that isolated cuts in Medicare will not adversely \neffect all Americans.\n  First and foremost, these ill-conceived cuts would harm our senior \ncitizens. The Health Care Finance Administration [HCFA] estimates that \nMedicare payments account for 45 percent of health care spending by our \nNation's elderly. Under the GOP budget plan, out-of-pocket costs to \nseniors are expected to increase by an average of $900 per person per \nyear by the year 2002. Over a 7-year period, the typical beneficiary \nwould pay an estimated $3,200 in additional out-of-pocket costs. While \nthis might not sound like much to some, these numbers become more \nsignificant when you factor in statistics which indicate that 60 \npercent of program spending was incurred on behalf of those with \nincomes less than twice the poverty level, and 83 percent of program \nspending was on behalf of those with annual incomes of less than \n$25,000.\n  Clearly, when we talk about Medicare recipients, we are not talking \nabout our Nation's wealthiest citizens. Many seniors live on fixed \nincomes. In fact, a large number of Medicare recipients depend on \nSocial Security benefits for much of their income. According to HCFA, \nabout 60 percent of the elderly rely on Social Security benefits for 50 \npercent or more of their income and 32 percent of the elderly rely on \nSocial Security for 80 percent or more of their income. It is also \nestimated that as many as 2 million seniors can expect to see the value \nof their Social Security COLA's decline as increased Medicare costs \nconsume 40 to 50 percent of Social Security COLA's by 2002. Requiring \nthese individuals to pay more for their health care will directly \nundercut their standard of living. In my view, it is simply \nunacceptable to create a situation where more and more seniors will see \ntheir resources stretched to the degree that they will have to choose \nbetween food and health care.\n  As a result of the proposed cuts in the Republican budget resolution, \nseniors may also end up paying more for the services they currently \nreceive. The number of Medicare recipients is expected to increase over \nthe next several decades just as the baby boomer generation reaches \nretirement age. The Republican budget proposal fails to account for \nthis projected growth. Therefore, in order to make ends meet, hospitals \nand other health care centers will have to shift costs to other payers \nor cut valuable services which are supported, in part, by Medicare \nreimbursements. According to the American Hospital Association, costly \nbut crucial services like trauma care units, burn units and intensive \ncare units would have to be closed in many hospitals. Teaching \nhospitals, which receive a higher rate of reimbursement for Medicare \npatients than nonteaching hospitals, will suffer losses in revenue \ncertain to impact the fiscal integrity of these institutions. \nReductions in funding to such institutions will result in less support \nfor services, research, and education. Such consequences impact us all \nand illustrate clearly the danger of arbitrarily cutting this critical \nprogram.\n  In addition, businesses and working Americans could see increased \nhealth care costs and higher premiums as health care providers and \ninstitutions shift a larger portion of costs to the nonelderly in an \nattempt to cover rising medical costs and provide quality services with \nlimited resources. Communities could also see increases in State and \nlocal taxes in order to assist financially strapped hospitals and \nhealth care providers.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Program does not operate in a vacuum. \nCuts of the magnitude being proposed by the Republicans will impact us \nall. I am not suggesting that the Medicare system does not need to be \nreformed. What I am suggesting is that there is a right way and a wrong \nway to make changes in the system and how we go about doing so provides \na clear picture of what kind of society we are going to be.\n  In his 1941 message to Congress, Franklin Roosevelt articulated a \nsecond bill of rights which established a basic standard of security \nand prosperity for all Americans. Among these rights is ``the right to \nadequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good \nhealth.'' The proposed Republican budget resolution seriously threatens \nthis basic standard and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthe Rockefeller-Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The focus of debate today has been on what to do about \nMedicare. I think all of us share the concern over the grim news that \nthe Medicare trustees announced a few weeks ago, namely, that the \nMedicare trust fund is going bankrupt.\n  I support the budget resolution that calls for a bipartisan \ncommission to devise a plan to basically pull Medicare out of its \nfinancial crisis. Just as we restored public confidence in the Social \nSecurity system over a decade ago through a bipartisan panel, the only \nway to fix Medicare is also through a bipartisan panel.\n  The amendment I am offering today for myself, Senators Dole and \nBradley, urges the bipartisan commission to give high priority to a \nproblem that is costing the Medicare Program, senior citizens, and \ntaxpayers across the country billions of dollars every year: health \ncare fraud in Medicare.\n  For the past 3 years, the staff on the Senate Special Committee on \nAging has been investigating the explosion of fraud and abuse \nthroughout the U.S. health care system. Nearly a trillion dollars is \nspent on health care each year, and roughly 10 percent is lost through \nabusive practices and fraudulent activities.\n  Over the past 5 years, the estimated losses from health care system \nfraud total $418 billion. That is four times the amount lost to the \nsavings and loan crisis--all those scandals, four times the amount just \nin the past 5 years.\n  A major victim of this health care fraud is the American taxpayer. In \n1993, spending on Medicare and Medicaid totaled some $272 billion, or \nover 30 percent of all the moneys we spend on health care in this \ncountry. The Federal Government loses as much as $30 billion a year due \nto fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid systems and as much as $44 \nbillion from fraud when we take into account all of the Federal health \ncare programs.\n  Taxpayers are losing $44 billion a year today through health care \nfraud. I think this only represents a tiny fraction of the problem. \nThese are the ones that we know about, the ones that are being caught \nand prosecuted. I think they represent a tiny fraction of the level of \nfraudulent activity taking place in this country.\n  Mr. President, it is shockingly simple to defraud the current system. \nThe payors are running as fast as they can to process the over four \nbillion claims that are filed every year, and law enforcement simply is \nlacking in the resources necessary to really detect and prosecute this \nfraudulent activity.\n  Recently the Aging Committee heard, I think, some compelling \ntestimony on the extent of the fraud in this country. FBI Director, \nLouis Freeh, testified ``We see cocaine dealers turning into health \ncare fraud entrepreneurs'' because that is where the money is big--but \nenforcement is little.\n   [[Page S7080]] Director Freeh also told the committee about how the \nRussian mafia and other organized criminal groups from every corner of \nthe globe are now engaged in creative schemes to siphon off money from \nthe Government and private health care funds.\n  Mr. President, padding claims and cost reports, charging the \nGovernment beneficiaries outrageous prices for unbundled services, and \nbilling Medicare for program costs that have nothing to do with patient \ncare are but a few of the schemes that are currently ruining our \nsystem.\n  The Medicare system is the one that is being targeted because of its \nsheer size and complexity. At our hearing, the Aging Committee heard \ntestimony that we are experiencing ``a feeding frenzy'' on the Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs, equivalent to ``unprecedented white collar \nwilding in which wave after wave of multimillion dollar frauds have \nswept through nursing homes and hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, \ndurable medical equipment, radiology and labs, and more recently, home \nhealth care.''\n  I would like to share with my colleagues just a few examples of how \nMedicare is being exploited and how fraudulent providers are draining \nMedicare, siphoning off these precious dollars from the Medicare trust \nfund and increasing the costs for senior citizens.\n  A chain of health home care companies were discovered by Medicare \nauditors to have been billing Medicare for over $16,000 in alcoholic \nbeverages at conferences, over $9,800 in personal travel for the \nowner's family, and over $3,200 in golf shop expenses. The home care \ncompanies also allegedly charged the Medicare Program for over $100,000 \nin promotional items given to doctors and others to encourage them to \nuse the company's home health care, including $85,000 in gourmet \npopcorn provided to doctors. Let me repeat that: $85,000 for gourmet \npopcorn going to doctors to promote the use of these home care \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to call on our senior citizens to bear \ncuts in Medicare when they learn that their Medicare taxes and premiums \nare being used to pay for gourmet popcorn.\n  It is not limited to gourmet popcorn and golf shop fees. Let me give \na couple of other examples of the costs that are driving Medicare close \nto bankruptcy.\n  We have the case of a phantom laboratory allegedly cheating Medicare \nout of $300,000 for lab tests that were never performed. The so-called \nlab submitted the bills that were really no more than a rented mailbox \nand a Medicare billing number.\n  We had a medical equipment supplier billed Medicare close to $1,300 \napiece for wheelchair pads that cost about $50 to $100 to manufacture, \nrepresenting a markup of roughly 2,500 percent.\n  We have an equipment supplier that allegedly billed Medicare for \n$4,000 apiece for compressors used to treat swelling. The devices cost \nless than $500 each.\n  We have a chiropractor and his wife who defrauded Medicare and \nprivate insurers by billing for services never provided. One time bills \nwere submitted for 169 patients supposedly treated in a single day.\n  We had four companies who peddled liquid nutritional supplements by \noffering ``free medical milk.'' These companies then billed Medicare \nfor over $14 million for the supplements that were not medically \nnecessary, and that were often not even delivered to the Medicare \npatients.\n  While I want to emphasize that by far most health care providers are \nhonest professionals with only the best interest of patients and \nMedicare beneficiaries in mind, without a doubt there is fraud in each \nsegment of the health care industry. The cases I have mentioned are \njust a small example of the kinds of rip-offs that are being \nperpetrated day in and day out in our Medicare Program, and indeed, \nthroughout the entire U.S. health care system.\n  Mr. President, we cannot wait any longer. I have tried for the past 2 \nyears to introduce legislation that would deal with Medicare fraud. \nEach time it has been blunted. On the one hand, the Senate passed an \namendment to the crime bill containing some of the provisions of my \nlegislation, only to have the House strip them out saying that this \nanti-fraud legislation does not belong on the crime bill. It belongs on \nhealth care reform. Of course, we did not have health care reform last \nyear.\n  I tried every single way to attach the health care fraud legislation \nto appropriations bills last year, including the D.C. appropriations \nbill, but others sought to amend it, because they wanted to load down \nthis amendment with other issues.\n  Mr. President, as a result of this, we have had to wait for health \ncare fraud reforms. What we are doing is we are losing roughly $11.5 \nmillion to health care fraud every hour. That is precisely what is \nbeing lost through fraud. We are losing $11.5 million an hour, $275 \nmillion a day, $100 billion a year.\n  Mr. President, this legislation that I have introduced the past 2 \nyears was included in virtually every health care bill that was \ncirculating last Congress: The Dole bill, the President Clinton bill, \nthe so-called Mainstream Coalition bill. These provisions in the \nlegislation that I have introduced had the support of the Justice \nDepartment, the Director of the FBI, and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services' inspector general. I believe the White House is now \nalso advocating health care fraud enforcement measures.\n  Now is the time to move forward with the bill. It has been introduced \nand will be considered as separate, free-standing legislation, \nhopefully in the very near future. In the meantime, what we have to do \nis at least go on record as saying we have to put a stop to the level \nof fraud taking place in our health care system today, particularly in \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  This resolution calls upon the bipartisan panel to look at ways in \nwhich we can reduce the perpetration of fraud against our system, that \nthose moneys can be saved. Perhaps we will not be able to recover all \nthe dollars lost to health care fraud in Medicare, but we will be able \nto recover some of these billions that are now being lost to fraud and \nabuse. Hopefully, the amounts recovered will be used to increase our \nhealth care fraud enforcement efforts, to reduce the deficit, and to \napply to the Medicare trust fund itself. It seems to me that would be \nan appropriate recommendation for the trustees of the Medicare trust \nfund to endorse.\n  I am hoping that we will use the same sort of bipartisan commission \nto restore public confidence in the solvency of Medicare that was \nformed in the wake of the declaration over a decade ago that Social \nSecurity was going broke.\n  I mentioned this morning during my remarks that the issue was \nexploited by the Democratic majority at that time. They waited until \nafter the 1982 elections were over and exploited the issue and then \ncame back in and said, ``Let us form that bipartisan panel.''\n  We did. The Social Security trust fund is solvent at least until the \nyear 2020 or 2030. We need to do precisely the same thing now. We have \nto call together a bipartisan panel to look at what is taking place in \nour health care system. The FBI has identified areas of fraud. We can \nlook at the New York Times on Sunday's edition and find another example \nof the kind of scams that are being perpetrated against our elderly--\nnot confined just to health care, but scams that target the elderly in \ngeneral--and we have to put a stop to it. We have an opportunity to \ntake a big step toward cracking down on scams targeting the elderly and \nprograms serving the elderly by passing legislation that will give the \ntools and resources necessary to law enforcement officials to \naccomplish that end.\n  There should be no political disagreement on this issue. This cannot \nbe delayed another day, another week, another year, or else the very \npeople that we are trying to help who are now facing the prospect of \nhaving their Medicare trust fund go broke within a 6\\1/2\\ year period \nof time will be the ultimate losers. We will be the ultimate losers.\n  We have an opportunity to prevent that from taking place through \nreforms contained in the budget resolution itself, which Senator \nDomenici as chairman is calling for so we do not see the growth of 10.5 \npercent but rather 7 or 7.1 percent. In that 7.1 percent, we can save \nbillions of dollars by adopting the legislation that everyone says that \nwe need.\n  Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time today since time \nhas now been limited. Let me say that this is an \n[[Page S7081]] important resolution. Hopefully, it will enjoy \nbipartisan and perhaps even unanimous support, so we can all go on \nrecord as in favor of giving this panel an opportunity to consider ways \nto shape legislation to prevent the kind of fraudulent activity that is \nrobbing our senior citizens of their trust funds and driving up the \ncosts of Medicare and the entire health care system.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). If neither side yields time, the \ntime is charged equally.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1116), as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 94, after line 21, add the following new section.\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LOSSES OF TRUST FUNDS \n                   DUE TO FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the General Accounting Office estimates that as much as \n     $100,000,000,000 are wasted each year in the health care \n     system due to fraud and abuse;\n       (2) outlays for the Medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act during fiscal year 1994 were \n     $161,100,000,000, and the General Accounting Office estimates \n     that up to 10 percent of those outlays were wasted because of \n     fraud and abuse;\n       (3) medicare beneficiaries incur higher out-of-pocket costs \n     and copayments due to inflated billings resulting from \n     fraudulent and abusive practices perpetrated against the \n     medicare program; and\n       (4) funds lost because of fraud and abuse are contributing \n     to the financial crisis of the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance \n     Trust Fund, as identified by the Boards of Trustees of such \n     trust funds in their 1995 annual reports.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that as the Committee on Finance of the Senate and, if \n     established, the Bipartisan Commission on the Solvency of \n     Medicare recommended under section 307, address the long-term \n     solvency of the medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), high priority \n     should be given to proposals which identify, eliminate, and \n     recover funds expended from the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance \n     Trust Fund due to, fraud and abuse in such program.\n       In addition the Senate assumes that funds recovered from \n     enhanced antifraud and abuse efforts be used to fund health \n     care anti-fraud and abuse enforcement efforts, reimbursements \n     to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for losses due to \n     fraud and abuse, and deficit reduction.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, by most estimates, the costs of health care \nin the United States approach $1 trillion annually. By the turn of the \ncentury, the figure will exceed $1.5 trillion, consuming up to 16 \npercent of the Nation's gross domestic product.\n  Since health insurance experts, the FBI, and other agencies agree \nthat fraud and abuse can account for as much as 5 to 10 percent of \nthese costs, any effort to rein in health spending needs to address \nthis problem. That is why I commend my colleague from Maine for \nbringing his amendment to the floor.\n  Still, I must raise some concerns about the language my colleague \nproposes which would have the Senate go on record in support of using \nhealth care fraud related fines and penalties to finance our \ninvestigative efforts in this area.\n  Frankly, I feel it is a dangerous precedent. We need to carefully \ncontemplate whether such a financing mechanism will taint our anti-\nfraud effort.\n  Historically, Congress has frowned on financing law enforcement \nactivities through criminal and civil fines and penalties. Yet, this \namendment--as did most of the major health care bills last Congress--\nsuggests that our Nation's antifraud efforts should be funded through \nfines, penalties, and damages collected.\n  I believe this sort of a system will create an incentive for Federal \ninvestigators to forgo prosecution or exclusion where warranted--or \npursue civil actions where unwarranted--in favor of large civil \npenalties that will provide additional funding for investigators. Year \nafter year, Federal agencies associated with such a program will be \nmotivated by their immediate fiscal needs. I think this is a serious \nissue.\n  Americans have witnessed how civil forfeiture and the resultant dash \nfor cash by law enforcement has, in some cases, inappropriately driven \nlaw enforcement investigations. We must be sure that we do not \ncompromise the priorities and integrity of our law enforcement \nofficials.\n  I also have concerns about taking one penny which could be used to \nreplenish the Medicare trust funds and dedicating it to law enforcement \npurposes. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in fiscal year \n1994, Federal spending for the Medicare Program totaled an estimated \n$162 billion, or over $440 million a day. CBO estimates that, in less \nthan a decade, Medicare spending will more than double from $181 \nbillion in 1995 to $463 billion in 2005.\n  Even by the most conservative estimates, billions of dollars are \nbeing lost to waste, fraud, and abuse and that is a luxury we cannot \nafford. However, Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is going \nbankrupt; in fact, its balances will dip into the red next year. We \nshould use any recoveries from illspent Medicare funds to put back into \nthe trust funds, not for new purposes.\n  As I stated earlier in my remarks, I have strong concerns regarding \nthe use of health care fraud related fines and penalties to finance \ninvestigative efforts in this area. Moreover, it seems to me that any \nfunds recovered should be used for their original purpose which is to \nprovide health care to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I support the spirit with which my colleague offers this broadly \ncrafted amendment. But, I have serious reservations about the so-called \nbounty hunter provisions contained in the second part of this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I will support the Cohen amendment, but reserve my \nrights to debate this matter further on the floor should legislation in \nthis area be considered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In suggesting that, does the Senator suggest \nthat the quorum be divided equally?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally \nwith the time running against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak on the Harkin-Hollings amendment during the remainder \nof this time between now and the beginning of the debate on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not think anybody disagrees that we \nneed to reduce dramatically the portion of our revenues that we expend \non interest on the national debt. There is no disagreement that the \ncurrent level of debt which was built up particularly in the 1980's and \nearly parts of this decade needs to be brought under control. The \ninterest on that debt is robbing us of the ability to invest in our \nchildren and in our future. We need to bring our annual deficits down \nto zero. We need to start to reduce the underlying debt in order to \nensure that our children are not saddled with the interest burden that \nwe bear today. [[Page S7082]] \n  Mr. President, we can go about this task in a shortsighted way by \njust cutting programs, including education and training programs and \ninvestments in our future, and reducing taxes at the same time--that is \nessentially what the Budget Committee has proposed. It said we shall \ncut programs, we shall take the savings from those cuts and reserve \nthem for a tax cut . Or we can take the responsible and long-term and \ncomprehensive approach that the Harkin-Hollings amendment will propose. \nThat amendment restores funding to the function of the budget that \nprovides for education and training, including student loans.\n  If we free our children from the burden of the Federal debt only by \ndepriving them of the education and training they will need to compete \nand succeed in the global and technologically driven economy of the \nnext century, then we have not been responsible. All we have done is \ntrade one burden, which is debt payments, for another, which is \ninadequate skills. The budget resolution which has been presented does \njust that. It is anti-working-families and anti-seniors and anti-\nfuture.\n  What the Harkin-Hollings amendment does is to take the $170 billion \nthe committee has identified and earmarked for a tax cut, and applies \n$40 billion of that to restore some of the funding that has been cut by \nthe Republican budget in the areas of education and training. The $40 \nbillion is still far short of what we should be restoring to that vital \nfunction, but it will help significantly.\n  When given the choice of a tax cut, which will go largely to wealthy \ntaxpayers--at least the blueprint that the House has announced clearly \nintends that--or reinvestment in education and training for working \ncitizens and for our neediest children, I do not think we should \nhesitate for a moment to forego the cut in taxes and seek the longer \nterm benefit that we will reap from educating our children.\n  Let me make one thing very clear. The Budget Committee resolution \ndoes drastically cut education and training programs. I have heard \nvarious proponents for the budget say that all they are doing is \nrestraining the growth in spending and not really cutting. That \nargument does not apply to the budget for education. The GOP budget \ndoes provide for less funding in 1996 than we are spending in 1995. It \nprovides for a decreasing amount thereafter. Over 7 years, 25 percent \nis taken out of the level of funding for these programs, the level that \nthey receive today, when you measure that in constant dollars.\n  Furthermore, the GOP figures make no adjustment for the fact that the \npopulation is growing. There will be 9 percent more children of school \nage in the next 7 years in this country. In my home State of New \nMexico, the estimate is there will be 12 percent more children in \nschool. But the GOP budget does not take into account that increase in \nthe school age population. So the effect of the budget is to make \nStates stretch dollars with a shrinking value over an increasing number \nof students.\n  Let me be specific. My State of New Mexico has the third highest rate \nof child poverty of any State in the country. More than 1 in 4 children \nin my State live in families with incomes below the poverty line. One-\nthird of the students in New Mexico's schools have limited proficiency \nin English. Our school-age population has grown tremendously. It has \ngrown much faster than the school-age population in most parts of the \ncountry, and that growth is anticipated to continue.\n  Against this background, we are facing actual decreases in funds for \nthe programs that serve our students.\n  The title I program, formerly known as chapter 1, provides about $850 \nper disadvantaged student to help them meet high standards in math and \nin reading. That is the 1995 number, the current fiscal year, before \nthe rescission that we have voted on and that the President has \nindicated he will veto.\n  The Budget Committee chairman has expressed an intent, expressed in \nthis budget resolution, that title I funds not be cut but instead be \nfrozen. If that intent is carried out by the appropriators and title I \nin fact is not cut the way that other education programs will be cut, \nthe result for New Mexico is not that we will enjoy ``level funding'' \nof the program; no, it will mean that we receive the same number of \ndollars each year for the program. Those same number of dollars will \nbuy less and less as the 7 years progress and the costs of education--\nsupplies, teacher salaries, and energy costs--all increase.\n  So even if our population did not grow, we would be facing a decrease \nin the real buying power of the Federal dollars for education. But, of \ncourse, the population is growing. It is expected to grow over 12 \npercent in the next 7 years. So instead of 88,000 children being \neligible for title I services in my State, as is the case today, there \nwill be almost 99,000 eligible students by the year 2002. Today we \nserve 73 percent of the students eligible for title I. In 2002, that \npercentage will decline considerably to near 50 percent. That will mean \nalmost 50,000 poor children from New Mexico who will not receive the \nservices they need to meet high standards that we are setting for our \nchildren.\n  It is clear that if the funding is frozen to 1995 levels, then almost \n4 million needy children will be denied assistance nationwide. If \nprograms are cut at even 25 percent across the board, then title I \nwould leave another 1 million children unserved.\n  What I just described assumes that title I will not be cut and that \nthat proposal to not cut title I is carried out. If that assumption is \ncorrect, then all of the other programs will have to be cut drastically \nin order to achieve the overall decrease in the budget category that \nthis budget requires.\n  What are some of those other programs? Technology is one of the \nprograms. The current programs which are attempting to bring technology \nto the classroom will have to be cut. Mr. President, these programs are \nvery, very limited at the present time. In 1995, we have committed $40 \nmillion to this effort, assuming the rescission bill does not pass. But \neven that would be seriously jeopardized if this budget resolution is \nadopted.\n  The Star Schools Program, again, would face a drastic cut. Obviously, \nwe cannot tell just what the appropriators will do. The Star Schools \nProgram tries to bring distance learning, technology-based education to \nour neediest schools, especially those in isolated rural areas, and \nthose funds will likely be cut as well.\n  Because of the nature of Federal programs--which are usually targeted \nto the neediest students--withdrawal of Federal aid will hurt those \nStates that are least able to make up the shortfall themselves. New \nMexico is one of those States.\n  Let me talk for just a moment about higher education funding, Mr. \nPresident. The budget includes a $14 billion cut in student loan aid \nand an undetermined cut in Pell grants.\n  Mr. President, Pell grants are critical to students in my State. I \nnoted above that the poverty rate in my State is among the highest in \nthe Nation. The way out of poverty is education. Yet many of our \ncitizens are not able to afford that education. They depend upon Pell \ngrants. They depend upon work-study and Stafford loans and State aid to \npay for the increased cost of higher education.\n  The GOP budget says that the Pell grants will remain at current \nfunding--at least that is the apparent intent--but what does it mean? \nIt means that the total Pell grant funding will remain at 1995 levels \nwith no cuts or increase through the year 2002. That would mean that \nreal funding, measured in constant dollars, would decline by reason of \nthe growth of student population and by reason of inflation.\n  Today, about 33,000 students in New Mexico receive Pell grants. I \nthink it is pretty obvious that this budget is going to either cut the \namount these students receive in Pell grants or result in a much \nsmaller percentage of our young people who are eligible to apply and \nreceive those Pell grants.\n  It is clear to me that the budget is going to have a profound impact \non students in my home State, even if you look just at the students who \nreceive these Pell grants. When you look at other programs, you have to \ncome to the same conclusion.\n  The Federal work study program provides about $5.4 million in grants \nto 6,300 students in our State.\n  The Federal supplemental opportunity grant program serves 6,500 \nstudents in our State. [[Page S7083]] \n  Perkins loans serve over 5,000 students in New Mexico.\n  The numbers they have provided in this budget resolution point in one \ndirection, Mr. President. The numbers indicate that the Stafford \nprogram will not be impaired, but if, in fact, we are going to save the \n$14 billion that is contemplated in the budget resolution, we are going \nto have to cut that program. We are going to have to charge interest to \nthose students from the time they take those loans just as the House \nhas proposed to do.\n  Mr. President, the proposal before us has as its purpose to cut the \ndeficit. Clearly, we need to accomplish that. I am proud of the deficit \nreduction we have accomplished in the last 2 years. I am sorry we did \nnot have the same zeal for deficit reduction by many of my colleagues \nwhen those votes were being cast in the last few years.\n  But cutting investment in education and training for our children is \nnot the right way to accomplish deficit reduction. If this Nation is to \nremain the world leader in the 21st century, we cannot cut investments \nin our most important resource; that is, in our children.\n  The effect of this amendment that Senators Harkin and Hollings are \noffering would be to reduce the size of the proposed tax cut by $40 \nbillion so we can return some reasonable level of support for education \nand training. It is an amendment that makes excellent sense for the \nfuture of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, amendment No. 1116 is \ntemporarily set aside.\n  Under the previous order, it would now be in order for a Democratic \namendment regarding education.\n  Mr. EXON. That order had been agreed to previously; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. EXON. Then the Chair will be recognizing the Senator from Iowa; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1117\n\n (Purpose: To restore funding to education by using amounts set aside \n                             for a tax cut)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 1117.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 74, strike lines 12 through 24 and insert the \n     following: ``budget, the appropriate budgetary allocations, \n     aggregates, and levels shall be revised to reflect \n     $28,000,000,000 in budget authority and outlays of the \n     additional deficit reduction achieved as calculated under \n     subsection (c) for legislation that reduces the adverse \n     effects on discretionary spending on education and \n     $12,000,000,000 in budget authority and outlays for \n     legislation that reduces the adverse effects on direct \n     spending for education.\n       ``(b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the \n     reporting of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and \n     again upon the submission of a conference report on such \n     legislation (if a conference report is submitted), the Chair \n     of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may submit to \n     the Senate appropriately revised allocations under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     discretionary spending limits under section 201(a) of this \n     resolution, budgetary aggregates, and levels under this \n     resolution, revised by an amount that does not exceed the \n     additional deficit reduction specified under subsection \n     (a).''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the President please advise the Senators as to the \ntimeframe now for debate on the education amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 7:15 this evening is to be \nequally divided, with Senator Bingaman having asked unanimous consent \nand spoke using some of the time allocated to the Democratic side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So between now----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right now the Senator has 72 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with Senator Hollings in offering \nthis amendment. I believe this amendment really does set the stage for \nwhat we are talking about in terms of priorities and choices. We all \nagree we need to get the deficit down and balance the budget, but what \nwe have all talked about is in terms of reducing the deficit and what \nit does to help future generations of Americans. There has been a lot \nof talk about our responsibility to balance the budget for the sake of \nour children and their future, and that is true.\n  But what this budget does is it cuts off the very fountain of life \nand funding that ensures that our children and future generations will \nbe able to have a better life in our country because of the devastating \ncuts that this budget makes in education.\n  We have seen report after report after report, study after study \ntelling us about the importance of investing in education. I am \nreminded even of the group of CEO's that was brought together by \nPresident Reagan. These were not social planners and thinkers, these \nwere CEO's of our major corporations, charged with the responsibility \nby President Reagan of determining what we needed to do in our \neducational system. They met, they filed their reports, and what they \nsaid basically is that we have to fund education, we have to fund early \nintervention programs, and we cannot back off on the Federal commitment \nto education.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush, convened the \nGovernors, and in 1989 they set up the national education goals, agreed \nupon by a Republican President, by Republican and Democratic Governors, \nby the U.S. Congress--by the Senate and by the House--what our goals \nwere in education by the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, we do not need any more reports. We know what needs to \nbe done. We know how critical education and training is to competing in \nthe world economy. We know that investing in education will save us \nmoney in the long run. We know that we are falling behind our \ncompetitors. We know that it is more difficult for middle-class \nfamilies to pay for college education today. How many more reports do \nwe need to tell us what we already know? We do not need any more \nreports.\n  We know that slashing education by the largest level ever is wrong. \nTaxing millions of college students with more debt is wrong. Denying \nHead Start to hundreds of thousands of young Americans is wrong. The \namendment I am offering with Senator Hollings will do what is right: It \nwill keep us on the right path, the right course.\n  Our amendment restores $40 billion for education and training \nprograms. Our amendment restores $12 billion for student loans, $28 \nbillion for discretionary spending. It restores common sense by \ninvesting in education.\n  Mr. President, this is an anxious time for our Nation's students. \nThey will soon be getting their report cards and, I must say, it is an \nanxious time for parents who are funding our kids in college. We want \nto see those report cards, too. We want to see how they have done in \nthe classroom. I asked my daughter today if she got her report card \nfrom college. No, she did not have it yet.\n  I think it is time for us to look at a report card to see how this \nbudget would do in our Nation's classrooms. Let us see if this budget \nthat we have before us passes or fails, what kind of a grade it gets.\n  So let us look at the different assignments, Mr. President, and I \nhave it here on the report card. Let us look at the different \nassignments that the people of this country have given to us, the \nnational education goals, what they have set out. Let us see how this \nbudget does on a report card.\n  Our first assignment was to make college affordable for students and \nfor working families. How does this budget do? It cuts student loans \nand reduces Pell grants by 40 percent. It cuts $5 billion from other \ngrant and loan programs. It increases the personal debt of college \nstudents by anywhere from 20 to 48 percent.\n  What that means is a lower income college student going to college \nborrowing money will have his or her debt increased by anywhere from 20 \npercent minimum to 48 percent maximum. The maximum increase, of course, \nfalls on the poorest students because they borrow the most money, and \nso they will [[Page S7084]] have the biggest debt to pay back. Just the \nopposite.\n  What kind of a grade do we give this assignment? It cannot be \nanything more than an F. It flunks at making college affordable for \nstudents and working families.\n  Our next assignment: Make sure all children will start school ready \nto learn. Mr. President, the No. 1 goal of the President's Conference \non Education set up by President Bush, agreed upon by Republican and \nDemocratic Governors in 1989, the No. 1 goal: All children will start \nschool ready to learn.\n  What does this budget do? It freezes Head Start funding so that by \nthe year 2002, 350,000 to 550,000 fewer children will be served. It \nfreezes Head Start. Fewer children will be served. Another F.\n  Another assignment: Improve student achievements so that U.S. \nstudents will be best educated. Another one of our goals, by the way. \nWhat does the budget do? It freezes title I funding so that by 2002, 2 \nmillion fewer children will be served. Right now, Mr. President, the \nFederal Government provides about 6.6 percent of funding for local \nschool districts. In 1980, that was 11 percent. It is now down to 6.6 \npercent, and that includes the school lunch program. So if you take out \nthe school lunch program, it is even a lot less than that. Education \nright now is 2.2 percent of the Federal budget--2.2 percent. In 2002 \nunder this budget proposal, it will fall; 1.4 percent of the Federal \nbudget will go for education.\n  What does that mean? That means that if our local school districts \nand our States want to continue a high level of education and input, it \ncan only mean one thing: Hang on, your property taxes are going to go \nthrough the roof. And so this budget fails in improving student \nachievement so that they will be the best educated.\n  The next assignment, making sure that all schools will be safe and \ndrug free, another one of our goals, to make our schools safe and drug \nfree.\n  This program funds things like the DARE Program that we are all so \nfamiliar with and I am sure we hear about in our States when we go back \nthere and how successful the DARE Program is. This budget cuts over $1 \nbillion from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. Ninety-four \npercent of school districts will lose funding from it, affecting over \n39 million children. So on keeping our schools safe and drug free, this \nbudget, another F.\n  Another assignment we have is to increase the Federal commitment for \nfunding of special education and reduce the costs to local school \ndistricts.\n  Mr. President, this Congress in 1975 passed legislation for the \neducation of all handicapped. It is called now IDEA, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. The commitment of Congress in 1975, and in \nevery Congress since then, has been to pick up 40 percent of the costs \nof special education for our school districts--40 percent. Do you know \nwhat it is now? Eight percent; 8 percent.\n  We are not talking about something that local schools can do or \ncannot do at their will. There is a constitutional obligation on our \nlocal school districts that if they provide a free and appropriate \npublic education for nonhandicapped students, they have to do it for \nhandicapped students.\n Constitutional requirement. We have said that we will come in and help \nlocal school districts meet that constitutional requirement by helping \nfund special education. Five-and-a-half million students with \ndisabilities. Over the next 7 years, under this budget, school \ndistricts will lose over $5 billion in Federal funding for special \neducation. And again, these school districts cannot say: OK, now we \nhave lost the Federal funding, so all you disabled kids, out, we are \nnot going to give you the kind of education that is comparable to other \nstudents. They cannot do that. The Constitution of the United States \ncommands that they have to do that.\n\n  So what it means, again, is hang on to your hat in your local school \ndistricts, Mr. President. Property taxes will go up through the ceiling \nto pay for special education, because we, in this budget, are saying we \nare not going to fund it. So another F on that assignment.\n  Another assignment is to make the United States first in the world in \nmath and science--another goal--by 2000. In an international assessment \nof eighth graders on math in 1992, the United States ranked 13th out of \n15 countries. This budget cuts $700 million in teacher training for \nmath and science teachers--400,000 fewer teachers will receive training \nand retraining.\n  So in trying to make our country first in math and science, another \nF.\n  Another goal is to improve technology to prepare students for the \n21st century. We are saying we have to get better technology in the \nschools: Up-to-date computers, fiber optics and interaction, and get on \nthe superhighway, get all this technology, Star schools, we are all for \nit. We have to do it if our kids are going to be competitive in the \nfuture. Over the next 7 years under this budget $175 million will be \ncut from Star schools and education technology. Another F.\n  Well, lastly, I think our overall assignment, is it not, is to ensure \na better future for our children. Is this not really why we are here? \nIs this not why we take time on the Senate floor to debate and offer \namendments? Is this not why our constituents put us here, to ensure a \nbetter future for our children? This is the largest education cut in \nthe history of this Congress, the largest education cut in history. \nHow, I ask, is that ensuring a better future for our kids?\n  So, Mr. President, in test after test, this Republican education \nbudget fails our children. It fails them in the earliest times, getting \nthem ready for school, and it fails them later on when they go to \ncollege. It fails our future. As a parent, I would be upset if my \ndaughter brought home a report card with nothing but F's, and if she \ndid, she would have to go back to school and do it all over again. That \nis what we are trying to do with our amendment. We are saying: Go back \nto school, those of you on the other side that want this budget. You \nhave failed. So Senator Hollings and I are saying, we will make it \nright and we will send you back to school. We will send you back with \nthis amendment so we do not fail our kids. We want them to pass and we \nwant to invest in education. The way to do it is to restore these cuts \nand restore some common sense back in the budget.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I yield whatever time the Senator may wish to \nconsume.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, One of the most distinguished \nforefathers, James Madison, said that ``a popular Government without \npopular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a \nfarce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.'' He said that in a letter to John \nAdams, and Adams wrote back that ``The whole people must take upon \nthemselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the \nexpense of it.''\n  Coming up to Horace Mann's day, he referred to the Northwest \nordinance where we laid the groundwork to develop Iowa--and it is a \ndistinct pleasure to be associated with Senator Harkin. Those States in \nthe Midwest were set up in 6 mile by 6 mile blocks, and the middle \nblock--number 16--was reserved for public education.\n  Horace Mann said:\n\n       This law laid the foundation of the present system of free \n     schools. The idea of an educational system that was at once \n     both universal, free, and available to all the people, rich \n     and poor alike, was revolutionary. This is the great thing \n     about America. No other nation ever had such an institution. \n     Three centuries later, it is a stranger to the bulk of the \n     people of the world. The free public school system, which \n     Puritans conceived, has been in large measure the secret of \n     America's success. In these classrooms children of all races, \n     nationalities and tongues learn the common language and \n     became imbued with one central idea--the American conception \n     that all men are created equal, that opportunities are open \n     to all, that every minority, whether respected or despised, \n     has the same guaranteed rights as the majority. Parents who \n     landed here often brought with them the antagonisms, the \n     rivalries and suspicions of other continents. But their \n     children became one and united in the pursuit of a democratic \n     ideal.\n\n  Mr. President, this idea was brought up-to-date, this observation of \nHorace [[Page S7085]] Mann, just Sunday before last, on May 14, at the \ngraduation exercises at the College of Charleston in my hometown which, \nincidentally, was founded in 1767. It is the fourth-oldest liberal arts \ncollege in the United States and the oldest municipal college in the \nUnited States, now having become a State university. Our distinguished \ncolleague from Kansas, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum, was the graduation speaker. As Dr. Alexander, our greatest \nof great presidents there, spoke and introduced the program, he said \nthis, and I think it should gain the attention of everyone:\n\n       A few more than 900 soon-to-be graduates are seated behind \n     me. If I ask each of them to stand who had attended college \n     on a grant from the Federal Government, 405 of them would \n     stand. If I then asked those to stand who had received a \n     Government loan, an additional 198 would stand. If I then \n     asked all those to stand who had received a scholarship which \n     included at least some Government involvement, an additional \n     120 would stand. Eighty percent of today's graduates would \n     then be standing. Of course, all the rest, as well as those \n     who are standing, had a part of the expenses at the college \n     paid for by the State of South Carolina.\n       So while our graduates are thanking their families and \n     friends, they might do well to also thank the Government. At \n     the College of Charleston, we do not think of the Government \n     as our enemy. It is not possible to love the College of \n     Charleston and hate the Government. In the American \n     democracy, the Government, in the phrase of Lincoln, is ``of \n     the people, by the people and for the people.'' Speaking for \n     myself, I do not think it is possible to love America and \n     hate the Government.\n\n  So my plea this afternoon is if we can set aside partisanship \nmomentarily and get some bipartisanship back on track for the general \ngood, let us look at this amendment and realize that we have to move \nforward.\n  This particular amendment has what aim? Is it our aim to streamline \nthe Government and cut out the fat? Or is it our aim to hack away \nindiscriminately, to tear down Government, to cut out not just the fat \nbut also the muscle? Quite frankly, I look at the unprecedented \neducation cuts in the budget resolution and this is what I see--not an \nefficiency inspired streamlining, but ideologically-driven amputation.\n  I am reminded of the Florida doctors down there who recently went \ninto the operating room to amputate a foot,\n when the patient awoke, he discovered that the doctors had amputated \nhis healthy foot.\n\n  That is exactly what is occurring here in this particular budget \nresolution. We are not talking here, Mr. President, about highway \ndemonstration projects and more subsidies and the usual litany of \nGovernment waste. To the contrary. We are talking about Government at \nits best. Government at its most cost efficient.\n  We are talking about proven programs--Head Start, Title I, assistance \nfor educating disabled people, and college loans for low-income people. \nThese are programs that demonstrably work, and work for our neediest \ncitizens.\n  By the most conservative estimate, Mr. President, every $1 spent on \nHead Start translates into $2 in later cost savings and educational \nbenefits. One investigation, the famous Perry Preschool Study, \ndetermined that there are $3 in benefits for every $1 spent on Head \nStart.\n  We see an even greater return from Title I programs. For every poor \nchild, thanks to Title I intervention, who does not have to repeat a \ngrade, Mr. President, we save $7,000. For every child who, thanks to \nTitle I, does not drop out of school, we save potentially tens of \nthousands of dollars in welfare costs.\n  Mr. President, the cuts proposed in the budget resolution give rise \nto a broader question: How in the world did we allow education to \nbecome a partisan issue? How in the world did we reach a point where \nvirtually every Republican is reported ready to vote for radical cuts \nin the education budget, and virtually every Democrat is ready to vote \nagainst the cuts.\n  I will never forget the bipartisan move over the years with the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Bob Stafford. We had been Governors \ntogether and worked on education and the education amendments. Thanks \nto the success of Senator Stafford, we had equally wonderful bipartisan \nsupport and leadership.\n  We used to have two rules for nonpartisanship around this place: One \nrule was politics stop at the water's edge; the other rule was that \npolitics stops at the schoolhouse door. I deeply regret in the rush to \ndismantle Government we are willy-nilly throwing away our consensus on \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to plead for a restoration of that \nconsensus, to plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto join in support of the amendment. Republicans have spoken very \npassionately about the need for people to pull themselves up by their \nown bootstraps, to stand on their own feet, to get out of the wagon, \nand help pull the wagon.\n  The distinguished Speaker of the other body has made a compelling \ncase for what he calls ``conservative opportunity society,'' a society \nwhich, he says, should guarantee equal opportunity but not equality of \nresults. Fine. How can we credibly talk about equality of opportunity \nat a time that we are making radical cuts in education? How can we tell \npoor and disadvantaged persons that we believe in equal opportunity at \nthe same time we are cutting the dickens out of Head Start, Title I, \nand other programs whose entire purpose is to make opportunity less \nunequal?\n  Indeed, Mr. President, if the cuts proposed in the budget resolution \nare allowed to stand without modification we will deal a devastating \none-two punch to poor Americans.\n  First, we will shred the social safety net by enacting cuts in child \nnutrition, health care, job training and so on. Sixty percent of the \n$961 billion in budget cuts planned over the next 7 years will come \nfrom programs for poor and elderly. By hacking away at education, we \ncripple the ability of poor children to get a decent start toward \nliteracy and other skills that they will need to stay off welfare and \nsurvive in the new economy.\n  I see a common thread, Mr. President, running through this budget \nresolution. The more needy a person is the more deeply they get cut. \nThis is true not just of children but of States as well. Cutbacks in \nthe budget resolution will hit hardest in the States that are most \ndependent on Federal aid.\n  These States tend to be small, they tend to be poor, and, yes, they \ntend to be Southern. Consider the following States and how much they \ndepend on Federal assistance in their education budgets: Mississippi, \n17 percent; New Mexico, 12.4 percent; Alaska, 11.5 percent; Alabama, \n11.4 percent; South Dakota, 11.1 percent; North Dakota 11.1 percent; \nLouisiana, 10.8; Arkansas, 10.8; Kentucky, 10.1 percent; my own State \nof South Carolina, 9 percent.\n  The main program cut back by the resolution is Title I for the \ndisadvantaged. We now serve, Mr. President, about 6 million children \nunder the program, and projecting the same across-the-board cut to \neducation, the Department of Education says that we will be serving \nonly 4 million children when that particular cut has become law.\n  Taken together, the cuts in the budget resolution make a mockery of \nany notion of an opportunity society. This budget resolution tells poor \npeople to pull them themselves up by the bootstraps, and then it takes \naway the boots.\n  It strikes me strongly that those who would make deep cuts in the \nsocial safety net have a special obligation, a special moral \nobligation, to at a minimum maintain the Federal Government's current \nlevel of investment in education. The bottom line, of course, is \neducation equals opportunity.\n  The income and opportunity gap is already striking. Between 1973 and \n1989, the annual earnings of black male high school dropouts in their \ntwenties declined by fully 50 percent.\n  Consider this, Mr. President: Kids whose parents are on the top \nquartile of income have no trouble going to college. A whopping 76 \npercent of them earn Bachelor's degrees. But for kids whose parents are \non the bottom quartile, a shockingly different story. Only 4 percent of \nthese lower-income kids receive a Bachelor's degree.\n  Mr. President, we are limited on time here this afternoon and many of \nour distinguished colleagues are interested in addressing this \nparticular problem.\n  Let me just say these are exactly the kids who are most at risk in \nunderachieving, flunking a grade or dropping out. Take away Head Start \nand Title I and we are yanking the rug out from under the kids. \n[[Page S7086]] \n  We have to get real. We cannot claim to favor an ``opportunity \nsociety'' at the same time we enact savage cuts in education. The \nopportunities of society should not be for those who are born on third \nbase; rather, we also need an opportunity society for poor children who \nare born stuck in the batter's box with a two-strike count.\n  Yet by cutting deeply into Head Start, Title I, and the other \neducation programs for the disadvantaged, we are heading in exactly the \nwrong direction. It is too late, now, Mr. President, to reconsider the \npriorities set forth in the budget resolution. To that end, therefore, \nI urge a strong bipartisan vote in favor of this amendment. If we are \nserious about opportunity for everyone, then we should be boosting our \ninvestment in education, not busting it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Hollings for his support and for his \ncosponsorship of this amendment and his long-time support for education \nin our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following as \ncosponsors: Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Pell, Senator \nDodd, Senator Bingaman, Senator Simon, and Senator Murray as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, of all the pain in this budget, nothing \nwill hurt our Nation more than the draconian cuts to education.\n  Education allows Americans to pull themselves up by their own \nbootstraps. And I know this first hand. I am one of seven children from \na family in a small town in Washington State.\n  My parents taught us the most important lessons in life. They taught \nus that everyone can make a difference. They showed us the bright \npromise of the American dream.\n  And, they taught us that education was the key to success.\n  That's why my parents--like many--are watching this debate closely. \nThey understand what's at stake--because they know the difference \neducation made in their children's lives.\n  Every one of my brothers and sisters, every one of us went to \ncollege. Every one of us has been able to follow our dreams--and one of \nus--my twin sister--is now a teacher herself.\n  When I stand here in this debate, I think of my sister, Peggy, in her \nclassroom in Bellingham, WA. I know the challenges she faces as a sixth \ngrade teacher.\n  Peggy tells me how class size will grow if these types of cuts are \nmade. If we just shift costs from the Federal to local level in this \nway, the quality of education in her classroom will decrease.\n  I know she is watching this budget debate--like teachers all across \nthis Nation--and she is expecting us to keep education funding a top \npriority.\n  Peggy instills the same hopes and dreams in today's children our \nparents and teachers instilled in us.\n  And, she knows that the priorities in this budget are misguided. \nTaxes on working families. Drastic cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. \nSlash-and-burn education cuts.\n  It frankly amazes me that we are seriously considering a budget which \ncuts education so severely.\n  The fundamental goal of any economic policy should be to raise the \nstandard of living, and increase opportunity for all Americans.\n  You achieve this by strengthening education at all levels.\n  Last year, I worked with some of my colleagues from across the aisle \nin a bipartisan fashion to help expand educational opportunities for \nall Americans. Unfortunately, it seems--in this budget--that spirit has \nnow collapsed.\n  This year, we are taking giant steps backward. In this budget, \neducation is targeted for some of the largest cuts.\n  I have stated many times that I am all for deficit reduction. \nHowever, it is irrational to cut investments in our children and in our \nworkers--and then turn around and say these cuts are good for our \nfuture. How is cutting education good for our future?\n  The American people have the right to know what's in this budget. \nLet's look at the specifics:\n  Head Start, one of the most effective early nutrition and education \nprograms, in cut by $3 billion. This draconian cut will deny as many as \n100,000 low-income children the benefit of a pre-school education. That \nmakes no sense.\n  K through 12 education programs also take a big hit. This budget \nwould eliminate Goals 2000, which supports the efforts of schools and \ncommunities to raise academic standards in their areas. That makes so \nsense.\n  Training programs are cut. The School-to-Work Program ensures that \nall young people attain the skills they need to enter the workforce. \nSome of our colleagues want to eliminate this program. That makes no \nsense.\n  Finally, I am truly concerned about the absence of student financial \naid funds in this budget. Nationally, the costs for higher education \nhave increased at twice the rate of family income over the past decade. \nWithout financial aid, college has simply become unavailable to the \nmiddle class.\n  I would have never even thought of college if it were not for \nfinancial aid. Neither would any of my six brothers and sisters. This \nbudget says to young Americans ``you have to be rich to go to \ncollege.'' Again, that makes no sense. Again, this is the wrong message \nto our young people who far too often feel today there is no hope and \nno future for them.\n  We can not expect to retain our position as a leader in innovation, \nresearch, and production--unless we continue to invest in education.\n  At a time when Americans are fearful of losing their jobs; when \nAmericans need training; when our high school seniors lack the funds \nfor college; at this time, it makes no sense to turn our backs on them.\n  Every day, I hear my distinguished colleagues--who were captains of \nindustry--talk about what private industry and big business need in \nthis budget.\n  I do listen to leaders in industry. They tell me how important \neducation is to American competitiveness. High tech companies and \nmanufacturing firms need well-trained, high skilled work force. So, I \ndo listen to them. And, I also listen to Americans who do not have \nrich, powerful lobbyists behind them.\n  Let us listen to America's displaced workers who need to be \nretrained. Let us listen to America's teachers. Let us listen to \nAmerica's schoolchildren. Let us remember the common sense our parents \ntaught us. Let us remember how each and every one of us got to this \nSenate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and restore these \neducation cuts, restore some hope to our children's faces, and restore \nsome common sense to this budget process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Harkin, \nSenator Hollings, Senator Murray, and others who have made such a \nstrong presentation on an issue which is of such fundamental importance \nto all Americans as the priority of education for the young people of \nthis country.\n  What this amendment to the budget proposal is doing is restoring in a \ndramatic way support for higher education.\n  If there has been one extraordinary success story in the postwar \nperiod in the United States, it has been higher education. Of the 140 \ngreat world universities, 127 of them are in the United States of \nAmerica. That is not an accident. Our higher education is the envy of \nthe world. We are doing it right.\n  How has that come about? One reason is because you have participation \nof individuals that is not simply based on their ability to pay; \nanother is government support for research, and finally, we have a \nsystem that attracts the best academic minds in the world. Overall, \nhigher education has been an extraordinary success.\n  Mr. President, we have many problems in this country. We have many \nproblems around the world. One problem that is growing increasingly \nserious is that access for the sons and daughters of working families \nto higher education is becoming more difficult. The escalation of costs \nhas become a serious problem.\n  The universities, the teaching hospitals, the schools of this country \nare the envy of the world, and we have to [[Page S7087]] ask ourselves \nin this budget resolution, as we are looking to the future: Why are we \nputting them at risk? And we are putting them at risk by the reduction \nof $30 billion in education funding over the next 7 years. That is the \nvery basic and fundamental question. In a minute, I will come to the \nsame question in terms of what we are doing in primary and elementary \neducation, as well.\n  I would like to review for all of our colleagues the figures about \nwhat people earn when they achieve higher education--this chart can be \nviewed by our colleagues. The chart is self-evident, but fortunately, \nor unfortunately, we have to remind our colleagues and remind the \nAmerican people.\n  The chart shows average annual earnings by level of education. If you \ndo not finish high school, the average income is $12,000. If you \ncomplete high school, the average over the lifetime is $18,000. If you \nhave some college but do not complete 2 years, it goes up to $19,000. \nIt is $24,000 if you get an associate's degree from a 2-year college, \nand up to $32,000 if you graduate from a 4-year college. It goes on. \nFor a master's, $40,000; a doctorate, $54,000; for a professional \ndegree, $74,000 individually.\n  Our older brothers and sisters and parents understand it because they \nhad the GI bill. Generally, borrowers under the GI bill repaid $8 for \nevery $1 that was expended. Student loans work. Higher education works \nin the United States of America.\n  What did we do in the last Congress? In the last Congress, because of \nthe concern about increased cost of education and the costs of loans to \nthe Government--we moved toward a direct loan program to try to \nrecapture some of the funding that was going to banks in the guaranteed \nloan program. We moved to phase in a direct loan program. We moved in a \nmoderate way. There were some who believed we ought to go to a full \ndirect loan program immediately. There were some who said, ``Senator \nKennedy, Senator Simon, and Senator Durenberger, since we have the best \nin terms of higher education, why do you risk the system by going to a \ndirect loan program when we do not really know?''\n  We said, ``Fine.'' We worked out a compromise, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, to move into a direct loan program in a moderate way. \nThe direct loan program is now being managed by the Department of \nEducation effectively. We have a direct loan program going on with \ncompetition with the guaranteed loan program, and we have reduced the \nlosses that were coming from failure to repay student loans from $2.7 \nbillion down to less than $1.2 billion--a dramatic reduction.\n  It is so interesting to hear Mr. Bennett talking about the Department \nof Education and we ought to abolish it. I wish he had been as good a \nmanager as Dick Riley in recapturing the billions of dollars that were \nlost during his tenure. If he knows so much about the Department, where \ndid not he recapture the funds?\n  So we have a situation now where we are doing well in implementing a \ndirect loan program. We are also lowering the basic fees, reducing \nthose the initial fee students have to pay.\n  We have also adopted national service as an additional way to get \nyoung people to go to college because we know that our Nation's future \ndepends upon education.\n  Now we have before us the dramatic changes proposed the Republican \nbudget to the Pell grants. This chart shows what is going to happen to \nthese grants even though the chairman of the Budget Committee is \ntelling us he is going to hold them harmless. You can hear all the \nstatements that you want, but if you want to know what is going to \nhappen to costs for students as we follow through the years of this \nbudget, look at this chart. The bottom line shows what the value of the \nPell grant will be in the year 2002--$1,501. The other line shows the \naverage cost of going to State universities across the country--$8,026. \nRight now, the Pell grant is worth $2,590 and the average cost at a \nState university is $5,314. That shows you pretty clearly what is going \nto happen to students.\n  It is interesting that in 1965, when the Aid to Education Program was \npassed, we had three-quarter grants, one-quarter loans. Why? Because we \nset the economic challenge to the young person by figuring out what \nthat young person could bring to their education, what they could earn \nover the course of the summer and during the year. But we did not want \nto encumber that individual and that family far into the distant \nfuture. If they were eligible on the basis of need, we intended that \nthey were going to be able to get a grant and only a quarter was going \nto be a loan. Twelve years later, three-quarters are loans and one-\nquarter grants. What do our friends on the other side say? They are \ngoing to make the loans even more expensive.\n  So they are going to indenture the young people of this Nation. We \nhear all these speeches by our Republican brothers and sisters saying \nwe are doing the young people a favor because we are going to keep the \nnext generation out of debt. Instead, they are putting them in debt, \nputting them in debt by what they will have to pay for college to say \nnothing of what they will have to pay for graduate school.\n  I see our distinguished friend and a distinguished doctor presiding \nnow. He can certainly tell us about what happened with his own \nclassmates at medical school and the indebtedness of those individuals.\n  Whatever help and assistance we are providing in terms of the young \npeople is going to be heavily undermined with this particular proposal. \nThere is no other way about it. You can say, ``Well, we are going to \nhold them harmless. We are going to provide the services.'' If you one \nprogram harmless, then you are going to find the further emasculation \nof some other program such as the chapter I program, the title I \nprogram, about $6.8 billion that goes to the neediest children, or you \nare going to emasculate others like the Head Start programs that depend \nupon the same pot of funding. It makes no sense. It makes no sense for \nthe young people that are going to go through this system. It makes no \nsense for the universities and, most importantly, it makes no sense for \nthe country. We have something that is working, and we are putting it \nat serious risk at the present time.\n  Mr. President, this amendment moves us dramatically back into a sane \nand rational position by restoring some $40 billion to education.\n  Mr. President, if we look where we are in primary, elementary, and \nsecondary education, the fact of the matter is all of us who have \nsupported the various programs understand that education is a local \nresponsibility. I hear so much about what we need to do is get parents \nback in the school system and I agree that we do have to do that. I \nhear what we have to do is let teachers make changes in the curriculum \nand that is also true.\n  As the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from South Carolina know, \nand others know, only about 7 cents out of every dollar is provided by \nthe Federal Government. But they are important dollars. Just look at \nthe special needs children that were never being taken care of prior to \nthe program that was developed in a bipartisan way under Senator \nWeicker, Senator Harkin, and many of the members, Republican and \nDemocrat, on the Human Resources Committee and on the Appropriations \nCommittees. Education is not just a Democratic effort. I daresay that \nSenator Weicker had as much to do with increasing the commitment of \nthis Nation to special needs children as any Member here. This has been \na Republican as well as a Democratic effort.\n  We have often listened to our colleagues talk about how migrant \nchildren and illegal children have settled in various States and \nschools, and how they need some help and assistance. But if you take \nout the nutrition programs, and the special needs programs, if you take \nout Star schools, take out technology, take out the TRIO program, what \ndo we have left? These are programs that have been tested, evaluated, \nchallenged, and worked. Those are the programs they are emasculating.\n  What happened last year? We had a bipartisan commission that was set \nup to review what had happened in Head Start. In the 1980's and into \nthe early 1990's, there was some increase in funding, to the credit of \nPresident Bush. But the problem was there was not quality control. You \nhad continued turnover in programs without insisting on quality \nprovisions for the teachers that were involved. [[Page S7088]] \n  So there was a real question about the quality of the Head Start \nProgram. We had a very good bipartisan panel, and their recommendations \nwere reported out with only one dissenting vote on the Human Resources \nCommittee, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  I am not going to quote many of our colleagues on that side talking \nabout the changes in the Head Start Program, how we were at last \ngetting this on track, how important that was because I do not have the \ntime, but we made important changes. Then we went ahead and took a look \nat the chapter I program because of the various challenges that were \nsuggested by many for that program. We reviewed and had hearings as did \nthe House as well. Those changes were supported overwhelmingly by the \nRepublicans and Democrats. We dealt with the changes that were taking \nplace with different kinds of poverty impacting local communities and \nthe growth of poverty in some of the rural areas. We went through that. \nWe did not do all the things that everybody would have wanted, but we \nworked together and made great progress, Republicans and Democrats \nalike. Even in the Goals 2000 Program, Republicans and Democrats alike \ncame together to pass legislation that provides new help and assistance \nto schools. Of that funding, 85 percent goes to local schools.\n  Goals 2000 was developed by Dick Riley from South Carolina, one of \nthe most effective Governors in education, and also Governor Bill \nClinton. Riley had great credibility because he had changed the \nacademic achievement and outcomes of the black and brown and white \nstudents of his State of South Carolina in an extraordinary way, \ninvolving parents, involving local communities, involving the \nbusinesses. In Goals 2000 he brought that experience to the \nlegislation.\n  We also had bipartisan support for the School-to-Work Program. I was \nwith a former Governor of Maine, a Republican, last week at the \ndedication of the 1-year anniversary of the signing of the School-to-\nWork Program. This Republican Governor said that this is one of the \nmost important programs of education that he has seen in the State of \nMaine.\n  At a hearing in our Human Resources Committee Tommy Thompson, \nRepublican Governor of the State of Wisconsin, down, also said that \nthis is one of the most important initiatives in his state. School to \nWork would be emasculated in this budget.\n  I mean, what is the sense? We have hearings, we develop the \ncoalition, we develop the bipartisanship, we have men and women that \nare out on the front line, Republicans and Democrats, and we have \neducators and parents saying how the good the programs are. And we are \neffectively emasculating them, saying we are going to have to cut \nsomeplace, and we are going to go ahead and cut it.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not believe the wholesale cuts that have been \neffected in this budget are justified or warranted. I find to the \ncontrary.\n  I think one of the things that I remember so clearly--is my time \nrunning out? Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  Mr. President, if I can have 2 more minutes.\n  Let me just give you a few instances about the importance of support \nfor students. This stack here on my desk represents the mail that I \nhave received on the Internet system from students all over the \ncountry. I hope that our Members check their mail because when they do \nthey will finding out what these proposed cuts mean.\n  I think there has been a great deal of trivializing the importance of \nthe extra debt burden to students. You know, people are saying, ``It is \nreally only the cost of a big gulp a day. Really, it is only the cost \nof a one-way plane ticket down to Ft. Lauderdale.'' People are trying \nto trivialize this. I can tell you the increases are not trivial to \nstudents and working people.\n  I think this whole process demeans the young people of this country. \nIt demeans their parents who have worked hard, worked and scraped and \nsaved over the course of a lifetime to help send their children to \ncollege.\n  A student attending medical school in Massachusetts writes:\n\n       I am a 24-year-old African-American woman, born and raised \n     in St. Louis, MO. I come from a poor, working- class, two-\n     parent household. I am proud to say I was the first African-\n     American valedictorian in my high school. I went on to \n     college at a private institution. I received much-needed \n     financial aid while there, including loans and scholarships. \n     My parents helped as much as they could, but with two other \n     children, they could only help a little.\n       Without the Stafford and Perkins loans that I received, I \n     would not have been able to continue my education. After \n     graduating from college I was accepted to an Ivy League \n     medical school where I am still very much dependent on \n     Federal financial aid. I hope to practice primary care \n     (pediatrics) in an indigent community.\n\n        I am close to finishing school and may not be affected by \n     such harsh cutbacks, but I am very concerned for the future \n     generation of students.\n\n  Mr. President, this student and thousands of other students just like \nher are exactly what we need, primary care physicians in indigent \ncommunities.\n  Under the Republican budget a student following this course of study \ncould well face over $40,000 in additional interest payments at the end \nof her medical training.\n  A student from New York writes:\n\n       ``My mother just got laid off today. I only have one year \n     left before I receive my bachelor's degree. I don't want my \n     opportunity and those of others to be cut short. Everyone in \n     the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the state \n     governments had their opportunity. Why are you taking away \n     ours?\n\n  A college graduate from Colorado writes:\n\n       ``I am not a student, but I'm raising my voice in support \n     of government backing for student loans. If it were not for \n     student loans, I would not have been able to attend college. \n     My mother was supporting two kids and we lived in government \n     subsidized housing--the projects. There was simply no way she \n     could have paid for a college education for us, so we applied \n     for loans and more loans. I received some grants and a great \n     deal of loan assistance, and still I worked at McDonald's. I \n     am now a consulting writer and I never have to look for work \n     . . . it looks for me. This is a most wonderful life and I \n     wouldn't have had any chance at all of attaining it without \n     those student loans and grants. Please do whatever it takes \n     to ensure that others get this chance . . . it is what \n     allowed me to become who I am today, and I thank you all.\n       Another student, from Maine, summed up the situation: ``If \n     you think education is expensive--try ignorance''\n       I ask each of you to think seriously before you consider \n     voting for a budget that contains $30 billion in cuts to \n     student aid. You will see very clearly that this budget is \n     turning its back on the nation's students.\n       The Republican budget turns its back on education, and it \n     does so in order to pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest \n     individuals in the country. That makes no sense. It is the \n     wrong priority for education, and the wrong priority for the \n     nation.\n       The pending Democratic amendment restores $40 billion to \n     this anti-education budget--$40 billion that will help to \n     correct these misplaced priorities. I urge the Senate to \n     support the Democratic amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \na very eloquent and learned statement. I again wish to thank him for \nhis great leadership over so many years in the area of education. I \nthink what the Senator from Massachusetts just said really pulls it all \ntogether in terms of what this budget is about and what it is doing to \nkids in this country, and the history of what we have tried to do over \nthe last couple of generations of young people to ensure that our kids \ndo get that affordable, quality education in this country. Senator \nKennedy has captured it in his statement.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island. I apologize. If he does need some more, I will try to get \nsome more time for the author of the Pell Grant Program.\n  Mr. PELL. Eight minutes is fine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Pell has been so important in making sure that \nthe poorest kids in this country get a decent education. I am proud to \nyield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I second his remarks about \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. He has shown remarkable leadership.\n  The budget resolution before us would have a very detrimental impact \non Federal education spending. Instead of adjustments, fine tuning and \nreasonable savings, this resolution would produce drastic and \nunwarranted reductions of the small but critical role \n[[Page S7089]] our Federal Government plays in education--5 percent for \ngeneral education and 11 percent for higher education is the share of \nthe Federal Government.\n  According to the Budget Committee figures, this resolution assumes a \nreduction of $59.4 billion in outlays for function 500 over the next 7 \nyears when compared with current law. When compared with the \nPresident's budget, though, the estimate is that the reduction would \ntotal $65 billion over the same 7-year period. According to the Labor \nCommittee's own estimates, education makes up about 58 percent of \nfunction 500, and this means therefore that the reduction in education \nspending could total as much as $38 billion over the next 7 years.\n  The reduction in education would come in two areas, mandatory \nspending and discretionary spending. The Hollings-Harkin amendment \nbefore us would add back $40 billion in both mandatory and \ndiscretionary spending. It would have the effect, therefore, of \nensuring that we would not experience drastic cutbacks in Federal \neducation spending.\n  Failure to approve this amendment would surely put education in \nharm's way. While the budget resolution assumes protection of certain \nprograms, those are only assumptions. They do not have the full force \nof law. The final decision for discretionary cuts will be left to the \nAppropriations Committee, while the final decision for mandatory cuts \nwill fall to we, the authorizing committee.\n  My fear is that the size of the cuts in the budget resolution are so \nimmense that no program will be protected and all will be at risk. If \nthe cuts are applied across the board, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that one-third of the Federal investment in education will be \neliminated by the year 2002.\n  In mandatory spending, the budget resolution before us assumes \nsavings of $13.8 billion in outlays over the next 7 years. Seven \nassumptions are made in order to achieve those savings, but only five \nof those are within the jurisdiction of our Labor Committee. According \nto OMB, the total of the remaining five options is less than $5 \nbillion. That includes about $3.3 billion in savings if we eliminate \nthe in-school interest subsidy for graduate students, an option which I \nfor one would vigorously oppose.\n  The Labor Committee is also left with the responsibility to come up \nwith almost $9 billion in additional savings. This is such a massive \nrequirement that the only option available would be the elimination of \nthe in-school interest subsidy for undergraduate students who come \nprimarily from middle-income families.\n  To my mind, this is not the road we should travel. Elimination of the \nin-school interest subsidy for all students would, according to the \nDepartment of Education, increase student indebtedness by 20 to 50 \npercent. In a period when more Americans are borrowing more money to \nhelp finance a college education, this would be the wrong step and the \nwrong direction to take. In a very real sense, we would be increasing \nprivate debt to decrease public debt, an option that is not at all \nsatisfactory.\n  With respect to discretionary program spending, the effect would be \nequally alarming. Freezing the Pell Grant Program at the current law \nlevel would diminish the value of that program by as much as 40 percent \nover the next 7 years. According to OMB, half of that is because of the \nincrease in eligible students and the other half because of the \nexpected increase in inflation in the next 7 years.\n  Freezing the title I program in elementary and secondary education \nfor the 7 years comes when we anticipate at least a 9-percent increase \nin student population. The result: According to OMB, we will serve 2 \nmillion fewer students by the year 2002. That is 2 million fewer \nstudents by the year 2002.\n  According to OMB, failure to protect the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nProgram would save $1 billion over the next 7 years. It would also mean \nthat 94 percent, almost all of our Nation's school districts would lose \nfunding that now goes to help 39 million students.\n  Failure to protect vocational education and training would place the \nvery existence of this program at risk. OMB estimates that a possible \ncut of $5.3 billion over the next 7 years means that some 12 million \nfewer students would be served. This would come at a time when business \nand industry leaders are telling us they need a better and more well-\neducated work force if we are to remain leaders in the world \nmarketplace.\n  Passage of this resolution without adoption of the Harkin-Hollings \namendment before us would alter almost 30 years of a strong bipartisan \npartnership on behalf of education. It would seriously threaten \nbipartisan accomplishments that have brought the dream of a college \neducation within the reach of every American who has the drive and the \ndesire and the yearning that has begun to bring poor children into the \neducation mainstream and that have brought real meaning to the concept \nof equal educational opportunity.\n  Mr. President, this is not the time to retreat in education; it is \nthe time to advance. As President Clinton has noted, as a nation we \nface both a budget deficit and an education deficit. To my mind, we \nshould not increase the latter to decrease the former. A strong and \nsound economy depends on a well-educated, well-prepared work force. To \npull back in education is the wrong step, in the wrong direction, at \nthe wrong time, and I hope we would not do so.\n  Accordingly, with all the strength we have, let us support the \namendment before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity, in this small \namount of time, to thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his many years of leadership and service to the young people in our \ncountry. There is a reason why they are called Pell grants. Go to any \ncollege, any student in this country--well, you go to anybody who is \nout in the professional world, who has graduated from college in the \nlast 20 years. They all know one thing. They know what a Pell grant is. \nSo many of our young people who came from lower-income families, who \notherwise would not have had the ability to get through college, got \nthose Pell grants. They are educated; they are making money; they are \npaying taxes; and we are all better off for it. We are a better country \nbecause of that.\n  I wish to say to the Senator from Rhode Island, thank you so much on \nbehalf of millions of students, present-day students and millions of \nAmericans who are out there now earning a decent living, raising their \nfamilies, passing on a better life to the next generation, living the \nAmerican dream because of the efforts of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont, and I will try to yield more if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in favor of the amendment.\n  I also want to echo the accolades for my patriot on the Education \nCommittee, Senator Pell, who has done so much over the years. I stand \nhere as the new subcommittee chairman of the Committee on Education, \nbecause I feel, as he does and others have, that we must be sure of \nwhat we do now. This is serious business.\n  Everybody recognizes that finally we have to balance the budget. But \nif we do not do it carefully, what we do will be counterproductive and \nwill result in increased costs and decreased revenues.\n  It is so simple and easy for us to all hold hands, close our eyes, \nand cut across the board. But that will not do it. This will not do it \nif you get into the area of education.\n  Education has always been bipartisan and it should remain so today. \nSo let us strike any partisanship out of here and take an examination \nof what will happen if we do not do this carefully. Let us talk about \nthe counterproductive aspects of cutting education.\n  First of all, the business community came to me a year ago and cried \nto me, ``You have to do something about increasing our productivity, of \nhelping us improve the education of this Nation, because we are not any \nlonger as competitive as we used to be.'' And unless we improve things, \nwe will be less competitive in the next century and this Nation will \nslip into a Third World capacity. Why? [[Page S7090]] \n  Let us take a look at this chart. A chart is worth a thousand words.\n  The first chart is high school graduates unable to perform basic \ntasks. Just take our standards, forget about the international \nstandards. Over half of our kids graduate unable to do simple functions \nthat would mean that you are at least basically literate. I will show \nyou later what that has an impact on.\n  Let me take the next chart. Let us take a narrow look at the \ninternational scene, where we stand in the world with respect to our \neducation system. And I will end up with it in another area. We are now \nin the area of math, and the same is true in science, dead last when we \ncompete with those other countries that are giving us competition in \nthe international fields. That is shameful.\n  Are we going to do something about it? We cannot, if we cut \neducation.\n  Let us take a look at what this failure of education has to do with \nour budget situation right now. We have a loss, through education \nfailure, of $\\1/2\\ trillion in our GDP. That is because we are slipping \nbehind with respect to productivity. We have problems. Eighty percent \nof those incarcerated in jails, costing $20,000 to $60,000 a year to \nincarcerate, are school dropouts; 60 percent of the teenage pregnancies \nare school dropouts.\n  In addition, the literacy level reduces our productivity level, \nlosing more, and we have $208 billion a year through lost productivity \nthrough welfare. And it costs us another $200 billion for remedial \ntraining to bring our students up to the capacity where they can be \nproductive in our industrial society.\n  In addition to that, because they earn less money being nonproductive \ncitizens, it costs us $125 billion in lost revenue.\n  So let us take a look at the next chart and see what this has done to \nthe median family income in this country and why we are losing that \nrevenue.\n  Two-thirds of our society over the last 20 years--over the last 20 \nyears--have had a decrease in their family income. And that is true \neven though we now have more two-worker families than ever before.\n  Education is related to what you earn. You will see the only ones now \nthat are increasing their income in this decade are those that have had \npost-graduate education in college.\n  Now let us take a look at what is happening with respect to another \narea. One area in here, which is part of this proposal as well, but one \nthat seems to be the easiest thing to do--our graduate students. Why do \nwe not just increase their debt load a little bit? Why allow them to \nget subsidies for interest while they are in graduate school? Seems \nlike an innocuous thing to do.\n  Well, this Nation has the best graduate schools in the world. \nEverybody wants to come here. However, over the last several years, a \ndecade, the debt load of our college students has gotten so high now, \nit is estimated it will be up around $22,000 when they get out.\n  Well, they cannot go on to graduate school. We have fewer and fewer \nand fewer people that are going to graduate school.\n  Now what has that done to us? Let us take a look at what it has done \nto us in a competitive area.\n  Mr. President, I ask Senator for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hate to tell the Senator from Vermont, I only have 6 \nminutes 5 seconds. I have two people that I promised more time to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. My punch line is all I wanted to get out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator gets at least 2 minutes for his punch line.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Well, it will not take that long.\n  What this chart shows here is, before, you know, we used to have all \nthe foreign students come here. They used to get educated and they \nstayed. You saw them at IBM and all over the country allowing us to be \nmore productive. Now what is happening, because of the debt load, fewer \nand fewer of our kids are going to graduate school and more foreign \nstudents are going to graduate school. The blue indicates the ones that \nare going home and the red indicates the ones that are staying here. \nMore and more are going home. So what we are doing now is we are seeing \nalmost all of the graduate students are being foreign students, a \nmajority are, and they are all going home. Ours are staying here, but \nwe do not have enough to fill the slots.\n  So that one little thing in this budget proposal would probably do \nmore damage to our competitiveness than about anything else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his contribution now \nand in the past.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will try to make it fast.\n  Of course, we need a balanced budget. But, of course, we have to have \nthe right priorities.\n  Every study that has been made by any group--conservative, liberal, \nyou name it--says we have to invest more in education. I have never \nseen a study that suggests to the contrary. And yet what we are asked \nto do is to cut back--cut back on Head Start, cut back on title I that \nhelps poor kids that is really showing results, cut back in higher \neducation.\n  Senator Jeffords is absolutely correct. In the narrative on the \nbudget, you will see we are going to get that $14.7 billion in savings \nby cutting out assistance to graduate students. That is bad enough.\n  But you put the numbers together and you only get $2 billion of that. \nWhere do we get the other $12.7 billion? Well, we get it out of the \nhides of students. And it means a lot of students are not going to go \non to higher education. That is not the way we ought to go.\n  In fiscal year 1949, I say to Senator Harkin, we devoted 9 percent of \nthe Federal budget to education. We are now devoting less than 2 \npercent. And if this budget is adopted as is, it will go down even \nfurther----\n  Mr. HARKIN. To 1.4 percent.\n  Mr. SIMON. Down to 1.4 percent, Senator Harkin says. It just does not \nmake sense.\n  I visited a Head Start group in Rock Island, IL, an impoverished part \nof that city. Like every Head Start group, they have a waiting list. \nMonday morning, one set of kids comes in, Tuesday morning a different \none, Wednesday morning a different one, and so forth.\n  I asked the woman in charge what would it mean in the lives of these \nyoung people if they could come here 5 days a week. She smiled and she \nsaid, ``You could not believe the difference it would make in their \nlives.''\n  We are denying them that chance. Oh, we are saving money, like you \nsave money when you put up a house and you do not put a roof on it. You \ndo not save money in the long run. We have to face up to the reality \nthat we are going to have to change in this field of education. We are \ngoing to have to fund it more adequately.\n  I think of the testimony before our committee by the Secretary of \nLabor talking about a manufacturing company from Connecticut, I believe \nit was, making a decision, do they build in Mexico, the United States, \nor Germany? Mexico offered cheap labor, poor education; the United \nStates better education, higher wages; and they reluctantly made the \ndecision to build their plant in Germany where they have to pay $6.50 \nmore per hour but where people are well prepared.\n  We are cutting back on our future if we do not adopt this amendment. \nI hope we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I must say that I find the fact that we \nonly have 3 hours to debate education unconscionable. We should have \nmore time. I was under the impression we were going to have 6 hours. I \nfound out when I walked on the floor we have 3, by unanimous consent. I \ndo not know how that happened. We need more time. This is the most \nimportant part of the budget to future generations.\n  I yield whatever time I have to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think it is unconscionable that we \nnot have more time.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Mary McEvoy, who is a fellow with me who \n[[Page S7091]] helped write, I think, an important speech. I ask \nunanimous consent that she be allowed the privilege of the floor during \nthe rest of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what we have before us today is a \nbudget that says loud and clear to the American people that education \nis no longer a priority. The proposed $40 billion cut in education \nspending represents the largest education cuts in American history. In \nfact, it is estimated that by the year 2002, the Federal Government's \ncommitment to young Americans will be cut by over 33 percent. And these \ncuts span all age groups. For example, by the year 2002:\n  Over 400,000 young children will be denied a Head Start through \npreschool education;\n  Education for over 5.5 million children and youth with disabilities \nwill be eliminated;\n  School-to-work programs, partnerships between businesses, \ncommunities, and schools stand to lose over $5.3 billion.\n  And less than one-half of the children who need it will receive \nassistance to improve their reading and math skills. Are these \nAmerica's new Goals 2002?\n  The cuts I have listed above are devastating. But there is also \nanother program that the proposed Education budget reductions will \nnegatively impact. I want to talk to you about cuts in student aid.\n  Remember, all of those who signed the Contract With America have \nsigned a document that says they intend to support cuts in student aid. \nThe proposed Senate budget is serving as another vehicle to accomplish \nthis devastating promise.\n  Under the proposed budget, $30 billion would be cut in Federal aid to \ncollege students over the next 7 years, affecting over 4 million \nstudents. For example, last year in Minnesota, over 14,000 students \nreceived assistance from the Federal Stafford Loan Program alone. And \nthese students are not from wealthy families who could afford to bear \nthe entire brunt of the cost of their child's post-secondary education. \nIn fact, the average income for the families of these students was less \nthan $37,000 per year.\n  A college education is an essential part of the American dream. It \ngives people an opportunity to be all that they can be. And, I know \nfrom what my father always believed for me and I believe for my \nchildren--that their lives will be better than the last generation \nbecause they went on to pursue a higher education. In fact, over 92 \npercent of all Americans believe that investing in a Federal support of \na college education is an investment in our country's future.\n  We also must remember that college education also significantly \nbenefits to our Nation as a whole. Our communities are stronger, our \neconomy is stronger and our democracy is stronger.\n  But the dream of an education is more and more difficult to achieve. \nMost students now are not going straight to college from high school. \nIt is not affordable. Some have to save some money before they can \nafford to go. Some have small children to take care of. The student \nbody these days includes a lot more non-traditional students--those who \nare returning to school, those who only go part time because of jobs or \nfamily or both, and those\n who take more than 4 years to get their degree.\n\n  The costs of going to school keep going up. Students are forced to \nput off school until they have saved enough money, seek student grants \nor go into a lot of debt. It used to be that State and Federal \ngovernments provided more grants than loans. Students were not asked to \nmortgage their future. But over the last 10 years the balance between \ngrants and loans have been inverted--the number of loans far outweighs \nthe number of grants. Loans are now the largest source of Federal \nstudent aid.\n  The Federal Government has had a commitment to high education for \nalmost 50 years. Yet even at its current level of resources, the \nFederal Government's contribution is insufficient. We should not be \ncutting financial aid programs--we should be increasing and improving \nthose programs. Higher education is one of the best investments we can \nmake as a country and it is one of the best investments individuals can \nmake in their own future. An education increases earning potential, \ndecreases unemployment, and improves the standard of living.\n  As a Nation, we cannot afford to cut educational financial aid to \nAmerica's families. We should not be taking away one of the few \nopportunities families have for their children and grandchildren to \nmake a better life for themselves.\n  The Senate should go on record in saying that in our effort to \nbalance the budget we should not be reducing opportunities for students \nto improve their lives.\n\n\n         it is extremely difficult to go to college these days\n\n  The total costs of attending a 4-year public institution averages to \nabout $7,600. The average cost to go to a 4-year private institution is \naround $16,000. Tuition alone has increased more than 120 percent over \nthe last 10 years. At this cost higher education is out of reach for \nmany middle income families. Without student aid many would be unable \nto pursue higher education. Students must seek out scholarship and \nother grants and awards. Many borrow, but even that is not possible \nwithout help from the Federal Government. For the 1993-94 academic \nyear, students borrowed a record amount--$23 billion from Federal \nguaranteed loan programs. The average loan exceeds $2,700 annually. \nAnd, borrowing of course sends recent graduates into the working world \nwith a pile of debt along with their nice new diploma. Debt that is \nsometimes with them for half of their lives.\n  Krista Hannem is a sophomore who will be graduating from community \ncollege and going on to Mankato State University to get a B.A. She is \n24 years old, and married. She writes:\n\n       I do not receive State or Federal grants, nor do I have any \n     scholarships. In order to pay for my 2 years at [a community \n     college], I have had to take out over $5,000 in student loans \n     ***. Last year I was receiving help through the State work-\n     study program. When that was cut I suffered again. I realize \n     that part of education is receiving some debt, and that it \n     should not be a free ride, but neither should it be a weight \n     tied around my neck. So I ask that whatever decision you \n     make, you consider the many students like myself who are \n     choking with this weight.\n                   most students are non traditional\n\n  The typical student these days is not the Brady Bunch kid who \ngraduates high school and goes straight on to college. Forty-five \npercent of the student body these days is over 25 years old. In fact, \nnearly 20 percent of all students are older than 35. Many are single \nparents. Forty-three percent attend on a part time basis, thus probably \nnot finishing a B.A. in 4 years. Even traditional students, students \nwho enroll full time at 4-year institutions immediately after high \nschool are remaining for 4 consecutive years, obtain a bachelor's \ndegree within 5.5 years. Sixty-two percent of students of all ages \nwork, including nearly half of traditional students. And, about one \nstudent in five is a member of a minority group: African American, \nAsian American, Latino, or Native American.\n  Denise Peters from Edina writes:\n\n       I am a 29 single parent currently enrolled as a Jr. at the \n     U. of M. Because of the excellent support of financial aid \n     and other programs I have been successfully maintaining a \n     3.76 GPA. Before returning to school--from the time my son \n     was 6 weeks old I worked as a medical assistant making $9.00 \n     an hour * * *. Without the needed assistance the rug would be \n     pulled out from under me * * *.\n\n  Sandra Mitchell from St. Louis Park writes:\n\n       I am devastated at the idea of any financial aid cuts. Not \n     only would I need to drop out of college--I am a sophomore--\n     but it would leave me with only two options. First, I could \n     obtain an entry level position. Second, I could remain a \n     public assistance recipient for a while. At any rate the best \n     I could do for my self and my son and society is to maintain \n     at below poverty level. I faced these options after a \n     miserable divorce which left me without a home, money, or \n     even credit to plan for the future. I have goals, not only \n     for myself, but to be allowed to contribute and replace what \n     I have used. By the time I graduate in 1997, I will be \n     financially independent. Likewise I am setting an example for \n     my son to achieve independence and pride which are invaluable \n     to our whole society.\n  Troy Goodwater is a sophomore at Austin Community College. He is a \n20-year single male. He lives at home. He has a part-time job and \nattends college full time. He writes:\n\n       My father is retired and receives only a four hundred \n     dollar check each month from [[Page S7092]] social security \n     and my mother works two jobs in an effort to make ends meet. \n     They are unable to assist me in anyway in helping paying my \n     tuition. I receive federal and state grants to help me pay my \n     tuition, without these grants I would not be able to further \n     my education. These grants pay for all my schooling, because \n     of my low finances. The Federal and State grants are very \n     helpful to myself and many others college students and if \n     these\n      grants are cut the people who want an education and can not \n     afford one will suffer the most in the long run.\n\n\n our federal commitment to higher education should be strengthened not \n                                  cut\n\n  For almost 50 years the Federal Government has made a commitment to \nhelping students go on to higher learning. Just during the academic \nyear of 1993-1994 the Federal Government spent $31.4 billion to ensure \nthat lack of resources does not prevent people from pursuing their \ndreams of a college education. In Minnesota alone, students received \nmore than $420 million in Federal dollars.\n  The Federal Government provides 75 percent of all student aid \nincluding federal grant, loan, and work-study programs.\n  In 1990, about 5 million students received Federal student aid under \none or more Federal programs. In the 1993-94 academic year about 3.8 \nmillion students received Pell grants; 4.5 million received Stafford \nloans; 991,000 received supplemental education opportunity grants; \n697,000 received Perkins loans; 713,000 received Federal Work Study \nawards; and 650,000 received State student incentive grants.\n  Most Federal student aid is based on need, with the amount of \nassistance determined by formulas that factor in family, individual \nearnings, savings, and the cost of education. Pell grants are targeted \nto the neediest students. The campus-based programs--supplemental \neducational opportunity grants, Federal work study, and Perkins loans--\ngives school financial aid officers the flexibility to respond to \nunique student needs.\n  These programs help both low- and middle-income families. Of the Pell \ngrants awarded to dependent students--those who are financially \ndependent on their parents--41 percent goes to students from families \nwith incomes less than $12,000 and 91 percent goes to students from \nfamilies with incomes below $30,000. Among Pell recipients who are \nfinancially independent, 73 percent have an income below $12,000.\n  Stafford and direct loans primarily benefit middle income families. \nMost subsidized student loans--72 percent are awarded to students who \nare still financially dependent on their families. The average family \nincome of a dependent student who receives a Stafford loan--a loan on \nwhich interest is not charged while students are in school--is \napproximately $35,000. Seventy-five percent of such students have \nfamily income between $12,000 and $60,000. Among independent students \nwho receive loans, average family income is $14,400. More than 69 \npercent have incomes above $6,000.\n  More than half of the students who receive Perkins loans have family \nincome below $30,000. More than half of the students who receive funds \nunder the work-study program have family income below $30,000. And more \nthan 75 percent of students who receive funds under the Federal \nsupplemental education opportunity grant program have family income \nbelow $30,000.\n  In recent years the Federal Government commitment has been \ndiminishing. It used to be that State and Federal governments provided \nmore grants than loans. Students were not asked to\n mortgage their future. But over the last 10 years the balance between \ngrants and loans has been inverted--the number of loans far outweigh \nthe number of grants. Loans are now the largest source of Federal \nstudent aid. And, even the number of loans has decreased. The explosion \nin the numbers of eligible Pell grant recipients combined with \ninflation meant that in 1992, 4.2 million students were forced to share \nthe same amount of money that served 2.8 million students in 1987.\n\n\n              FINANCIAL AID IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE\n\n  Statistics show that financial aid to students more than pays for \nitself by stimulating economic growth, expanding the tax base and \nincreasing productivity. A college degree makes an extraordinary \ndifference in the lives of people holding them and in the lives of \ntheir communities. Our new service and information based economy \nincreasingly requires the technical skills and knowledge that can only \nbe obtained through higher education.\n  Higher education also makes a difference to us as a Nation. A more \neducated citizenry makes a strong democracy.\n\n\nTHERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES IN THE FUTURE OF THOSE WHO GO TO COLLEGE AND \n                            THOSE WHO DO NOT\n\n  Higher education is a ticket to greater opportunity and a better \nstandard of living for millions of people. That is why over 82 percent \nof Americans feel that without a college-educated work force we will \nnot be able to compete in a global marketplace.\n  It certainly has been instilled in me since I was young that the most \nimportant way to improve your lot in life was through an education. An \neducation meant that your life would be better than your parents. That \nyou would have more opportunities that they did. I feel the same about \nmy children, and now my grandchildren. And, I think an education is \neven more important now than it was when I was growing up. The economy \nis so unsure these days that there is no guarantee that our children \nwill be better off than we are. This is one of the biggest worries I \nhear back home. And part of that concern is the affordability of \ncollege.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, the lifetime average \nearnings of a man with a college degree is 51 percent higher than his \ncolleague with a high school degree. The difference for women is even \ngreater. The lifetime average earnings of a woman with a college degree \nis 57 percent higher than her colleague with a high school diploma.\n  In 1992, figures showed that the median income of men who were \ndropouts was $15,928, for a man with a high school diploma it was \n$22,765, and for a man with a college degree it was $36,691. For women \ndropouts the median income was $9,784, for a woman with a high school \ndiploma it was $13,266, and for a woman with a college degree it was \n$24,126.\n  And, of course unemployment rates are decreasing according to \neducation levels. In 1990 the unemployment rate for high school \ndropouts was about 12 percent. A high school diploma cuts that rate in \nhalf. A college degree cuts the rate in half once again.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  All children, and all people, must share in America's future. We \nshould not be balancing the budget on the backs of students, nor should \nwe be balancing the budget by cutting back on investments in our \nfuture. And this must include opportunities for a college education.\n  The numbers in the current budget proposal that we now have in front \nof us do not add up. Despite what may be said, we cannot cut $40 \nbillion without substantially reducing Federal aid to undergraduate and \ngraduate students thus denying opportunities for millions of our young \npeople. This educational opportunity cannot belong only to the well to \ndo.\n  I urge my colleagues to restore the $40 billion proposed cuts in \nEducation programs to the budget. We must send the message loud and \nclear that this Congress is committed to assuring that all children, \nyouth, and young adults have educational opportunities to become \nproductive, tax-paying citizens of America.\n  Finally, all I can say as somebody who has been a teacher for 20 \nyears--and it is impossible for me to speak about this issue in now 1 \nminute or less--I will just say to my colleagues that they are being \nmyopic, very shortsighted, if they do not understand that the very best \nwe can do is invest in the health, intellect, and skill of young \npeople.\n  If we want to reduce poverty in this country, focus on a good \neducation. If we want to have real welfare reform, focus on a good \neducation. If we want to have a stable middle class, focus on a good \neducation. If we want to have a country that can compete in the \ninternational arena, focus on a good education. If we want to have a \nrepresentative democracy where men and women can think on their own two \nfeet, understand the world, the country, and community they live in, \nand know what they can do to make it a better world, [[Page S7093]] a \nbetter country, and a better community, focus on a good education.\n  This budget resolution takes us exactly in the wrong direction, and \nthat is why I support this amendment and that is why, one way or \nanother, we will have a lot more debate on this issue over the next 4 \nor 5 months, several years to come.\n  This resolution is a huge mistake. We will never reduce the violence, \nMr. President, in our communities unless we understand an essential \ntruth, which is we must invest in the health and the skills and the \nintellect and the character of young people in America, and that starts \nwith investment in education.\n  That is all I can do, I say to my colleague from Iowa, in 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth \nStreet, a congressional science fellow, and Ruth Hardy, a J.J. Pickle \nfellow, be granted privilege of the floor during the remainder of the \ndebate on Senate Concurrent Resolution 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand we have 82 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will have some opening remarks, but my \ncolleague from Indiana wishes to speak first, and so we will turn to \nhim. But before I do, and while my friends from the other side are \nstill on the floor, I would like to make one opening comment for myself \nthat I believe resonates with other Members on this side.\n  Senator Wellstone said if you want to solve poverty, focus on \neducation; if you want a solid middle class, focus on education; if you \nwant a sound working force--et cetera--focus on education.\n  I wish the record could be very clear that this Senator could not \nagree more with that statement. Indeed, if I may be personal, Mr. \nPresident, the thing that got me back into public life after I had left \nit and decided that I would spend the balance of my career in the \nprivate sector as a business executive was when I got a phone call \nasking me to serve as chairman of the Strategic Planning Commission for \nEducation in the State of Utah. For the next 18 months, I immersed \nmyself in educational issues. I came out of that with the conviction \nthat with the collapse of the Soviet Union, education has replaced \ndefense as the No. 1 survival issue in this country.\n  So I yield to no one on either side of the aisle in my conviction \nthat we must, as a Nation, solve our educational problem. But I ask \nthis rhetorical question as we begin this debate: As we agree about the \nimportance of education, does that mean that there is no such thing as \nan educational program that is not working and may need to be defunded? \nDoes that mean, in our conviction that education is essential to our \nsurvival, that there is not anything in the Department of Education \nthat could be done more efficiently than is being done today and might, \nindeed, with better management yield up some hard-earned dollars to go \ntoward balancing the budget? Does that mean we cannot have a lucid \ndiscussion about education in this Chamber that focuses on the \neffectiveness of the educational dollars that we are spending because \neducation is such a Holy Grail that nothing relating to its \neffectiveness or its performance can be discussed?\n  If that is what it means, then I think the debate in this Chamber \nwill not be particularly enlightening on this subject to either side.\n  Before I yield time to the Senator from Indiana, I would like to \nreview the overall record. In unadjusted dollars, Federal spending for \neducation has gone up 900 percent from 1965 to 1993. In constant \ndollars, it has more than doubled in that same time period. And what \nhas happened to our educational achievements in the period when we have \nbeen doubling our commitment? The national assessment of educational \nprogress says that over the past 20 years, there has been little \noverall change in student proficiency in reading, writing, science, and \nmathematics.\n  The senior Senator from New York, prior to his entering this Chamber, \nwas a distinguished writer, and I remember reading an article by him \nwhere he said whimsically--and we all know he is given to whimsy at \ntimes--if you were to put educational achievement and educational \nspending on the same chart and track the trend lines, you would come to \nthe conclusion that increased spending produces decreased performance \nin a straight cause-and-effect relationship.\n  The senior Senator from New York obviously does not believe it. He \ndid not believe it when he said it, but he said it to make the point \nthat the problems in education are not necessarily problems of money. I \ncame to that conclusion in the 18 months that I immersed myself in \neducational issues in Utah.\n  I am dedicated to doing what I can to resolve and repair educational \nproblems in this country. I have established a foundation to which I \nhave given my personal wealth, whose primary focus right now is \nexploring new ways of solving our educational problems. We have some \npilot projects which I may talk about where we are achieving dramatic \nbreakthroughs in teaching and learning progress among disadvantaged \nstudents without any increase in costs.\n  With that opening statement, then, Mr. President, I yield such time \nas he may consume to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding, \nand I certainly want to say how much I respect the amount of effort and \ntime that he has personally committed into looking into this issue, \ncertainly more than this particular Senator. I am anxiously looking \nforward to his discussion with us about what he has found and what he \nlearned in those 18 months that he has committed to studying this \nsubject.\n And I think he raises the essential point that we are attempting to \ndeal with here, and that is not whether or not Members of either side \nare more or less committed to education. I think we are all committed \nto education. I think our record shows that we are committed to \neducation. But what many of us are attempting to communicate is that \nthe current system of education--providing public education for our \nchildren in this country--does not seem to be working very well. Report \nafter report throughout the decade of the 1980's, and now the 1990's, \nindicates that there are significant problems with the public education \nsystem in America. It is not based on anecdote, but it is based on \nfacts, studies and statistics.\n\n  And so the question that Republicans are essentially raising is: Is \nthere a better way to provide education for America's young people, so \nthat they are better prepared to enter today's work force, so that we \nas a Nation are better prepared to compete internationally, so that we \nas parents can provide our children with better opportunities to learn? \nThose are the questions that are before us.\n  It is, in a sense, a question of, do we retain the status quo, the \nstructure, the framework that has brought us to this point in American \neducation, or do we allow for change? Do we allow for experimentation? \nDo we allow for a different approach? And perhaps if we do that, we can \nfind that there is a more effective, more cost-effective and results-\noriented way of providing education in this country.\n  Now, if it were simply a matter of money, we would be the best-\neducated Nation in the world. Our children would be head and shoulders \nabove everybody else, because we have poured untold amounts of money \ninto education in an attempt to solve the very problems that I think we \nall recognize exist today in education. It is the solution where we \ndraw a line of distinction in terms of the difference between us.\n  The fact is that education spending has increased dramatically. In \nthe last 30 years, we have increased spending four times what we spent \nin the 1950's. On average, we pay as much per student per year in \npublic schools as many private schools charge. Per pupil spending \ntripled from its 1960 level, resulting in an average cost of $5,971 in \n1993 figures. In the last 10 years alone, [[Page S7094]] per pupil \nspending nationwide has increased 30 percent above the level required \nto keep up with inflation. That is according to the Education \nCommission of the States' report.\n  The Department of Education, in its first year, which was fiscal year \n1980, housed 150 programs funded at $14 billion. Today, just 15 years \nlater, it houses 250 separately authorized programs, employing nearly \n5,000 people. Its fiscal year 1995 appropriations total is $33.7 \nbillion. Their administrative costs alone are $440 million. The \nEducation Department spends nearly $500 for every student in America.\n  So the question is not, are we pouring money into education, or are \nwe making resources available either at the Federal, State or local \nlevels for education. That is being accomplished. The question is: What \nare we getting for the money that we are putting into education? Are we \ngetting the kind of results back that all of us here would desire? Or \nshould we look to see if there is a more effective way of accomplishing \nthis goal?\n  I suggest that we need to look--and look pretty immediately--at \nwhether or not there is a more effective way, because the results are \npretty discouraging.\n  We have all heard about the decline in SAT scores and the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress Reports, where in the face of the \nfact that real public spending in elementary and secondary education \nrose from just over $50 billion in 1960 to nearly $190 billion in 1990, \nand whereas real per pupil spending more than tripled from $1,450 in \n1960 to $4,622 in 1990, I do not know of anybody saying that the result \nhas been a tripling of the quality of education that is being received \nby our students.\n  Eric Hanushek, in his book, ``Making Schools Work,'' which was \npublished by the Brookings Institution, concluded from an exhaustive \nstudy of educational funding in America, that funding is not related to \nschool quality.\n  A study done by American Demographics, a publication of the U.S. \nCensus Board found that----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield when I have finished my \nstatement. My understanding is that the Democrats have had their full \n90 minutes. We would like to use some of our time. I know the clock is \nrunning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I did not mean to interrupt. I understand.\n  Mr. COATS. The results of the American Demographics study found that \nthere was no direct correlation between the amount of money spent per \npupil and student performance. In fact, there were many examples where \nit was the reverse--the more money spent per pupil, the worse the \nstudent performance in that school actually was. And oftentimes, where \nthe amounts per pupil were relatively low, performance was relatively \nhigh. And so experts studying the situation had to go in and determine \nwhether or not there were other factors involved in providing learning \nand education for our students. They found that there were many other \nfactors involved.\n  Many have pointed to those factors. And those are factors that I \nwould hope throughout the debate this year on education--and to my \ncolleagues who said it is unconscionable that we only have 3 hours, let \nme just reply that I was not here when the unanimous-consent agreement \nwas offered, but unanimous consent by its very nature means that any \none of us can object. If anybody wanted to object, I suppose we could \nhave objected to that.\n  We will have probably hundreds of hours of debate on education this \nyear in this Congress. There are many bills that will be coming up. \nSenator Lieberman and I are offering a bill, which may be an amendment \nto education. Others will be offering amendments on various bills. We \nwill be dealing with this subject at length. So I do not think anybody \nneeds to worry that we are going to be shorted in the amount of time we \nare going to speak on education subjects.\n  But, clearly, for those who think the solution to education is simply \nto pump more money into a system that has produced such disastrous \nresults--I cannot understand that logic. It seems to me that now is the \ntime to be asking fundamental questions about how we can reform the \neducation system in this country. What changes can we make? What \ndemonstration programs should we enter into to give us more data with \nwhich we can make decisions?\n  I have found--and I think this is supported by a number of studies \nand researchers--that there are some very basic principles that are \ninvolved in providing sound education. If you study schools that \nproduce results, if you look at students that can demonstrate through \ntheir educational achievement the kind of success that we are looking \nfor, you find some very common themes running through the whole \nprogram.\n  One theme is that the education process to which those students have \nbeen subjected to dealt with basic core subjects--the reading, writing, \narithmetic and other subjects that have traditionally formed the core \nof our elementary and secondary education in this country.\n  We have seen a great deviation from that in the last few decades. \nThere have been many new experimental programs and so forth, and \nunfortunately, the kind of electives that students have been allowed to \nsign up for, have not resulted in the kind of educational achievement \nin the basic subjects necessary for adequate performance in the \nworkplace.\n  Schools that have returned to basic core subject teaching have turned \nout students that are much better prepared to compete in today's \nsociety.\n  Second, we found that in those schools that have demonstrated success \nand students have demonstrated success, we have found that there has \nbeen a pretty steady, high level of discipline, that the standards \nestablished by the schools, by the communities in which those schools \nresided, and administered by the administrators and the standards to \nwhich the students were held accountable, were high standards. \nDiscipline was one of the major ingredients, one of the basic \nprinciples underlying the education process.\n  Third, we found that there was an emphasis on teachers, not on \nadministrators. We have seen an explosion of administrative costs in \nour schools, where it seems that we have more positions filled by \nadministrators than we do teachers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield? I wanted to ask a question.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I give the same reply to the Senator from \nMinnesota that I gave before. I would like to be able to complete my \nstatement. I am sure the Senator has a number of questions he would \nlike to ask, but I would prefer to make my statement. To the best of my \nknowledge, we allowed your side to make your statements without \ninterruption, and I think we would appreciate making our statements \nwithout interruption. I know the Senator would like to engage in debate \non this subject. The time is divided. We will be happy to do that. \nThere will be plenty of opportunities all year long, in committee, on \nthe floor. We are under a time limitation. The limitation was agreed \nto. The Senator from Minnesota and Iowa agreed to it, or did not object \nto it.\n  So here we are. I think those of us who have a statement to make, to \ncounter the statements made by the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from \nMinnesota and the Senator from Massachusetts, would like to make those \nstatements without interruption.\n  Mr. President, if I could do that, I would appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right not to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as I was saying, I think one of the basic \nprinciples underlying the provision of a sound education is the \nemphasis on those providing the education, not on those administering \nthe building. One of the most discouraging things to this Senator in \nviewing public education is to find the layer upon layer upon layer \nupon layer of administrative bureaucracy designed to solve every \nproblem in the school except providing the teaching of the student.\n  Inevitably, the more we involve the Federal Government in the \neducational process, the more layers of administration are required. \nThe more assistant principals for this, that and everything else, the \nmore forms, the more procedures, the more rules, the more of everything \nbut what ought to take place in the classroom. [[Page S7095]] \n  I, for one, have been urging the Senate to revise the way in which we \nfund our schools so that we can provide funds to hire competent \nteachers and then let them teach.\n  Another thing I have noticed: it does not make a difference how fancy \nthe school is, how much equipment they have, or what the condition of \nthe building is, these items pale in comparison to the requirement that \nthe teacher knows what they are doing and the teacher is able to \nprovide sound teaching to the students under his or her tutelage.\n  The fourth basic principle I found that seems to be a component of \nsuccessful education is that the school involves the parents, that \nthere is parental involvement and community involvement in the \neducation process. There is a direct correlation between parental \ninvolvement and educational success.\n  Those are part of the values that we cannot necessarily legislate. \nPumping more money into the Department of Education is not going to \nsuddenly transform parents into being more concerned about their \nchildren's education. It is not going to make them show up at school \nmore often, be more involved in the homework, be more involved in \nmaking sure their student gets to class on time and performs the work \nthat is assigned. Community involvement and parental involvement is an \nessential key ingredient to educational success.\n  Finally, and I know this is controversial, but those schools that \nmaintain some core basic values, have some value education as part of \ntheir curriculum, are more successful in turning out students who \nperform better, who are better trained, who do better on the tests. It \nprovides, I believe, a better atmosphere for learning and has been \ndemonstrated to be effective.\n  The sad reality that has emerged from about 30 years of Federal \ninvolvement and ever-increasing Federal dollars and ever-increasing \nFederal rules and regulations into our education is a pattern of more \nspending, especially as I said for administration, fewer students \nstaying in school through graduation, lower SAT scores, lower \ngraduation rates and dismal rates of academic proficiency.\n  We only need to look at the District of Columbia right outside our \ndoor to show that spending per pupil is not the solution to the \nproblem. Most public school graduates arriving at college, graduating \nfrom District of Columbia schools, are ill-prepared for their further \neducation. Nearly 90 percent of the freshmen at the University of the \nDistrict of Columbia last fall needed remedial work in English, 49 \npercent had trouble reading, and 49 percent could not do basic math.\n  Now, is the solution to pour more money into the system? Or is the \nsolution to say maybe there is something wrong with the system. Maybe \nwe ought to look at ways in which we can change the system.\n  That is one of the things that Senator Lieberman and I are attempting \nto do with our school choice demonstration project, designed for low-\nincome families and low-income students and parents who find that their \nstudents are trapped in a public education system that is not going to \nprovide them with the education they need to rise out of their current \nlevel of poverty. Many parents, particularly those who live in the \ninner city, are begging for the opportunity to send their students \nsomewhere other than the public education facility.\n  We have a school in Indianapolis, IN, which is a private parochial \nschool that spends one-third of the amount per pupil as the public \nschool just down the block. We have parents standing in line trying to \nenroll their students in a parochial school that spends one-third less \non their students than the public schools, because they know they are \ngoing to get a better education. And why will they get a better \neducation? Because the basic principles underlying the education in \nthat parochial school, many of which I have outlined earlier, are not \nprovided in the local public school. All Senator Lieberman and I are \nattempting to do is set aside some funds so that on a voluntary basis, \ncommunities can enter into demonstration programs, demonstration \nprograms which will provide this Congress with objective data about the \nschool choice alternative, which we can use to determine how best to \nmake the necessary changes in the education system to enable the \nchildren in this country to lead successful, productive lives.\n  Yet each time we offer this amendment, we are thwarted by the same \nproponents of this amendment. We are not allowed any experimentation. \n``Do not do anything different. Keep the system just exactly as it is. \nThe only thing it lacks is more money.''\n  Well, I would argue, Mr. President, that it lacks much more than \ngreater amounts of money, rather that it needs fundamental, basic \nreform. I do not have the answers as to exactly what that reform ought \nto be, but we ought to at least be able to experiment and give students \nand parents a choice outside the system. If we can give them a choice \noutside the system, maybe it will make the system better.\n  If we had one car company in America, I daresay that we, as \nconsumers, would not enjoy the variety, the quality, nor the cost \neffectiveness that we get from having competition throughout the \nindustry.\n  I am not aware of any system in America, that as a monopoly, operates \nefficiently. Competition spurs better performance, it spurs more cost-\neffective performance, it spurs better results. Yet we do not have \ncompetition in schooling alternatives in America for those with low \nincomes.\n  It is easy for Senators to say, ``Let us keep all the emphasis on \npublic schools.'' We can afford to send our kids somewhere outside the \npublic schools. My children go to public schools, but it is easy for \nme. If I do not like the public school I can afford to send them \nsomewhere else. But what about the low-income mother, living in the \ninner city? What about the parents who do not have the income to have a \nchoice? They are condemned to a school which is condemning their child \nto an inferior education, trapping that child in circumstances and in \npoverty. And we cannot even provide a demonstration project to see \nwhether or not it would benefit the children to have a degree of choice \nas to what school they attend.\n  Who are we trying to protect? The administrators? The system? Or do \nwe really care about the education of children? I submit our goal here \nis not to protect the system. It is not to protect the administrators. \nIt is not to protect the lobbying groups. Our goal is to look out for \nthe children and give them opportunities that they have not had under \nour current system.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to reject this ``Let us just put more money \ninto the existing system'' amendment. That is what it is. ``Let us make \nsure we perpetuate the status quo. Let us keep everything within the \nbox and the framework will be defined by the public system and their \nlobbyists. They will define the framework. And do not let anybody dare \ncompete with them because they might do it better.''\n  Who do we really care about? Who are we really looking out for? I \ncontend it is the students we should care about. It is their future we \nshould care about. And we ought to give them the opportunities to \nescape a lousy, rotten, failed school if that is where they find \nthemselves.\n  There are many public schools doing a fine job in America. But there \nare many lousy schools doing a lousy job in America. And to trap a \ncertain segment of our population, low-income families, in that \nsituation I think is a great disservice to the future of this country. \nTo argue that those who object to putting more money into the failed \nsystem are against education, or do not care about the future of \nAmerica, or somehow do not care about the future of our children, is \nthe most disingenuous argument that I have heard. It just flies in the \nface of the facts that we all know are true.\n  As the report in the 1980's said, we are just treading along in a sea \nof mediocrity in public education in this country. It is high time we \nmade some changes in the system. In 1995 let us be a little bit \ninnovative, let us be bold, let us take some chances, especially when \nwe are dealing with a system that has failed us so badly.\n  I went on longer than I intended. I thank the Senator from Utah for \nhis generous yielding of time. I yield the floor. [[Page S7096]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require \nand will yield shortly to the senior Senator from New Mexico, who has a \npoint to make.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I have a point of inquiry and that is it?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will there be any opportunity for questions and \ndiscussion after the Senator speaks? Or does he want to just go forward \nwithout any questions?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I cannot speak for other Senators. When I get in my \npresentation, if the questions are not so much a barrier to prevent me \nfrom going on to the point I would make, I will be happy to yield for \nquestions at the appropriate time, and tell my friend he could look \nforward to that, if he can stand the boredom of staying on the floor \nuntil I get going.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his graciousness and say to \nhim, as a teacher, as long as we are talking about education, the best \neducation is when we have a chance to have this exchange of views. I \nthank my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had some general statements about \neducation here. Undoubtedly we will have some more before this time is \nup.\n  May I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise the Senator from Utah \nthat he has 49\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chair.\n  Let us talk for just a minute, although it may seem extraneous to the \ndiscussion we have had, about what the amendment does. Let us talk \nabout the parliamentary situation with which we are faced, rather than \nabout cosmic matters relating to education in general.\n  The total amount of Federal spending in America's educational system \ncomes to 6.6 percent of the total figure. So we are talking about what \nhappens to that Federal 6.6 percent. With all of this talk about \ngigantic slashes, even if we were to eliminate all of it that would be \na 6.6 percent cut. But of course we are not talking about eliminating \nall of it. We are talking about funding here at a level that has been \nestablished in fiscal 1992. Someone says, ``Why do you go back to \n1992?'' Simply because as I understand the budget process, there was a \nstrong blip up in 1993 and 1994, and the Budget Committee has gone back \nto the level that they would consider to be more traditional, to hold \nthat level through the year 2002. So we are talking about level \nfunding, not slashing all of the 6.6 percent.\n  From some of the rhetoric I have heard on the floor this afternoon \nyou would think we were cutting the entire educational system of the \ncountry by huge, huge amounts when in fact the amendment proposed by \nthe Budget Committee would establish a level of funding for that which \nis 6.6 percent of the total rather than the other implications we have \nhad.\n  Do Washington education dollars fund my daughter's textbooks? No. \nThat is all done with State and local funds. So this budget has nothing \nto do with textbooks.\n  Do Washington education dollars pay for my son's teachers? No. That \nis all done with State and local funds. This has nothing to do with the \npaying of teachers' salaries.\n  Then do Washington education dollars build my neighborhood schools? \nNo. We are not talking about building schools, paying teachers, buying \ntextbooks or supplies.\n  The Federal dollars we are talking about go to very specific \nprograms, primarily to assist State and local governments in efforts \nfor special populations: Disadvantaged, individuals with disabilities--\nFederal dollars go to assist State and local people in that population. \nI stress assist, because, once again, the bulk of the funds come from \nthe States and the localities. I will address that in just a moment. It \ngoes to assist those with special needs: Bilingual education, drug use \nprevention, dropout prevention and so on. Some assists with research.\n  The programs with the largest outlays in the Federal dollars are \nIndian education, impact aid, school improvement--that is drug-free \nschools--math and science improvement kinds of things, education for \nthe disadvantaged--we call Chapter 1 programs--and, as I say bilingual \neducation, special education, rehabilitation services for those with \ndisabilities, some vocational, libraries and so on.\n  I alluded, in my opening comment, to my experience as chairman of the \nStrategic Planning Commission for Education in the State of Utah. We \nlooked over the budget. That is where you start. You look at the \nnumbers. And as the folks were outlining the budget to me, I said, \n``Can we move any money from this to this?''\n  I was told, ``Oh, no. You cannot move any money from this function to \nthat function.''\n  ``Why not?''\n  I am coming in as a businessman, all excited with this assignment \nfrom the State Board of Education. I am going to show them some sound \nbusiness practices--all the naivete that comes with that kind of \nassignment, with those who really do not understand what they are \ngetting into.\n  I was told: ``You cannot move this money from this program to this \nprogram because when it is over here, it is matching Federal funds.''\n  And naively I said ``Oh, matching Federal funds? OK. I understand \nthat. We are spending 50-cent dollars, are we?\n The Fed put up 50 cents, and we put up 50 cents. I can understand \nthat. Is it not wonderful to spend 50 cents out of every dollar?'' \n``Oh,'' they said. ``Bob, you really are naive. The Feds do not put up \n50 cents. The Feds will put up 15 cents and require you to match the \n85.'' ``Oh. Well then,'' I said,''in that case, if we do not like the \nprogram, let us just tell the Feds to keep their 15 cents, and we will \nspend the 85 cents someplace else.'' Once again, with the shake of the \nhead, ``Bob, are you naive? You have to put up the 85 cents whether you \nwant to or not. The Federal law requires it.'' I said, ``Wait a minute. \nWhat is it? Matching funds? Matching means 50-50.'' They said ``No. \nMatching means whatever the Feds decide it means.'' ``You mean we \ncannot refuse the 15 cents? We have to take the 85 cents, whether we \nwant to or not, and spend it in this program?'' They said, ``Now you \nare beginning to understand.''\n\n  I said, ``What would happen if we did refuse the 15 cents?'' They \nsaid, ``The Federal Government would sue you. And they would win.'' I \nsaid, ``Isn't there any program of matching funds where the Feds put up \nat least 50 cents out of every dollar?'' They said, ``Yes. There is one \nprogram where the Feds put up 50 cents out of every dollar. It is \nschool lunch. But everything else the Feds put up less than 50 cents \nand the States have to put up more.''\n  So they said, in effect, even though the Federal Government only puts \nup 6 percent of the total educational budget, the Federal Government \ncontrols the State priorities through this process because they distort \nhow you are spending your State funds. My first education, if you will, \nin education and the discovery of how intrusive the Federal Government \ncan be. Somehow I came back here with the desire that that ought to be \nchanged. And this budget resolution which begins to level out rather \nthan continue to spiral up Federal spending, I think, gives us an \nopportunity to effect that kind of change.\n  We have heard a great deal on this floor about the cost of college \neducation, how we need to bring down the cost of college education, to \ndo something about student loans, as this budget resolution does, and \nthat it would be devastating to every college student who has to borrow \nmoney to go to college. Now, in this debate they are ignoring one very \nimportant thing when they say that.\n  I am about to yield time to the senior Senator from New Mexico \nbecause he has a chart on this and is ready to talk to us about that.\n  The important thing to remember is that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us that, if we adopt this budget resolution, interest \nrates will come down. That means students who borrow money to go to \nschool will have to pay back less because they have lower interest \nrates. Not only those students who are borrowing student loans, but \nalso those students who, for one reason or another, cannot get a \nstudent loan [[Page S7097]] will also benefit as a result of this \nbudget resolution. The benefit will be across the board. All students \nwho have to go into debt to pay their college education, whether \nthemselves or their parents, will benefit as a result of this budget \nresolution, and you are diluting that if you adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from Utah think there is a certain amount \nof irony in this? You have these Members from the other side of the \naisle who I know come here in good faith, spending money which is \nbasically the result of the efforts made by Members on our side of the \naisle to get the budget balanced, which dollars are generated by a \nscoring of a balanced budget, as a result of which the CBO says they \ncan score a 2-percent reduction in interest rates.\n  So the money which is being used in this amendment to fund this \nalleged expenditure, or this expenditure they are proposing, is \ngenerated by a 2-percent dividend which is the result of the drop in \ninterest rates. Yet, they totally ignore at the same time that that 2-\npercent dividend in a drop in interest rates will run to the benefit of \nall the students who are borrowing money, all the homeowners who are \nborrowing money, all the people who have credit cards, all the folks in \nthis country who are involved in the use of credit, whether it is for a \nhome or for getting through the day with their Visa card or \nMasterCharge card, or whether it is their education.\n  So they are perfectly happy to spend the money that is generated by \nthis 2-percent dividend, but they give us no credit for scoring the \nbenefits to the students of this country as a result of getting that 2-\npercent dividend.\n  Is not that ironic?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree that it is ironic. But it goes beyond that, if I \nmay respond.\n  The adoption of this amendment would imperil the creation of the so-\ncalled special fund or discretionary fund at the end of the process \nfrom which they intend to take the $40 billion. In other words, if in \nfact more money is spent on education than is called for in this \nresolution, the fund at the back end will not occur and, therefore, it \nwill not be available to them to pay for the $40 billion that they are \nspending. The only way that can be there is if the budget amendment is \nheld intact.\n  So it is not only ironic; it is fiscally impossible for you to do \nboth things at the same time.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will yield for an additional comment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think this point is very important to emphasize because \nI asked my staff. If they are going to continue to spend this 2-percent \nthat is generated as a result of interest rates coming down, should not \nwe at least find out what that benefit is to the American people \ngenerally, not only in the area of deficit reduction but generally? So \nI asked my staff. They talked to the people at the Federal Reserve and \nfound what the gross consumer debt is in this country and what the \ngross home ownership debt is in this country. One can make a simple \ncalculation. What is 2-percent of that worth to the American people? \nThey did that. I am not sure how good their math is, but their numbers \nsay that the 2-percent savings on the gross consumer debt, which \nhappens to be $928 trillion, 2-percent savings----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Was that $928 trillion?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is right.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think the Senator missed a decimal point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the entire consumer debt.\n  Mr. GREGG. The entire consumer debt. The Senator is right, ``billion \ndollars''; $928 billion.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The entire worth of the country is about $27 trillion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Just a second. I will get to the trillion dollars. The 2-\npercent savings on that is $18 billion annually. On home ownership \nmortgages, the entire debt is $4.3 trillion--$4.3 trillion--which means \nthat the annual savings on that number is approximately $90 billion.\n  So you put those two together, and you are up to $100 billion of \nsavings in interest costs that we are going to generate for the \nAmerican consumer over the next year, every year that we have in place \nthis balanced budget.\n  I did not happen to get the number for what the gross amount is of \nstudent loans, but I think that would be a very interesting number. The \ngross amount of student loans which we have in this country, take 2 \npercent off that, and I suspect you are going to see that the dividend \nto the students in this country far exceeds the number which is being \nconsidered here over a 5-year or 7-year plan.\n  I think this is critical to understand because there is nobody on \nthat side, nobody, who is going to vote to institute the type of \nchanges that are necessary in order to get to a balanced budget which \ngenerates this dividend, this reduction in interest rates.\n  I think it is critical. I appreciate the Senator from Utah correcting \nmy math. That is deeply critical. But I think it is very important, as \nthe Senator from Utah has pointed out; it is a very significant fact.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  I have two observations. One is a personal one. I remember when I \nwent to the University of Southern California where my son decided he \nwanted to go. I went there with some fear and trembling because I did \nnot think I could afford to have him do that, my two other children \nhaving gone to much cheaper institutions financially.\n  I said, ``Can I get a loan?'' They said, ``Well, what is your \nincome?'' I told them my income. They said, ``Well, we are not sure. Do \nyou have any other children in college?'' I said, ``Oh. Sure.'' I have \nsix children and not all of them were in college at the same time but \nenough were. They said with other children in college I could get a \nloan. I said, ``Good. At a lower interest rate?'' ``Oh, yes. Subsidized \ninterest rate.'' Then they said, ``By the way, what is your house \nworth?'' I was living in southern California at the time, and real \nestate prices had gone sky high. And when I told them what my house was \nworth, they said, ``There is no way in the world you can qualify for a \nloan with that much net worth.'' The only way I could get that son in \nschool was to take out a second mortgage on my house. But I could not \nget it subsidized with a Government program because my house was worth \ntoo much.\n  So, on a personal basis, bringing down the interest rates 2 percent \non my home loan would have been tremendously valuable to me in terms of \nwhat I could afford for that student. And that goes to the point I was \nmaking earlier, which is this budget resolution, if passed intact, will \nnot only benefit those students that are getting student loans from the \nGovernment but the over 50 percent of students whose loans are not \nsubsidized by the Government but whose parents are paying for it \ndirectly.\n  I refer you to the chart which the senior Senator from New Mexico has \nplaced on the floor, and I ask the Senator if he would care to take us \nthrough that.\n  I yield such time as the senior Senator from New Mexico may require.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure that Senator Harkin would be within \nearshot of these comments, but actually, from my standpoint, I would \njust suggest he very much wanted to speak and apparently did not get a \nchance. I would have no objection if he wanted to use 5 or 6 minutes of \nour time, if he appeared here shortly on the floor, I say to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would have no objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator would like to come to the floor, I will \nyield him 6 or 7 minutes if he wants to speak. We will try to work it \nout where he does not get the last remarks, just as a matter of \nprinciple but, otherwise, I would not mind at all.\n  Mr. President, maybe what I will do for a few minutes is just go \nthrough about 5 charges, what we have been charged with doing in this \nbudget, and respond to it in terms of what we think we are doing. So \nmaybe I could just take a few minutes and do this.\n  Yesterday, I was on the floor and heard this. I would be very \nsurprised if it was not said again today. Under the \n[[Page S7098]] Senate resolution, thousands of students will not have \naccess to Pell grants. Remember that statement?\n  Response: The budget resolution before us makes a number of \nassumptions and comes out with exactly the amount of money saved and \nspent in this resolution. The answer to that charge is: Absolutely \nfalse. The Senate resolution assumes no changes in the Pell grant \nprogram.\n  In fact, the report accompanying the resolution states clearly \ncurrent law funding for Pell grants is assumed. The Pell grant program, \nwhile a discretionary program and thus up to the appropriators, is \nfunded on the basis of eligible population. The resolution assumes that \nthis will continue to be the case. The Pell grants will be $2,340 per \nstudent. The Senate resolution has no change in current law.\n  Next one. Charge: Under the Republican plan--and this is the most \ngross charge and grossly erroneous charge--it will cost graduate \nstudents $40,000 more to go to school.\n  Response: This argument is based upon the assumption that the student \nborrows the maximum amount for all 4 years of undergraduate education, \nfor 2 years of graduate school, that interest accrues during that \nentire period while the student is in school, and they repay the loan \nover 20 years.\n  Now let me suggest, the Senate plan does this: For the above student \nthat I just referred to, interest costs would accrue during school only \nfor those loans taken out as a graduate student, not undergraduate. \nUnder the Senate plan, under the most extreme case, for example, if a \nstudent borrowed the maximum amount, $65,000 over 6 years, and took 30 \nyears to repay--not 20, but 30; so we even make it a longer period of \ntime--their cost would rise by 10 percent over what they would pay \nunder current law.\n  Under current law, this student would repay a total of $173,605. \nUnder the Senate plan, in an extreme case, affecting less than 1 \npercent of all students--that is why I used it; it is an extreme case--\nwe would add $17,000 over 30 years, not $40,000 over 20, and only 1 \npercent of the students borrowing money today would be affected by that \nmost extreme scenario. And they are all graduate students. Now, that is \nthe truth.\n  Charge: Under the Senate resolution, it will cost undergraduate \nstudents an additional $5,000 repayment of their loans.\n  Our response: That assumption is based upon the premise that an \nundergraduate student borrows the maximum amount allowable each year \nfor 4 years, and that interest accrues during the in-school period.\n  Again, this is false. The assumption about the Senate resolution is \nfalse and is being done in a vacuum. The Senate resolution assumes \ncurrent law with respect to undergraduate students while they are in \nschool. Under current law, while they are in school, their interest \nwill not accrue until graduation.\n  Under the Senate balanced budget resolution, a student who borrows \n$17,125 over 4 years will pay an additional $182 over the 10-year \nrepayment, for approximately $1 per month.\n  Now, I could go on, but I will insert in the Record the charge about \nmiddle-class families not being allowed to send their children to \ncollege. That is an allegation, a charge.\n  Response: For all students, the plan provides a current growth in \nloan volume as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the availability of \nloans for students at much lower cost than what they could receive in \nconsumer markets will not be limited in any way under this budget plan.\n  Under this Senate plan, students will receive $26 billion in 1996. \nThe level of available loans will continue to rise to $33 billion by \nthe year 2000.\n  Over the next 5 years, $151.4 billion in student loans will be \navailable.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am quite sure that for those who listened to \nthe debate, they would never have assumed that that is the case, for \nthey would have assumed the Republicans do not understand the value of \neducation. They would have assumed that we just set out on a course to \nsay even those programs that are successful, we are for cutting them, \ntightening them up, getting rid of them, none of which is true.\n  Mr. President, I would like very much to go through this chart for a \nminute and then tell the American people what we are trying to do.\n  Here is the way the undergraduate program looks.\n  Current law, original principal and amount borrowed, $10,000. Senate \nbudget resolution, same, $10,000. Difference, zero.\n  Amount used to pay fees, $400; $500; $100 in additional fees.\n  In other words, we are having the student pay a little bit of the \nfees, $100.\n  Amount available to pay education costs over 10 years, $9,600; \n$9,500; minus $100.\n  Original principal amount of repayment, $10,000; $10,000. Difference, \nnone.\n  This next one, the accrued interest during 6-month grace period. This \nis the change. Right now, you have 6 months after graduation and \nobtaining the degree before interest starts to accrue. So during that 6 \nmonths, there is zero. In the suggested program in that budget \nresolution, you do not get that 6-month grace. You start paying \ninterest--$330 total amount at repayment. You would have thought these \nundergraduate students were going to end up paying three or four times \nwhat they are paying--$10,000; $10,330; plus $330.\n  Perhaps there are some who would like to say, ``We can't afford that. \nWe just cannot do that. Do it somewhere else.'' Or, ``Do not get a \nbalanced budget. Just charge the future generations. That is a little, \ntiny bit of money.''\n  Repayment at a standard 10 year monthly payment, $123. Estimated \nafter the balanced budget, $124. Why? Interest rates come down. The \namount is $1.\n  Somebody might say, ``But what if those interest rates do not come \ndown?'' Let me see if I can read what happens. This one is changed to \n$8, Mr. President. So instead of $1, which we assume will be the case, \na $1 increase, it will be $8. This is the entire student loan program, \n$26.6 billion. Are we cutting the $26.6 billion? How much is it going \nup to? One hundred fifty-one billion dollars over 5 years, that is what \nwe are recommending this loan portfolio be for undergraduates. \nCumulative repayment.\n  College students of America, your contribution to helping us balance \nthe budget of the United States under the student loan program is $1 a \nmonth increase, an astronomical amount over the 10-year repayment of \n$142. Frankly, I will take my chance on that on any campus in America. \nI will go tell the freshmen and the seniors: For your student loan \nprogram, do you want to share a little bit with us the sacrifice so we \ncan get a balanced budget, or do you want to listen to people who say \nto do that is to destroy universities, is to eliminate opportunities \nfor all our children, all those wanting to go to college?\n  I do not believe that is the case, and I do not believe the young \npeople in college feel that. If we were not going to get a balanced \nbudget, and we were just going to run-around here like we have been \ndoing for all these years and tinkering around the edges and say we \nwill take care of that some day, some day some year--in the meantime, \nget your college degrees and go to work and then we will make you start \npaying off these bills. Not these bills, these other giant bills, these \nbillions that we are going to charge to you, you college students, we \nare going to make you pay them off, I would think they would jump for \nthis proposition. Frankly, that is not all.\n  We have been accused here of cutting title I for the poor children. \nLet me tell you, I do not know whether the appropriators will cut it or \nnot, but we left it at current law. We did not even touch title I. It \nneeds a lot of reform, everybody knows that. It has been reformed \nsomewhat. We did not touch it. We said it is a good program.\n  You know, Mr. President, we do not have the time to go through every \ncharge, but I thought it might just do a little bit of good to put in \nperspective one program that people are talking most about. That is the \nundergraduate student loan guarantee program. I think we have done that \nfairly well here, and I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Utah that \nthere are 20 minutes remaining. I notice the Senator from Idaho on the \n[[Page S7099]] floor. I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Utah for \nyielding in what is really one of the most important parts of the \ndebate as we consider Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, and that is a \nportion of the debate that most of us would consider, and many would \nargue from the other side, is a portion of the Federal budget that is \nan investment in the future, an investment in the education of our \nyoung people.\n  While the amendment of the Senator from Iowa and South Carolina would \nargue all of these very worthy issues and attempt to put them in \nperspective, what they are really arguing is against a balanced budget. \nThey are largely arguing that at least there should be somewhere near a \n$40 billion to $50 billion deficit built into the budget as we are now \nhaving it proposed to us, at least to the future, the next 5 to 6 \nyears, and the dividend that the chairman of the Budget Committee and \nthat Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 embodies that we believe would go \ninto potential reductions in taxes that would stimulate the economy \nsimply is not what ought to be done or how it ought to be spent.\n  So it really is important when you listen to the Senator from New \nMexico argue about an investment in our young people's future. To begin \nto weigh just how important a balanced budget is, last year the Office \nof Management and Budget, I believe, proposed that young people in the \nvery near future, at least in their earning lifetime if they were born \nlast year, would have to start investing as much as 80 percent plus of \ntheir gross income into all forms of Government just to continue \ncurrent services as they would be projected from last year into the \nfuture 30 to 40 years and into the peak of their earning capacity.\n  That is talking about the future. If I have to turn to the young \npeople in my family and say you are going to have to pay 65 to 75 to 80 \npercent of your gross pay to afford all levels of Government, I am \nawfully afraid they are going to say: ``Dad, I don't want to work that \nhard. What is the advantage in working hard to get ahead? I can't own a \nhome or at least the kind of home that you and mom used to own. I am \nnot sure I can afford to provide for my children the kind of education \nthat you helped me get, because we cannot afford the Government that \nyou left us.''\n  So the reason I am on the floor tonight and the reason a lot of \nSenators have come to the floor the last few days and will through \ntomorrow and Wednesday is because for the first time in this Senator's \nlegislative life in Congress, I have a chance to vote for a balanced \nbudget amendment. No longer is it just the idea or the concept that \nsince 1982 I have come to the floor to debate, and that is a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, we are doing what \nthe other side, the Democrats for over 5 weeks, challenged us to do: \n``Don't put forth an amendment, put forth a balanced budget. Don't talk \njust rhetoric, do it.''\n  So the Budget Committee of the U.S. Senate and the Budget Committee \nin the House are doing it, and they are doing it in a way that \nabsolutely begins to cause the American people to understand that this \nis not pie in the sky, this is reality. It can be done.\n  So, Mr. President, for the next few minutes, let me give you the top \n10 list of why we ought to have a balanced budget amendment and why \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 13 is or should be rated as No. 1, if you \nare listing top 10 lists.\n  The first reason we ought to have it is the very reason I have been \ntalking about, the very reason the Senator from Utah and New Mexico \nhave talked about. It is our children, it is the future, it is \nproviding them with an unburdened, debt-free opportunity to achieve. \nAnd when you strive to do that, you create an economic environment in \nwhich our colleges and universities can thrive in the very economy that \nsupports them, and that is usually the State economy, and the local \neconomies can also thrive.\n  What is the second reason in the top 10 list? It is jobs. It is the \nfact that DRI McGraw-Hill, one of the leading economic forecasting \nfirms, has projected that a balanced budget will create 2.5 million new \njobs by the year 2002. That is exciting to think that if we get our \neconomic house in order that the economy of this country will begin to \nrespond by the generation of an additional 2.5 million jobs. That makes \na world of sense.\n  What is the third reason in the list of 10? It is the seniors, the \nseniors of our Nation, who I think really recognize what this debate is \nall about because they were born into a debt-free society. They were \ntaught by their elders to live within their means, and it is awfully \nfrustrating for them today to understand, or to try to understand, why \nwe have a $4.8 trillion debt and why we are having to look at \nGovernment and attempt to downsize it and change it and shift the \npriorities today.\n  And when we debate Social Security on the floor, they understand \nbetter than anybody else that the debt is the threat to Social \nSecurity, not the U.S. Congress. The reason Medicare is in trouble is \nthe spending rate and the fact that it will be bankrupt, and President \nClinton's own advisers said it. Yet, the other side ties their hands \nand walks away and uses the language of fear. The seniors understand \nthat in this country. They know that the debt is the threat to Social \nSecurity, to the future of our young people, to the strength of our \ncolleges and universities, and to Medicare.\n  What is the fourth good reason? Well, it is lower taxes. It is the \nstimulation of an economy. It is what makes sense in America, that we \ndo not overburden our society beyond their ability, or their will, or \ntheir enthusiasm to produce.\n  The fifth reason is economic growth. It is not trickle down. It is \ncalled leaving money in society to generate an economic base that fuels \nan economy that creates jobs.\n  It really means if we do what we say we are trying to do, that we put \n$1,000 in every wage earner's pocket, that the Federal Government would \nhave reached out and snatched away by 2002, if we pass this resolution \nand if this Congress becomes committed to a balanced budget amendment.\n  Reason 6 in that top 10 list is investment. Over $200 billion a year \nin annual deficits drag the economy down, and we know--and economists \nare telling us--that if we balance the budget, we are going to see an \neconomy begin to pick up at another 2 or 3 percent annually. That is \njobs. That is exciting.\n  Well, if you really look who is buying the debt, who is really taking \nadvantage of a Government that is in perpetual debt and has to borrow a \nlot of money, it is an awful lot of overseas interest. We used to hear \nthat argument from the other side. Somehow they are quiet today. They \nare not interested in the fact that we pay $75 billion or $80 billion \ninterest that flows abroad when that money can stay here and be \ninvested in our society and create jobs for our people.\n  Of course, what we are doing with this resolution also empowers the \nU.S. Congress to begin to look at the priorities of what Government \nreally ought to be doing and, most importantly, what Government should \nnot be doing; what State government ought to be doing that the Federal \nGovernment now may be doing but that it should not be doing. That is \nthe kind of shifting in priorities that I think is fundamentally \nimportant. When we talk about the Domenici dividend and the $170 \nbillion that will be saved and, therefore, create an opportunity \nthrough taxation to--reductions to stimulate our economy, that is the \nkind of empowerment that our Congress is talking about.\n  The ninth reason is a reasonable and responsible glidepath. Anybody \nwho has served in Congress any length of time who is committed to \nbalancing a Federal budget knows, and knows very clearly, that it \ncannot be done overnight. It probably should not, under any \ncircumstance, be done overnight. But this Budget Committee, with the \ndirection of this side of the aisle, has built a glidepath to take us \nto the year 2002 that makes a heck of a lot of sense. And that builds \nthe kind of economic resurgence we need and says to the average worker: \nYou are going to have less Government to pay for. And, in simple terms, \nthat means you are going to have more money to spend on \n[[Page S7100]] yourself and your kids. That is what this budget really \nought to be all about.\n  In the end, the 10th and most important reason is the people of our \ncountry. Seventy-five to 80 percent of the American people, year after \nyear, for well over a decade, have said: Congress, wake up, balance the \nbudget, get your fiscal house in order. The debt is really the threat \nto our future and the future of this country, and they, as the average \ncitizens, know it. The common sense of balancing your own checkbook has \nalready said it.\n  For years, we have labored under the burden that if we just spent a \nlittle more in every program, the world would be just a little better. \nWe have put a lot of money into education, and our educational system \ntoday does not meet the test and standards that we want it to meet.\n  Mr. President, those are the top 10 reasons that the Harkin amendment \nought to be voted down and that we ought to stay with Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13, the reasonable approach toward balancing the Federal \nbudget and forcing this Congress into the kind of spending priorities \nthat it must make and it never before has caused itself to do.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes three seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. As per the previous agreement, I yield 4 minutes to \nSenator Harkin and reserve the remainder for myself.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you. I appreciate the yielding of the time so that \nwe can have a few more minutes to respond and make a couple of points \non this side.\n  First of all, the Senator from Utah is a very thoughtful individual. \nI wanted to respond about some of the comments he made at the opening \nof the debate in regard to reviewing on a regular basis and changing \neducation programs. I want to assure the Senator that on a regular \nbasis, our committee, the Education Committee, reviews--as we do in the \nauthorizing process every year--and has hearings, and we do change \nprograms. We are doing that right now with IDEA, Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act; we are changing it. Last year, we \nreauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and we made \nseveral changes to the title I program. We rewrote the formula. It was \nquite a fight around here, as the Senator probably remembers. That went \non for several months. In 1992, we reauthorized the Higher Education \nAct and again made changes, in responding to the concerns of our \nconstituents. For example, one of the changes we made concerned a lot \nof farm kids with parents that were land rich but had no cash. They had \na farm but did not have any money. We changed that so these kids could \nbe eligible, also, for financial assistance.\n  Finally, every year the appropriations process also does its part. \nFor the 6 years that I chaired the subcommittee, we eliminated programs \nevery year. Last year, more than a dozen education programs were just \neliminated. I wanted to respond to the Senator that we do take our \nresponsibility seriously, and we do have the authorizing process here \nunder which we do, in fact, review these programs and get rid of some \nin the appropriations process, change them as times and circumstances \ndemand. I feel very strongly that trying to use the budget process to \nmaintain certain changes without having gone through this authorizing \nprocess and without looking at the history, I think, is really the \nwrong approach on this.\n  Finally, I wanted to respond to the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, in talking about some of the figures and how they add \nup. When you look at the assignment from the new GOP budget, the \nnumbers do not add up. They require a $13.7 billion cut. But when you \nlook at what the Budget Committee proposed in privatizing Sallie Mae, \nwe get no money. Maintaining long-term interest rates for student \nloans, we pick up about $229 billion. Extending the State default fee \nto direct loans, we get $702 billion. Eliminating in-school interest \nsubsidy for graduate students, $3.3 billion. There is about $4.257 \nbillion in the instructions of the Budget Committee. Yet we are \nsupposed to cut $13.7 billion. Maybe this is why I am so interested in \nputting more in education. This math does not add up. I hope the \nchairman will look at his math. And $13.7 billion does not equal $4.257 \nbillion. So there is a gap here of money that needs to be raised.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that really the only way we can possibly get \nit would be through the undergraduate student loan program, which is \nthe only program large enough under which we can get the missing $9 \nbillion.\n  Finally, the budget chairman claims to hold the Pell at the current \nlevel. But if we add inflation and the additional growth of students, \nthat comes out to be a 40 percent reduction in value of the grant by \nthe year 2002.\n  What is now about a $2,500 a year grant will now be down to about \n$1,600 by the year 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa is expired.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President,\n   I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 1158, the supplemental rescissions \nbill, that it be considered under the following time agreement: 20 \nminutes under the control of the chairman and ranking minority member \nof the Appropriations Committee; 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator McCain; 10 minutes under the control of Senator Feingold; 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Wellstone; and that following the \nconclusion of the debate, the Senate vote, without any intervening \naction or debate, on adoption of the conference report.\n\n  I understand this has been cleared with the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have come to the end of this debate. \nWe have heard a great deal about education, a great deal about numbers, \nwhose numbers add and whose numbers do not.\n  Mr. President, I will not try to repeat or summarize all the rhetoric \nthat has gone down. There is one point that perhaps has not been \nadequately made that needs to be understood by all Senators before we \nvote.\n  If we pass this amendment, the entire $170 billion reserve is lost. \nThe $170 billion reserve exists only if the Senate budget resolution \npasses as structured. It comes from the scoring of the CBO that says if \nthis amendment passes as structured, the lowering of interest rates and \nother economic activity that will occur as a beneficial result of this \nbudget will produce an additional $170 billion.\n  If the budget does not pass and is not enforced as structured, the \n$170 billion will not be there. So the $40 billion that is taken in \nadditional spending breaks through the one condition that the CBO laid \nout when they promised the $170 billion--I am informed by the chairman \nof the committee that if this amendment passes, the $170 billion that \nwe thought would be available to the Finance Committee for \nconsideration for other purposes will, in fact, not be there. And the \nwhole $170 billion will disappear.\n  If for no other reason, Mr. President, that alone is reason enough to \nvote down the Harkin amendment.\n  We must recognize the work that the Budget Committee has done and how \ncarefully they have structured all of their numbers, how carefully it \nhas been examined by the CBO, and on what thin ground the $170 billion \nreserve fund rests. It is not thin ground in the analysis, but it is \nthin ground in terms of the ease with which the ground could be cut \naway by amendments that break through the overall limit.\n  If we, in our wisdom, decide we want to increase the budget by that \n$40 billion, meaning there will be no balanced budget by the year 2002 \nbecause there are no offsets in the Harkin amendment, meaning that we \ndo not reach our target, then what the CBO says the cost will be, will \nbe $170 billion gone in the form of lower interest rates and lower \neconomic activity.\n  The Budget Committee, as I understand it, did not put that in. It \ncame from the CBO after the analysis. Senators must keep that in mind \nas we cast this vote. I yield the floor.\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n            Vote on Amendment No. 1116, as Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had a lot of inquiries as to what \nwill happen the remainder of this evening. We are still discussing this \nwith the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. Let me indicate what I \nhope will happen for the remainder of the week.\n  As I understand, when we complete action today, if we stay 5 more \nhours, there will be about 15 hours left on the resolution. And then \ntomorrow, to accommodate the other side for their fundraiser, we can \nonly go to about 6 o'clock, but we can still maybe get 8 hours in by \nworking through the lunch hour--or 10 hours--and start at 8, 8:30. So \nthen that would leave 5 hours remaining on Wednesday. If we start early \non Wednesday, we hope to finish this bill by mid-afternoon on Wednesday \nand, I assume, as in many other cases, there will be a number of votes \nbefore final passage.\n  Amendments will be called up and voted upon. You could have 2 or 3 \nhours of votes because we want to move to the antiterrorism bill, \nhopefully, on Wednesday, try to complete action on that Thursday or, if \nnot, on Friday. We indicated to the President we would do that.\n  It is my hope we can have a bipartisan effort so that we can pass \nthat legislation before the Memorial Day recess, as we indicated to the \nPresident we would.\n  We are not in a position to indicate there will be no more votes, but \nthere will be no more votes at least until 9:15, 9:30, if that is of \nany help to anyone. Otherwise, we will be here a number of hours and \nthere will be votes. If we are here, we could have votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we on our side are entitled to an \namendment. Senator Roth is going to offer an amendment. I designate him \nto be in control and manager of the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1121\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense-of-the-Senate that the number of Federal \nfull-time equivalent positions should be further reduced, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1121.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FURTHER FEDERAL \n                   WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution include \n     that the reductions in Federal full-time equivalent positions \n     required under section 5(b) of the Federal Workforce \n     Restructuring Act of 1994 (5 U.S.C. 3101 note) should be \n     further reduced to provide that--\n       (1) the total number of full-time equivalent positions in \n     all agencies shall not exceed 1,682,300 during fiscal year \n     2002; and\n       (2) of the additional reduction of 200,000 full-time \n     equivalent positions provided for [[Page S7102]] under \n     paragraph (1), no more than 50,000 shall be within the \n     Department of Defense.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my amendment would express the sense of the \nSenate to reduce the number of Government-wide full-time equivalent \n[FTE] positions over the next 7 years. It is consistent with the \nDomenici budget to streamline and eliminate several Government \nfunctions and programs.\n  The amendment provides for a reduction of 200,000 positions by 2002 \nin addition to the already enacted reduction of 272,900 FTE's by 1999 \nin the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. That legislation \nincluded government-wide annual FTE caps on civilian employment as well \nas provided buyout authority to help agencies downsize in a more humane \nfashion.\n  The Domenici budget calls for the elimination of the Department of \nCommerce, an idea that I have endorsed since the early 1980's. It also \ncalls for the elimination or phase out of nearly 150 Federal programs \nand functions. My estimates show that with these programmatic changes, \nover 150,000 positions could be eliminated in non-Defense agencies by \nfiscal year 2020.\n  My amendment limits the overall reductions within the Department of \nDefense to 50,000. Current Clinton administration projections show that \n208,000 of the mandated 272,900 FTE reductions will be within the \nDepartment of Defense. This amendment will help to achieve the \noriginally intended balance to further downsize the non-Defense related \nagencies as well. My amendment is consistent with the Roth-Kasich \nDefense Department acquisition reform bill to reduce the number of \nacquisition personnel. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthis reform bill would produce 42,500 in FTE savings with the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Current FTE reductions to comply with the 1994 Federal Workforce \nRestructing Act of 272,900 by 1999 are proceeding as planned. Further, \nOMB has estimated that the total civilian workforce will be \napproximately 25,000 below the existing FTE cap levels for 1995 and \n1996.\n  Let me take just a few moments to explain the personnel savings that \ncould be achieved within the acquisition workforce at the Defense \nDepartment. Despite recent efforts at improvement, DOD programs \ncontinue to experience significant cost, schedule and performance \nproblems. A recent Defense Department study found that defense programs \nare over budget and behind schedule by one-third, on average. The \nDefense Science Board reported that ``* * * without fundamental reform, \nDOD will be unable to afford the weapons, equipment and services it \nneeds to provide for our national security.'' After spending billions \nof dollars this suggests our troops in the future could face an enemy \nwho is better equipped, because of the failure of the current \nbureaucracy to efficiently procure weapons.\n  Last month, I introduced the Defense Acquisition Management Reform \nAct to address this situation. It contains two key elements. First, it \nbusts the bureaucracy. It combines the three separate maintenance and \nprocurement systems--the Army, Navy and Air Force--into one. This is a \ncommonsense solution for incredible duplication and inefficient \nbureaucracy. In fact, this bill turns 20 levels of bureaucracy into 3, \nand eliminates hundreds of paperwork requirements.\n  We are proposing that the Pentagon use the lean, results-oriented \napproach employed by globally competitive high-technology firms. This \nwill not only highlight results over process, but it will cut the \ntimeline in half! As the result, the bill returns authority to program \nmanagers and those who actually use the weapons.\n  Second, it changes the incentives and rewards that drive the day-to-\nday actions of the individuals in the buying system. The Defense \nAcquisition Management Reform Act of 1995\n gives managers and contractors the incentives they need to deliver \ntheir programs on time and on budget. If they deliver more than 10 \npercent ahead of time and under budget, they get bonuses. If they \ndeliver more than 10 percent late or over budget, they are penalized. \nIf they are more than 50 percent over budget, the program is cancelled. \nIt is that simple.\n\n  These changes are only a few of the many features contained in this \nbill that will save the American taxpayers some $20 billion each and \nevery year. As a part of these savings, we calculate that this bill \nwill allow a reduction of the defense acquisition work force, currently \nestimated at 425,000, by at least 10 percent. This is a bill with \nteeth, different from past reform efforts because of the incentives and \npenalties that will affect the program managers. Pay for performance \nand busting the bureaucracy will make all the difference.\n  The act focuses on eight, key principles: First, expanding the 90 \npercent cost, schedule and performance goals established for defense \nacquisition by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994; \nsecond, creating a single, lean DOD acquisition command which is more \nresponsive to the war fighters; third, more directly tying the pay of \nthe work force to achievement of program goals; fourth, establishing an \naccelerated, results-oriented acquisition cycle which is more sensitive \nto user needs; fifth, speeding up the contracting process; sixth, \ninstituting performance-based contract management which focuses on \nsharing with defense contractors the gain (or the pain) of meeting (or \nmissing) program performance goals; seventh, requiring improvements in \nthe financial management systems and procedures used to ensure the most \neffective stewardship of taxpayer dollars; and eighth, increasing the \nefficiency of acquisition operations through consolidation of military \ndepots and elimination of duplicative defense industry capabilities.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the purpose of this amendment is to express \nthe sense of the Senate that the number of Federal full-time equivalent \npositions should be further reduced.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It provides that it is the sense of \nthe Senate that the assumptions underlying the fundamental totals in \nthis resolution include that the reductions in Federal full-time \nequivalent positions required under section 5(b) of the Federal Work \nForce Restructuring Act of 1995 should be further reduced to provide \nthat, first, the total number of full-time equivalent positions in all \nagencies shall not exceed 1,682,300 during fiscal year 2002; second, of \nthe additional reductions of 200,000 full-time equivalent positions \nprovided for under paragraph 1, no more than 50,000 shall be within the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment by my \ncolleague and committee chairman on Governmental Affairs. I do it, \nalthough this is a sense of the Senate and is not binding on the \nSenate. I am afraid that it sets out goals that are not achievable.\n  Let me go back. The new administration came in. One of the things \nthat they set out to do was to downsize Government. They have been \ndoing a pretty good job of it. They have been getting very little \ncredit for it. They have been doing a pretty good job. First off, they \ndo not go about their task of downsizing Government just by picking a \nnumber off the top of their head to set out as a goal for reducing the \nfull-time employees of Government, the FTE's.\n  What they did was have the Office of Personnel Management actually \nmake estimates, department by department, agency by agency, all over \nGovernment, and come up with a total of what they thought was really \ndoable.\n  Mr. President, they set out to have the Office of Personnel \nManagement do actual estimates, the numbers of full-time employees that \nthe managers, doing the work of Government, thought they could do \nwithout. They came up with a total. It came out to 272,900, to be done \nover a 4-year period.\n  Now, Mr. President, that was doable. That had a basis in fact, a \nbasis in the estimates that were made by the various departments and \nagencies.\n  Now, that was a very studied approach. As a result of that, we had \nfewer reductions in force where they are mandatory, where they call \npeople in and fire them. That was not necessary.\n  What we did was we provided for buy-out legislation, put some money \nin the kitty so they could address this problem of getting people to \nleave Government, not just solely by attrition, because attrition, \nunfortunately, occurs in the lower GS ratings and fewer in \n[[Page S7103]] the higher GS ratings. That is understandable, more \nturnover at the lower level.\n  What they did was they asked Members to go ahead and set up buy-out \nlegislation. We did that. I proposed that in committee. We had it \npatterned after the civil service ratings, on the same basis we had \nprovided for the Pentagon some time before on reduction in force over \nthere, and doing it in a way where we did not have to really just call \npeople in and fire them. We wanted to do as much as we could by \nattrition but have buy-out legislation to encourage people to get out \nif we needed to use it. That has worked very, very well. It was one of \nour better administered plans in Government.\n  Let me say that along the way we had an additional thing we were \ntrying to achieve with this buy-out legislation. Through the years, \ngreat inefficiencies have developed in the Government in our hiring and \nstaffing patterns in that we had about one boss, one supervisor, for \nevery seven employees in the Federal Government, just on an average. \nSome areas that required higher level GS ratings, as NIH and places \nlike that, would be different, but overall across Government, there was \none supervisor for each seven employees.\n  Now, how does that compare to private industry? Private industry \naverages 1 to 15 on an average across the country for the average \nbusiness. Some employee-intensive industries will vary from that ratio, \nobviously. However, there would be many on the other side that would \nbalance it the other way. The overall ratio for the country is about 1 \nto 15.\n  With this buy-out legislation, we provided a way in which different \ndepartments and agencies could help correct that imbalance while we are \ngetting people out. We wanted the buy-out legislation targeted at GS \n13's, 14's and 15's so we could correct this imbalance. It has been \nworking very, very well.\n  How far have we come with this goal of 272,900 people? Right now they \nestimate 108,000 people are actually out, and they are hoping by the \nend of the year to have the whole 272,900 reduced.\n  This was done on a very studied basis. It was not done just on \npicking a number off the top of our heads and saying, well, we will \nshoot for there and see how many more we can get out.\n  Nevertheless, whether this is a studied basis or not, it is set as a \ngoal. How on earth would we meet it? We say that defense would be left \nout of this equation here except not completely left out. We say no \nmore than 50,000 more shall come out of the Department of Defense. What \nis to protect NIH? What is to protect those areas--the Center for \nDisease Control in Atlanta? What is to protect the FDA? What is to \nprotect areas of health and safety that we should be protecting, also?\n  My colleague on the other side of the aisle says, well, commerce is \ngoing to be put out of business, perhaps, if the plan goes through and \nsome 150 Federal programs will be out. We do not know that yet for \nsure. We do not know what ones.\n  It seems to me that the approach we should be using is to set what we \nwant to define as the functions of Government, not just swinging a \nmachete wildly and say, pick a number, any number, off the top of our \nheads and say we will set that as a goal to meet as though we could do \njust as good a job in Government no matter how low we cut the FTE's \ndown.\n  I think we should be defining the functions of Government first. I do \nnot know that there was any real thought given on how we arrived at \nthat 200,000. I would ask my colleague, Senator Roth, the Senator from \nDelaware, how he arrived at that 200,000.\n  Where did he come up with that? Was it a studied approach such as OPM \nused on behalf of the administration to be used on behalf of the \n272,900? That was not a figure just picked wildly at random, but \narrived at by totaling the number of people that agencies and \ndepartments said they could probably do without. And we came up to \n272,900 that could be cut. That was done on a very, very, studied \nbasis.\n  I do not know how we arrived at this 200,000. I do not know, in \naddition, how much it will cost for a buy-out if we are not to just set \nout wholesale firing people. I know it was said we would try to do this \nas much by attrition as possible.\n  Let me say this: Attrition does not work if we are going to correct \nthe imbalance between the supervisors or the bosses in Government and \nthe employees that are the workers across Government. If we were just \nto take attrition, attrition normally occurs in the lower civil service \nranks. It does not occur in the higher ranks. We specifically, in the \nlegislation that was passed before that helped them along to get the \nadministration's reduction of 272,900, we provided money in there, buy-\nout money, to help attain that goal.\n  That approach was worked very, very well. If we are to do this \nfurther downsizing as my distinguished colleague from Delaware \nindicates, then it seems to me we would want to continue this \ncorrection of the imbalance in the GS ratings as much as we possibly \ncould. We are not providing for that in this sense-of-the-Senate \nproposal.\n  My colleague also talks about the procurement legislation, putting \ndefense procurement all into one section. We still have different \nfunctions of Government to be performed, whether they are left in the \nindividual services or combined into one section. We will still have to \nhave people that do the design work, the evaluation work on airplanes, \nships, tanks, infantry and tactics, and all of the other things.\n  I do not know whether that will save money or not. I am certainly \nwilling to look at the defense procurement bill in 1995 and see how \nthat works out. What my distinguished colleague from Delaware said a \nlittle while ago as far as time limits on this, if it runs 10 percent \nover dollars or 10 percent over time, that the contract would be \ncanceled, if I understood his proposal correctly,\n I would say would almost certainly have precluded some of the major \nadvances we have had in military equipment in the past.\n\n  When we procure military equipment we are not just procuring Ford and \nChevy trucks off the line in Detroit, where you can predict exactly, \nwith great accuracy, when they come off the line, how much they will \ncost, and when they can be delivered.\n  We are talking about tanks that, as you go along, may need some \nchange to the original design. We are talking about the development of \nlasers, where you do not really know the cost, exactly, nor the time, \nyet you know it is worthwhile to go ahead and develop that particular \ncapability.\n  On guided missiles, we rarely know exactly when, what date they are \ngoing to come into active service on because, as you go along, you find \nproblems. The same thing with aircraft. Yet we do not want to say that \nevery aircraft that we design for the military would have to be such a \nsimplistic design, not getting into state-of-the-art matters, that it \ncould possibly adhere to an absolute 10-percent dollar or 10-percent \ntime limit or have its contract canceled. You are not talking about \nthings that are that neatly developed and that much here and now.\n  Many of these are programs that need to be developed and I do not \nknow how you would take care of something like that.\n  I am happy to look at the defense procurement legislation but I think \nwe have to be very, very careful when we set hard and strict rules that \nsay things will be canceled if they are 10 percent over budget or 10 \npercent over time. Perhaps bonuses can be given for coming in on time \nor coming in ahead of time. Maybe that would be a different approach \nand I will be glad to discuss that and work with my colleague from \nDelaware in looking into that. But I think, to get back to the original \nproposal here on passing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that just \nautomatically says:\n\n       The total number of full-time equivalent positions in all \n     agencies shall not exceed 1,682,300 during fiscal year 2002; \n     and, No. 2, of the additional reduction of 200,000 full-time \n     equivalent positions provided for under paragraph (1), no \n     more than 50,000 shall be within the Department of Defense.\n\n  That leaves 150,000 other cuts in Government.\n  I just cannot in good conscience vote for something that maybe some \npeople would interpret to mean cuts in FDA, cuts in NIH, cuts in the \nCenters for Disease Control; cuts in safety for our people, for health \nand safety matters for our people. We can say, ``I know it is not \nlikely that would occur.'' But do [[Page S7104]] we have any guarantee \nit will not occur? And with other things being proposed, the big cuts \nbeing proposed in other areas within this budget resolution, I do not \nhave much faith we would not have to take cuts in NIH and CDC and \neverywhere else. And I do not want to see that happen. I think that \nwould be a major, major mistake.\n  So I rise in opposition to this legislation even though it is only a \nsense of the Senate. I know it is easy, sometimes, to say it is sense \nof the Senate so it is not really binding so let us not worry about it, \nlet us pass it and we will work it out later on. But I do not look at \nthis as being quite so innocuous, because what we are doing is we are \ngoing on record saying the best judgment of the Senate of the United \nStates is that we can, without defining where they would come from, cut \nanother 200,000 people beyond the 272,900 that will already have been \ncut by this administration by the end of this year.\n  If we wanted to charge the Office of Personnel Management with going \nthrough once again at the end of this 272,900 cut and say OK, let us \nlook at this now, see what the job is of Government, see how many \npeople we need to do it, and can we really safely cut some additional \npeople in Government without hurting the function of Government, \nwhatever it is--NIH or FDA or whatever--then that would make some \nsense. But to just pick an arbitrary figure and say we will cut \n200,000--we could just as well have said cut the work force in half. \nCut the work force by 800,000. Cut the work force by half a million. It \nwould have made just as much sense. But the 200,000 to me is a figure I \nwould not want the Senate to go on record as saying that would be the \nobjective, even in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  So, Mr. President, for all those reasons I oppose the amendment by my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware. I will be glad to work with him \non some of the defense procurement legislation he is proposing, but \njust to go out and say we will automatically whack another 200,000 \npeople out without knowing exactly where they are coming from or \ndefining this, agency by agency, or department by department, would be \na big mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, has enough not happened over the last \nfew weeks that this abysmal practice of beating up on Federal employees \nought to come to an end? ``Oh, it is just a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution,'' the sponsor says. Nevertheless, it would represent a \njudgment of the Senate that we are going to cut the Federal work force \nanother 11 percent over and above, I repeat, over and above the 272,000 \nreduction in force that has already been programmed; over and above \nthat reduction in force.\n  At some point I hope people will reach the conclusion that Federal \nemployees have a reasonable role and place in the workings of our \nsystem and they ought to be treated with a measure of dignity. Why, \nonce again, are we landing with both feet on the men and women who \nrender dedicated service to the country? They are already taking a very \nheavy hit in this budget resolution.\n  In fact, over the period of this budget resolution Federal employees \nwill, in effect, give up $85 billion of pay adjustments that are \nprovided for by law in terms of assuring them comparability with the \nprivate sector. Yet here some come, late at night, with this amendment. \nThere is no study that backs these figures. They say, ``We assume the \nDepartment of Commerce is going to be done away with.'' Even the people \nadvocating the elimination of the Department of Commerce are not \nadvocating the elimination of all of the programs carried out by the \nDepartment of Commerce. When questioned, they in effect say, ``This \nprogram is going to go here, this program is going to go there. Yes, \nthis activity should continue.'' So most of those activities have to go \non. They are important to the economy of our country.\n  Now we are going to say to the Federal employees: Over 11 percent of \nyou are going to go by the board, over and above the reduction of \n272,000 which has already been programmed and which is well underway. \nIn fact, now well over 100,000 of those positions have been phased out \nin the course of the reduction that is taking place, and the rest are \nprojected to accrue by the end of the century.\n  This amendment says to people who have already been through turmoil, \nwho have already had all of the worry and the anxiety connected with \nthese reductions, ``Well, now there are an additional 200,000--well \nover 10 percent of those of you that are left--who are on your way \nout.''\n  What do you think that does for the morale of the work force? What do \nyou think that does for the health of their families? What do you think \nthat does to having a first-rate Federal service? We have a national \ninterest in having a first-rate Federal service. You do not want a \nsecond-rate Federal service. But, if you continue in effect to assault \npeople, keep them in this state of agitation and anxiety and fear and \napprehension, you are well on your way to bringing about a second-rate \nservice. People have other opportunities. Good people have other \nopportunities and will leave to take them. Good people will not come in \nbecause they do not want to live in this environment. This is not a \nrational, sensible proposal. It is not a proposal that is grounded on \nsome thorough analysis working up from a real examination of \nactivities. It arbitrarily imposes this upon the work force.'' We have \nhad far too much of that.\n  For years the Federal employees have been a favorite target. Take it \nout on the Federal employees. Call them ``bureaucrats'' with a sneer. \nDeprecate the work that they do. How long is this going to go on?\n  Are my colleagues finally going to begin to say these are dedicated \npeople, the vast number of them. They render important service. Many \nare highly trained and highly skilled. They are proud of the work they \ndo. They give a good performance. They carry out very important and \nessential functions. Yet, many constantly berate them, denigrate their \nwork, treat them not even as second-class but third-class citizens. Now \nthey come along and make these proposals. Proposals that have not been \nworked out carefully. They propose to go ahead and slap the Federal \nemployees once again, or twice again. After all, they are a favorite \ntarget, even though they are making, and have made, extraordinary \nsacrifices throughout this deficit reduction process.\n  Literally tens and tens of billions of dollars for the deficit \nreduction process have come out of the Federal employees. Now the \nofferor of this amendment comes along and says, despite the downsizing \nof 272,000 which is now on track to be carried through by the end of \nthe century, let us add another 200,000 to it; over an additional 10 \npercent of the work force.\n  At some point enough is enough, and this ought to be the point. We \nought to stop this practice of berating the Federal employees and stop \nnow.\n  Some say, ``Well, it is only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.'' I \nsimply say to them, that the message that is sent to the Federal \nemployees, and the message sent to the public at large about the \nFederal employees, is every bit as strong in this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which the Senator from Delaware has introduced as it would \nbe in a piece of binding legislation.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, it is time to stop this \nabysmal practice. These employees have sacrificed a lot. They ought not \nto be held under this sword of Damocles hanging over them, and be kept \nin this state of turmoil and apprehension. We ought to have some \nsensitivity for the situation in which they find themselves, and reject \nthe constant assault that is made upon hard working, dedicated men and \nwomen in the Federal service. They deserve to be treated with some \nmeasure of dignity. This resolution does not do that. I hope it will be \ndefeated.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask if the Senator from Delaware will yield time on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be happy to yield as much time as the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania may desire.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Delaware for the time yielded.\n  I would like to first just respond to the comments made by the \nSenator from Maryland. I am the son of two [[Page S7105]] Federal \nemployees. My parents worked for the Federal Government for their \nentire careers.\n  I think the Senator is right. I think Federal employees do get beat \nup on a lot. A lot of them are doing the best they can in a system that \nis not working particularly well for them, a Government which was \ndesigned under the theory of bureaucracy, a theory created prior to the \ninvention of the typewriter. That is how we wrote our Federal \nGovernment.\n  So to saddle them with a bureaucratic organizational structure in an \nera where we are debating a telecommunications bill that is going to \nmove us into the next millennium, which was unthinkable as much as 10 \nyears ago, to saddle them with that and to suggest that they can \nperform their functions is almost asking too much of them.\n  In addition, to suggest that the number of Federal employees in this \ninformation age cannot and should not be reduced, as it is in every \nprivate sector employment of any major corporation, is again not to \nface reality, that in fact structures must change, delivery systems \nmust change, theories that ran our Government from the time of the \nrevolution to now must change, and as a result the Federal compliment \nof employees must change, as it is in every major corporation in the \ncountry of any size.\n  I would daresay that if the Senator from Maryland suggested we had a \n10 percent cut in employment, we cannot afford another 10 percent, I \nwould look to any major company in the country that has not cut their \nwork force by 5, 10, or 20 percent or more. We have to do the same \nthing here. We have to understand that we have to deliver services more \nefficiently using technology that is available for us to do it better, \ncheaper, more efficiently and with less people in many cases.\n  So I do not think the argument--at least my argument is not to look \nat these Federal workers as terrible, these do not do a good job. I \ndisagree with that. I think the Federal workers that I know--and I know \nlots of them--work very hard, are very concerned about their job and \nwant to do the best they can, and in the most of the cases are \nhamstrung by their own internal operations from doing the job that they \nwanted to do. But to suggest that now as we move into this information \nage that we cannot modernize like everybody else and as a result of \nthat modernization be able to downsize the work force I think just \nflies in the face of what is going on in the entire world around us.\n  Government should reflect what the country is doing, and what the \nprivate sector is doing to be able to streamline and make more \nefficient.\n  I would suggest that there is one Federal employee who is not doing a \nvery good job, who does need to be scrutinized more in this debate in \nparticular; that is, the President of the United States.\n  If there is a Federal employee who is not facing up to the demands of \nhis job and coming forward with solutions to solve problems that face \nthis country, it is, in fact, the President.\n  We have the President now standing tall and firm against deficit \nreduction by saying he is going to veto the rescissions bill which is \ntrumpeted to be $16 billion but, as most of us in this Chamber know, as \nthe Federal Government continues to spend money day after day after \nday, that rescission bill is not worth $16 billion any more. We might \nbe able to get $9 billion in savings. But the President says, ``No, you \nhave got a couple of million dollars or so that I don't like and so we \nare going to throw the whole thing out.'' Leadership. Leadership.\n  In trying to solve the problem that is most pressing on the American \npublic's mind and one that is front and center to this U.S. Senate \nthese last 2 weeks when we are debating the budget resolution, where \nhas the President been on the budget resolution? Well, he did present \nhis budget earlier this year that called for $200 billion and $300 \nbillion deficits for as far as the eye can see, which last week was \nvoted down 99 to nothing, 99 to nothing. Hardly leadership, hardly \nvisionary on the part of the President to put forward a budget that \nsimply was a nonstarter on both sides of the aisle unanimously.\n  So where has he been? Where has the leadership been from the one \nFederal employee that we demand the most from? Nowhere.\n  And so I came to the floor last week and I said that I would be here \nevery day between now and the 1st of October when the new fiscal year \nstarts and remind Members of the Senate of the kind of leader we have \nin the White House when it comes to balancing our budget.\n  On Saturday, the President did not present a budget that brought this \ncountry into balance over the next 7 years. That was the third day that \nbefore the Senate was the balanced budget resolution. On Sunday, day \nfour, the President did not present a balanced budget resolution. And \ntoday, day five, the President did not present a balanced budget \nresolution.\n  It is incredulous to me that the President of the United States, who \nsaid during the balanced budget amendment debate, the amendment to the \nConstitution, that the we did not need a balanced budget amendment to \nmove forward and solve the deficit crisis that faces us; that all we \nneeded was our own resolve, our own resolve. This same President 2 \nyears ago during his budget debate, his first one, in 1993, when he \npassed a large tax increase and a few spending cuts along the way \nchallenged Republicans and said, ``Where is your plan? Where is your \nplan? Why don't you come up with something? Show us your specifics?'' \nHe said ``No hot air, show me where.'' Show me where.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, on March 3, 1995, during the \nbalanced budget debate said, ``And for those who say we do not need a \nconstitutional amendment to do the job''--that job being balancing the \nbudget--``I think it is all the more important that we demonstrate that \nwe can, that we are up to the task, that we can meet our \nresponsibilities to make it happen correctly, to make it happen in a \nway that was foreseen when we passed the law setting up the budget \nprocess.''\n  And what amendments have we seen? Are they amendments that have been \nbrought to the floor by the other side of the aisle the substitutes to \nshow us what their plan is to get to a balanced budget? No. Are they \nrearranging spending priorities to say we should cut from this area of \nGovernment and add to another area of Government in setting priorities? \nNo.\n  What are they? They are amendments to spend more money, to take the \nreserve account, which is theoretical on the part of the Congressional \nBudget Office, that only occurs if we, in fact, have a budget that \nbrings us to balance in 7 years. Then they give us a bonus of $170 \nbillion because they figure lower interest rates, more economic growth, \nand lower inflation.\n  So this bonus now, what do they want to do? Do they want to put it \ntoward the deficit? Do they want to give it back to you, the taxpayers, \nwho paid it in the first place? No. We want to spend it right away. We \ndo not want to wait until it accrues in the future. We want to spend it \nnow.\n  This is responsibility? This is demonstrating that we can, that we \nhave the resolve?\n  I suspect the American public has a hard time buying all of this--\ncertainly, I have a hard time buying all of this--that the President \nand his party are serious about making tough decisions; about having \nideas and vision as to where to take this country into a future that is \na fiscally sound future; about having innovative approaches like the \nSenator from Delaware, who does not just and has not, as chairman of \nthis committee, just proposed cuts in Federal employment. He proposes a \nperformance-based budget which puts managerial goals for Federal \nemployees to achieve, to give flexibility to managers, to make it more \nlike a private sector employment place, to give the kind of flexibility \nthat many Federal employees ask me, plead for me, to give.\n  So the Senator from Delaware is not just out here willy-nilly \nthrowing numbers around. He is putting forward responsible proposals \nthat have a vision as to where to take this country in the future. And \nyou will see, and have seen from this side of the aisle, such \nproposals, and you will see more.\n  So I commend the Senator from Delaware for his amendment. I wish him \nsuccess in that amendment. [[Page S7106]] \n  I hope that I do not have to be here tomorrow. I hope that I do not \nhave to be here with this chart. I hope the President has read the \npolls, seen the position he has taken is not one that is particularly \npopular with the American public and, more importantly, is not what is \nright for this country.\n  For this system to work, we need a healthy dialog and we need \nleadership from both sides for us to come up with this compromise and \nthe strategy to move us forward\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President I would like to respond to my colleague from \nPennsylvania briefly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wanted to ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, if he is \nhere tomorrow with his chart, will that fellow who puts the numbers up \nbe here with him in order to make this demonstration work? I am just \ncurious. Unfortunately, he left the floor once he got the number up. \nAnd I just wanted to know, if you are here tomorrow and you have to put \na number up, will that fellow come back so we can catch another glimpse \nof him, the one who puts the next number up.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. His wife and kids like to see him, too.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am glad to hear there is concern about his wife and \nkids, because I listened to this diatribe about the President, when we \nneeded to talk about a very serious matter affecting the rank and file \nof the Federal employees. So I am glad to see there is some \nsensitivity.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the ranking member for yielding such time.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Roth amendment to further reduce \nthe Federal work force beyond the quarter of a million that we have \nalready done under the Clinton reinventing Government framework.\n  I am concerned that we are engaging in a mass mania of who can rack \nup the biggest number. Every day there seems to be a bidding war on who \ncan escalate the numbers of Federal employees that need to be laid off \nin this so-called downsizing of Government.\n  But make no mistake, every time we raise the number beyond a \nreasonable and rational level that we can achieve through technological \ninnovation, we are not accomplishing downsizing; we are accomplishing \ndowngrading.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially says what it is that \nthe Senate wants to do. Well, I believe that we have already been on \nrecord to support reinventing Government as laid out by President Bill \nClinton and Vice President Al Gore, looking at the best available \nmanagement practices and technological innovation to reduce, in a \nrational way, the Federal work force.\n  What this says to 200,000 more Federal employees is we do not want \nyou to show up; we do not value you; we do not think you are needed; we \nthink your time is up and it is time for you to go.\n  Well, Mr. President, who is it that we do not want to show up? I want \nto talk about my own State of Maryland. I have the honor of \nrepresenting the National Institutes of Health, which are located in \nthe State of Maryland, and there are thousands of Federal employees \nworking there from research scientists to lab technicians to back-up \nsupport services to security personnel.\n  Now who are we saying not to show up at the National Institutes of \nHealth? Are we saying to that Nobel prize candidate who could have a \nbreakthrough in AIDS research, Don't bother to show up, we're \ndownsizing, we're going to technological innovation, we don't need your \nintellectual competency, we'll do a computer simulation?\n  What will we say in this decade of the brain research to those \nscientists working on Alzheimer's research which killed my father--\nAlzheimer's killed my father--and if we can find a cure for it it would \nsignificantly reduce the health care debt in this country. Are we \nsaying to NIH, Don't show up?\n  But let us not just stay around the State of Maryland. Let us go to \nthe Centers for Disease Control. We now know Ebola virus threatens \nZaire and could even possibly threaten the world.\n  We had a near outbreak in something called The Hot Zone in northern \nVirginia. If you read the book, you know what the story was. It was \nFederal employees at Fort Dietrick who were willing to risk their \nlives--willing to risk their lives--who were willing to go into the hot \nzone to kill the monkeys that carried this disease.\n  When you read the newspaper accounts--this is not Mikulski memos, \nthis is newspaper accounts--that talk about how skimpy the resources \nare at CDC and in infectious diseases, they are stretched so thin that \nthey are now afraid an accident could happen at the CDC exactly at the \nsame time when we are asking for their help. The world is asking for \ntheir help to come and take care of the Ebola virus.\n  Let us talk about other threats to the safety and security of the \nUnited States. Let us talk about our law enforcement. Who else are we \ntelling not to show up? Shall we say no more FBI agents, do not show \nup? Are we saying to the Secret Service, Well, you might be in the line \nof fire in one way, but we're going to put you in the line of fire in \nanother way. We are going to tell them not to show up?\n  We in Maryland were willing to take a Federal prison. There is a \nmedium-security prison right now in the Allegheny Mountains in the \ncommunity of Cumberland. We have a Federal prison for medium-security \nprisoners. Are we telling the prison guards that they are superfluous, \nwe are going to have better locks, better keys, maybe have chain gangs; \nwe do not need you?\n  Well, I want those prison workers there. I want the bums and thugs \noff the street. I supported life without parole legislation. I have \nsupported not only prevention programs but tough prison sentences. So \nare we going to tell the prison workers we do not want you; do not show \nup?\n  And then here we are now on the eve of celebrating victory in Europe, \nthe end of World War II, and what do we say to the GI Joe generation? \nOh, aren't taking your health care, but we are going to say no to the \ndoctors at VA; we are going to say we are going to shrink the nurses; \nwe are going to say we are going to shrink the lab technicians; we are \ngoing to say we do not need them. We are going to replace them with \nsomething called technological innovation.\n  We know we are going to downsize. We have already begun to do it. The \nPresident of the United States has not been AWOL on this issue. He has \nbeen in the forefront. He has charged the Vice President to do it, and \nwe have absolutely done it.\n  In Maryland, this downsizing will have devastating impacts on the \neconomy of Maryland but also on the morale of Maryland. Right now, \nthere is a morale crisis among Federal employees. They have essentially \nbeen told they are not needed, they are not valued, and now the bums \nand thugs in the world are even targeting them for violent attacks.\n  I do not think this is the United States of America. We are from the \ngeneration that when Jack Kennedy said ``Ask not what your country can \ndo for you, but what you can do for your country,'' we answered that \ncall. Many of the people in my generation saw public service as a noble \ncalling, a way to serve the United States of America to do good and \nearn a decent living. Now they feel that they are absolutely under \nattack.\n  I can tell you what is going to happen. You will not only downsize \nFederal employees, but, no smart, self-respecting person will want to \ncome to work for the Federal Government.\n  And who do you think is going to be in these Federal agencies? Do we \nnot want a Government at all? If we want to do that, well then let us \ndo that. Let us not go through this charade of downsizing, if you are \ngoing to have a Government and you believe that there are core \nfunctions that Government must perform, not only in national defense, \nbut on domestic security issues and the risks that the United States of \nAmerica faces--crime on the streets, drug dealing, punks that want to \nsabotage the United States of America, and we need law enforcement.\n  We are also plagued by another horseman of the apocalypse called \nplague and pestilence, and we want to [[Page S7107]] make sure that we \nhave the medical research and the staff at FDA and the Centers for \nDisease Control that are going to find the cures for disease and be \nable to work to contain pestilence around the world. We think that is \nimportant.\n  What are the other threats to the security of the United States of \nAmerica? It is a crisis of confidence. We should make sure that we have \na core set of values that encourage people, along with the values of \nduty, obligation, loyalty, patriotism.\n  If we treat our Federal employees this way, how are we going to call \nit forth? We are going to ask them to be loyal to us when we are not \nloyal to them, to have a sense of duty about the job they do when we do \nnot have a sense of obligation to them? I think this is a terrible \ncourse of action.\n  There is a logical, rational way to downsizing. I oversee as an \nappropriator 25 different agencies. We are already taking concrete \nsteps to be able to do it. I was the one that commissioned the study on \nthe National Association of Public Administrators, which is now being \nused as the framework to downsize HUD. I am not opposed to shrinking \nthe work force, but I am opposed to shirking our duties to our Federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, our Federal employees have served their country, they \nhave devoted themselves to public service, they deserve our gratitude \nand our support. We are already reducing by 272,000 positions. The Roth \namendment is not only going to result in downsizing but, as I said, in \ndowngrading. So I stand here to support those Federal employees and to \ndefend them who defend my health, my safety and my national security.\n  Mr. President, I hope we defeat the Roth amendment and, most of all, \nI hope we defeat the attitude that underlies the Roth amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the distinguished Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have, of course, been watching the \ndebate for the last few days and there is no question, this is a tough \ndebate. We are getting down to the decisions that are very difficult to \nmake. But I have been watching my colleagues with charts really since \nthis debate started last week. You see everybody's chart, and there are \nthe budget lines that go up and budget lines that go down. But now we \nare into making those tough decisions and saying, You know, everybody \nin America is going to disagree with something that we do. In fact, \nprobably every Member of the Senate is going to disagree with something \nwe do in this budget resolution. But, in fact, we have to make the \npriority choices. We have to go back to the basics and talk about what \nis the role of Federal Government.\n what must we do to set those priorities and then with the money that \nwe have left, we have to determine where we have to cut and where we \nneed to spend.\n\n  I think that Senator Roth has done a very responsible thing. He has \nproposed a sense of the Senate about what we would look for in ways to \nmeet these budget targets that we are going to be voting on for the \nnext few days--200,000 positions by 2002. That is over a 7-year period \nand is about 11 percent of the work force. Now, if we make the budget \ncuts that we are talking about making over the next 7 years to get to \nthat magic number in the year 2002, we are going to have to cut. We are \ngoing to have to cut the size of Government, and that means that we \nwill have to downsize departments.\n  I remember when I first got here about 2 years ago, I introduced an \namendment to cut the legislative branch budget by 7 percent. Mr. \nPresident, you should have heard the debate. People came running on the \nfloor and they said we might have to shut the Library of Congress. We \nmight have to shut the Washington Monument. You know, we always have \nour priorities and we decide what is important in those priorities. Of \ncourse, shutting the Library of Congress would not have been an option. \nBut we heard the sky-is-falling-theories all over the place. I lost on \nthat amendment by about two votes. Do you know what happened? After all \nthe sky is falling and after losing that amendment 2 years ago, guess \nwhat? This year, we come in and we have cut our legislative branch \nbudget about 15 percent. Is the sky falling? I do not think so. Are we \nmaking do with less? Yes. Are we doing the responsible business of our \nGovernment? Yes. And I do not think one person in America has written \nme a letter saying you cut your legislative branch budget 15 percent \nand I miss that money. Not one person.\n  So I think that Senator Roth is trying to do the responsible thing. \nHe has come in and he has said we are going to have to have an 11 \npercent cut. Well, if we are going to cut the budget for the next 7 \nyears in the places where we can, if we are going to stop the growth in \nincreases in our budget, of course, we are going to have fewer \nemployees. And I think it is very important that we establish a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution so that we can have the parameters we need \nwhen we start making these tough decisions.\n  You know, the people of America have been looking at the debate for \nthe last few weeks in the House, and the last few days on the Senate \nside, and I think the people of America are really beginning to see the \ndifferences between the two parties and the way we come at the problems \nof Government. And I think the people of America are going to be able \nto make a decision about what is right. And I think they are seeing all \nthe smoke and that there is a group of Senators that really wants to do \nwhat we said we were going to do. I was elected in 1994 and I did \npromise that I would do everything in my power to have a balanced \nbudget for the future of our country. I am going to do everything in my \npower to keep that promise. That is something the American people have \nnot had for so long--politicians who make a promise and lo and behold, \nkeep it. They are going to keep their promises this time, and that is \nnew. We have seen politicians from both parties--this is not in any way \npartisan --come in and they make promises and then the election is held \nand they go about the business of Government, business as usual, just \nlike it has always been. Not this year. This year is going to be \ndifferent. We are going to pass a balanced budget resolution. We are \ngoing to take the tough steps. And even if we disagree on this part of \nit or that part of it, I think enough Senators are going to take the \nresponsible step and say my part may not be so important that I would \nhold up the progress of this Senate for the future of America. That is \nthe parameter we are going to have to put around that final vote.\n  Is it more important that we get every single thing we want, just the \nway we want it, or is it more important for us to say in the long-term, \nthe most important vote we will ever take is to start that long march \ntoward a balanced budget for the future of this country.\n  This is a historic moment; it is a historic debate and we do have the \nopportunity to do what is right for America.\n  So I appreciate my colleague, Senator Roth, and my colleague Senator \nDomenici for working so hard, for so many years to try to make this \nhappen. I appreciate the input that we are having on this floor. But I \nhope that in the end, when all of us, Democrats and Republicans, have \nhad our say, maybe we have won a few, maybe we are going to lose a few; \nbut when it all comes down to that last vote, the people of America are \ngoing to have the ability to judge which politicians are keeping their \nword and which of us are ready to take that historic step, change the \nway Washington does business and start balancing that budget.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is going to be one of those first \nsteps. We will see a lot more over the next few days. But on Wednesday, \nI hope we will be ready to do the right thing for America.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes. Senator Roth has \n29 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to respond very briefly to \nsome of [[Page S7108]] the remarks made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania that did not address directly the proposal of this sense \nof the Senate resolution by my distinguished colleague from Delaware. \nHe talked about the President of the United States and what he has \ndone. I would like to go back a little and take a few minutes to \ndescribe what actually has happened over the past 15 years or so. We \ncame out of the Carter years, and President Carter, during his time in \noffice, I think, did a lot of fine things, foreign policy and so on. \nOne thing that did not occur is a real close control of the economy. We \nhit a time period where there was 21 percent interest rates and 17 \npercent inflation rates. I think that contributed a lot to President \nReagan being elected when he was. What happened? A lot of people were \nscared and President Reagan proposed the supply side economics and the \nbudget cuts, and we reduced taxes here by 25 percent over a 3-year \nperiod--over a 3-year period, 5 percent the first year, 10 percent each \nof the next 2 years. This was supposed to stimulate the economy so much \nthat it was going to result in such a new level of business activity \nand consumer confidence that we were going to see the new business \nlevel raised to such a point that there was going to be more than \nenough revenue to make up what had been left and we were going to move \non to a new higher level.\n  Now, what happened? That did not occur. Most voted for that, but some \nwith the idea after trying to get it down to 15 percent reduction and \ntrying to make several changes, finally voted for it because we had \nbeen scared, too, about what had happened before. We voted for it with \nthe idea that we would try to come back and change it if it did not \nwork.\n  Now, what happened? Over the next 12 years, we saw an additional $3.6 \ntrillion in debt pile up as supply-side economics did not work. Then we \ncame into the time period where Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was placed out \nhere. That did not do the job. Then we came to the election of \nPresident Clinton. President Clinton said privately as well as publicly \nthat the first thing we had to do was get control of the economy.\n  What did he do? He proposed a way of getting control of the economy \nthat he sent the Congress and we farmed it out here on the Democratic \nside, farmed it out to the committees, with targets to hit, targets to \ntry to meet the efforts to balance the budget that President Clinton \nproposed.\n  Now, we passed that reconciliation bill in the summer of 1993. I \nthink we need to look at what happened on that. Now, President Clinton \nwas honest enough that he said I will not promise people a lot of tax \ncuts back then. No. What he said was we will cut as many programs as we \ncan and we will increase taxes. Much has been made of that since then. \nWe will increase taxes--what, on the top 1.2 percent income people of \nthe country, not the middle-income people, not the poor folks of the \ncountry. He is going to increase taxes on the top income people of the \ncountry, the top 1.2 percent. That is where half of that budget \nbalancing effort came from.\n  Now, what happened? After all the dire predictions here on the Senate \nfloor about all the unemployment this would cause if we passed that \nPresident Clinton proposal--there would be millions unemployed was one \nof the statements here on the floor.\n  What happened? Well, I can say at that time when we passed that \nbudget reconciliation bill, we passed it without one single Republican \nvote in either the House or the Senate. Not one single vote. Not a one. \nAnd it was a moment of high drama here in the Senate when the vote was \ntied 50-50, and the Vice President broke the tie and cast a winning \nvote.\n  What happened? At that time the budget deficit was running right at \n$300 billion a year. As a result of that reconciliation effort in the \nsummer of 1993, last year the budget deficit was down do $246 billion. \nThis year, it is $192 billion. It is the first time since Harry Truman \nthat the budget deficit has gone down 3 years in a row--the first time \nsince Harry Truman.\n  I say one-half of it was reduction in programs and one-half was the \ntax on the top 1.2 percent income people of the country.\n  Now, that is real leadership. We can have all the derogatory signs \nput up on the Senate floor that deride the President and make light of \nthe President if we want to. That is what actually occurred for the \nfirst time since Harry Truman. Three years in a row, the budget deficit \nhas gone down as a result of President Clinton's policies.\n  What we should be debating is how we keep that going, how we keep it \ngoing down incrementally, rather than some of the schemes that are \nbeing proposed. Some of the proposals out of the House here make \nassumptions on how we can balance the budget now, make assumptions that \nI cannot go along with.\n  Medicare. We say we will take $87 million out of Medicare over the \nnext 7 years, meaning we assume that it will not grow at the 9 percent \nit is growing now, that it goes down to 3 percent to 4 percent in \ngrowth.\n  We are saying that we will assume that doctors and hospitals will not \nbe allowed to make as much as they can. They will be kept below \ninflation rate, as a matter of fact, and we will limit the fees for \ndoctors and hospitals.\n  Those assumptions are made. We make assumptions for HMO savings. That \nis how we get $87 billion proposed. Some of the assumptions, I think, \nare false. We have to depend on a CPI adjustment downward from where it \nis now. We have to assume that the average inflation will not go above \n2.5 percent. We have to say there will be no inflation increase in \nadministrative costs, and that will save 22 percent in that area. These \nare assumptions that really are not very realistic when we get into it.\n  Back to the President's proposal. Now, what happened out of that \nreconciliation bill we passed in the summer of 1993? Since then, we \nhave had the lowest unemployment in 4 years. In cutting back on the \nsize of the Government, the administration has cut over 300 programs \nout of Government.\n  They set a goal of cutting 272,900 people out of civil service by the \nend of the administration's term. They are well ahead of schedule. They \nhave 108,000 actually cut up to now and think they will be able to meet \nthe whole 272,900 target by the end of this year. When that occurs, \nthere will be the lowest Federal employment overall since John F. \nKennedy was President, the lowest Government employment since John F. \nKennedy was the President.\n  Now, along with that, last year we passed a crime bill, a very major \nbill. I know there will be efforts to override some of it this year. \nThat was a major effort. We passed the GATT legislation, General \nAgreement on Tariff and Trade. That is a mighty big step forward in \nrecognizing we no longer could be an isolationist nation if we wanted \nto be in this country, because most of our trade, in fact, about one \nout of every eight manufacturing jobs in the whole country, and it is \ncertainly true in my State of Ohio, works to make a product that gets \nexported.\n  We can no longer be an isolationist America. We have moved into the \nworld. And the GATT agreement, with its readjustments being required, \nindicate our willingness to move into that international world.\n  We passed a family leave bill. We passed a Head Start bill in the \nfirst 2 years of this administration that helps over 200,000 kids get a \nfair start in school. We passed the national service bill. We passed a \ncollege loan bill that over the period of 5 years will let an \nadditional 20 million young people go to school.\n  Now, all of these are things that were passed in the first 2 years of \nthis administration in spite of all of the things that are said about \nthis administration on the other side of the aisle.\n  Do Members know what Time magazine said last October? They printed a \nchart showing what agenda--announced agenda--had been passed by each of \nour past Presidents. They pointed out that President Bill Clinton had \nthe best record of getting his agenda through in the first 2 years of \nCongress of any President since Lyndon Baines Johnson, and before that \ngoing clear back to Eisenhower.\n  Now, I think that is a remarkable record. It is one I am proud to \nsupport the President on. When I hear all these derogatory remarks \nabout the President and what is going on and signs up here on the \nSenate floor that are meant to be derogatory, then I just have to take \nexception to that.\n  Now, back to our current sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is up \nnow. [[Page S7109]] This administration has already cut 108,000 jobs \nout of the Federal work force, and done it in a responsible manner, \ndone it in a way that helps correct the imbalance between the higher GS \nratings and the lower GS ratings, through the buyout legislation that \nwe passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I know that a sense of the Senate that would just arbitrarily add \nanother 200,000 to it is not binding, but it certainly sets the course. \nI do not know how we would meet that. I would rather ask OPM do another \nstudy, a follow on and see where we can do this, and do it responsibly \nrather than just setting what I view as a goal that might result in \nsome real harm being done to our Government.\n  If we want to do the thing that we should do, what we do is define \nthe role we want Government to have in all these different areas or \ndifferent departments or agencies. If we are eliminating the agency, \nfine, eliminate it. But rather than just pick an arbitrary figure, we \nwill have OPM study the Government again, each agency, department by \ndepartment, agency by agency, and decide how many they think can be \ncut, and do this responsibly and target those departments where we have \ntoo big an imbalance yet.\n That is the way the figure of 272,900 was arrived at. It was not a \nfigure off the top of somebody's head. It was a figure arrived at by \nstudy, by canvassing the agencies, by holding their feet to the fire on \nwhat they could do or not do. I think that is what we should be doing \nfor the future.\n\n  I hate to have to oppose my colleague from Delaware but I do. I think \nto pass this Sense-of-the-Senate would indicate a wrong direction for \nus to be taking.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator has 10 minutes and 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair. I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to talk about some of the \nthings that were just said by my distinguished colleague from Ohio. I \nwould like to talk about the tax increase that he mentioned that was \npassed without one Republican vote in 1993, because I do think there \nwas a difference of opinion that became very clear when the Democrats \npassed the largest tax increase in the history of America without one \nRepublican vote. It was described as a tax on the rich, but I do not \nthink Social Security recipients making $34,000 a year or couples \nmaking $44,000 a year are rich people. That is middle income. And the \ntaxes were raised on those people.\n  I do not think that was the way to start the process of getting to a \nbalanced budget. In fact, the President's budget that has been sent to \nus does not balance the budget. The President gave up on balancing the \nbudget. He left it to us to do it. He left us the responsibility.\n  In fact the deficits are lower in the last 2 years but the reason the \ndeficits are lower is because we have financed our debt with short-term \nborrowings. We are in fact in one of the weakest recoveries from a \nrecession that we have ever had. We should be in a booming economy and \nwe are not in a booming economy. We are in a relatively flat economy. \nIt is going up a little. The deficit is coming down a little. But we \nare going to have to pay the price. We are going to have to pay the \nprice for short-term borrowing to finance that debt. That was a bad \ndecision and we will have to pay for that later. If interest rates go \nup there is no question that the deficit is going to rise when we have \nto refinance that debt.\n  This is all going to become very clear when we have to raise the debt \nceiling toward the end of the summer, this year. That is going to be \nthe scary thing. We have $5 trillion in debt in this country. That is \nnot a small amount.\n  The debate we are having today is for the future of our country. We \ncannot continue to raise that debt ceiling without taking care of that \nlong-term debt situation. So I think it is very important that we keep \nour eye on the ball here. We cannot continue to raise taxes to try to \nbring the deficit down. We cannot do short-term financing on that long-\nterm debt, because the price will go up.\n  Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told us \nwhat would happen if we balanced the budget and if Congress shows it \nhas the will to balance the budget. That is when we will see our \neconomy take off. That is when the investors in our country will know \nthat they are making a good and wise investment for the long term.\n  We will be able to see our economy take off. We will be able to see \nthe deficit come down, if we take the steps to balance the budget. I \njust hope my colleagues, like the Senator from Ohio and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, will help us when that final vote is taken. It is going \nto be tough. Senator Roth is giving us a tough choice. But we are going \nto stand up and we are going to do it and I hope it will be a \nbipartisan effort in the end, because we are going to do it without \nincreasing taxes and that is the distinction between the philosophy of \nthe President, who gave us a budget that is not balanced, and the \nRepublican majority in Congress that is going to give a balanced budget \nto the people of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielded 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not come on the floor with any \nwell-rehearsed speech. But it does seem to me that, once again, we are \nnot actually debating whether or not there ought to be deficit \nreduction. We are also not debating whether or not anybody is in favor \nof the debt that we built up in this country.\n  As a matter of fact, I could make my own analysis about what happened \nstarting with what was euphemistically called the Economic Recovery \nAct, passed in 1981, pushed by President Reagan, which eroded the \nrevenue base of this country about $700 billion over 5, 6, 7 years; \nplus an unprecedented buildup in the Pentagon budget.\n  I find it interesting that by and large we still have not heard very \nmuch discussion about all the subsidies that go for oil companies; all \nthe subsidies that go for tobacco companies; all the subsidies that go \nfor pharmaceutical companies; all the subsidies that go to some of the \nlargest corporations and financial institutions in America. But we have \nbeen talking about cuts in nutrition programs and financial aid for \nhigher education. We did not have much time to debate that on the floor \nthis afternoon. And, I think, draconian cuts--draconian cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid. I do not have the time and I do not have the \ndata right now to go into those arguments in great detail.\n  But I will say to my colleagues that when I presented this this \nmorning on policy grounds, I did not hear any rebuttal. So in terms of \n``we have to do all of this,'' let us not be so generous with other \npeople's suffering. Let us make sure we do it in a responsible way.\n  The reason I support my colleague from Ohio is that I consider this \nto be bashing. I mean, 200,000 additional positions eliminated--by what \nagency? What job? What position? A description of those positions? Who \nare we going to do it to? What positions are we eliminating?\n  It is very easy to just say eliminate 200,000 positions. I would like \nto know: Where? Where do these men and women work? For what agencies? \nIs it the National Institutes of Health? Or is it going to be some of \nthe other Federal agencies?\n  Where are you eliminating these positions?\n  It seems to me it is not responsible unless the Congress approves in \nadvance exactly what agency, what positions, what descriptions, what \nmen and women, whose positions are you eliminating?\n  Colleagues stand up on the floor and they say ``Oh, these decisions \nare so difficult. We have to make difficult decisions.'' Easy if it is \nnot our job. Very easy. We have to make these difficult decisions. \n[[Page S7110]] \n  Sometimes I think we get a little bit too generous with the suffering \nof other people. Before I would vote for such an amendment I would want \nto know exactly which people we are talking about. Let us just get \nconcrete. What agency? What descriptions? Which Federal employees? \nProviding what kind of work in this country? For whom? Let us have a \ndiscussion of that. I think in the absence of that kind of specificity \nthis is a profoundly mistaken amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 67 minutes and 32 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Delaware has 24 minutes and 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may take.\n  Mr. President, I was surprised to once again hear the attack on the \nReagan years. I recall during the Carter administration when we had \ndouble-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation, the misery index, \nwhich was based upon unemployment and inflation, was never higher, and \nunemployment was as high as it has been in recent years. But after the \ntax cut in the Reagan administration, we enjoyed the longest peacetime \ngrowth period in the history of this country.\n  Mr. FORD. And the largest debt.\n  Mr. ROTH. I hear someone talk about the largest debt.\n  But let me point out that Congress, part of Congress, was Democratic, \nthe House of Representatives. And I would say that the problem there \nwas that, yes, the President was trying to build up defense but the \nother party was trying to build up social spending. Unfortunately, the \ncompromise was by increasing spending everywhere. So both Democrats and \nRepublicans can take a partial credit for the increase in the debt. \nThat was not just the act of the administration.\n  But what we are talking about today is trying to make Government \nsmaller, Government less obtrusive, and Government more efficient.\n  There is no question that but what modern technology has made it \npossible for Government, as well as the private sector, to do more with \nless.\n  What we are proposing today in the way of reductions in personnel are \nnot just figures drawn out of the air, but based primarily on the \nproposals in the Domenici budget. What we are proposing in the way of \nreduction in employment, first of all, is a 50,000 reduction in FTE \nsavings below the current FTE caps. And the GAO figures show that is a \nreality.\n  With the elimination of the Department of Commerce we expect a \nreduction of 30,000 in FTE, HUD, 20,000, and the Department of Defense, \n50,000.\n  Let me point out that the administration has made significant \nreductions in the DOD. But basically most of the reductions are in \nDefense Department, and not in the other civilian agencies. As a matter \nof fact, defense military functions will be reduced something like \n208,000 under 272,000.\n  What we are proposing in our reduction of 200,000 is that most of \nthese reductions will come from the civilian agencies, limiting the \nreduction in the Department of Defense to 50,000. Currently, in the \nacquisition of military systems there is something like 17 to 20 levels \nof bureaucracy. This bureaucracy does not add value or expedite the \nacquisition of new weapons. Instead, it takes about twice as long in \nthe military area to go from an idea to fielding a weapon as it does in \nthe private sector to go from an idea to selling a product in the \nmarket.\n  What we are seeking here is a reduction of personnel that is based on \nthose programs and departments that would be reduced or eliminated \nunder the Domenici budget.\n  Just let me point out that for the fiscal year 1996 the chairman's \nmark lists something like 150 different programs that are going to be \neliminated. And obviously, when you eliminate programs, you do not need \nthe personnel that you otherwise have. So that is where we are \nproposing these reductions. By doing this, we expect better service to \nbe given the American people.\n  Let me point out that one of our concerns is that we want to make the \nFederal Government a desirable place in which to work. And, \nunfortunately, anyone who has discussed the matter with people in the \nexecutive branch will tell you the frustration, the inability to move \nforward because of the process that has been built up over recent \nyears. And that is what we are trying to eliminate today. Hopefully, by \nreducing the size of Government, and by changing the personnel \npolicies, the Federal work force will find this a better place in which \nto work because what we are proposing as changes is that individuals \nwho perform in the executive branch will be rewarded for their \naccomplishments. They will also be penalized if they do not perform.\n  My distinguished colleague and friend from Ohio said that we proposed \nto do away with a military system, if it were 10 percent off the \nproposed goal. In other words, if the cost of the system was 10 percent \nhigher than schedule, or if the time was 10 percent longer, the system \nwould be canceled. That is not what I have proposed.\n  To the contrary, what we are proposing is that, in order to get a \nbonus, an employee would have to perform 10 percent better than the \ngoal set as the acquisition of the weapons system, or, on the other \nhand, if it is 10 percent more expensive, the schedule is 10 percent \nbehind, then the employee can be penalized. But we would only revoke \nthe system if it were 50 percent off course, and hopefully those \nopportunities would not present themselves too often.\n  But again, let me spell out what we are proposing in this amendment. \nOur amendment expresses the sense of the Senate to reduce the number of \nGovernmentwide, full-time equivalent positions over the next 7 years. \nAnd it provides for a reduction of 200,000 positions by 2002 in \naddition to the already enacted reduction of 272,900 FTE's by 1999 in \nthe 1994 Federal Work Force Restructuring Act.\n  Not more than 50,000 of the reductions may be within the Department \nof Defense. As I have already indicated, of the reductions that have \nalready been made by this administration, the vast majority have \nalready been in the Defense Department. And our program is consistent \nwith the Domenici budget to streamline and eliminate several Government \nfunctions and programs.\n  It is also consistent with the Roth-Kasich Defense Department \nacquisition reform bill to reduce the number of acquisition personnel. \nThis reform bill would produce savings of 42,000 in FTE's with \nDepartment of Defense. Current FTE reductions to comply with the 1994 \nFederal Work Force Reduction Act of 272,900 are proceeding as planned.\n  And it has been further estimated by OMB that the total civilian work \nforce will be approximately 25,000 below the existing FTE cap for 1995 \nand 1996. Current projections show that 208,000 of the mandated 272,000 \nFTE reductions will be within the Department of Defense, and this \namendment will help to achieve the originally intended balance to \nfurther downsize the non-defense-related agencies as well.\n  So in conclusion, just let me point out, Mr. President, that what we \nare proposing is based upon the Domenici budget. We are eliminating 150 \ndifferent programs and activities. We are going to be reducing the size \nof departments, if not the department itself, and the number of \npositions that we are eliminating reflect those changes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 6 minutes 27 \nseconds, the Senator from Delaware has 12 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici \nbudget. As I have said on the Senate floor before, I strongly believe \nthat this represents a solid blueprint that finally will lead this \ngovernment to a balanced budget.\n  It has been a very strange sequence of events here in the Senate when \nwe [[Page S7111]] saw the entire Senate reject the President's budget. \nI would certainly welcome a debate on the President's budget, but the \nmembers of his own party voted his budget down. Thus, the only budget \nthat is before us is the Domenici budget.\n  Overall, this budget is a solid, responsible plan, and takes an \nacross-the-board approach to achieve balance. Without this kind of bold \nplan, we will be facing bankruptcy, both in terms of the Federal \ndeficit and in terms of Medicare. The liberals may be criticizing this \nbudget, but where is their budget?\n  Insofar as agriculture is concerned, I think many of us have said \nthat we will take an across-the-board approach, and I think this budget \ndoes that. There will be efforts, and perhaps I will join them, to make \nsome minor changes in the Domenici budget, but overall it represents a \npath or a guidepost to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, recently our dollar has been doing very poorly. We \nhave an unstable dollar. It is because of our huge Federal deficit. We \nhave reports that Medicare will go bankrupt by the year 2002. I would \nrather give senior citizens a stable, sound dollar and a secure \nMedicare than to continue going on year after year without taking some \naction. It is time that we take sound action in this Chamber, and this \nrepresents that opportunity.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend Senator Domenici and the Budget \nCommittee for their leadership and its hard work. I know there may be \nsome changes in that document this week. But I would say to the \nliberals who are criticizing it to bring forward a complete budget of \ntheir own. Indeed, the Democrats on the other side of the aisle voted \ndown the President's budget entirely. Where is their plan?\n  The Senate Republicans have a plan. It is a solid plan for the \nAmerican people. I believe that we are on the right path.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, it \nwill be deducted equally from each side.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as I have remaining to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it has been an interesting experience \ntoday to listen to the debate about balancing the budget. It is a \nlittle bit surprising, as a matter of fact, I suppose, that there is a \ngreat deal of debate about balancing the budget. It is legitimate to \nhave differences of view as to exactly how that is done, but the fact \nis that we have to do something to be fiscally and financially \nresponsible.\n  I am encouraged, frankly, by the chance to do something. For the \nfirst time in three decades we have a chance to balance the budget. And \nI suppose, when we think about that, my goodness, that is \nirresponsible. How can that be? But it is a fact. We have gone all this \ntime with no balanced budget.\n  So I am encouraged by the opportunity. I am encouraged by the fact \nthat voters said to us clearly a few months ago that Government is too \nbig and it costs too much and it is time you do something about that. \nAnd I think a measure of good Government is the responsiveness we have \nto doing something about it.\n  So I am encouraged by the fact that we have this opportunity. I know \nthere are differences. There are some here who really believe that \nbalancing the budget is not important, that it is just a matter of \ndollars, it does not really matter.\n  Let me suggest to you that I think it is terribly important for some \nvery concrete reasons, such as the fact that it takes money out of the \neconomy to finance this deficit, maybe more to the point that the \ninterest on the debt will soon be the largest single line item in the \nbudget, larger than the total budget was just a couple of decades ago. \nIt is important.\n  There are those that believe that more spending through the \nGovernment is a better way to do it; that, in fact, Government spends \nmoney better than you and I do in our families. That is a legitimate \nview, I suppose.\n  There are those who think we are better off with more Government and \nmore spending. I do not happen to agree with that, nor do most of us on \nthis side agree with that. We believe that we have to balance the \nbudget, that it is the responsible thing to do, and we have an \nopportunity to do it.\n  I hear everybody who stands up starts out by saying, ``We have to \nbalance the budget. I know we are going to balance the budget, I want \nto balance the budget,'' and then goes on to point out the reasons why \nit cannot be done.\n  We heard the same thing about the balanced budget amendment. ``Well, \nI wanted to balance the budget but we do not need to do this, we can do \nit by just making the hard decisions.'' Well, now is the time to make \nsome hard decisions. What we have is each time we come up with another \namendment, we hear arguments that you cannot do it. It is time to make \nthe tough decisions.\n  I suspect this is the kind of conversation that has gone on for \ndecades here, and that is why we have not done it, and that has been \nthe history of what we have to do. We clearly have to do something \nabout Medicare. It is not an option unless you simply do not want to \nhave a program to provide health care for the elderly. Do nothing, as \nis the proposal from that side, and the program goes into reserves in 2 \nyears, goes broke in 7 years, no question about that.\n  Or, in fact, we can take the approach that has been taken and say, \n``Let's raise taxes.'' In order to balance the budget without doing \nsomething about spending, we would have to raise taxes by $950 billion \nin 7 years. How is that as an option? I do not think many people would \nchoose it. And yet we cannot seem to say, ``Yes, we can make cuts, not \ndraconian cuts but to reduce the spending from 5 percent a year to 3.'' \nThat is hardly asking too much, and voters are asking that of us.\n  So, Mr. President, it is interesting as we go forward that we always \nhear, ``Well, we have to balance the budget, I want to balance the \nbudget, but we cannot do that to balance the budget, we can't do this \nto balance the budget.'' What can we do to balance the budget? There is \nno plan on that side. The President has no plan.\n  So despite that, Mr. President, I am very optimistic that we will for \nthe first time in my legislative experience, for the first time I guess \nin my political experience, have a genuine, legitimate, bona fide \neffort to balance the budget to cause the Government to be a little \nsmaller, a little less expensive.\n  Give us the opportunity to choose some options, to look at programs \nand make sure that they are efficient and effective and, in fact, that \nthey are legitimate, that they need to be done, and we can do that. We \ncan do that. No one argues with that concept. Unfortunately, it does \nnot happen. We find a million excuses why we cannot do that, why we \ncannot cut it here, why we cannot slow growth. Why we really should not \ntake a look at why the program cannot be changed, to be more efficient, \nthe delivery of programs cannot be done more efficiently.\n  I do go away from the last 3 or 4 days of this debate, again \noptimistic that we will do something that has not been done for a very \nlong time, and that is lay before the American people a plan to balance \nthe budget in 7 years, and we can do it.\n  The committee has laid out a plan. Of course, it is not perfect. Does \nit take some pain? Of course it takes some pain. It always takes some \npain to recoup when you find yourself in this kind of a financial \nproblem--$5 trillion in debt, taxes at the rate of about $21,000 per \nhousehold, to pay the interest on the debt costs $5,000 for each \nhousehold each year.\n  That is where we are, Mr. President. So we do not really have a \nchoice as to whether we do something. The fact is we need to do it. We \nhave to do it. We can have legitimate debate about options but not a \nlegitimate debate about just saying, ``No, no, can't do it,'' and that \nis what we hear.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, because there have been general \nstatements about the budget tonight in addition to the statement about \nthe [[Page S7112]] amendment that is pending before us, I just want to \nunderscore this point. The budget resolution that is before us takes \n$175 billion, which the CBO has put out there as a pot to be available \nat the end, and commits it for tax cuts.\n  Now the amendments that have been offered today on Medicare and on \neducation have said rather than committing that money to tax cuts, you \nshould make a less draconian cut in Medicare and education. You should \nnot come down with such heavy force on our senior citizens or on our \nyoung people seeking an education, and that, as a matter of national \npriorities, we should place ahead of a tax cut, which in the House-\npassed legislation is overwhelmingly committed to the very wealthy, the \npeople at the very top of the income scale, overwhelmingly so \ncommitted.\n  These amendments, in effect, are saying that instead of a tax cut \nthat has that impact, we should make less draconian cuts in Medicare \nand in education. As a matter of national priorities, educating the \nnext generation and preparing them for the 21st century and assuring \nthat our young people's capacities are developed to the fullest extent \npossible should put that ahead of taking this pot of money and \ncommitting it to tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield him another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So there is a very important question of priorities \nthat is at issue here, and the same is true with respect to each of the \nmeasures being taken in order to bring about this drastic reduction.\n  It is one thing to deal with a matter in a reasonable way, it is \nanother thing to deal with it in an extreme way. I submit that much of \nwhat is in the budget resolution is extreme, and it is particularly \nextreme when it is seen that the purpose of it is to create this pot of \nmoney to be committed to tax cuts which, as I said, in the House-passed \nbill overwhelmingly committed to the people at the upper end of the \nincome scale. In order to achieve this, our senior citizens receiving \nMedicare are being subjected to incredible cuts, and our young people \nseeking an education are going to find that their opportunities are \nbeing frustrated and may be perhaps even denied to them.\n  So that is an issue that is put and it is put very clearly by the \nresolution that is before us and by the amendments which have been \nproposed to the resolution. I have supported those amendments because I \nthink they represent a better balance in terms of what our national \npriorities are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has now \nexpired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 51 seconds and the \nSenator from Delaware 43 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 33 seconds. The \nSenator from Ohio has 41 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am waiting for the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. Let me indicate while he is on his way to the floor \nthat I want very much to accommodate the Democrats tomorrow evening. \nBut we will complete at least 10 hours on the resolution tomorrow. We \nare going to have two or three votes. We tried to get credit for that. \nWe cannot get that. So I just suggest that we will have to stay here \nbeyond 6:30, probably, to get the 10 hours--maybe 7 o'clock. We will \ntry to accommodate our colleagues in every way possible.\n  As I understand, we will be working through the policy lunch period \ntomorrow, and so if there are no amendments, I assume there will be a \nquorum call so the clock will run against the resolution.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to complete action on this resolution by \nearly Wednesday afternoon, I yield back 3 hours and 51 minutes of the \nmajority side time for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has that right.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, if I can inquire of the \nchair, does this not mean there are 14 hours for total debate \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \npending amendment.\n  This amendment again poses the central question in this budget \ndebate: Whose side are you on?\n  In this case, the issue is whether the Senate will side with \nordinary, middle-class families who are trying to ensure a decent \neducation for their kids. Or whether we will again side with the \nwealthy, by preserving the slush fund that will be used to provide them \nwith lavish tax breaks.\n  I have heard Senators from the other side of the aisle say that this \nbudget is for our children and grandchildren. They say it is for their \nfuture.\n  Yet if Republicans really are concerned about our children, why are \nthey proposing the biggest cut in education in the history of the \nUnited States? Let me repeat: This budget contains the largest cut in \neducation in the history of this country.\n  Is that their idea of helping our children?\n  This budget resolution cuts education for young people from pre-\nschool to graduate school. These cuts will affect all students. From 3 \nyear olds who are learning fingerpainting, to graduate students \nstudying business administration. No young person will be spared.\n  The Republican budget cuts the Federal investment in education by 33 \npercent by the year 2002. This figure comes from CBO, not from the \nDemocrats on the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you the impact that this will have on our \nyoung people. Let us go chronologically.\n  First, let us start with the preschoolers. The discretionary cuts in \nthis budget mean that 350,000 to 550,000 preschoolers will not be able \nto get into a Head Start Program.\n  Second, let us take a look at what will happen to those children from \nkindergarten through 12th grade. The Republican budget will: Cut funds \nfor math and reading for 2 million children. It will cut $1 billion for \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools Programs. It will cut $5 billion for \nspecial education for almost 6 million children with disabilities. It \nwill cut assistance for school to work programs that help students who \ndon't go to college to acquire skills and obtain meaningful employment.\n  Regrettably, the education cuts do not end at the 12th grade. These \ncuts will also hurt those young people who want to get a college \neducation.\n  The Republican budget also makes deep cuts in the student loan \nprograms and Pell grants. These programs help young people attend the \ncollege of their choice. They help them obtain skills to get a foothold \nin our economy. They help them live out the American dream, just like \nthe GI bill did for me and other Members of this body.\n  The student loan program is not a welfare program for poor children. \nIt is for all low and middle income Americans. In fact, 50 percent of \nall college students receive Federal financial assistance.\n  Middle class families need this assistance because college tuition \nhas gone through the roof. Tuition, room and board at a private college \nnow costs approximately $25,000 per year. If you think I am kidding, \nlet me give you some examples of these costs. These include tuition, \nroom and board: Brown University--$26,000; Dartmouth College--$24,000; \nGeorgetown--$24,500; Harvard--$25,000; Yale--$25,000.\n  Mr. President, if you think you can avoid paying such costs by \nsending your child to a quality State university--think again. Tuition, \nroom and board for non-residents at many State schools also are \nstaggering. Consider two examples: University of Michigan--$16,000; \nUniversity of California Berkeley--$20,000.\n  It is very difficult for American families to afford this type of \ntuition without borrowing money. The proposed Republican deferral of \ninterest will cost these students and their families another $3,000 to \n$5,000 on top of the thousands of dollars they now \nspend. [[Page S7113]] \n  Members of the other side of the aisle have talked a lot about \nbalancing the budget so that the young people of this country will not \nbe burdened by the national debt. Well, if we pass this Republican \nbudget they will be saddled with more debt. They will be punished for \ntrying to get ahead. Punished for getting a college education. This is \nsimply wrong.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment. Stop the tax cuts for the \nrich and restore these harmful cuts in education.\n                        opposing education cuts\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Democratic \nresponse for funding education and to speak in opposition to the \neducation cuts that are assumed in the Republican budget plan. The \nresolution reported by the Budget Committee calls for $97 billion in \neducation cutbacks over 7 years, a 33-percent reduction from current \nservice levels.\n  This adverse disregard for our most important long-term asset--the \nknowledge and skills of our emerging and future workforce--illustrates \nthe failure of the Republican agenda.\n  It reveals that Republicans are willing to destroy the single most \nimportant factor that will determine the success of our Nation's future \neconomic viability--educational opportunity.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that their package \nof spending cuts and tax changes is proof that they are serious about \neliminating the deficit. I welcome this expression of fiscal \nresponsibility, if it is genuine; I only wish we heard such oratory in \nthe Reagan-Bush years, when supplyside, trickle-down policies created \nthe fiscal debt we find ourselves in today.\n  But the fact that my colleagues are pondering a massive tax cut for \nthe wealthy at the same time they are proposing massive reductions in \nsocial expenditures reveals more about the majority's priorities than \ntheir newfound demands for fiscal responsibility.\n  Even if we accept the claim that their priority is not to benefit the \nrich but to eliminate the deficit, it is obvious that their strategy is \nfatally flawed. For the proposed education cuts will profoundly affect \nour future economic viability and our ability to compete \ninternationally. Reducing investment in education, which is already \nlow, will inevitably limit economic growth and undermine the standard \nof living of middle-class Americans in the twenty-first century. And it \nwill close the window of opportunity for the economically disadvantaged \namong us who are pursuing the American dream.\n  Mr. President, reducing our commitment to an educated, skilled \nworkforce in the name of deficit reduction is short-sighted and \nterribly misguided. As this country struggles to find its way in a \nglobal marketplace dominated by cheap foreign labor and high \ntechnology, withdrawing our investment in education is economic \nsuicide.\n  This budget proves that Republicans are more committed to protecting \nthe interests of the haves than in accommodating the aspirations of the \nvast majority of Americans who want only to improve the quality of \ntheir lives through education.\n  Mr. President, nowhere does the impact of the proposed cuts in \neducation fall more heavily than on two areas, Head Start and Student \nLoans.\n                          impact on head start\n\n  The resolution reported by the Budget Committee proposes cutting Head \nStart by $600 million in 1996 and $3 billion over the next 7 years. \nThis means that as many as 100,000 children would be denied the \nopportunity to utilize the program and to be appropriately prepared for \nschool.\n  Mr. President, it has been fashionable of late to criticize many of \nthe Great Society Programs that were established in the 1960's; some of \nthis criticism is justified. But at least one program, Project Head \nStart, has consistently received praise for its work. Since its \ninception in 1965, the program has helped 14 million underprivileged \nchildren prepare for school. And this year, Head Start will serve \napproximately 740,000 kids, roughly a third of all poor children aged 3 \nto 4.\n  Why is this program so important? Well, statistics demonstrate that \nchildren who enter the program score higher than comparable non-Head \nStart kids in pre-school achievement tests for cognitive abilities; \nthey perform equal to or better than their peers when they enter \nregular school, and, they experience fewer grade retention and special \nclass placements.\n  Reports also indicate that Head Start has had a positive impact on \nchildren's motivation, self-esteem, socialization, and social maturity. \nIn addition, the studies show that participation in the program \nresulted in lower absenteeism and better health. Head Start has even \nhad a positive impact on the attitudes of parents toward their children \nand an improvement in their employment and education status.\n  But statistics and reports aside, I think that all of us who are \nparents understand from personal experience why the Head Start concept \nworks. It is simply this: During the preschool years, children undergo \nan accelerated phase of learning which is never again duplicated.\n  The rapidity of a child's development is truly amazing. Seemingly, in \nthe blink of an eye, kids are running when they were once crawling, \nfeeding themselves when they were once fed, arguing when they were once \ncrying. They learn to drink milk from a glass rather than a bottle; \nthey begin to use spoons and forks instead of their hands to eat. They \nlearn the alphabet and how to brush their teeth. They learn what a joke \nis and how to turn on the TV. If they live in a multilingual household, \nthey become fluent in several different languages. They acquire the \nrudiments of moral and social behavior. In short, well before they \nenter school, children have acquired the basic motor skills as well as \nthe mental, social, and emotional attributes that they will build on in \nlater years.\n  However, it is clear that the economic and social circumstances of a \nchild's family have an impact on this crucial, peak learning period. If \na child is undernourished, if he does not receive proper health care \nsuch as immunization from childhood diseases or treatment for a \ndisability, if he is not exposed to books or proper educational \nmaterials, if he lacks parental attention or his mother or father are \nabusive or otherwise lack parenting skills--all of these factors will\n probably have an adverse effect on his ability to socialize and \nacquire appropriate knowledge and skills. And once a child has been \nhandicapped in this way, it will be difficult if not impossible for him \nto catch up with his peers.\n\n  Head Start's comprehensive approach to child development, which \ninvolves education, physical and mental healthcare, nutrition, parental \ninvolvement, and social services, has proven to be an effective method \nof breaking the cycle of poverty that has helped millions of \ndisadvantaged children and has given them the opportunity to achieve \ntheir full potential, which in turn has had a salutary effect on our \neconomic well-being.\n  Until this year, Republicans appeared to embrace the goals and \nphilosophy of Head Start, working side by side with Democrats to \nsupport the program. Indeed, under President Bush, the program received \nits single largest funding increase. And only last year, Head Start was \nreauthorized on a broad bipartisan basis. Yet we are now considering a \nbudget plan that proposes to undermine much of the work of the last 30 \nyears, a plan that balances tax cuts for the wealthy against the future \nof disadvantaged children, and finds the children wanting.\n  How is it, Mr. President, that our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle can tell us with straight faces that this budget plan is good \nfor the country? How can it be good for America to take away a resource \nthat has the potential to help a hundred thousand poor children grow up \nto be productive, educated citizens? This is a question that \nRepublicans have yet to answer.\n\n\n                       reductions in student aid\n\n  Mr. President, on the other end of the educational spectrum, the \nbudget measure calls for reductions of as much as $20 billion in higher \neducation aid over the next 7 years. Of this amount, $14.5 billion in \ncuts would be in Student Loan Program cutbacks alone, mostly in the \nform of eliminating the in-school interest exemption for 4.5 million \nstudent who receive Stafford loans. I have been told that this \nrepresents the single largest reduction in student financial aid in \nhistory. [[Page S7114]] \n  Again, I believe this is a penny-wise, pound-foolish approach that \nwill save us money in the short term but will cause us grief in the \nlong run. Unlike other education programs which are largely financed by \nthe States, postsecondary student aid programs account for 75 percent \nof all available student aid, $31.4 billion of a total of $42 billion \nduring fiscal year 1994. Thus, education cuts of the magnitude \ncontemplated by the pending measure would have a disproportionate \nimpact on these programs.\n  Mr. President, if the in-school interest exemption is eliminated, the \nindividual indebtedness of Stafford loan recipients could rise to more \nthan $3,000 for undergraduates and thousands of dollars more for those \nwho pursue advanced degrees. In fact, it could increase the total cost \nof college for students and their families by 20 to 50 percent, \ndepending on the amount borrowed and the length of time a student is in \nschool.\n  According to the National Association of Independent\n   Colleges and Universities, this would mean an additional debt burden \nof $12 million over 5 years for the 4,900 Stafford loan borrowers in my \nown State of Hawaii. Here, in the District of Columbia, the debt would \nincrease by $186 million. And, in California, the total 5-year debt \nincurred by students would rise by more than a billion dollars.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an outrage. Student aid now will be less \naffordable to lower- or middle-income students, especially when one \nconsiders the proposed reductions in the constellation of other student \naid programs, including campus-based aid and Pell grants.\n  If this budget is implemented, students of modest means may have to \nforgo a college education; others who are fortunate enough to achieve \ntheir baccalaureates may have to forgo their dreams of pursuing \ngraduate study. And those students who exit college in the future will \nbe saddled with huge debt burdens at the time when they are least \nlikely to be able to afford payments.\n  All of this means that our future workforce is likely to be less \neducated, less productive, and less well off. This in turn will reduce \nthe Nation's taxbase, placing further upward pressure on the deficit, \nexactly the opposite effect from the stated purpose of this budget \nplan.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I have touched on only two areas--Head Start and \nstudent loans--that will be impacted by the proposed budget plan. But, \nas I have indicated, the GOP budget calls for nearly $100 million in \ntotal education cuts by the year 2002. This includes cuts in many other \nimportant programs, such as GOALS 2000, Title I, Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools, Special Education, and School-to-Work initiatives.\n  This wholesale disinvestment in our most important resource, our \nyoung people, is not merely shortsighted, it is blind. Blind to the \nimperatives of the new global marketplace, blind to the effect that \ncuts in education will have on our ability to prosper in an \nincreasingly complex world, and blind to the effect it will have on our \ndeficit.\n  But competitiveness, economic viability, and individual opportunity \nwill not be the only victims of the proposed cutbacks in education. Our \nsense of civil community, of history, of tolerance, the ability to \nconduct informed, rational discourse--these are also the potential \nvictims of this harsh and ill-conceived budget plan. For education is \nnot just about making enough to feed the kids or to buy a new car or to \nown a home--it is also about preparing ourselves to carry out the \nmultiple responsibilities of citizenship in the world's oldest and \ngreatest republic.\n  Mr. President, no sane nation embraces ignorance. Yet, this is what \nthe proposed resolution would have us do. I urge my colleagues to \nreject this war on knowledge by opposing the cuts in education \ncontained in this measure that threaten our future.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment \nby my colleagues, Senators Harkin and Hollings, to restore funding for \neducation in this budget. This amendment would restore $40 billion to \nour most critical national investment.\n  As a percentage of overall spending, our Federal commitment to \neducation programs has fallen significantly over the last two decades. \nAlthough recently these numbers have climbed thanks to the leadership \nof the Clinton administration, this budget resolution would scale back \nthose modest improvements and put overall spending in this vital sector \ninto a tail spin.\n\n\n                   growing challenges in our schools\n\n  Even as our Federal commitment declines, the challenges to our \nschools have grown. Children walking through our school doors today are \nquite different from those of two decades ago--fewer and fewer come \nfrom two-parent homes, a growing number are poor and many come from \ncommunities plagued with violence and crime. Our classrooms are also \nseeing the first generation of crack babies, and far too many of our \nchildren continue to enter school unprepared to learn.\n  These social changes come on top of wrenching economic \ntransformations. There was a time when blue-collar workers formed the \nbedrock of the middle class. High-wage jobs for people without years of \nadvanced education were plentiful, and a high school education was a \npassport to a healthy future. That time is gone.\n  In less than one generation, the payoff for those with education and \nskills has risen substantially, and the penalty for those lacking a \nhigh school or college education has become more severe. These trends \nshow no sign of abating. The wage gap between college graduates and \nhigh school graduates doubled during the 1980's. College graduates used \nto earn about 30 percent more than high school graduates--they now earn \nmore than 60 percent more. Every year of postsecondary education or \ntraining boosts earning power by 6 to 12 percent.\n  But education does much more for our economy than increase individual \nearnings. It is also the fuel that drives the engine of productivity. A \nrecent study by the Census Bureau and the University of Pennsylvania \ncommissioned by the Bush administration demonstrated that education \ndemonstrably increases productivity in the workplace. In fact, \nincreases in educational attainment produce twice the gain in workplace \nefficiency as similar increases in plant and equipment.\n  Education is clearly the best investment we can make in our economy. \nOur future strength will be derived from education for all, not tax \ncuts to the most affluent. That is the alternative we offer in this \namendment.\n\n\n                         the budget resolution\n\n  This budget resolution takes a different course: It would abandon our \nschools and our children. In the name of eliminating the deficit, this \nbudget proposal would create an education deficit far more costly in \nthe long run.\n  In real terms, the resolution cuts education by an average of 25 \npercent over 7 years. Because the cuts gets progressively larger in the \nout years, in 2002, we will have fully a third less money to spend on \neducation than we will spend this year.\n\n\n                            higher education\n\n  For millions of families, higher education has been the road to a \nbetter future for their children. Federal aid has been the bridge that \nextended this road across the high-priced gulf between families and \ncollege. This budget resolution would wash out this bridge for millions \nof American families. It would cut college loans, freeze Pell grants, \ncut college work study, eliminate other campus-based aid, and broadly \nincrease student debt.\n  This budget resolution would increase student loan costs by $14 \nbillion over 7 years. Four million needy students a year could lost \nthis in-school interest assistance they currently receive on their \nstudent loans, raising their personal debt from 20 to 50 percent. This \nwould mean that a student who completes a master's degree and borrows \nthe maximum of $34,125--not uncommon with annual college costs rising \nabove $25,000 at many schools--would end up paying an extra $13,320 \nover the life of his or her loan. This is not debt reduction. It is \ndebt shifting.\n  The budget resolution promises to freeze Pell spending--as if that is \nprotection. Because of the annual increase in eligible programs and \nlosses to inflation, however, even at a freeze Pell grants would lose \n40 percent of their purchasing power by 2002. And there are no \nguarantees that Pell would not be cut further--as we know, \nappropriators are in no way bound by the Budget Committee chairman's \npromises.\n[[Page S7115]]\n\n                   elementary and secondary education\n\n  The front lines of our educational system--our public schools--are \nalso under attack. The severe reductions proposed in this budget would \nhave a real impact on whether or not students have such basic \neducational supports as smaller class sizes, safe and drug-free \nschools, more teachers for reading and math, access to computers, and \nother services that make the difference for millions of young students.\n  The cuts may seem abstract, but the impact will be real--94 percent \nof school districts in America would lose over $1 billion that they use \nto keep students safe and drug-free. With the elimination of the \nschool-to-work program and vocational education, 12 million students \nwould see their opportunities to learn job skills curtailed. States and \nlocalities could see losses of $5 billion in Federal assistance for the \n5.5 million special education students if the chairman's promised \nfreeze does not hold in the Appropriations Committee. Title I for \ndisadvantaged students also is at risk of cuts that would leave 2 \nmillion needy children without these services.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n  Head Start is on the line as well. It too is promised a freeze--\nalthough just last year, 98 colleagues joined me in passing legislation \nthat promised full-funding for this model Federal program. Does that \npromise mean anything now? Let's assume that this year's promise of a \nfreeze in Head Start will hold--even though it isn't binding on \nappropriators. Even at a freeze, 350,000 fewer children would receive \nHead Start by the year 2002. And if the promised freeze doesn't hold, \nover half a million children would be out of this program.\n  Our amendment today offers us the chance to make a different choice \nin addressing the education deficit as well as our Federal deficit. Our \namendment does not increase the fiscal deficit; it does not challenge \nthe goal of a balanced budget by 2002. It simply puts our investment in \neducation before tax cuts for the well off.\n  It ensures that our children enjoy the benefit of a balanced budget \nwithout diminishing their educational opportunities for diminishing the \nvery foundation of our economy--education itself.\n\n\n                        the anxious middle class\n\n  This is not an academic debate: It is central to the future of this \ncountry. In the past two decades, our economy and our work force have \nexperienced tremendous economic and structural changes. Growing \ninternational economic competition and rapid advances in technology \nhave created a widening gulf between those at each end of the income \nscale. Income inequality is accelerating, and it is doing so faster in \nthe United States than anywhere else in the world.\n  In 1976, 1 percent of the population owned 19 percent of America's \nwealth. Today, 1 percent of the population owns 40 percent of our \nNation's wealth. In Britain, in contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent owns \n18 percent of its country's wealth. Between 1979 and 1993, incomes of \nthe least affluent three-fifths of the Nation's families dropped by 3 \nto 17 percent.\n  There are no easy answers to these problems, but I know that slashing \nfunding for education is not one of them. We must come together as a \nnation to invest in our children, not turn our backs on them. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Harkin-Hollings amendment.\n  There are no easy answers to these problems, but I know that slashing \nfunding for education is not one of them. We must come together as a \nnation in invest in our children, not turn our backs on them. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Harkin-Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Harkin-\nHollings Democratic Leadership's amendment to restore $40 billion in \nfunding to the Federal student financial assistance program, and \neducation programs, such as Head Start, to be paid for out of proposed \ntax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Cutting the student financial assistance program by $14 billion over \nthe next 7 years, and eliminating the in-school interest subsidy for \ngraduate and professional students is truly beyond my understanding.\n  Over and over again Senators come to this floor and talk about how \nthe most important resource we have in our country is our children. \nOver and over again Senators lament that our country's children are \nbehind the rest of the industrial world in educational achievement, and \nthat we must focus on educational opportunities to keep this country \ncompetitive.\n  And yet, we are offered a budget resolution that would cut back \nsubstantially on student financial assistance. I do not understand.\n  This Budget proposal would freeze funding of Pell Grants. These are \nneeds-based financial assistance grants. These are the grants that help \nensure approximately 4 million low and middle income students have the \nopportunity to go to college or receive vocational training. We have \nnot yet been able to provide funds for all of the students who qualify \nfor these grants. Still this budget proposal would freeze such grant \nfunding.\n  What should I say to the low or middle income mother and father with \na child who wants to go to college? No Pell Grant for your child. We \nhad to freeze those funds to pay for a tax cut to benefit some of the \nmost affluent in our country--those making up to $200,000. Do we really \nwant to say the need for the affluent to get a tax cut is greater than \na low or middle income child's need to go to college? I can hardly \nbelieve such a message.\n  I know firsthand how important educational opportunity is for helping \nassure employment achievement. I have three grown children, all of whom \nreceived bachelor degrees. I am particularly proud each has also gone \non to earn graduate degrees in medicine, law and education. Thankfully \nall three of my children have also been able to find work in their \nchosen fields.\n  But not all children qualified to further their education get to do \nso, simply due to the lack of money. And yet this budget proposal would \nend the AmeriCorp program. The President's program allows people the \noption of working in their communities to earn financial credits to go \nto college or to pay off school loans already incurred. And why would \nwe want to eliminate that option for hardworking and dedicated students \nto earn their way into college or out of their school debts, so those \nmaking $200,000 can receive a tax cut?\n  And not only does the budget proposal cut and freeze student \nfinancial assistance, it would force graduate and professional students \nto pay interest that accrues on their student loans while they are \nstill in school. Under current law, the Federal Government pays the \ninterest on student loans while the students are in college. During a \nrecent conversation, a Nevada lawyer told me the recent law school \ngraduates he has hired quite commonly carry a law school loan debt of \n$1,000 per month. This frequently is being paid over a 10-year period. \nAnd yet this Budget would require interest accrual while the student is \nstill in school. Students could face increases in their loan debt of 20 \npercent to 50 percent, depending on how much was borrowed. Why would \nanyone want to pay for a tax cut for the affluent by requiring young \npeople to go further into debt--while they are still in school--by \npaying interest on their school loans?\n  Additionally, this budget proposal would freeze funding for Head \nStart and special education programs. Like Pell Grants, we have not yet \nbeen able to provide funds to cover all of the children eligible for \nHead Start--those low income children most at educational risk. And \nonce children start school, this budget would freeze the funding for \ntheir special education needs. Again--why would we want to pay for a \ntax cut for the affluent by cutting off funds to the most vulnerable \nyoung children in our country who are just starting to begin their \neducation? Who needs the leg up here--the person making $200,000 or the \nlow-income child needing a lunch and a chance to learn their colors and \nnumbers before starting first grade?\n  I have a long record reaching back to the beginning of my political \ncareer in the 1960s of supporting balancing the Federal budget. As a \nU.S. Senator, I have voted twice for such legislation. There are many \ncuts I will support, some will be unpopular, some will take a hit on \nNevada. But I also have a long record of supporting investing in our \nchildren and their education as a top priority for whatever funds we \nhave. We cannot maintain a viable economy [[Page S7116]] at home, nor \nbe a viable competitor abroad if our children are not educated.\n  I have, and will continue to support efforts to try to balance the \nFederal budget by 2002--but through a fair budget proposal. When \nefforts to balance the budget rely on eliminating educational \nopportunities for our children, it is a most foolhardy way to \naccomplish.\n  I urge my colleagues support the Harkin-Hollings amendment. We must \ncontinue to invest in our children to ensure they do not have the door \nto educational opportunity slammed in their faces.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, education is fundamental to our \ncountry's future. If we are serious about strengthening our country and \nstaying competitive in a fierce global marketplace, America must \neducate its children and offer continuous education to working adults.\n  Previously, we might have differed on some details and policies, but \na tradition of bipartisanship support for basic education programs was \nsomething Americans could count on--from Head Start to Chapter 1 help \nfor elementary schools to student loans for college. Fairly recently, \nunder the leadership of President Bush, along with the National \nGovernors Association that included Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, \nthat bipartisan commitment to basic education goals was visible and \nreal.\n  I support those goals and am horrified to see a budget resolution \nbefore the Senate that makes basic education programs the victim of \nmajor cuts.\n  For example, how can we meet our goal of having every child enter \nschool ready to learn if Head Start is cut by $3 billion?\n  How can we ensure that our schools are safe and students steer clear \nof drugs, if the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program is virtually \neliminated by a $1 billion budget cut? I worked hard to establish this \nprogram in 1986 with Republicans. Since then, I have visited numerous \nWest Virginia classrooms and watched police officers in the DARE \nProgram, to cite one example, make a real difference with students.\n  How can we expect students to enter the modern workplace with the \nskills they need if we cut Federal funding for educational technology? \nIn today's Washington Post, there is an excellent story about children \nsigning up for time to work on computers at the local public library. \nWhat will happen if we pave a new information superhighway, but we \ndon't provide an on ramp or instructions for our schools and libraries?\n  Again, I have visited West Virginia classrooms, libraries and \ncommunity centers and sat with children as they show me what they can \nlearn on the Internet. Connecting students to technology is vital.\n  This resolution undercuts our national commitment to lifelong \nlearning by cutting college assistance and increasing student loan \ninterest.\n  It undercuts the School-to-Work programs, just passed last year with \nbipartisan support. The School-to-Work initiative was endorsed by both \nbusiness and labor unions. It is a partnership between the Departments \nof Education and Labor. It is where we should be investing our energy \nand efforts. With Secretary Bob Reich, I visited a West Virginia \nprogram and watched students get hand-on experience to prepare them for \nthe challenges of work in today's world. But this budget resolution, \ninstead, proposes a cut of $5.3 billion from this relevant, needed \nprogram.\n  I am personally disappointed by the suggestion of eliminating the \nAmeriCorps program. National service is something that works, and has \nwon the hearts, the minds, the support of Americans everywhere. It is \ntoday's symbol and substance that stand for responsibility and values \nlike community. Just this past weekend in West Virginia, I was with \nAmeriCorps and VISTA workers and former VISTA volunteers at a special \n30th reunion event. The people in that room are committed to making a \nreal difference for West Virginia, working in domestic violence \nshelters and providing primary health care through the Children's \nHealth Van. This is important, meaningful work that kindles the kind of \ncommunity spirit we need. I know, because it was VISTA that brought me \nto Emmons, West Virginia years ago. AmeriCorps has that same spirit, \nand deserves the same support.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are many things I do not like about \nthis Republican budget. But, one of the most outrageous parts of this \nproposal is the increased burden it would put on college students.\n  Currently, students who take out loans to go to college do not have \nto pay interest on those loans while they are in school. The Federal \nGovernment pays it for them. This is known as the in-school interest \nsubsidy. And, it has been a fundamental part of the student loan \nprogram since its inception 30 years ago. Without this protection--if \nthe interest were to accumulate while an individual is in school--the \ncost would simply be prohibitive for many families.\n  But, that is just what is about to happen. The Republican budget in \nthe Senate would end the interest subsidy for graduate and professional \nstudents. That is bad enough. But the House-passed budget is even \nworse. it would end the interest subsidy for all students.\n  This comes at a time when a higher education is increasingly \nimportant and at a time when the cost of that education is increasingly \nexpensive. Studies show that a person with a college degree earns about \n$12,000 more each year than a person with only a high school degree. \nThe unemployment rate for college graduates is 3 percent; for those \nwith a high school diploma, it is 6 percent; and for those who are high \nschool dropouts, the unemployment rate is 12 percent. And, yet, getting \nto college--opening up that door to economic opportunity--has become \nharder. During the 1980's, the cost of attending college rose 45 \npercent, while disposable income rose only 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about deadbeats. We are not talking \nabout those who default on their loans. We are talking about middle \nclass students from hard-working middle class families. The average \nannual family income for those students who borrow money to go to \ncollege is $35,000. These are middle class students who have to borrow \nmoney to get to college, who work hard to get ahead, who are playing by \nthe rules and just want a fair shot. The Republicans are turning their \nbacks on these young people by raising the costs of college loans.\n  The fact of the matter is this is a tax increase on college students. \nAlready, for too many college students, when they graduate, they are \nhanded not only a diploma but also a big IOU. This Republican budget \nmakes the IOU even bigger. For example, a medical student could see his \nmonthly loan repayment increase by more than $200 per month. A typical \ngraduate student could easily see his or her loan increase by $5000.\n  Already, few young doctors who have to borrow money to attend medical \nschool can afford to be primary care doctors in underserved rural and \nurban areas. Already, few young lawyers who have to borrow money to \nattend law school can afford to be public defenders. Already, it is \nhard for graduate students to pursue degrees in math and science--\nsomething we need desperately in this country for the Twenty-First \nCentury--because, unlike doctors and lawyers, they do not have very \nmany high-paying job alternatives. And, already, there are thousands \nupon thousands of undergraduate students who want to be policemen and \nteachers--but cannot because their loan repayment is too high. By \nremoving the in-school interest subsidy, the Republican budget would \nonly make it worse.\n  Frankly, we should be moving in the opposite direction--making \ncollege more affordable. Higher education is clearly an investment in \nour country's future, and it is without a doubt in the national \ninterest. We should encourage parents to provide a college education to \ntheir children by changing the tax laws to make it easier for them. I \nam cosponsor of a bill to allow Americans who send their kids to \ncollege to deduct up to $10,000 of the cost of that education from \ntheir taxes. That is a real investment. That is a real tax cut. That is \na real benefit to the Nation and to middle class families.\n  I disagree with some of my Democratic colleagues who argue that we \nshould not cut taxes. We should. But, we should not cut taxes as \nproposed by the House Republicans--where the cuts overwhelmingly \nbenefit the wealthy. \n[[Page S7117]] We need and we can afford--in fact, I would argue that \nwe cannot afford not to provide--a tax cut targeted to middle-class \nfamilies for the cost of an education.\n  This budget does not do that. It fails to provide relief for families \nwho pay for their kids to go to college, and it punishes those who must \nborrow to go to college. The Republican budget, instead of making a \ncollege education more affordable, makes a college education less \naffordable.\n  Mr. President, from the establishment of the land-grant university \nsystem in the late 1800's to the GI bill at the end of World War II to \nthe creation of the Pell Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan programs in \nthe 1960's, the Federal Government has been committed to seeing that \nyoung people desiring to go to college would not be turned away because \nof the cost. It was a national goal to see a college education within \nreach of every American.\n  And, no matter who you talk to--black or white, rich or poor--every \nAmerican family has the same goal: that their children will go to \ncollege. It was my dad's dream for his children, and it was my dream \nfor my children. It is the dream of the richest businessperson and the \npoorest welfare mother. It is the dream of every American parent. We \nhave not always reached the dream. But, we have always tried, and we \nhave never turned our backs. We should not now. But, I am afraid that \nthe Republicans are about to.\n  Balancing the budget is important, and it is important for our \nchildren. But, balancing the budget for future generations will be \ncounterproductive if in the process we slash the programs like \neducation that are an investment in our future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7079-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, this year, one of Alabama's most \noutstanding high school football coaches was inducted into the Alabama \nHigh School Sports Hall of Fame. From 1934 until 1942 and again from \n1951 to 1960, Howard ``Chap'' Chappell served as the coach of the \nDeshler High School Tigers, of Tuscumbia, AL, compiling an overall \nrecord of 110-52-2. But, Chap did more than just coach. As State \nRepresentative Marcel Black once said, ``My favorite stories of Coach \nChap are the ones involving his guidance and support to his former \nplayers after their careers as high school football players had \nended.'' Chap was inducted into the Hall of Fame on March 20, 1995.\n  After graduating from Sylacauga High School in 1930, Chap accepted a \nscholarship to the University of Alabama. He was a 3-year letterman on \nfootball teams that went 24-4-1 and won the first Southeastern \nConference Championship in 1933. He was also a star player on the track \nteam, lettering for 3 years.\n  Coach Chappell's first tenure as coach began in 1934. As a senior, he \nmade recruiting trips for the coach, encouraging outstanding high \nschool students to go to the University of Alabama. ``Coach Hank Crisp \nsent me to Sheffield to see about a boy named Jack Machtoff,'' Chap \nrecalled in an interview. ``I found out about a job opening in \nTuscumbia. I went to see superintendent R.E. Thompson. He didn't give \nme the job then * * * but he called later and said I could have the job \nif I wanted it.'' So, Jack went to play at Alabama and Chap became \ncoach of Deshler High School.\n  During his career as a coach, he managed to lead 3 undefeated teams. \nThe Tigers were the dominant team in the Tennessee Valley. In 1938, \nthey were described as ``striking with the swiftness of a marauding \nband of Vikings.'' He left coaching in 1960 to become principal of R.E. \nThompson School, a position which he retained until he retired in 1975.\n  Howard Chappell's many contributions have extended beyond his \noutstanding coaching. As Dr. James Maples wrote: ``I was never \nfortunate enough to have played for Coach Chap * * * but his spirit, \nhis tradition, his style and his attitude still to this day blanket the \nstadium that bears his name * * * What makes Chap great, however, what \nlifts him to heroic status in the minds of his friends and neighbors, \nis his presence in our everyday lives.

Mr. President, as President Clinton continues his review of \nFederal affirmative action policies, one of his top priorities should \nbe to take a very close look at the Justice Department's brief in the \nPiscataway Board of Education case. This case is now pending before the \nthird circuit court of appeals.\n  In Piscataway, the Justice Department has taken the position that, \nwhen an employer is laying off employees, a worker can be fired from \nher job because of her race. That's right: Our Nation's top law \nenforcement agency says that it is perfectly legal, as a way to \npreserve workforce diversity, to tell a person that she can no longer \nkeep her job because she happens to have the wrong skin color.\n  This position is even too much for the editorial writers at USA \nToday, normally staunch defenders of affirmative action, who argue in a \npowerful editorial that the Justice Department's actions in Piscataway \nare ``a tale of values misplaced.''\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has publicly embraced the Justice \nDepartment's misguided position. Hopefully, the President will rethink \nthis position before he completes his affirmative action review.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the USA Today editorial \nbe reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From USA Today]\n\n            Firing Based on Race Not Real Affirmative Action\n\n       Can you legally lose your job because of your race?\n       The answer seems obvious: No. That's why we have civil \n     rights laws. But for high school teacher Sharon Taxman, the \n     answer was a cavalier yes. And therein lies a tale of values \n     misplaced.\n       Six years ago, a financially squeezed school board in \n     Piscataway, N.J., laid Taxman off, citing her race, white, as \n     the sole reason. She sued, and the case has been marching \n     toward the Supreme Court ever since. A ruling by the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals, the last interim step, is due any day.\n       By next year, the case could affect affirmative action \n     policies nationwide and even influence the presidential \n     election.\n       Taxman's story offers a clear-cut lesson in the rights and \n     wrongs of affirmative action--a story of two teachers linked \n     by fate and separated by race.\n       It began on the first day of school in 1980 when Taxman and \n     Debra Williams, who is black, went to work as business \n     teachers in Piscataway. Both worked hard and earned high \n     marks for performance. They even won tenure the same day.\n       Then came 1989. The school board, under financial pressure, \n     needed to downsize, as so many governments and businesses \n     across the nation have in recent years. The business \n     education department was required to cut \n     [[Page S7118]] one teacher, and the choice came down to \n     Taxman or Williams, whose qualifications amounted to a flat-\n     footed tie.\n       What to do? By the board's own rules and past practice, \n     ties were to be broken by a coin flip. But the board wanted \n     to preserve racial diversity, and Williams was the \n     department's first and only black teacher. So Taxman got the \n     pink slip. And she sued.\n       Her case was seen as so important by the U.S. Justice \n     Department that it jumped in to help, suing the school board \n     for violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits \n     racial and other discrimination.\n       The courts agreed. But last year the Clinton Justice \n     Department did something extraordinary. It switched sides, \n     defending the school board's choice of Williams as a \n     legitimate affirmative action.\n       As the controversy over affirmative action has grown, the \n     administration has scrambled to downplay its role, fearing \n     reprisal at the polls. And well it should.\n       Far from helping affirmative action, approaches like \n     Piscataway's put sensible affirmative action at risk.\n       Unlike affirmative action complaints about hiring and \n     promotion--inevitably complex and arbitrary decisions--this \n     one has a clear, identifiable victim.\n       Furthermore, all sides agree the school board was under no \n     pressure to remedy any previous discrimination or to correct \n     any imbalance in minority employment--the starting point for \n     affirmative action. In fact, the school exceeded state goals \n     for minority representation on its teaching staff.\n       Most importantly, the board could have achieved its goal \n     without violating anyone's rights. It could have come up with \n     a more creative redeployment of teachers to achieve the same \n     results. Or it simply could have offered a financial \n     inducement to Taxman. That's a common practice, and she was \n     willing to accept.\n       Instead, as its first resort, it chose to lay Taxman off \n     solely because of her race. And that is wrong, no matter what \n     race it is.\n       Polls show almost no public support for such action. And \n     the courts have upheld the rights of employers to make \n     choices based on race alone only to remedy previous \n     inequities.\n       Taxman, who spurns interviews, never intended to become a \n     landmark test of firing as an affirmative action tool. She \n     just wanted to teach. When Piscataway offered to reinstate \n     her in the business education department in 1993, she gladly \n     returned.\n       But the ruckus didn't need to happen. The school board's \n     well-intentioned ends didn't justify its means.\n       For too many years, millions of women and minorities were \n     denied equal opportunity and pay because of discrimination in \n     education and in the workplace. Affirmative action has done \n     much to remedy that.\n       Firing Sharon Taxman righted no wrong. It created one. That \n     is not justice by any reasonable definition.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7117-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 AN INSPIRING STORY: A GLORIOUS FAILURE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, we often celebrate success on the floor of \nthe Senate: the passage of a particularly difficult bill, the \nratification of a difficult international agreement, or even the \nretirement of a public figure who has built a record of achievements.\n  This time, however, I would like to share with my colleagues the \ninspiring story of a glorious failure. It truly is an inspiring story \nfor several reasons: the age of the individual involved, the wisdom of \nhis perspective, and the strength of his spirit.\n  I do not know Mark Pfetzer but, as a Rhode Islander, I have been \nfollowing the news accounts of this 15-year-old high school freshman's \nattempt to become the youngest person to climb Mount Everest.\n  Mark has climbed at least 26,000 feet up the 29,028-foot Himalayan \nmountain, perhaps even higher, when he reportedly was forced to turn \nback because of rib injuries.\n  According to his mother, he was injured during a coughing fit brought \non by the extremely dry and thin air near the summit. Those injuries \nreportedly led a doctor to rule Mark out of the final assent to the \nsummit.\n  I found one quote from Mark's mother, Christine Pfetzer, to be \nparticularly telling. She said that during his preparations for the \nexpedition he was fond of a quote by the Roman general Cassius: ``In \ngreat attempts it is glorious to fail.''\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Mark on his effort, his wisdom, and his \nspirit. I am confident that his glorious failure will lead him to a \nlife of continued success.\n  I trust that, with his attitude, he eventually will climb the highest \nmountain--all the way to the top. I am sure he will go on to new \nconquests, if he remains willing to take the chance of failure.\n  We wish him well and, when he returns to Rhode Island in June, I hope \nhis homecoming is only the beginning of a life with great promise.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a May 18 wire story by the Associated \nPress, titled ``15-Year-Old Fails in Everest Summit Attempt,'' be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered by be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Middletown, R.I. (AP).--A 15-year-old high school \n     freshman's attempt to become the youngest person to climb \n     Mount Everest has been halted by rib injuries.\n       Mark Pfetzer spoke to his mother, Christine Pfetzer, by \n     phone this morning from an Everest base camp. She said Mark \n     was forced to give up a summit attempt because of bruised and \n     sprained rib muscles and at least one cracked rib.\n       Mark was injured during a coughing fit brought on by the \n     extremely dry air on the 29,028-foot Himalayan mountain, she \n     said, adding that the doctor who examined her son had seen at \n     least five similar injuries on Everest this year.\n       Christine Pfetzer said she did not know how high her son \n     climbed before he turned back. He had reached 26,000 feet \n     earlier in the expedition.\n       Pfetzer said recent severe weather on the mountain has \n     cleared and at least two other climbers from Mark's \n     expedition will attempt the summit climb. Her son, however, \n     will not be among them.\n       ``With the ribs, the doctor said no,'' Christine Pfetzer \n     said.\n       ``(Mark) did work really hard,'' she said. ``I think he \n     should have all the commendations he can get for what he \n     accomplished at his age.''\n       Pfetzer added that during her son's preparations for his \n     Everest expedition he was particularly fond of a quote by the \n     Roman general Cassius: ``In great attempts it is glorious to \n     fail.''\n       She said her son's rib injuries would take about a month to \n     heal, but that he already is looking ahead.\n       He said, ``There's next time,'' she said.\n       Since taking up climbing three years ago at a summer camp, \n     Pfetzer has climbed once in the Himalayas, scaled Argentina's \n     22,834-foot Mount Aconcagua, 19,347-foot Mount Cotopaxi in \n     Ecuador and two Peruvian peaks, 18,870-foot Mount Pisco and \n     22,200-foot Mount Huascaran.\n       Only about 400 people have reached Everest's peak since Sir \n     Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tensing Norkay of Nepal \n     first scaled it in 1953. Another 109 have died in the \n     attempt.\n       A 17-year-old French boy was the youngest person ever to \n     climb Everest, reaching the summit in 1990.\n       Christine Pfetzer said she expects Mark back in Rhode \n     Island in the first week of June.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7118-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, many in the athletic circles of Alabama \nwere saddened last month by the death of Hayden Riley, former \nUniversity of Alabama basketball and baseball coach. In 1964, 1965, and \n1967, his basketball teams achieved upset victories over the University \nof Kentucky, truly remarkable feats. From 1971 to 1979, he served as \nthe school's head baseball coach, winning two SEC championships.\n  Originally from Guin, AL, Hayden Riley attended Marion County High \nSchool, playing four sports while a student there. In 1942, he was \ncalled to active duty in the Navy. While stationed at Pensacola Naval \nAir Station, he played football, basketball, and baseball.\n  After being discharged, he attended the University of Alabama, where \nhe lettered in basketball and baseball from 1947 to 1949. In 1948, he \ngraduated with a degree in physical education and went on to receive \nhis masters in 1953 in physical education and school \nadministration. [[Page S7119]] \n  In 1951, Hayden joined the University of Alabama staff as assistant \nbasketball coach. He became head coach in 1961, staying for 9 years. \nLegendary coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant made him assistant athletic \ndirector in 1968, and he worked as one of Bear's top football \nrecruiters until he became head baseball coach in 1971.\n  Hayden Riley made many outstanding contributions to the University of \nAlabama as both a player and a coach. I extend my sincerest condolences \nto his family and friends, and ask unanimous consent that a news column \non his career be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          (By John Cameron, Assistant Managing Editor/Sports)\n\n                   Bear Said, Just Coach, and He Did\n\n       Hayden Riley and Paul ``Bear'' Bryant came to Alabama to \n     coach just about the same time.\n       Riley left Coffee High School in Florence and joined Dr. \n     Eugene Lambert's basketball staff as an assistant coach in \n     1957. Bear came home in 1958 to take over as football coach \n     and athletic director.\n       Today's generations know about the legend of the Bear. Very \n     few of the younger Alabama supporters know about coach Hayden \n     Riley. Some have never head of him.\n       Yet, Riley, who died Monday following a lengthy illness, \n     was one of the most loyal and dedicated people to ever coach \n     in the Crimson Tide athletic program.\n       In a sense, he ``was Alabama.'' He lettered in basketball \n     and baseball as a post-World War II student and, as a coach, \n     he contributed greatly to Bama's rich sports history.\n       Somehow, Coach Riley has been overlooked. He contributions \n     are seldom recognized and he is not the Alabama Sports Hall \n     of Fame. However, he is not without fame. Many former Alabama \n     athletes and coaches have fond memories of the Bama mentor. \n     They know what he did for them.\n       Coach Riley became Alabama's basketball coach in 1961, the \n     same year that Bryant won his first national championship.\n       In those days, coaching basketball was a struggle. It was \n     still all-white and all the headlines, money and fans went to \n     football. Only a few leftovers went to basketball.\n       These were the days when Tide basketball was played in \n     cramped Foster Auditorium and games provided students with \n     something to do after football season. Still, he was happy \n     just to have the chance to do the job.\n       He wound up with a losing record in basketball by only two \n     games (102-104) but he had some big years. Most of his losses \n     came in his early years.\n       In the SEC during the 1960s, you measured success by the \n     number of times you defeated powerhouse Kentucky. Riley upset \n     the Wildcats in 1964, 1965 and 1967. His 1967 team went 17-9.\n       In 1968, Bear made him assistant athletic director and put \n     him on the road recruiting. He became one of Bama's top \n     recruiters during the early 1970s, a period that produced \n     some of the Tide's greatest teams. He spent quite a bit of \n     time in Mobile and southwest Alabama.\n       Bear then asked him to coach the baseball team. From 1971-\n     79, he compiled a 224-163-1 mark and won two Western Division \n     titles. Diabetes forced him to retire from coaching in the \n     spring of 1979, although he remained with the university in \n     an administrative capacity until 1982.\n       No, history does not record Riley as a great coach in \n     basketball or baseball at Alabama. However, it does reflect \n     his strength as a loyal member of the staff and a man willing \n     to give his time to help young people. He seemed comfortable \n     remaining somewhat in the background.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7118-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF MOTOR-VOTER\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, last month, one of my State papers, the \nLexington Herald-Leader, ran a story about why people don't vote. One \nof the top reasons people cited for not voting, was because they always \nforget to register.\n  Thirty-one-year-old Tracey Adkins told the paper that ``My husband's \na preacher, and we move a lot from town to town. It's hard when you \nmove a lot. It's inconvenient.'' She couldn't remember the last time \nshe was registered, but said she would ``definitely register the next \ntime she renewed her driver's license through the motor-voter law.''\n  Tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the President signing this \nbill into law, and the culmination of years of work. But more \nimportantly, it's another milestone in this country's long history of \nworking to assure all American citizens have the ability to exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  From women's suffrage in 1920 to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to \nextending the right to vote to 18 year-olds in 1971 to removing \nphysical barriers for the elderly and disabled in 1984, Congress \nrecognized that the right to vote is perhaps the clearest expression of \ndemocracy at work.\n  When Tracey Adkins goes to renew her driver's license she'll join \ntens of thousands of other Kentuckians who took advantage of the new \nsystem--tens of thousands of other Kentuckians who now have no \nobstacles between their opinion and their Government.\n  In Kentucky, voter registration has skyrocketed to record levels, \ngaining 76,550 new voters since January 1. And it's estimated that \nmotor-voter is responsible for two-thirds of those new potential \nvoters. In the first quarter of this year, over 2 million Americans \nnationwide registered to vote under the new law. At this rate 20 \nmillion will be registered by the next Presidential election.\n  Not only are we experiencing the largest voter registration increase \nin our country's history, but as Becky Cain, president of the League of \nWomen Voters said, ``The 1996 electorate will be larger, more diverse \nand more reflective of the American people.''\n  And, nearly 10 years of opposition to this legislation has proven to \nbe completely unfounded, from arguments about the high cost of \nimplementation to the fear that somehow Democrats would benefit more \nthan Republicans. Statistics show that new registrations in Kentucky \nare almost evenly divided between Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents.\n  Barbara Jorden once said that the ``stakes are too high for \nGovernment to be a spectator sport.'' As more and more Americans found \nthemselves in the bleachers simply watching the political game, they \nwere encountering a Government that knew little about their problems, \nand even less about the way the average citizen might want to see those \nproblems solved.\n  But motor-voter sent a clear message to these disenchanted Americans \nthat Government belongs to them, its future guided by their individual \nvote. Because, it is only through their participation that the \ndemocratic process can work effectively, efficiently, and equitably.\n  So, as we celebrate this second anniversary, we do so knowing that \nwith each new registered voter, this Nation becomes a little stronger, \nour course a little steadier, our future a little brighter.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7119-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution; in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide for additional radio broadcasting to Iran \nby the United States; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                          RADIO FREE IRAN ACT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Radio Free \nIran Act.\n  This legislation is intended to create a Farsi-language service to be \nbroadcast to Iran that will supplement, not supplant the current \nprogramming already beamed to Iran by the Voice of America. This \nservice is intended to be made political in nature and as such, will \nbring to the Iranian people the real news that they are denied access \nto be the dictatorial regime in Tehran.\n  It is vital to the people of Iran that they be exposed to the truth \nof what is happening inside Iran. More must be done to detail what the \nregime is doing to this proud people. The Iranian people must \nunderstand how the regime has created impossible living conditions \nthrough massive inflation and shortages, persecuted minorities, denied \nhuman rights, and forced international isolation upon this proud nation \nbecause of its abhorrent practices.\n  The regime has robbed the Iranian people of its glorious history, \nreplacing it with the status of a pariah state. The regime in Tehran is \nknown as the chief sponsor of international terrorism, it is known as \none of the worst abusers of human rights, and it is known for its \nunceasing determination to obtain weapons of mass destruction. This in \nitself is lowering the Iranian people's living standards with each \npassing day.\n  This legislation is intended to expose the people of Iran to a more \nbalanced approach to the conditions in Iran so that they can hopefully \nhave a greater impact on their own future.\n  If anything is clear it is that the Iranian people deserve better. \nThey deserve a chance to live free of the abusive and dictatorial \nnature of their corrupt government. They deserve to shed the status \nthat this regime has cast upon them, and they deserve the chance to \nregain their proper role in the world.\n  Radio Free Iran will not be the panacea, but it will be the \nbeginning. I want Radio Free Iran to be for the Iranian people what \nRadio Free Europe did for the people of Eastern Europe. The only goal \nfor the Iranian people is freedom from oppression.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile project.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Free Iran Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to support the \n     right of the People of Iran to seek, receive, and impart \n     information and ideas through any media, regardless of \n     frontiers, in accordance with article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (2) Consonant with this policy, radio broadcasting to Iran \n     may be effective in furthering the open communication of \n     accurate information and ideas about Iran to the people of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Such broadcasting to Iran, operated in a manner not \n     inconsistent with the broad foreign policy of the United \n     States and in accordance with high professional standards, \n     would be in the national interest.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit greater flexibility for States to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries \nin managed care arrangements, to remove barriers preventing the \nprovision of medical assistance under State Medicaid plans through \nmanaged care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       medicaid managed care act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we face many difficult decisions in the \nnext few months. Due to the increasing national deficit and our efforts \nto control it, we must carefully review all Federal programs. Of \nparticular concern are Federal entitlement programs such as Medicare \nand Medicaid. Today we are debating a budget resolution that will \nreduce the growth rate in Medicaid spending by $175 billion over the \nnext 7 years. I am supportive of efforts to bring Federal spending \nunder control, including Federal spending on the Medicaid Program. \nHowever, I am deeply concerned about the future of this program which \nprovides critical health care services to low-income children, pregnant \nwomen, persons with disabilities and the elderly.\n  Clearly, as we move forward we can expect to see some dramatic \nchanges in the Medicaid Program. And as a former Governor, I understand \nthe need to provide States with additional flexibility to administer \nthe program, and to control costs. Many may question whether it is \npossible to meet these objectives without jeopardizing health care \nservices to millions of low-income Americans. Some have suggested \nconverting the Medicaid Program into a block grant and capping the \ngeneral rate of growth in Federal expenditures. While I agree that we \nshould give States more flexibility, I do not believe that it is \nreasonable to expect the Federal Government to hand over more than $100 \nbillion per year without expecting accountability. Thus, earlier this \nyear I began to look for alternatives to this approach.\n  Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleagues Senators Bob \nGraham and Kent Conrad in introducing legislation that we believe will \nserve two very important objectives in the Medicaid Program. First, \nthis legislation will give States the additional flexibility that they \nneed to administer the Medicaid Program by allowing them to enroll \nMedicaid patients in managed care. Second, this bill will set Federal \nstandards for managed care to ensure that Medicaid patients receive the \nsame quality of care afforded private managed care patients.\n  Specifically, this legislation would allow States to require Medicaid \npatients to enroll in managed care plans. States would be required to \noffer patients a choice of a least two plans. States would no longer \nhave to go through the lengthy and cumbersome process of applying to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services for a waiver of Medicaid \nregulations.\n  This legislation sets Federal standards for managed care plans that \nwish to enroll Medicaid patients. Plans would be required to meet \ncertain standards for quality, access to care, and solvency. These \nstandards are especially important given recent problems in States that \nhave set up Medicaid managed care programs under the waiver process. \nPlans have failed to contract with enough providers to serve the \nMedicaid population; plans have been permitted to operate under \nstandards that are lower than commercial insurers are required to meet; \nand plans have used fraudulent marketing practices to entice Medicaid \npatients to sign up with their plans. These actions have resulted in \npatients being denied medically necessary services, and have resulted \nin States and the Federal Government paying for care that was never \ngiven.\n  Considering these abuses, why should we allow Medicaid managed care \nat all? Because managed care, if done correctly, can vastly improve the \nquality of health care provided to low-income families. In today's fee-\nfor-service program, patients face myriad problems. Some are forced to \nget care in hospital emergency rooms because they cannot find a private \nphysician willing or able to accept Medicaid's low payment rates. Those \nwho do have access to providers often face waiting for hours in clinics \nwhich are overcrowded and understaffed. And, sadly, they often do not \nhave access to primary and preventive care services which would have \nprevented them from becoming ill to begin with.\n  Medicaid managed care, if done well, provides regular prenatal care \nto assure that children are born healthy. These plans provide coverage \nfor check-ups and immunizations to prevent serious illnesses. And they \ngive patients a medical home--a provider they know can go to if they \nare sick, or a number to call if they have questions.\n  Medicaid managed care also has the potential of benefiting our \noverall health care system by providing access to primary care \nproviders rather than forcing patients to make costly and unnecessary \nvisits to hospital emergency rooms. It gives providers the opportunity \nto catch and treat, or prevent, costly health problems.\n  Mr. President, I hope as we move forward in this budget debate that \nwe will be successful in funding a means of giving Governors the \nadditional flexibility they need to administer their Medicaid programs. \nI am also hopeful that we will be successful in dramatically decreasing \nthe rate of growth in this program. The legislation that I introduce \ntoday will give States the flexibility they have sought without going \nthrough the costly and complicated waiver process, and I look forward \nto working with the Governors to identify [[Page S7122]] additional \nareas of flexibility in the Medicaid Program.\n  We must bear in mind, however, that the Medicaid Program is the sole \nsource of health insurance for millions of low-income Americans. I \nbelieve that it would be a mistake for Congress, in its efforts to \ncontrol Federal spending, to take any action that would result in a \ndramatic increase in our Nation's uninsured population. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered, to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 839\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide the States greater flexibility in providing \njobs for, and assistance to, needy families, to improve child support \nenforcement, to reduce teenage pregnancy, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    work and gainful employment act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Nebraska for securing this time and I \nthank the distinguished Republican manager of the bill, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, for his graciousness in allowing me at this time to \nintroduce a bill which I will send to the desk.\n  This bill is a major welfare reform piece of legislation and I ask \nthat it be printed, but not in the Record. I want to make that clear: I \nam not asking it to be printed in the Record, so we can save the \ntaxpayers some money. But I am introducing a bill to dramatically \nrevamp the welfare system in this country. I call it the Work and \nGainful Employment Act.\n  The WAGE Act significantly reforms our welfare system while \nprotecting the children of America against an abdication of Federal \nresponsibility. I offer an innovative approach to reforming welfare \nthat is based on four principles: work, protecting children, State \nflexibility, and family. The WAGE Act is designed foremost to put \nwelfare recipients to work and to make welfare recipients self-\nsufficient. Under my plan, States receive unprecedented flexibility to \nexperiment in developing new methods for moving welfare recipients into \nwork. The WAGE Act retains a safety net for children and an automatic \nstabilizer for States.\n  Mr. President, Americans overwhelmingly agree that the current \nwelfare system does not work; it does not move recipients from \ndependency to work and self-sufficiency. Welfare undermines the basic \nvalues of our country--work,\n family, self-sufficiency, and personal responsibility--and sends a \ndetrimental message to children that welfare can be a permanent way of \nlife.\n\n  The WAGE Act is a departure from the status quo. The current system \nfocuses on writing checks and does little to promote work and self-\nsufficiency. States are overburdened by extensive Federal regulations \nthat impede their ability to enact innovative and creative approaches \nto moving individuals off of welfare. The worst part of welfare is the \nmessage sent to children--that if their parents do nothing, the \ngovernment will send them a check. We have no choice but to revamp and \nreengineer welfare from the ground up.\n  The WAGE Act ends welfare as we know it. In its place, States are \ngiven [[Page S7128]] the flexibility to design work programs that do \none thing--move parents into the work force. But the WAGE Act does not \njust let States take the money and run.\n  It is based on the principle that those who raise the money should \nhave some say in how it is spent. But it discards the micromanagement \nof the past.\n  The WAGE Act has four themes:\n  First, work. From the day that a parent sets foot in a welfare \noffice, we will expect that person to work or to demonstrate progress \ntoward self-sufficiency.\n  Second, State flexibility. States will have a wide latitude to design \neffective work programs under a new work and gainful employment block \ngrant. The WAGE block grant will also provide incentives for moving \nparents into the work force.\n  Third, profamily. Families that stay together and play by the rules \nwill be supported in their efforts to be self-sufficient. For children \nin divorced and never-married families, both parents will be expected \nto provide financial support through extensive and tough new child \nsupport enforcement measures.\n  Fourth, protects children. A transitional aid program will replace \nAFDC and provide cash assistance to families with children. States will \nhave broad flexibility to determine eligibility and to set benefit \nlevels and time limits. Teen parents will be required to stay in school \nand to live with their parents or in adult-supervised living \narrangements.\n  Under my proposal, the transitional aid program will be a cooperative \nFederal-State effort, with the Federal Government providing matching \nfunds to States. However, unlike AFDC, it will emphasize the need for \nparticipants to work or prepare themselves for work. The WAGE block \ngrant will provide States with the means to move welfare recipients \ninto work. The WAGE Act will save money and reform the welfare system \nwithout\n resorting to the free-for-all of AFDC block grants that does little to \nhold States accountable and that puts America's children at great risk.\n\n  While there are savings to be realized in ending welfare \ninefficiencies, I hope the Senate's deliberations will emphasize first \nand foremost that welfare reform is not an experiment to be tested on \nAmerica's poor children. The House bill allows States to count people \nas working who are kicked off the rolls. Mr. President, what could be \nmore absurd than to say that people are working who have just been \neliminated from the welfare rolls? You can be eliminated from the \nwelfare rolls and not working, and we should not count people as \nworking who are not. Real welfare reform is about solving the problem \nof transitioning parents into the work force, not the streets.\n  The person most affected by our deliberations are America's children. \nI hope that our efforts will focus on supporting and enabling their \nparents to be self-sufficient. That is the only approach that will \nensure that we are responsible to the next generation.\n  Mr. President, let me end as I began. This new welfare reform \nproposal emphasizes four principles: work, State flexibility, families, \nand protecting children.\n  I think those ought to be the principles that underlie any reform of \nour welfare system.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7120-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 364\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 364, a bill to authorize \nthe Secretary of the Interior to participate in the operation of \ncertain visitor facilities associated with, but outside the boundaries \nof, Rocky Mountain National Park in the State of Colorado.\n\n\n                                 S. 412\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Connecticut \n[Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 412, a bill to amend the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to modify the bottled drinking \nwater standards provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 495, a bill to \namend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to stabilize the student loan \nprograms, improve congressional oversight, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 529\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] was added as a cosponsor of S. 529, a bill to provide, \ntemporarily, tariff and quota treatment equivalent to that accorded to \nmembers of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to Caribbean \nBasin beneficiary countries.\n\n\n                                 S. 729\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the names of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] and the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 729, a bill to provide off-budget \ntreatment for the Highway Trust Fund, the Airport and Airway Trust \nFund, the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and the Harbor Maintenance Trust \nFund, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] was added as a cosponsor of S. 770, a bill to provide for \nthe relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, his name was withdrawn as a cosponsor of \nS. 834, a bill to restore the American family, reduce illegitimacy, and \nreduce welfare dependence.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 11\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n11, a concurrent resolution supporting a resolution to the long-\nstanding dispute regarding Cyprus.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1112\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley his name was added as a cosponsor of \nAmendment No. 1112 proposed to S.

Mr. President, I rise to give my strong support to the \npending amendment which would restore $40 billion to education.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Republican budget \nresolution which is currently before the Senate would eliminate 33 \npercent of the Federal investment in education by the year 2002. In my \nview, such action is penny-wise and pound-foolish and I would strongly \nurge my colleagues to join me in opposing such proposals which serve to \nreduce our Nation's investment in education programs.\n  Every nation puts a premium on education in order to develop the \nskills and talents of their people in order to deal with a modern, \ncomplex economic society. That is true whether the country is governed \nas a democracy or governed as a dictatorship or somewhere in between--\nthey are all concerned with enhancing or somewhere in between--they are \nall concerned with enhancing the skills of their people in the \nworkplace. That obviously is one of the purposes about which we must be \nconcerned in terms of education, particularly as we confront an \nincreasingly competitive world economy.\n  Those who are now seeking to draw back from the American commitment \nto education through the cuts included in this budget resolution at the \nsame time that they assert the necessity for America to compete more \nsuccessfully in the world's economy are asserting a basic \ncontradiction. Our success as a competitor in the world's economy rests \nupon educating our future generations.\n  We cannot as a nation afford to shortchange programs which have \nproven effective in ensuring a brighter future for our children. This \nwas recognized in the last Congress when we were able to enact a series \nof important initiatives to expand the amount and the quality of \neducation investment in America. These initiatives, which I strongly \nsupported, included the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, the Head \nStart Amendments of 1994, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the \nNational and Community Service Trust Act, and the Improving America's \nSchools Act.\n  Despite these efforts to expand educational opportunities during the \nlast Congress, the Republican budget proposal would dramatically \ndecrease educational opportunity in order to finance tax cuts for the \nwealthy and to meet arbitrary deficit reduction targets. In my view, it \nmakes little sense to cut investments in programs which give people the \nskills to function in a modern, complex society. It makes even less \nsense to do so in a document which is supposed to be a budget for our \nNation's future.\n  Mr. President, education is fundamental to what the American dream is \nall about--providing our children a path by which they can improve \nthemselves and develop their full potential. The budget resolution we \nhave before us today is a retreat from the American dream. It would \ndeny hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged children from receiving \nneeded services by freezing spending for the Title I program and deny \nHead Start services to as many as 350,000 to 550,000 preschoolers over \nthe next 7 years. These children, who come from our poorest \ncommunities, need such services in order to achieve their potential and \nreach the same high standards as their peers.\n  The Republican budget resolution we have before us today would also \nrenege on our historical commitment to access to higher education by \ncutting Federal aid to college students by $30 billion over the next 7 \nyears. Personal debt for students with subsidized loans would be \nincreased by 20 to 48 percent by eliminating the in-school interest \nsubsidy. Pell Grants for individual students would be reduced by 40 \npercent by the year 2002 or terminated altogether for over one million \nstudents per year.\n  Mr. President, education in this country has always provided an \nessential ladder of opportunity for our people. In this Nation, which \nbelieves that a person's merit and talent should take them as far as \nthey can go, the path to achieve this is to move up and onward through \neducation. Many of us here today have experienced this and are where we \nare today because of this ladder of opportunity. It seems ironic, at \nbest, that many of those who have used those ladders of opportunity to \nadvance themselves are now trying to knock the ladder down through \nthese budget cuts so those coming after them do not have the same \nopportunities.\n  I strongly support the pending amendment to restore funding for \ncritical education programs in the FY96 budget resolution and would \nurge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that education remains a top \npriority for our Nation.\n                                 ______\n\n\n               HATFIELD (AND JEFFORDS) AMENDMENT NO. 1118\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize the efforts of the many individuals who are participating in \nthe fourth White House Conference on Aging. In particular, I would like \nto give special recognition to the delegates from my State of \nMinnesota.\n  Over the last 2 years, I have had the opportunity to work with and \nlisten to many of Minnesota's senior citizens about issues of great \nconcern to them such as ensuring the solvency of the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds, expanding the highly successful Medicare \nSelect health care program to all senior citizens and repealing the \nClinton administration's seniors-only tax. [[Page S7132]] \n  In addition, many seniors have expressed the frustration with the \nseniors' earnings limit which unfairly penalizes senior citizens by \nreducing their Social Security benefits if they continue working beyond \nretirement age and earn over $11,160.\n  Last year, as a member of the 103d Congress, I nominated John Pribyl \nas the delegate from Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. John has \nspent over 20 years helping to develop service opportunities for senior \ncitizens.\n  As director of the Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota's Senior \nCompanion Program and Foster Grandparent Program, John Pribyl has \nworked tirelessly to promote seniors as a valuable resource with talent \nand experiences to share with others.\n  I also nominated Joanne Demko of Minneapolis, who has worked in aging \nservices for 15 years. She currently serves as director of the \nVolunteers of America Anoka/Hennepin Senior Dining and Home Delivered \nMeals Programs. In addition to these duties, Demko is an active member \nof the Minnesota Gerontological Society, Minnesota Minority Elders \nCoalition, and previously served as president of the Minnesota \nNutrition Directors Association.\n  Mr. President, these two individuals have devoted a significant \nportion of their lives improving the opportunities for Minnesota senior \ncitizens. Joanne Demko and John Pribyl stand out as leaders in their \ncommunities who have the vision, the compassion, and the determination \nto protect the great state of Minnesota. Mr. President, it is a \ndistinct honor for me to have such qualified champions of seniors' \nissues advocating the needs of older Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask that there be printed in the Record a complete \nlist of Minnesota's delegates to the White House Conference on Aging \nand again, congratulate these individuals for their commitment to these \nimportant issues.\n\n            Delegates to the White House Conference on Aging\n\n  The list follows:\n       David E.

BRUCE FLINT, VICE CHANCELLOR EMERITUS, LOUISIANA STATE \n                     UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURAL CENTER\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on Wednesday, May 31, 1995, Dr. Bruce \nFlint, the vice chancellor emeritus and retired director of the \nLouisiana Cooperative Extension Service, will be honored by his peers \nand colleagues at LSU and throughout the State of Louisiana.\n  After achieving a degree in agricultural economics from LSU, Dr. \nFlint, who grew up on a farm in northeastern Louisiana, served 4 years \nin the U.S. Army before accepting his first extension position--as an \nassistant county agent in Union Parish--in 1956. Through the years, he \nserved as an associate county agent, district program specialist, \nassociate specialist for training and staff development, extension \neducation specialist, division leader and State agent for personnel and \nprograms. Along the way, he also obtained his masters degree in \nextension education from LSU and his doctoral degree in cooperative \nextension administration from the University of Wisconsin.\n  In 1980, Dr. Flint was named assistant director of the extension \nservice with responsibilities for personnel, business, and fiscal \naffairs of the organization, and in 1984, he was promoted to associate \ndirector. In mid-1988, he assumed leadership for the agricultural \ncenter's administrative services as its director, and in mid-1989, he \nwas appointed as vice chancellor for administration and director of \nadministrative services. Finally, in 1993, Dr. Flint returned to \nextension as vice chancellor and director of the Louisiana Cooperative \nExtension Service--the position he held until his retirement on April \n30, 1995. On April 21, 1995, the LSU Board of Supervisors named him \nVice Chancellor Emeritus Bruce Flint in recognition of his remarkable \ncareer with the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service and the LSU \nAgricultural Center.\n  That recognition capped a 39-year career during which Dr. Flint \nreceived a variety of honors, served on countless boards and \ncommittees, and was a member of several honor societies. Among those, \nhe was a member of Epsilon Sigma Phi, Gamma Sigma Delta, the Adult \nEducation Association, the Commission of Professors of Adult Education, \nand the American Legion.\n  He also served as chairman of the LSU Continuing Education Council, \nthe Midsouth Region Extension Workers Committee on Program Development \nand Management Information Services and a Louisiana Board of Regents \ntask force studying statewide programs in agricultural research and \npublic service--extension--as well as academic programs in agriculture, \nhuman ecology, forestry, wildlife, and fisheries.\n  Mr. President, it is easy to ascertain that Bruce Flint not only \npossesses a remarkable mind and intellect, but has accomplished an \nunparalleled career. My hope is that others in Louisiana, and \nthroughout America will model themselves after Dr. Flint's approach and \ncommitment to both work and involvement within the community. Dr. Bruce \nFlint is a true asset to higher education, conservation programs, his \nfamily, and the community. He will be missed by his colleagues and \npeers and by all of Louisiana.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7132-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7132-S7133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I was saddened to learn of the \npassing of Les Aspin. He was a great public servant who worked all his \nlife to make our country better and stronger.\n  Les Aspin understood the defense budget better than just about \nanyone. He chaired the House Armed Services Committee during the height \nof the cold war and during the even more challenging years of the post \ncold war. He led the Department of Defense as it began to adjust to \nAmerica's new role in the world. And he began the difficult process of \nexpanding opportunities for women in the military. Most recently, he \ntook on the challenge of reviewing and reinvigorating our Nation's \nintelligence programs.\n  He didn't come to Washington for power and prestige--he came to \nserve. He came to represent the working families of Wisconsin's First \nCongressional District. He quickly became an expert on national \ndefense. His goal was to strengthen our military while making sure that \nthe U.S. taxpayer got the most out of every dollar spent on defense. He \nrealized that national security was too important to become \npoliticized. He believed that a strong defense is not a Republican \nposition or a Democratic position--it is a necessity for the world's \nonly superpower.\n  Les Aspin served the people of Wisconsin and the people of this \nNation with honor and distinction. He will be greatly missed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7133-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI TO VISIT ALMA MATER\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to inform my \ncolleagues that, as predicted in the press over the weekend, the \nadministration will announce this afternoon that it has agreed to issue \na visa to President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China on Taiwan for \na private visit to his alma mater.\n  I am very pleased that the administration has finally decided to take \nthis step. The feeling in Congress on this issue has been very strong, \nas evidenced by the near unanimous votes in the last 2 weeks on the \nresolution calling on the State Department to allow the visit. I'm \nequally pleased that we have avoided an escalating squabble with the \nState Department over the visit. If this action had been taken earlier, \nwhen it should have been, we could have avoided a great deal of \nacrimony and conflicting signals. I believe that the decision to admit \nPresident Lee brings our policies on admission of, let us say, \ncontroversial public figures more into uniformity, and it removes a \ngross and unnecessary slight to one of our close friends in Asia.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to make something clear to our \nfriends in the People's Republic of China. Although I understand the \ndepth of their feelings on this issue, I do not believe that this \nsimple move has to adversely affect our important relationship. \nAdmitting President Lee Teng-hui for a private, I repeat, private visit \nshould not be seen for more than it is--an internal decision to admit a \nprivate citizen for a limited private purpose--and I am sure that \nPresident Lee will closely adhere to the parameters of the visit in \norder to avoid any unnecessary complications. There are no hidden \nsignals here, no nebulous meanings, no new policy currents. This is \nnot, nor should the People's Republic of China interpret it to be, our \nrepudiation of their one-China policy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7133-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           SUPPORT OF S. 747\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \n747. The intent of this bill is to modify section 36(b)(1) of the Arms \nExport and Control Act to require congressional oversight and scrutiny \nof all arms sales to the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \nuntil such time as the Secretary of the State certifies and reports to \nCongress that the unpaid claims of American companies described in the \nJune 30, 1993, report by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section \n9140(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1993 (Public \nLaw 102-396; 106 Stat 1939), including the additional claims noticed by \nthe Department of Commerce on page 2 of the report, have been resolved \nsatisfactorily.\n  My interest in S. 747 relates in part to a New York company, Gibbs & \nHill, Inc. Gibbs & Hill was founded in 1911, and has the privilege of \nbeing the oldest power and transportation engineering firm in the \nUnited States. One of its most notable projects was the electrification \nof the Northeast corridor rail line between New York and Washington, \nDC. The first electric locomotive to run on these tracks was the George \nGibbs I.\n  In 1978, Gibbs & Hill went to Saudi Arabia to provide its engineering \nexpertise to the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu in connection \nwith the design and construction of the Yanbu Industrial City. Gibbs & \nHill was hired by the Royal Commission to design the desalination and \nrelated facilities, which are a major component of this industrial \ncomplex. The Royal Commission required significant additional services \nof Gibbs & Hill, equaling more than 200 man-years of effort. After \nrequiring Gibbs & Hill to perform the work, committing to compensate \nGibbs & Hill for the added services, and benefiting from the work \nperformed, the Royal Commission refused to pay. Gibbs & Hill's attempts \nto seek redress through the kingdom's court system was useless, as the \ncourt merely upheld the wrongful acts of another agency of the kingdom.\n  The default landed Gibbs & Hill in the special claims process \nestablished following congressional hearings in May 1992, and furthered \nby section 9140(c) of the fiscal year 1993 Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act. The $43.4 million claim of Gibbs & Hill is the last \nremaining unpaid claim awaiting resolution by the Saudi Government \nthrough the special claims process. Despite repeated commitments to our \nGovernment by the Saudi Government to resolve the claim favorably for \nthe company, Gibbs & Hill has not been paid. Gibbs & Hill has waited \nmore than 14 years to have this debt paid, including 2 years since \nreceiving explicit commitments from the Saudi Embassy that it would \nspare no efforts in resolving the claim fairly and promptly.\n  Today, the Yanbu Industrial City is pointed to as an example of the \nkingdom's technological advancement. Yet this advancement was obtained \nat the expense of Gibbs & Hill. The kingdom had an obligation to honor \nits commitments to Gibbs & Hill, as it still does today. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting S. 747.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7133-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Congressional Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough May 19, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $5.6 billion in budget authority and $1.4 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.5 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$238.0 billion, $3.1 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated May 8, 1995, there has been no action \nthat affects the current level of budget authority, outlays or \nrevenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, 50 years ago, when World War II left \none in five of the world's Lutherans homeless, U.S. Lutherans mobilized \nto help through an agency they called Lutheran World Relief.\n  After the needs in Europe were met, LWR's horizons expanded to people \nin need in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, helping \npeople regardless of religion, race, or politics. That ethic of aid for \nall who are in need has shaped LWR's work in relief and in long-term \ndevelopment over the last half century.\n  Lutheran World Relief's vision responded to changing circumstances--\nit grew from supplying disaster to cultivating partnership in \ndevelopment with communities all over the world.\n  Fifty years later, LWR is again helping refugees in Europe--now in \nthe former Yugoslavia--as it continues to respond to disasters and \npromote self-help development in places like Ethiopia, Bangladesh, \nPeru, and Rwanda.\n  Partnership has become LWR's hallmark--addressing local needs with \nunderstanding, skills, and resources found locally. LWR has focused on \nself-help and built up local capacities for emergency and long-term \nwork as well. Working with partners to improve health, promote food \nsecurity, and increase employment, LWR has seen people and communities \nall around the world improve their well-being.\n  LWR's commitment to self-help and capacity building offers numerous \nlessons and examples that aid works when it is provided in response to \nlocal needs and in partnership with local people. Those lessons have \nnot been lost on the larger, government and aid agencies. Increasingly, \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development has recognized that \nworking in partnership with local people and organizations is the key \nto improving aid effectiveness.\n  LWR has also over the years taken on the task of advocacy, bringing \nthe concerns of partners to U.S. public officials and advocating on \ntheir behalf.\n  May the accomplishments of LWR's first half century inspire the next \n50 years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7134-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7134-S7135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          HONORING BEA DISMAN\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in this era of \nbureaucrat bashing, to tell my colleagues about one particular civil \nservant who exemplifies all of the good qualities a Federal employee \nshould embody. I speak of Ms. Beatrice Disman, the new Region II \nCommissioner of the U.S. Social Security Administration in New York.\n  Bea Disman first came to my attention 12 years ago when she spent 6 \nmonths on my Senate staff, detailed by Social Security to learn how the \nlegislative process worked. Bea was a hard worker, willing to start \nearly and stay late--whatever it took to get the job done, and done \nwell. Bea always was willing to pitch in to help others. Couple these \nqualities with a fine intellect and a genuine concern for people, and \nthere is no wonder why Bea Disman has risen through the ranks to become \none of the top officials at the Social Security Administration.\n  With a Masters in Diplomatic History and a winning personality, Bea \nDisman joined Social Security as a district office claims \nrepresentative in 1965. Assigned to the Midtown Manhattan office, she \nworked her way up the hierarchy until, in 1973, she was assigned to the \nNew York Regional Office as a Program Evaluation Analyst. In 1979 Bea \nwas selected as Executive Assistant to the Regional Commissioner. \n[[Page S7135]] In 1987 she became Director of the Office of Regional \nPrograms and Integrity Reviews. Now she is Regional Commissioner.\n  Region II of Social Security is in fine hands. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7134-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   HAITIAN CHILDREN AT GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the current issue of Time \nmagazine includes a beautifully written article by Tammerliin Drummond \ndescribing the plight of more than 200 Haitian refugee children being \nkept at a place called Camp Nine at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. \nThe children escaped Haiti on rafts nearly a year ago, and many of them \nare orphans.\n  News has reached Guantanamo that the Cuban refugees living there will \nsoon be admitted to the United States, yet there is no end in sight for \nthe interned Haitian children. A report in the Washington Post over the \nweekend indicates efforts are being made to help the Haitian children, \nbut under current United States policy, they are ineligible for \n``humanitarian parole'' to enter the United States because democratic \ngovernment has been restored in Haiti. The children will be returned to \nHaiti if relatives can be located there; 60 children have been \nrepatriated thus far. Sadly, however, some of those children have ended \nup not with relatives, but living in the streets of Haiti.\n  I commend Tammy Drummond for calling attention to the awful \nconditions these children are enduring in Cuba. It is not easy for a \nreporter to gain access to the Haitian children at Camp Nine, but Tammy \nDrummond did it and we are in her debt. I hope her compelling account \nwill be read widely in the executive branch, and that the children will \nbe released from the camp as soon as possible.\n  I ask that Tammerliin Drummond's article from the May 22, 1995, issue \nof Time magazine be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                   [From Time Magazine, May 22, 1995]\n\n    Suffer the Children--Haitian Orphans Are Stranded in Guantanamo\n\n                        (By Tammerliin Drummond)\n\n       At Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuban refugees cavort happily \n     on the beach in a scene reminiscent of a Club Med. They have \n     good reason to celebrate: soon they will be flying off to \n     freedom in the U.S. Meanwhile, less than a mile away, more \n     than 200 Haitian children lounge listlessly under drab green \n     tents, seeking refuge from the harsh midday sun. Camp Nine, \n     their home since last June, is a desolate patch of cactus-\n     filled desert where the only sign of life is an occasional \n     banana rat or iguana. A fence encircles the camp, which is \n     guarded by American soldiers. The children, many of them \n     orphans, have languished in this dusty purgatory for nearly a \n     year. Despite the efforts of immigrants' rights groups, only \n     a few of the Haitian minors--who range in age from infants to \n     teenagers, including some who are pregnant--have been allowed \n     to enter the U.S.\n       ``When I heard that the U.S. was going to let 15,000 Cubans \n     into the country and leave 450 Haitians in Guantanamo, I felt \n     like someone had stuck me with a knife,'' says a 17-year-old \n     boy. ``This is a very cruel situation.'' (U.S. military \n     officials will not allow the children to be quoted by name.) \n     When Attorney General Janet Reno announced the new Cuban \n     policy on May 3, dozens of furious Haitian teens first tried \n     to organize a hunger strike with the younger children, then \n     went on a rampage, pelting soldiers with rocks and setting \n     tents on fire. No one was seriously injured in the melee, but \n     a handful of soldiers and children ended up with cuts and \n     bruises.\n       Earlier this year some of the children attempted suicide by \n     drinking bleach. Marleine Bastien, a Miami social worker, \n     counseled a desperate 16-year-old boy who tried to hang \n     himself from a tree branch in February. He survived only \n     because the branch snapped under his weight. ``Many of these \n     children have expressed suicidal ideas,'' says Bastien. ``Are \n     we going to have to wait for a fatality before something is \n     done?''\n       During the rafter crisis last summer, more than 20,000 \n     Haitians and 30,000 Cubans were intercepted at sea and \n     delivered to hastily erected camps in Guarntamamo. Among the \n     refugees were 321 unaccompanied Cuban children, all of whom \n     have since have been paroled to the U.S. But of the 356 \n     unaccompanied Haitian children who ended up a Gitmo, only 22 \n     have been admitted to the U.S., because they needed medical \n     attention or had a parent already in the States. Since the \n     island has officially returned to democratic rule, \n     immigration officials say, Haitians don't qualify for \n     humanitarian parole. Some of these children were orphaned in \n     Haiti, and set to sea alone or with friends; others saw their \n     parents drown. Because of the violence the deprivation they \n     have experienced, many of the kids are terrified of going \n     back to Haiti.\n       Yet the official U.S. policy for these children is to \n     locate relatives in Haiti and send the kids to them. So far, \n     60 Haitian children have been returned. But last week Florida \n     Rural Legal Services released a report condemning the \n     repatriations. ``The claim that what is being done is in the \n     best interest of the children is a farce,'' said Niels \n     Frenzen, a public-interest lawyer who helped track down some \n     of the returnees and found that many were homeless or living \n     in squalor with strangers. ``There is only one humane \n     solution to this problem. Close down the camp and accept the \n     generosity of the families and agencies willing to care for \n     these young people, just as we have done for Cuban \n     children.''\n       According to Florida Legal Services, all but 40 of the \n     Haitian children have U.S. sponsors lined up. ``We told the \n     State Department months ago that we had foster parents to \n     sponsor these children,'' said Deacon Chris Baumann, \n     spokesman of the U.S. Catholic Conference. Yet the children's \n     advocates report that even in cases where they have located \n     U.S. relatives, the State Department has refused to grant \n     them entry. Helene Charles, a 36-year-old Haitian living in \n     Fort Lauderdale, says she has been trying for months to \n     obtain a visa for her 14-year-old son Kissene. She left him \n     behind in Haiti with her mother, but she became ill and could \n     no longer care for him. Kissene got on a raft with some \n     friends, who got word to his mother that he was at \n     Guantanamo.\n       U.S. authorities will say only that all cases are under \n     review. ``You can't just move them lock, stock and barrel to \n     the United States and separate them from their families \n     forevermore,'' said a State Department official. ``You have \n     to find out where each child's family is and go and look for \n     the family.'' That can be a long, difficult process, says the \n     State Department, which hopes most of the children will be \n     released from the camp by early July.\n       ``We just want to get out as fast as possible and go \n     elsewhere,'' says a 17-year-old boy who has a cousin in the \n     U.S. ``We are not criminals, but we are living in a \n     prison.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7135-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CHIEF ROBERT A. SESSIONS\n\n Mrs. BOYER. Mr. President, I rise today to report that over \nthe weekend California lost a great public servant. On Saturday, \nBarstow chief of police Robert A. Sessions died after a brief battle \nwith cancer. Chief Sessions was a 28-year veteran of the department, \nand he will be missed by the people of Barstow and all who knew him.\n  Chief Sessions had a long and distinguished career serving his \ncommunity. He graduated from high school in Butte, MT, in 1958, and \nsubsequently received advanced degrees in education from Barstow \nCommunity College and in sociology from Chapman College. He also \ngraduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Academy, \n125th session.\n  After holding the positions of patrol officer, K-9 officer, \ndetective, sergeant, lieutenant, and captain, Sessions was promoted to \nchief of police in 1985. During his tenure at the helm of the Barstow \nPolice Department, Chief Sessions implemented numerous community \npolicing programs and supervised special projects ranging from drug \nabuse resistance and education to the retired senior volunteer \nprograms.\n  Chief Sessions was devoted to his family and his community. He \nmarried Carol Dawson in 1963 and the couple adopted two children, Jon \nand Jennifer. He joined the force as a reserve officer in 1967, and was \nsworn in as a full-time member of the Barstow Police Department the \nfollowing year.\n  Chief Sessions was a licensed pilot and led an active life that \nincluded hunting, fishing, running, and golf. He was a positive role \nmodel for the young people of the city of Barstow and his presence will \nbe greatly missed.\n  The memory of Chief Sessions' dedication to his family and his \ncommunity will live in each of us as we remember a remarkable public \nservant.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7135-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7135-S7136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I discussed that with the Democratic leader. It is our \nintent tomorrow, when we have an opportunity, to have back-to-back \nvotes in order to save time so that we can reach the 10-hour period.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business \ntoday, it stand in recess until the hour of 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May \n23, 1995; that following the prayer, the journal of the proceedings be \ndeemed approved to date; that the time for the two leaders be reserved \nfor their use later in [[Page S7136]] the day, and the Senate resume \nconsideration of S.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will not \nstand in recess between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 for the weekly \npolicy luncheons. The Senate will be debating the resolution. For the \ninformation of all Senators, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe concurrent resolution at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow morning.\n  Rollcall votes can be expected throughout Tuesday's session of the \nSenate in order to make progress on the budget resolution. It may also \nbe the intention of the majority leader to turn to the consideration of \nthe rescissions conference report under the time limitation previously \nordered. I have discussed that with Democratic leader.\n  I think for the information of all Senators, the Senate will recess \nfor the July 4 recess at the close of business on Friday, June 30, or \nSaturday July 1, if necessary. The Senate will reconvene on Monday, \nJuly 10. It may become necessary for the Senate to convene on some \nSaturdays prior to the recess in order to consider and complete action \non some legislative matters. I hope that is not the case. I do not like \nSaturday sessions. But I suggest that is a possibility.\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator will yield, I have asked this of the \nmajority leader, and I have asked this of the minority leader. Since \nyou did not mention it, has there been a decision made on the August \nrecess, whether or not we are going to have one this year and, if so, \nwhen?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me say to the Senator from Nebraska: It is on my short \nlist, you understand that. We did discuss it today and we are going to \nhave staff look at some of the issues, and we will try to map out where \nwe might end up. Obviously, we would all prefer to have an August \nrecess. But we hope to have an answer to that. We did get the July \nrecess settled today. Hopefully, we can do the August recess very soon \nbecause I know many Members may want to make plans, and in some cases \nthey need fairly long lead time.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/22/senate-section/article/S7136-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
