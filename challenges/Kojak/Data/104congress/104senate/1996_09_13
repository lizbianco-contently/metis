We thank You that we are all united in our need to repent, \nto return to our real selves for an honest inventory, and then to \nreturn to You with a humble and contrite heart. Forgive our sins of \nomission: the words and deeds You called us to do and we neglected, our \nbland condoning of prejudice and hatred, and our toleration of \ninjustice in our society. Forgive our sins of commission: the times we \nturned away from Your clear and specific guidance, and the times we \nknowingly rebelled against Your management of our lives and Your \nrighteousness in our Nation. Sound the shofar in our souls, blow the \ntrumpets, and wake our somnolent spirits. Arouse us and call us to \nspiritual regeneration. Awaken us to our accountability to You for our \nlives, and our leadership of this Nation. We thank You for Your atoning \ngrace and for the opportunity for a new beginning.\n  Help the Jews and Christians called to serve in this Senate, the \nSenators' staffs, and the whole support team of the Senate to celebrate \nour unity under Your sovereignty and exemplify to our Nation the \noneness of a shared commitment to You. In Your holy name. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10511-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin \nconsideration of H.R. 3662, the Interior appropriations bill.\n  As announced last night, there will be no rollcall votes today to \naccommodate Members who have a special holiday today. However, I hope \nthat Members will have amendments to the Interior bill, that they will \ncome over and offer them, and that they will be germane. These will \nonly be debated during today's session. But if votes are required then \nwe will stack those votes on Tuesday morning.\n  It is also possible that the Senate will consider S. 39, the Magnuson \nfisheries bill, as under a previous consent agreement. We reached the \npoint last night where we could not go any further with the Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill. We would like to get the Magnuson bill up. \nWe did not have time at that time of the night to consult with all the \nvarious Senators who are interested in that. We will be doing that this \nmorning if we can get an agreement this morning, or perhaps even for \nMonday morning. We will make every effort to move this legislation that \nhas been cobbled together with a lot of difficulty. But I think it is \nready for us to take up now.\n  Following legislative business today, there will be a period for \nmorning business to accommodate a number of requests from both sides of \nthe aisle, after which we will adjourn over until Monday.\n  During Monday's session the Senate will continue with the \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Again, no rollcall \nvotes will be held so that Members who are celebrating the Jewish \nholiday will be able to get back to town.\n  It is possible the Senate will consider the Federal Aviation \nAdministration authorization measure. The Democratic leader and I \ntalked about that last night. We believe we are about ready to go. We \nkeep being told by the managers that they have it all agreed to. But \nwhen we look at the agreement, it still looks pretty long. So we have \nto look at that. We will try very hard to see if we can get that done.\n  Senators should be prepared for rollcalls to begin on Tuesday as \nearly as 9:30. But it will depend on what we have pending, and a lot of \nother considerations. But we will have stacked votes early sometime on \nTuesday morning.\n  I anticipate busy sessions of the Senate all of next week as we \nattempt to complete our business before sine die.\n  I am glad we are going to the Interior appropriations bill now. We \nhave two managers who have worked together beautifully; certainly two \nof the most\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\nexperienced legislators that we have, the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, and the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. They do \ngreat work. But they have a bill that has some issues that will be \ncontroversial and should be debated. And they should be. But I hope \nthat Senators will cooperate better on this bill with the managers and \nwith leadership on both sides of the aisle than what we saw this week \non the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. That was a big \ndisappointment and a very poor exhibition by the Senate. We spent 25 \nhours 38 minutes on a bill, basically an appropriations bill that is \nrelatively small and should not have been controversial. The problem \nwas there were over 100 amendments offered, most of them nongermane. In \na couple of instances the managers withheld going to a vote so that \nSenators could come over and speak on their amendment and the Senators \nnever showed up. That is disrespectful of the process, the managers, \nand the institution. We should not do that.\n  I have tried to keep the focus on getting our work done. The best \nthing for us to do now, or any other time of the year, is just do what \nneeds to be done under the rules of the Senate and for the American \npeople. I have been playing it straight. I have been trying to \ndiscourage amendments that could be considered political or blow this \nplace up. But I reached the conclusion last night that that might not \nbe possible. We spent all day yesterday, we spent the last 10 hours on \nthat bill basically with partisan political positioning amendments \nbeing offered for TV spots.\n  I refuse as majority leader to: first, accept amendments that should \nnot be accepted on a continuous basis; second, to ask responsible \nSenators to walk the plank on obviously blatant political amendments \none after another. I mean my attitude is, OK, a little bit of that. You \ndo a little yourselves, and we do a little ourselves. You score your \npoints, and we score our points. Let us move on, and do the business.\n  It was obvious to me by late last night that the Senate was not being \nserious and that this was politics. I have in my hand exhibit A, the \nproof of what was being done on the Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill. Here is the political plan for the Democrats for \nthis year. They have their parts, and in their components under these \nthree main titles, there is an issue here, like health care. Then they \nhave the amendments they have planned to offer in that area. I mean it \nis just pure politics. I am not going to play that game. We are not \ngoing to have it on Interior. If the Senators start playing blatant \npolitics on the Interior bill, it will meet the same fate that \nTreasury-Postal Service did. I am not going to have that. I do not \nthink Senator Byrd or Senator Gorton will allow it. I urge them for \nevery amendment of that type that is offered to move to table it right \naway.\n\n  I also want to serve notice that, if there are going to be blatant \npolitical amendments put out here, we will have a second degree to \nevery one of them. It will ball this institution up. That is not right. \nThese Senators have done good work, important work, on a bill that \nAmerica wants and needs.\n  Let us do our business. Let us do it in a bipartisan and as \nnonpolitical way as possible realizing this is a political institution. \nIf we do, it will reflect well on all of us. We will all benefit \npolitically.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10511-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Section 1. Land Exchange.--\n       (a) Exchange.--Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary of \n     Agriculture (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall convey all right, title, and interest of \n     the United States in and to the National Forest System lands \n     described in subsection (b)(1) to Public Utility District No. \n     1 of Chelan County, Washington (referred to in this section \n     as the ``Public Utility District''), in exchange for the \n     conveyance to the Department of Agriculture by the Public \n     Utility District of all right, title, and interest of the \n     Public Utility District in and to the lands described in \n     subsection (b)(2).\n       (b) Description of lands.--\n       (1) National Forest System Lands.--The National Forest \n     System lands referred to in subsection (a) are 122 acres, \n     more or less, that are partially occupied by a wastewater \n     treatment facility referred to in subsection (c)(4)(A) with \n     the following legal description:\n       (A) The NE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\ of section 27 of township 27 \n     north, range 17 east, Wilamette Meridian, Chelan County, \n     Washington.\n       (B) The N\\1/2\\ of SE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\ of such section 27.\n       (C) The W\\1/2\\ of NW\\1/4\\ of SE\\1/4\\ of such section 27.\n       (D) The NW\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\ of SE\\1/4\\ of such section 27.\n       (E) The E\\1/2\\ of NW\\1/4\\ of the SE\\1/4\\ of such section \n     27.\n       (F) That portion of the S\\1/2\\ of SE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\ lying \n     north of the northerly edge of Highway 209 right-of-way of \n     such section 27.\n       (2) Public utility district lands.--The lands owned by the \n     Public Utility District are 109.15 acres, more or less, with \n     the following legal description:\n       (A) S\\1/2\\ of SW\\1/4\\ of section 35 of township 26 north, \n     range 17 east, Wilamette Meridian, Chelan County, Washington.\n       (B) The area specified by Public Utility District No. 1 as \n     Government Lot 5 in such section 35.\n       (c) Requirements for exchange.--\n       (1) Title acceptance and conveyance.--Upon offer by the \n     Public Utility District of all right, title and interest in \n     and to the lands described in subsection (b)(2), if the title \n     is found acceptable by the Secretary, the Secretary shall \n     accept title to such lands and interests therein and shall \n     convey to the Public Utility District all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the lands described \n     in subsection (b)(1).\n       (2) Appraisals required.--Before making an exchange \n     pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall conduct \n     appraisals of the lands that are subject to the exchange to \n     determine the fair market value of the lands. Such appraisals \n     shall not include the value of the wastewater treatment \n     facility referred to in paragraph (4)(A).\n       (3) Additional consideration.--If, on the basis of the \n     appraisals made under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines \n     that the fair market value of the lands to be conveyed by one \n     party under subsection (a) is less than the fair market value \n     of the lands to be conveyed by the other party under \n     subsection (a), then, as a condition of making the exchange \n     under subsection (a), the party conveying the lands with the \n     lesser value shall pay the other party the amount by which \n     the fair market value of the lands of greater value exceeds \n     the fair market value of the lands of lesser value.\n       (4) Conveyance of wastewater treatment facility.--(A) As \n     part of an exchange made under subsection (a), the Secretary \n     shall convey to the Public Utility District of Chelan County, \n     Washington, all right, title and interest of the United \n     States in and to the wastewater treatment facility (including \n     the wastewater treatment plant and associated lagoons) \n     located on the lands described in subsection (b)(1) that is \n     in existence on the date of the exchange.\n       (B) As a condition for the exchange under subsection (a), \n     the Public Utility District shall provide for a credit equal \n     to the fair market value of the wastewater treatment facility \n     conveyed pursuant to subparagraph (A) (determined as of \n     November 4, 1991), that shall be applied to the United \n     States' share of any new wastewater treatment facility \n     constructed by the Public Utility District after such date.\n       (d) Additional terms and conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the exchange under this section as the Secretary \n     determines appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n       Sec. 327. ``Snoqualmie National Forest Boundary Adjustment \n     Act of 1996.''\n       (a) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby \n     directed to modify the boundary of the Snoqualmie National \n     Forest to include and encompass 10,589.47 acres, more or \n     less, as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Snoqualmie \n     National Forest Proposed 1996 Boundary Modification'' dated \n     July, 1996.

Sugarbush Land Exchange Act of 1996.\n       (a) Exchange or sale of land.--\n       (1) If Sugarbush Resort Holdings, Inc. conveys to the \n     United States land acceptable to the Secretary of Agriculture \n     that is at least equal in value to the value of the land \n     described in subsection (a)(2), makes a payment of cash at \n     least equal to that value, or conveys land and makes a \n     payment of cash that in combination are at least equal to \n     that value, the Secretary, subject to valid existing rights, \n     shall, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may \n     prescribe, convey all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to the land described in subsection \n     (a)(2).\n       (2) Federal land to be exchanged.--The Federal land to be \n     exchanged is approximately 57 acres of federally owned land \n     in the Green Mountain National Forest depicted on the map \n     entitled ``Green Mountain National Forest, Sugarbush \n     Exchange,'' dated December 1995.\n       (3) Lands acquired from Sugarbush Resort Holdings, Inc.--\n     Any land conveyed to the United States in an exchange under \n     subsection (a)(1) shall be subject to such valid existing \n     rights of record as may be acceptable to the Secretary, and \n     the title to the parcel shall conform with the title approval \n     standards applicable to federal land acquisitions.\n       (b) Administration of land.--\n       (1) Addition to green mountain national forest.--On \n     approval and acceptance of title by the Secretary, the land \n     acquired by the United States through an exchange or with \n     proceeds from a sale under subsection (a) shall become part \n     of the Green Mountain National Forest, and the boundaries of \n     the National Forest shall be adjusted to include the land.\n       (2) Administration.--Land acquired under this Act shall be \n     administered by the Secretary in accordance with the laws \n     (including regulations) pertaining to the National Forest \n     System.\n       (3) Authority of the secretary.--This section does not \n     limit the authority of the Secretary to adjust the boundaries \n     of the Green Mountain National Forest pursuant to section 11 \n     of the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 963, chapter 186; 16 \n     U.S.C. 521) (commonly known as the ``Weeks Law'').\n       (4) For the purposes of section 7 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-9), the \n     boundaries of the Green Mountain National Forest, as adjusted \n     under this Act, shall be considered to be the boundaries of \n     the Green Mountain National Forest as of January 1, 1965.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I bring before the Senate today the fiscal \nyear 1997 Department of the Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill.\n  This bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, totals \n$12,617,764,000 in discretionary budget authority and $13,306 million \nin outlays and is within the 602(b) allocations. Any amendments offered \nto the Interior bill will require offsets. The President's budget \nrequest is $263 million above the committee's budget authority \nallocation and is $333 million above the committee's outlay allocation.\n  The bill before you represents difficult choices and challenges. The \nneeds for various agencies funded through the Interior bill are great, \nfrom operations and facilities requirements of the national parks, \nforests, refuges, public lands, and museums to the basic health care, \ntribal government, and education services provided to native Americans. \nFunding for fighting fire on public lands, such as the fires that have \nbeen devastating the West this summer, is provided through the Interior \nbill. In putting this bill together, we have attempted to strike a \nbalance among these competing interests.\n  I wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield, for his support of the Interior bill \nprograms and his willingness to give the Interior Subcommittee an \nadditional $500 million in budget authority and $400 million in outlay \nallocations above the House allocations. It is because of Senator \nHatfield that I am able to present this as a balanced and appropriate \nbill, with attention to and recognition of the difficult decisions that \nhad to be made during formulation of this bill.\n  This year, the Interior Subcommittee received approximately 1,400 \nrequests for amendments to the bill, that total to more than $2 \nbillion. Many of these requests presumed enactment of the amounts \nproposed in the President's budget, and then proposed to add above \nthat. With the budget constraints we faced, our starting point was the \nfiscal year 1996 budget with consideration of the administration's \nfiscal year 1997 budget proposals, of the priorities contained within \nthe budget request, and of concerns important to Members.\n  As is the usual practice on the Interior Subcommittee, this bill was \nprepared in a bipartisan manner.\n  Senator Byrd and his staff were not only cooperative, but were major \nand significant players in drafting the bill that is before you today.\n  The recommendations represent the result of extensive review of the \nPresident's budget proposals through subcommittee hearings with the \nagencies, briefings, and written testimony from the public.\n  Now, we will turn to the recommendations before you today. Among the \nitems of interest are of course, those within land management.\n  The committee has provided additional funds above the fiscal year \n1996 amounts for the operational accounts of the land management \nagencies: Bureau of Land Management--2 percent, Fish and Wildlife \nService--6 percent, National Park Service--7 percent, Forest Service--2 \npercent.\n  The land management agencies are involved presently with the \nsuppression of devastating wildfires and are faced with a shortage of \nfunds to fight the wildfires. This recommendation provides $321 million \nfor presuppression fire activities, $340 million for fire suppression, \nand $110 million for an emergency appropriation, that is contingent \nupon the President's emergency declaration.\n  To assist with the growing recreation demands on the agencies in this \nbill, the pilot recreation fee proposal is extended for an additional \nyear and the number of demonstration sites are increased from 50 to \n100. Eighty percent of the fee collections are to be returned to the \nsite from which they are collected.\n  I may add, Mr. President, at this time, I was recently briefed by the \nheads of each of those agencies. Each of them is enthusiastic about \nthis proposition. It has improved morale in the various services \nbecause they can now see the tangible results they can obtain by these \nfee schedules, some new and some increased. So far, the public response \nhas been very positive because the public can see that it is actually \ngetting something in each of the parks or refuges to which admission \nfees are being charged.\n  I think this is a first-rate experiment. I am convinced that it will \nsoon become permanent and that it will result in at least beginning to \nwork on the background of deferred maintenance in all of our public \nlands that are used for recreational purposes.\n  The construction accounts for the land management agencies have \nincreased $39.6 million in total--11 percent. The majority of the \nconstruction projects involve the completion of ongoing projects and \nthe restoration or rehabilitation of existing facilities. No new starts \nfor visitor centers are provided. While it may seem that this is a \nlarge increase for construction, I would remind my colleagues that the \nfacility backlogs for these land management agencies are approximately \n$9 million.\n  Overall funding for land acquisition for the land management agencies \ntotals $152.9 million, which is $14.7 million--11 percent--over the \ncurrent level and $52.9 million above the level appropriated in the \nHouse of Representatives. The committee has identified specific \nprojects, while the House bill did not. Priority is given to completing \nongoing acquisitions and avoiding new starts that would increase future \ndemands. Additional funds are provided to acquire sensitive endangered \nspecies habitat and to ensure protection of natural and cultural \nresources.\n  With respect to the science agencies, funding for the Office of \nSurface Mining and Minerals Management Service is increased slightly.\n  On cultural activities, the first priority was to provide adequate \nresources to those cultural institutions such as our Nation's museums, \nfor which this subcommittee has primary funding responsibility.\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\n  Among the many competing needs of our cultural agencies, the \nsubcommittee continues to place particular emphasis on repair and \nrenovation work that is required to keep these institutions open to the \npublic and collections preserved safely. Budget estimates from the \nKennedy Center, the National Gallery of Art, and the Smithsonian \nInstitution have been met in full to facilitate this work.\n  With respect to the Department of Energy, energy conservation \nprograms are $33 million--6.2 percent over the fiscal year 1996 level \nand $47 million over the House level. This includes an increase of \n$19.7 million over fiscal year 1996 for weatherization.\n  Fossil research and development is down 3.8 percent from the \ncomparable fiscal year 1996 level, but is $12.75 million above the \nHouse bill.\n  Mr. President, $150 million is rescinded from the Clean Coal \nTechnology Program, substantially less than the $325 million rescission \nproposed in the budget.\n  Senator Byrd and I have studied this program carefully. I have \ndeferred to him, as he is the overriding national expert on the \nsubject. And I am assured by him that the bill includes the absolute \nmaximum rescission that can be sustained at this time without \nprematurely terminating ongoing projects.\n  Funding for the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves is decreased \nby $16.5 million from the request of $149.5 million. While the \nDepartment of Energy has stated that this reduction will result in a \nrevenue loss of $45 million over the next 2 years, I see no other \nalternative in light of the lack of support shown for the reserves by \nthis committee last year.\n  Operations of the strategic petroleum reserve are funded by oil sales \nfrom the reserves of some $220 million.\n  With respect to Indian programs in the Bureau of Indian Affairs \noverall, funding increases by $10.3 million above the fiscal year 1996 \nfunding, and $32 million above the amount in the House bill. Emphasis \nhas been placed on providing additional funding to tribal priority \nallocations, which is $22.5 million--3 percent above fiscal year 1996 \nand $12.5 million above the House level. Within the tribal priority \nallocations, the committee has included an increase of $4 million for \nsmall and needy tribes and a general increase of $14.7 million. The \ncommittee has also placed emphasis on elementary and secondary school \noperations and has increased funding by $18.4 million--5 percent above \nfiscal year 1996 level and $8.9 million above the House level.\n  Funding has been provided for enacted Indian land and water \nsettlements as requested by the administration.\n  The bill reported by the committee includes a provision that would \nallow tribes the option to receive direct payments from the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs for services or the option to receive services in the \ncurrent manner. While this provision was initiated in cooperation with \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, consensus on the final details of the \nplan could not be reached.\n  Mr. President, this is a result that I greatly regret. A bill has \nbeen reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs that would accomplish \nthis goal in a much more permanent and extensive fashion.\n  There is great resistance to that bill from many quarters, some \nwithin the Indian community, some within the administration, some from \noutside. I share many of those reservations. I had hoped, and I \ncontinue to hope, that we could experiment with this field, could start \ndown the road on an optional basis, and could do it in an \nappropriations bill for 1 year, perhaps 2 years, perhaps 3 years to see \nhow it worked.\n  I am deeply sorry that, between the administration and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and at least some of the Indian communities, this \nexperiment was not deemed to be acceptable. In fact, it is the subject \nof a letter from the White House threatening a possible veto of the \nbill.\n  I understand that Senator McCain will make a motion to strike this \nprovision in its entirety, and with great regret, I will agree to that \nmotion, and it will be stricken. I hope by next year, we will be able \nto reach a resolution of this problem so that we can move forward with \nwhat I am convinced is an appropriate experiment in increasing the \nauthority of the tribes over their own affairs.\n  Total funding for the Indian Health Service has increased in this \nbill by some $66 million. This increase is for staffing of recently \ncompleted facilities, a portion of pay costs to maintain existing \nservice levels, and funding for replacement of a health care facility \nin Montana that recently burned to the ground.\n  Mr. President, I am continuing an experiment which I began, at least \nfor the committee, last year. I have available for all Members of the \nSenate, and for the public, a picture of what we are doing. This is \nanother case in which I think a picture is worth a thousand words. I \nhave cast about a large number of statistics, even in these brief \nopening remarks. This chart shows where the roughly $13 billion in this \nbill will actually go.\n  The left column, in various shades of green, is the land management \nprograms which are the responsibility of this subcommittee and, of \ncourse, of this Congress. The Forest Service is on the bottom, the \nNational Park Service next, Bureau of Land Management above that, and \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service on top, for a total of almost $6 billion, \nbut $6 billion spent in the management of the public patrimony of the \npeople of the United States, the lands that we as a people own, I think \nthe most important responsibility of this committee.\n  Those ratios are not greatly different from last year. They are \nprobably a little bit higher than they were last year because of the \nincreased recreational use, an increase which goes on year after year \nafter year in almost all of these areas.\n  The second, the blue column, has to do with our responsibilities for \nNative Americans. The lower part of it is the Indian Health Service, \nwhich you will notice is larger for that single unit than in the entire \nBureau of Indian Affairs and, then there are tiny little appropriations \non top of that. But that is a little bit under $4 billion. So we are \nclose to $10 billion at this point in the land management programs and \nIndian programs.\n\n  Then we shift over to science programs, in shades of purple. The \nlargest portion of that, slightly more than a billion dollars is the \nGeological Survey, the Office of Surface Mining and Minerals, mining \nservice and others. There we consolidated money that goes to two \ndifferent Departments.\n  Then there is energy programs, in orange, to the Department of \nEnergy. Research and development is the largest portion of that, less \nthan a billion dollars. The management of our oil reserves and grants \nfor various programs, mostly directed at the more effective use of our \nenergy or the development of new energy sources.\n  The dark blue is the cultural programs of the United States, and, \nbasically, except for a tiny share for memorials, they go in large \nmeasure to the museums--the Smithsonian, the National Gallery of Art--\nthe repositories of much of our culture. The smaller amount goes to the \nendowments--the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities.\n  Finally, over on the right, the smallest portion, about $200 million, \nis the management of the Department of the Interior.\n  This shows people the relative size of the spending of the people of \nthe United States on these matters, all of which are important and may \nhelp guide Members of this body as they deal with amendments.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to repeat something that was in my \nwritten remarks.\n  Last year was my first as the chairman of this subcommittee, and I \ntook on that position with some trepidation, because I succeeded in \nthat position as subcommittee chairman my friend and colleague and \nmentor, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who has \nchaired the full committee and the subcommittee. He made that \ntransition both easy and constructive, Mr. President, by his advice, by \nhis knowledge of the programs with which we dealt and by his wonderful \nsupport.\n  As a consequence, when we debated this bill on this floor last year, \nwe had a number of controversial and contested amendments. Not one of \nthose amendments after debate and on a vote\n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\nwas decided by a party-line vote, because the management of these \nprograms should not and is not a partisan matter. They were decided, I \nthink, on their merits. Members had to consider carefully what was \nbeing said because they couldn't come down and vote a straight party \nline, and that is the way, in my view, that the Senate ought to work.\n  It worked that way because of the cooperation and thoughtfulness of \nSenator Byrd. I appreciated that. We ended up with a number of troubles \nand veto over a matter which neither of us had any control. This year, \nI believe that we have a bill, even if there are a few amendments on \nit, that has an outstanding chance of being approved by the President \nof the United States, particularly if we are able to retain the extra \n$500 million in allocations that was given to us in conference with the \nHouse. I believe we will be able to retain that. I think we are able to \ndo a good job, and if we are a complete success this year, the credit \nwill be largely due to my friend and colleague, Senator Byrd.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of the \nfiscal year 1997 Interior appropriations bill. This bill was reported \nout by the Appropriations Committee on July 16, so there has been ample \ntime for Senators to review its contents. I hope that the Senate will \nbe able to move expeditiously in its consideration of this bill. The \nstart of the new fiscal year will be upon us before long, and there are \nenough differences between this bill and the House version that the \nsooner we can get to conference, the better our chances of resolving \nthese differences will be.\n  Again this year, it has been a privilege for me to work with Senator \nGorton in the development of this appropriations bill. He is a very \nable chairman--I have said on more than one occasion that he is more \nknowledgeable about the details of this bill than was his predecessor. \nThe Interior bill is a complex bill--it provides funding for 40 \ndifferent Federal agencies, ranging from the national parks, to Indian \nhospitals, to the Smithsonian Institution, to energy research and \ndevelopment. The reach of this bill is vast--there are 368 national \npark units, 121 national forests, over 500 national wildlife refuges, \n438 Indian hospitals and clinics, 16 Smithsonian museums, 185 Indian \nschools, and countless other facilities where the research and \ntechnology development supported by this bill occurs.\n  Because of the extent to which the programs under the subcommittee's \njurisdiction touch so many Americans, this is a bill in which many \nSenators are very interested. Again this year, the subcommittee \nreceived numerous requests for attention to particular items of concern \nto Senators, despite limited, and increasingly limited, funding \nresources. I believe that the chairman has done an excellent job in \nputting the pieces of this bill together. He has been very fair in his \napproach. His task in developing this bill was made easier by the much \nbetter allocation provided by the full committee chairman, Senator \nHatfield. The Senate version of this bill has $500 million more in \nbudget authority and $400 million more in outlays than its House \ncounterpart. These resources still leave the subcommittee essentially \nat a freeze level, so adjustments have been made internally to address \nthe highest priority programs in the bill.\n\n  I urge the administration to take a close look at the distribution of \nthe resources provided by the Senate. Additional funds above the House \nare provided in important areas such as fire protection, national \nparks, land acquisition, Indian programs, energy efficiency, and \nSmithsonian activities. If the Interior bill were to be vetoed and the \nvarious individual accounts to be held to the fiscal year 1996 level, \nit would have far greater consequences than the language concerns or \nthan not to providing additional funding for the areas identified by \nthe administration. For example, under a freeze at the 1996 level, \nfirefighting would receive $414 million below this bill's \nrecommendations; park operations would be at a level $74 million below \nthe Senate recommendation; endangered species programs would be $10 \nmillion below the committee recommendation; tribal priority allocations \nin the Bureau of Indian Affairs would be $22 million less; energy \nefficiency research and development would be $33 million less; and \nadministrative functions, particularly the Interior Departmental \nmanagement account, would be lower.\n  I will not delve further into the details of the appropriations bill. \nThe chairman has summarized sufficiently the various programs and \nactivities contained in this year's bill. The bill contains a good \nbalance among the various programs--our national parks, basic human \nservices for native Americans, minerals and science, energy research \nand development, the public lands and wildlife resources, our national \nforests, and the cultural institutions that draw so many visitors to \nour Nation's capital each year.\n\n  About $1 billion of the funding recommended in this bill falls within \nthe jurisdiction of the Department of Energy. Because of the \nconsiderable importance of several Department of Energy programs to my \nState, particularly fossil energy and clean coal technology, I have met \nwith Secretary O'Leary to discuss various issues. And I have found her \nalways--I have met with her on several occasions over the years. I have \nalways found her to be responsive and forthright in her stewardship of \nthe Department of Energy. She faces an enormous task--not just on all \nmatters related to energy policy, but also in managing the vast complex \nof the Department of Energy's weapons activities. Secretary O'Leary has \nbeen steadfast in her efforts to show real progress in downsizing and \nstreamlining the Department of Energy. Consequently, she has achieved \nreal reductions in the size of the DOE workforce as well as managed \nDOE's declining budget in a fair and effective manner. She deserves to \nbe commended for these actions. And I commend her actions, for her \nsteadfast support and dedication.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I extend a word of appreciation to the staff \nthat have assisted the chairman and me in our work on this bill. They \nwork as a team, and they serve both of us, as well as all Senators, in \na very effective and dedicated manner. And I receive many compliments \nfrom other Senators concerning our staff. On the majority side, the \nstaff members are Cherie Cooper, Kathleen Wheeler, Bruce Evans, Ginny \nJames, and Dave Gilbert. On my own staff, Sue Masica and Carole Geagley \nhandle the Interior bill.\n  This is a good bill, upon which I hope the Senate will be able to \ncomplete action in a timely manner.\n  So, Mr. President, for now I shall yield the floor. Again, I \ncongratulate and thank my chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gorton, \nand all members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle. I thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The chairman of the \nsubcommittee is recognized, the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I hope that very soon we will be able to treat, en bloc, \nas many as 25 technical and noncontroversial amendments. The Members \nand the staff are reviewing those amendments at this point, as are one \nor two other Members who are interested in them. I will suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, but it is simply for that purpose. I will be back \nsoon and get it started with a large number of noncontroversial \namendments in this bill.\n  I also, for the purposes of Members and offices that are listening to \nthis debate, solicit the presence on the floor of any Member who has an \namendment that he or she would like to present. There are, in addition \nto these en bloc amendments, a number that I am sure we will be able to \nagree to, some that will be debated. But the sooner we start those \ndebates, the sooner we will finish. And I trust that between now and \nnoon, when we move on to another subject, that we will hear from some \nof our Members. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent David Gilbert, a \ndetailee from the Department of the Interior to the Interior \nSubcommittee, be granted floor privileges today, September 13, during \nconsideration of this bill and on such successive days as we shall \nconsider this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 5318 through 5342, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send a group of amendments to the desk \nand ask they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let the clerk read first, and then we will determine if \nthere is an objection.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will explain each of these amendments \nbriefly, and, if further discussion is desired, we will separate it \nout.\n  This first amendment is proposed on behalf of Senator Chafee as the \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. We have, as \nI pointed out during my opening remarks, added to and expanded the \nauthority of our various land management agencies to charge entrance \nfees and to use those entrance fees in large measure for the \nimprovement of the facilities at which they are collected.\n  Senator Chafee and his committee have a slight modification in that \nconnection with respect to some of those facilities. We have viewed it. \nIt is the opinion of his committee it is included for that reason.\n  The second amendment is proposed on behalf of the two Senators from \nIdaho. It will move $100,000 of an appropriation from the Running Creek \nRanch land acquisition project to the National Forest Service \nappropriation for ``jammer,'' an old logging road inventory in Idaho.\n  The third, proposed by the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], would add \none additional county to an existing moratorium on land acquisitions \nfor the Wayne National Forest in the State of Ohio.\n  The next, on behalf of the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth] removes approximately 100 acres from a 9,000-acre Snowbird \nWilderness Study Area.\n  The fourth, for myself, moves $308,000 from Forest Service \nconstruction for the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie flood project to Lake Chelan \nNational Recreation Area for the repair of the Company Creek Road.\n  The fifth, on my behalf, advises the Elwha language in the bill to \nspecify that any agreement with the State of Washington shall provide \nprotection of the existing quality and availability of water.\n  The next, for myself and for Senator Byrd relating to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, adds language capping welfare assistance similar to \nthat that is in the present 1996 bill.\n  Next, for myself and for Senator Byrd on the National Park Service, \nis a technical correction that specified $300 million is available for \nresearch, planning, and interagency coordination in support of land \nacquisition in the Everglades in Florida. This is an agreement that was \nmade during the full committee consideration of the bill.\n  The next, for myself and Senator Byrd on the Forest Service, is \nliterally a technical correction where we made a mistake and where \nlanguage should read ``50 percent.''\n  The next, for myself on the National Park Service, allows a \nreimbursement of some $270,000 by the National Park Service to the \nState of Washington for fish restoration activities.\n  The next, for myself and Senator Byrd relating to Bureau of Mines, is \nto extend the facilities transfer authority provided in the 1996 \nappropriations bill.\n  The next, for myself and Senator Byrd for the Forest Service, is a \nsurprise, Mr. President. It will rename the Columbia Wilderness Area in \nOregon, the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness. The Columbia Wilderness Area \nis some 39,000 acres and was established in the 1984 Wilderness Act \nthat Senator Hatfield sponsored. This small wilderness area overlooks \nand borders the Columbia River Gorge on the Oregon side, though it is \nnot a part of the formal gorge area itself. The wilderness also \noverlooks the Bonneville Dam and the Oxbow salmon fish hatchery and is \nin the shadow of Mount Hood. Each addition to wilderness areas in the \nState of Washington has been sponsored by Senator Hatfield. This one is \nnear the northern edge of the Bull Run Reservoir near the wild and \nscenic Hood River.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is produced without the knowledge, at \nthis point, of Senator Hatfield, but it is a particularly appropriate \ntime. He is absent today, holding what I suspect will be his final \nhearing as a Senator in the Columbia Gorge which he greatly loves and \nwhich his State, of course, shares with my own. And so we feel that a \nrenaming of this wilderness area in his honor and in honor of his long, \nextraordinary and distinguished service in the U.S. Senate is a most \nappropriate amendment.\n\n  The next amendment, again, on behalf of myself and Senator Byrd, is \nlanguage relating to the National Park Foundation, allowing money that \nit collects to be used to rehabilitate visitor centers.\n  The next is on my behalf, and it removes the Mt. Graham red squirrel \nprovision from the bill. This provision was included in the 1996 \nappropriations bill and was highly controversial. At one time, it was \nthe subject of a veto threat on the part of President Clinton. Mt. \nGraham is in Arizona. It is the location of a number of astronomical \nobservatories. The creation of the last of those has been bitterly \ncontested in Arizona over a number of years. The Arizona congressional \ndelegation wanted to allow the completion of the last telescope. As \nmuch of the aid from other nations that was available to it was going \nto be lost if the project was not begun soon. Ultimately, we did \ninclude the provision in the bill that was signed by the President. \nSince then, there was a court decision won, after a long series of \ndecisions, that has validated the construction. So the provision is no \nlonger necessary and can be stricken from the bill.\n  The next is for myself and Senator Byrd for the Fish and Wildlife \nServices, which clarifies the California NCCP earmark funding will be \nprovided to local governments.\n  The next two are both by Senator Hatfield and, ironically, are naming \nprovisions that he has asked for for other people. The first is \nrenaming of Bend, OR, silviculture laboratory to be the Robert W. \nChandler lab; and the second is renaming a BLM facility for Frank \nSmullin in Rand, OR.\n  The next amendment is for Senator Hutchison of Texas, Fish and \nWildlife Service and Forest Service. It transfers $250,000 from the Rio \nGrande National Wildlife Reserve land acquisition to the Lake McClellan \nRecreation Area for dredging.\n  Next is for the Senator from Louisiana, [Mr. Johnston] who is \nretiring. It is, to me, interesting that it is renaming of the Jean \nLafitte Visitors Center to be named the Laura C. Hudson Visitor Center. \nJean Lafitte, if my memory serves me, is long dead. I suspect the new \nperson after whom it is named is more recent than any of that desired \nby the Louisiana Senators.\n  The next is for Senators Murkowski, Burns, and Craig, asking for a \nstatus report of timber sales under the salvage provision of the 1995 \nrescissions bill.\n  Next is for the two Alaska Senators modifying an Alaska subsistence \nmoratorium, included in the 1996 legislation.\n  Next for the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] for the Indian \nHealth Services, which allows use of the Choctaw Nation funds for \nconstruction of a Talihina hospital.\n  Next is by the two Senators from Virginia, which transfers $1 million \nfrom the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge land acquisition to the \nRappahannock National Wildlife Refuge land acquisition.\n  Next is by the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] with respect to \nthe Office of Surface Mining, which allows the State of Maryland to \nspend more than 10 percent of its State grants for acid mine drainage \nprojects.\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\n  The final one is for the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for the \nBureau of Land Management. It transfers $250,000 from the Alaska \ncadastral survey to preparation of environmental impact statement for \nresumption of an oil leasing program in the National Petroleum Reserve.\n\n  That is an outline. I believe these amendments have all been cleared, \nbut I will defer to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, all of the amendments have been cleared on \nthis side of the aisle. Having heard the amendments read and explained, \nI, therefore, have no objection to the request that they be considered \nand agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes \n     amendments numbered 5318 through 5342, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Choctaw Nation proposes to utilize \nvarious funding sources, including Tribal Funds, Medicaid and Medicare \ncollections, carry-over funds and IHS Area and Headquarters tribal \nshares to support this project for a community based hospital. The \nmanagers have agreed that IHS funds may be used only for the Indian \nuser portion of the projected patient workload. I understand the \nmanagers have no objection to the use of these Federal funds so long as \nit does not diminish the current level of health care services. IHS \nwill work with the Choctaw Nation in the implementation of this project \nand identify and reach an agreement of future resources and \nresponsibilities related to staffing, equipping and operating the newly \nconstructed facility. These operational needs will be considered in the \ncontext of current budget constraints, project placement on the \nfacility priority list and future funding of facilities on the \nfacilities priority list.

Second, Mr. President, I send to the desk an agreed-on \nseries of amendments not to the bill but to the committee report, and I \nask unanimous consent the committee report be amended in the way I have \nsubmitted it and the amendments be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n       On page 16 of the Committee report under U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, Habitat Conservation, the increase of \n     $500,000 provided for the Jobs in the Woods program was \n     intended to be from the FY 1996 level, not from the level in \n     the FY 1997 budget request.\n       On page 17 of the Committee report, funds earmarked for \n     cooperative marine mammals programs are provided pursuant to \n     section 119 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, not section \n     199.\n       In the Construction table for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service on page 20 of the Committee report, the amounts \n     provided for the\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\n     Southwest Fisheries Technology Center are transposed. The \n     Senate bill actually provides $961,000 for the Dexter \n     hatchery and $2,705,000 for the Mora hatchery.\n       On page 41, the amount for the Committee recommendations \n     for the Operation of Indian Programs should be \n     $1,413,606,000, consistent with the amount shown in the table \n     on page 43, instead of $1,418,606,000 as printed in the \n     report. The corrected funding level represents a decrease of \n     $165,817,000 below the budget estimate, an increase of \n     $31,983,000 above the House allowance, and $29,172,000 above \n     the fiscal year 1996 level instead of the amounts printed in \n     the report.\n       On page 43, the amount listed for the Committee \n     recommendation in the text should be $511,266,000, consistent \n     with the amount in the table on page 42, instead of \n     $521,966,000 as printed in the report. The corrected funding \n     level represents an increase of $17,769,000 above the fiscal \n     year 1996 funding level and $8,208,000 above the House \n     allowance.\n       On page 56, the Senate bill referenced on the last line of \n     the paragraph should be Senate bill 1425 instead of 1475 as \n     listed in the report.\n       The Senate bill does not include the $3.5 million increase \n     requested by the Indian Health Service to fund the cost of \n     new and expanded tribes. However, it is not the intent of the \n     Committee to deny such tribes access to contract health care \n     within the funds provided. The Committee has not provided any \n     funds for new or expanded tribes beyond those which are \n     explicitly identified in the budget request. To the extent \n     additional tribes are recognized or expanded during the \n     fiscal year, funding for such tribal populations will be \n     addressed in the context of the FY 1998 appropriations bill.\n       On page 66 of the Committee report, on the fourth line of \n     the paragraph discussing the Small Business Administration \n     timber sale set-aside program, after the words ``appeals \n     process'' insert ``, within 36 CFR Part 251, Subpart C,''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on another subject, Washington State is \nnot unlike many other Western States in that a significant portion of \nits land is in public ownership. In many cases, the ownership is \nFederal, State, and private in the form of a checkerboard pattern \nacross wide areas of the State.\n  Because of this checkerboard land ownership in Washington State, land \nexchanges are quickly becoming an efficient way for landowners to do \nbusiness with the Federal Government. There are several such exchanges \nto block up land in the works in the State of Washington. One such land \nexchange was announced on July 27 in Seattle by Agriculture Secretary \nGlickman. Secretary Glickman announced an agreement between the Forest \nService and the Plum Creek Timber Co. to complete a major land exchange \nin the Wenatchee National Forest within 2 years.\n  Last year, the Senate included $350,000 in its fiscal year 1996 \nInterior appropriations bill to facilitate this exchange. I support the \nexchange strongly and am glad that the Secretary has made it a high \npriority. The committee did not include specific funding for the \nexchange in this year's appropriation bill in large part because the \nForest Service has stated its preference that its management accounts \nnot be earmarked. As chairman of the committee I have met the agency's \nrequest while understanding that the necessary funds will be made \navailable in fiscal year 1997 to work on this important land exchange.\n  The Senate report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 Interior bill \nincludes the following report language:\n\n       The committee encourages the use of land exchanges as a way \n     in which to protect important recreational and \n     environmentally significant lands in lieu of direct \n     acquisition by the Federal Government. The committee believes \n     that land exchanges represent a more cost effective way in \n     which to do business and encourages the Forest Service to \n     give priority to those exchanges either nearing completion or \n     where land management decisions are made particularly \n     difficult due to a checkerboard pattern of ownership.\n\n  The Plum Creek land exchange should continue to be a priority for the \nagency along with other exchanges that are nearing completion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate section in title III, insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \n     fiscal year 1997 the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior \n     are authorized to limit competition for watershed restoration \n     project contracts as part of the ``Jobs in the Woods'' \n     component of the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific \n     Northwest to individuals and entities in historically timber-\n     dependent areas in the States of Washington, Oregon, and \n     northern California that have been affected by reduced timber \n     harvesting on Federal lands.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment was requested by the Forest \nService and is supported by Senator Hatfield and Senator Murray in \naddition to myself.\n  The amendment would enable the Forest Service to limit the \nadvertisement of contracts for watershed restoration projects in \nhistorically timber-dependent communities in the States of Washington, \nOregon, and northern California. The funding for this restoration work \ncomes from the ``Jobs in the Woods'' Program created by the President's \nPacific Northwest forest plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Glacier National Park\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will send an \namendment to the desk. This amendment deals with the Park Services \nmanagement of Glacier National Park in the State of Montana. As you \nmight know, Mr. President, the Park Service is beginning a new general \nmanagement plan for Glacier Park. It will be a blueprint for the next \n20 years.\n  I must say, that we in Montana are quite concerned about this \nblueprint. I ask that everybody watching take note of what is going on \nhere and to come and visit us in Montana, particularly at Glacier Park. \nGlacier has some of the most stunning real estate in the world. The \nGoing to the Sun Highway, mountain goats scaling the rocks, Grinnell \nGlacier and Iceberg Lake, which is just a small sample of what we have \nin Glacier. It is truly a national heritage, one that we must preserve \nforever. So on its face, Mr. President, an updated management plan \nseems like a pretty good idea. After all, we want to protect Glacier in \nthe long term. It does not make much sense not to protect a resource as \nprecious as this.\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\n  Full campgrounds, crowded roads, aging infrastructure, and many other \nchallenges face the Park Service today. Because Glacier has been \ndiscovered, people are coming to visit Glacier, as well they should. It \nis so magnificent. So we do need a management plan that does meet these \nchallenges and preserves the quality of Glacier National Park.\n  But so far, the National Park Service, it seems, is doing a better \njob at scaring people, at frightening people, particularly those who \nuse Glacier, than in making citizens full partners in the plan which \nprotects the park for future generations.\n  The Daily Interlake, a Kalispell newspaper, editorialized:\n\n       The Park Service has come up with a document that by \n     accident or design manages to offend just about everyone one \n     way or another.\n\n  I might say, that is an understatement. Most people I talk to are, if \nnot outraged, quite upset. And given the conversations I have had with \nthem, and others who have visited Glacier Park over the last couple \nweeks, I can tell you that something has to be done.\n  For decades visitors have had a truly first-class experience when \nthey visit Glacier. Radical changes could make these experiences a \nthing of the past.\n  I want to believe that the Park Service has merely had a clumsy \nbeginning, a clumsy start, which will soon lead to a very productive \nprocess that reflects public sentiment concerning proper Glacier \nmanagement. But up to now, the Park Service has done very little to \nreassure Montanans about where they are heading.\n  I think we need an insurance plan, an insurance policy, something \nthat guarantees that the new management plan will not go haywire. So my \namendment provides that protection. It allows the Park Service to go \nahead, but it requires them to submit the final Glacier general \nmanagement plan to the Senate Energy Committee and the House Resources \nCommittee. These committees will then have 90 days to review the plan \nbefore it goes into effect. That, I think, will guarantee public input \nand a final management plan that preserves the Glacier Park experience.\n  This amendment is a final line of defense against illogical or \nunresponsive decisionmaking by the National Park Service, not that I \nexpect them to be unresponsive or illogical, but I think it is \nimportant to have an insurance plan. I think this amendment will help \nmake that happen.\n\n\n                           Beartooth Highway\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I will also offer an amendment to \nensure the proper management of one of the most spectacular highways in \nthe United States, that is called the Beartooth Highway. Highway 212, \nbetter known as the Beartooth Highway, begins just outside Red Lodge, \nMT. It climbs a mountain to Line Creek Plateau looking out over the \nAbsaroka-Beartooth wilderness area of Wyoming and Montana. It then \nproceeds on to Cooke City and the northeastern entrance of Yellowstone \nNational Park. It is truly magnificent. Anyone who has ever taken a \nvacation in that part of our country, put it on your calendar, the \npossibility of driving the Beartooth Highway. I guarantee you will not \nregret it.\n  It is named for a spectacular rock spire, capping a mountain ridge, \ncarved by ancient glaciers into the shape of a bear's canine tooth. \nThat is why it is called Beartooth. When traveling up Beartooth \nHighway, travelers often see wildlife from moose to the bighorn sheep, \nblack bear, and golden eagle. High meadows in the spring are covered \nwith alpine wildflowers, while snowdrifts often last all summer long. \nIt is magnificent.\n  Travelers driving the Beartooth Highway see some of the most unusual \nand spectacular scenery in our country. And maybe that is why Americans \nhave treasured this region--according to archaeological evidence--for \nthe past 12,000 years. That is about as long as human beings have lived \non our continent.\n  Since the Beartooth Highway was built in the 1930's, the National \nPark Service has kept it plowed to make sure it is open for tourism by \nMemorial Day weekend. This has guaranteed access for Americans who want \nto appreciate this part of our heritage. And it has helped to ensure \nprosperity for towns along the road, in places like Red Lodge, Cooke \nCity, Silver Gate.\n  But this year the Park Service did not open the highway on Memorial \nDay. It did not plow the road on time. And small businesses in the \ngateway communities--already reeling from the Congress' blundering \ndecision to shutdown the Government at the height of the winter tourist \nseason--felt the impact. To make matters worse, these towns can expect \nthe same thing to happen in the future. Because soon after Memorial \nDay, the Superintendent of Yellowstone announced that after 1997, the \nPark Service will no longer make sure the Beartooth Highway is open at \nthe start of the tourist season.\n  The Superintendent's reason for this policy change stems from the \nbudget squeeze that Yellowstone is feeling. That is not a frivolous \ndecision, and I am sympathetic to the challenges the Park Service faces \nin managing Yellowstone. But walking away from responsibility to \nBeartooth Highway and these gateway communities is not acceptable.\n  Rather, I believe we have to find a solution now. And I think it is \nclear. The responsibility for the Beartooth Highway rests jointly on \nthe Park Service and on the Forest Service. Visitors use this road to \nget both to Yellowstone and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area. The \nformer, of course, is managed by the Park Service and the latter by the \nForest Service. So both agencies should share equally in the cost \nof opening the Beartooth Highway.\n\n  My amendment requires the Park Service and the Forest Service to \nenter into a memorandum of understanding by April 1, 1997, to split the \ncost of opening the Beartooth Highway between the two agencies. It also \nrequires these agencies to make sure that the Beartooth Highway is open \nto traffic by Memorial Day each year.\n  I think this is fair. It is a good, common sense solution. It will \nhelp ease the Park Service's concerns over funding. It will make sure \nAmericans can drive this highway in the spring. And it will make sure \nsmall businesses in Red Lodge, Cooke City, and others, who depend on \nthe Beartooth Highway opening at the beginning of the tourist season, \ncan look to the future with confidence.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I want to raise the issue today of how we, \nas a nation, are continuing to address the question of terrorism.\n  Yesterday, the committee which I chair, the Subcommittee on State, \nJustice, Commerce, a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, had \nthe\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\nchance to hear from the Attorney General, Janet Reno, who is, I think, \ndoing a very admirable and effective job as Attorney General, on what \nthe policies are of the administration relative to the issue of \naddressing in a strategic way the threats of terrorist acts directed at \nAmericans, not only in the United States but overseas.\n  Clearly, I think we now understand, America understands that this is \nour primary international threat to American lives and American \ninterests. We may have instances going on in Iraq today which are \nsignificant. We may have wars going on in Bosnia which are significant. \nBut as it relates to the threat to America, nothing right now is more \nsignificant than the threat of terrorist actions.\n  Coming out of the cold war, I think we, as a nation, decided to \nbecome a little more complacent. We felt we had gotten past one of the \ngreat hurdles of history: a confrontation between the Soviet Union and \nthe United States, a confrontation which was always overlaying with the \nissue of nuclear annihilation and confrontation on a variety of fronts, \nbut, most important, the possibility that mankind might end up in a \nnuclear war.\n  With the end of the cold war, there was a great sigh of relief, \nobviously, and appropriately so. We, as a nation, went back to looking \nafter problems which are American problems and our perspective became \none of looking at our internal issues.\n  But in the process, we couldn't step out of the world arena, and the \nfact is that the United States remains the single most influential \nnation in the world. As would be expected, because we maintain that \nposition of influence, we obtain enemies and people use us as their \nfoil and they use us as their rallying point as they try to gin up, or \ngenerate, their concerns and their own issues in other parts of the \nworld.\n  We have, therefore, become targeted by large groups, a large number \nof groups, disparate in nature, as the opposition. Many of these groups \nare motivated for religious reasons, fanatical religious reasons. Many \nof them are motivated for reasons that they see themselves as oppressed \nand they see the capitalist marketplace approach that we take to the \nworld as being an oppressive approach, which, of course, is wrong, but \nit is their attitude.\n  We view ourselves as a generous people, and we are a generous people \nand a people that has a history of not seeking any territorial gain, \nnot using our military forces for the purposes of exploiting other \nnations.\n  We have been through two major world wars where we have been left as \nthe most powerful nation on Earth and have not used that for any \npurposes of aggrandizement of the American situation, but have rather, \nin a most generous way, rebuilt our enemies and allowed them to proceed \non a course which has improved the lifestyle of our enemies we \nconfronted in past wars.\n\n  So it comes as a surprise to the American people that there are \npeople out there, that there are interest groups out there, that there \nare actually even nations out there that view us as their enemy and \nwish to exercise against the American people horrific acts, acts that \ninvolve the killing of innocent individuals--children, people who have \nno involvement in the military.\n  Yet, that is the way it is in today's world, and we must be realistic \nabout it, and we must acknowledge the fact that as we move into the \nnext century, and certainly in the beginning of the next century, that \nour most significant threat to Americans is going to be generated by \nterrorist action. It is not only terrorist action which may involve a \nbomb placed on an airplane, it is terrorist action which could well go \nbeyond that. It is terrorist action which could involve, of course, a \nthreat of chemical activity, biological activity and, of course, even \nof nuclear activity.\n\n  So the issue for us as a Government must be: How do we reorient \nourselves as a nation, which for years structured its defensive \nmechanisms for the purposes of confronting the Soviet Union, a \ndefinable threat, a threat which, although huge, massive and awesome, \nwas at least able to be brought into focus because the Soviet Union was \na definable entity, how do we shift from that sort of a threat to a \nthreat which is so amorphous, to a threat which comes at us from so \nmany different directions, and a threat which is so much more difficult \nto tie to rational thought, and respond to it in a rational way? That \nbecomes the main issue for us as a nation relative to how we structure \nour defensive policies over the next few years.\n  So the hearing which we held yesterday was for the purposes of trying \nto get an idea as to how the White House and the administration is \napproaching this issue. The way that they appear to be approaching it \nis that they are going to put more money into certain agencies which \nhave responsibilities for addressing questions of terrorist threat. \nThey have sent up a supplemental package of spending which represents \nabout $1.1 billion. They sent it up about a week ago. Many have asked \nwhether or not the package was structured for political purposes or \nwhether it was structured for substantive purposes. And that is \nprobably a very legitimate question in the middle of a Presidential \ncampaign, because the fact is that over a year ago the President set, \ntheoretically set in place, an Executive order which should have led to \nthe definition of the policy which would have then led to the \ncommitment of resources.\n  It is ironic that it has taken a year for that policy to evolve to \nthe point where money comes forward--or a proposal to spend money comes \nforward just a few weeks before an election, whereas, clearly, one \nwould have presumed that if there was a need for more dollars to be \nspent, and you had a 1-year lead time, that you would have requested \nthose additional dollars at the beginning of the appropriating process, \nwhich occurred back in March and April of this year.\n  But independent of that question of whether or not it was a primarily \npolitical motivation for bringing this forward at this time, there is a \nquestion of whether or not the request comes in the terms of a strategy \nor whether it comes in the terms of a haphazard response to the issue, \nto the threat of a terrorist action against the United States.\n  For the part of these dollars which are under the jurisdiction of the \ncommittee on which I serve, which is the State, Commerce and Justice \nCommittee, of the $1.1 billion that the President requested, about $300 \nmillion of that comes under my committee's jurisdiction. Our committee, \nabout 5 months ago, took a look at the way we were approaching \nterrorism and responding to terrorism, and decided we were not doing \nenough.\n  Our committee has jurisdiction over the FBI, over the State \nDepartment, over the DEA, over the INS, over a number of agencies which \nclearly have front-line responsibility on the issue of terrorism. So we \nset up a proposal which essentially outlined a number of basic \napproaches to how we could better address the issue of terrorism.\n  First, we asked that the White House give us a strategic plan by \nNovember 15. We picked November 15 because we did not want it to end up \nbeing a political plan. We wanted it to end up being a substantive \nplan. Thus, we pushed it past the election so that it would not end up \nin the political whirlwind that occurs before every Presidential \nelection.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is absolutely critical that we get such a proposal.\n  Second, we felt that if we were going to adequately address the \nterrorist issue, we should do it in an orderly manner, that first we \nshould address what the threats are. And that means we have to beef up \na number of functions in the Federal agencies that have \nresponsibilities, specifically the FBI area. We need to put more agents \non-site on this issue. We need to also be improving our ability to \nrespond to a chemical and biological attack.\n  In the international arena, we need to make sure that our personnel \nwho are serving overseas are protected from attack, and, therefore, we \nneed to significantly increase the security, physical security of \npeople who are serving overseas, not only the people who are serving, \nbut the physical security for their families, which is very important.\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\n We should not be putting at risk either an individual who works for \nthe Government or the family of that individual who has gone overseas \nto live with that individual.\n  Fourth, we addressed the interrelationship of the Federal agencies \nand the State agencies, because although this is a uniquely Federal \nrole, the role of protecting this country against terrorist action, \nthere are tremendous strengths which can be drawn by a coordinated \npolicy of State agencies.\n  So we took all this together and had a package that I think was put \ntogether in a fairly thoughtful and concise way. We came up with a need \nfor additional dollars, about $150 million. And we took money out of \nother accounts--other accounts--and moved them into the spending \naccounts which were necessary to pay for these additional resources to \nimprove our efforts relative to terrorists.\n  Now the White House comes along, and they increase that number from \n$150 million to $300-plus million. There is some overlap here. We are \nnot absolutely sure what the dollar difference is, but let us presume \nthe dollar difference is over $100 million. Yet, in doing this, they \nhave suggested no offsets; they have not suggested where we should take \nthis money from. They said simply, let us put more money into this and \nthat and more money into something else. That is not really a \nresponsible way to do this.\n  To the extent more dollars are needed than the package which we put \ntogether, it should be paid for. We should recognize that the priority \nin protecting this country from terrorism is high enough so that those \ndollars that we are going to allocate to terrorism should represent a \nreallocation and should not just be used to aggravate the deficit. That \nis the first thing.\n  Second, if the White House's decision is to spend this additional \nmoney to expand those accounts, they have to do it in a coordinated \nway. This, I guess, is where I have my greatest concern.\n  I asked the Attorney General about this, and, of course, the Attorney \nGeneral feels there is coordination. But as you look at what is going \non, and how the different instances of terrorism that we have seen so \nfar have occurred and how they have been reacted to, you sense maybe \nthere is not as much coordination as there should be.\n\n  For example, has the President of the United States ever sat down \nwith the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the CIA, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the Secretary of State around the table, and said, ``What \nis our strategy on approaching international terrorism? How do we get \nabout anticipating a terrorist act against the United States?''\n  We are very good, I believe, once a terrorist act has occurred, in \nreacting and investigating. And the FBI, I am absolutely confident, \nwill reach the bottom as to what happened, find out what happened in \nthe TWA situation and in the Atlanta situation and in the Saudi \nsituation. But we should be ahead of that as much as possible, ahead of \nthat curve. To be ahead of that curve, you simply have to have \ncooperation at the top, with the senior officials within the \nGovernment, and it has to be made a priority with the President. The \nPresident actually has to physically sit in that room for at least a \nfew meetings and drive the process so that we get a substantive \nstrategy, the purpose of which is to anticipate where the terrorist \nthreat is coming from and be ready to take action prior to the incident \noccurring.\n  My sense is that although strides have been made in this area, and \nalthough there is a sincere effort on the part of all the major \nplayers, certainly in the Defense Department, the intelligence agency, \nthe CIA, in the State Department, and at Justice, my sense still is \nthat there is not an attitudinal approach which says, we intend to \nanticipate, we intend to coordinate, and we intend to have an effort \nwhich tries to strategically position ourselves to be ahead of the \ncurve in the area of addressing the terrorist threat.\n  We should be approaching this with the same thought process that we \nused relative to the Soviet Union when we considered it to be a threat. \nWhen we saw the Soviet Union as a threat, basically the Defense \nDepartment spent an inordinate amount of time--not inordinate, an \nappropriate amount of time, a huge amount of time, dollars, resources \nand people on developing scenarios anticipating various events.\n  We do not have that type of structure. We do not have that type of \ndollar commitment or personnel commitment yet in the area of strategic \nplanning. We have it in the area of reactive planning. It is improving. \nJust yesterday, the FBI asked that they be able to move 200 senior \nagents into the Terrorism Activist Unit, which is a very appropriate \naction to take, not putting green new agents into this area. We are \nputting our best into this area. That is a good decision by the \nAttorney General and the Director of the FBI. We are going to increase \nthe terrorism functions within the FBI by 5 percent, so basically 10 \npercent of the FBI effort would be directed toward counterterrorism.\n  The fact is that we still do not have a strategic structure \noverlaying this. That strategic structure and how it gets overlayed and \nhow the process gets evolved really has to come from the White House \nwith the President. We are going to see, unfortunately, that the \nfailure to have this type of a structure probably was one of the \nproblems in Saudi Arabia. There will be a report coming out sometime \nnext week that will point out that there was not adequate anticipation \nof the threat, even though there was knowledge of the threat, there was \nnot adequate participation and anticipation of the threat, and that the \nsenior officials within the Government simply did not react properly.\n  Why did they not act properly? I think probably because there was not \na protocol in place because there had been no strategic planning put in \nplace for how to get ahead of the curb. We still are taking the view \nthat we wait until the act occurs rather than taking the view that we \ngo on the offensive.\n  I recognize that the White House is trying hard in this area and the \nadministration is trying hard. I greatly admire the efforts of the \nAttorney General in this area. I think the effort is incomplete. We \nhave recognized but have not yet absorbed the nature of this, its \nsignificance to us, and the fact that we as a nation are going to have \nto use all our resources, all our creativity and our imagination in \norder to address it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business until the hour of 11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is at the hour of 11:30 \nthere is, by previous consent, an opportunity for the Senator from \nWyoming and others to make a presentation. I believe there is an \nopportunity following that for others of us to make presentations.\n  I wanted to introduce a piece of legislation and I will do that in \njust 5 minutes, but first I want to comment about the bill on the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10533-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10535-S10536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for Senator \nByrd, who is going to go down as one of the real greats in the U.S. \nSenate. I have great respect for the Senator from Washington, who is \nmanaging the bill on the floor. This is a bill in which there is a \ndifficult job of reconciling almost unlimited wants with limited \nresources.\n  I want to mention one area, however, that we must address. It is not \naddressed here. It has not been addressed by the BIA, but we will have \nto address it here. It deals with the school called the Ojibwe School. \nThat may not mean much to anybody in this body, but it is very \nimportant to those on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.\n  The Ojibwe School is an education home for 400 students. These 400 \nstudents go to school on this Indian reservation in North Dakota in \nfacilities that are fundamentally unsafe. If you go tour that school, \nyou will see electrical wiring exposed, as I have seen; you will see \nstudents who have to go out in the middle of the winter into kind of an \nold, dilapidated trailer facility, one after another, stacked up in \norder to house the children and provide for their schooling.\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\n  This Ojibwe School should have been provided with a new school years \nand years ago. It was once on a priority list and somehow it got \ndropped off that list. There is a current priority list for \nconstruction, but the BIA cannot tell us how the priority list was \narrived at, who is on it, or how it was constructed. This is a mess. \nOne way or another this has to be addressed, because we cannot put 400 \nchildren in unsafe circumstances in this Ojibwe School. The BIA and our \nCongress has a responsibility.\n  I almost feel that we must think about having 400 children look at \nthe people who walk in the door of the BIA or through the front doors \nof Congress every morning until we look in the eyes of those children \nand say, ``We owe you a decent school to attend.''\n  I must move on to another topic, but we will talk more about this \nlater. I say this with the greatest respect to the people who are \nmanaging this bill. I say to the BIA, you must begin addressing these \nissues that deal with Indian children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10535-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CRIME\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the next 3 or 4 minutes I will introduce a piece of \nlegislation. It is late in the session, but I intend to push on this \nlegislation in the next session of Congress, as well. It deals with \ncrime.\n  One-third of all violent crimes in this country are committed by \npeople who are under supervision. Under supervision means people on \nprobation, parole, or pretrial release. One-third of all violent crimes \nare committed by people we know because they are already in our system. \nThey are in jail and let out. In most cases, they are let out early. It \ndoes not take Dick Tracy to figure out who will commit the next crime. \nIn most cases it is someone who has committed a previous crime.\n  Now, in the Federal system, which we control, we allow automatic good \ntime for Federal prisoners. It is not supposed to be automatic because \nthis Congress passed a piece of legislation, that I authored, that \nrevoked automatic good time and said Federal prisoners will get good \ntime only if the present system decides to bestow it upon them for \nexemplary behavior. The prison system interprets that differently and \nautomatically gives every prisoner automatic good time off for good \nbehavior. That is not what the Congress meant.\n  Now, I have a different idea. I think in the Federal system and also \nin the State and local system in the criminal justice system, we ought \nto have a system that says to people who commit violent crimes: ``If \nyou commit a violent crime you are going to go to prison and you will \nspend your entire term or sentence in jail.'' No good time off for good \nbehavior. No rewards for doing well in prison. If you commit a violent \nact you will go to jail and stay in jail until the end of your \nsentence.\n  We do not run the State and local criminal justice system, but we do \nrun the Federal system. Let me give an example of one Federal prisoner \nnamed Martin Link. In 1982, Martin Link grabbed a 15-year-old girl in \nan alley in St. Louis, MO, sodomized her and tried to rape her. In \n1983, he forced another young girl into his car, took her to East St. \nLouis and raped her. He was sentenced to 20 years in Federal prison, \nand was released in 6 years because of a combination of good time \ncredits and parole. Soon afterward, he got a year's probation for \nsoliciting sex from an undercover agent. The next year, in 1990, he \nstole a car, but he was still on the streets in 1991 when he murdered \nan 11-year-old girl named Elissa Self-Braun while she was walking to \nher schoolbus from her home.\n  This fellow is awaiting death in the Federal prison system. But he, \nlike so many others convicted of violent crimes, was walking our \nstreets early because we still have in the Federal system good time off \nfor good behavior for those who commit violent crimes--for all Federal \nprisoners. For those who commit violent acts, it seems to me we ought \nto say in this country: ``Understand this, if you are a criminal and \nprepared to commit a violent act, there will be no reward for you once \nyou get to prison.'' When you get to prison, whatever the judge says \nyour sentence is, your sentence will be--no good time off for good \nbehavior for those who commit violent crimes.\n\n  Do you know that there are more than 4,000 people who have been \nmurdered in this country--murdered by people who should not have been \non the streets to murder anybody? They should have been in jail, in \nprison, but they were let out early. Now, the prison system authorities \nsay, ``Well, we need incentives to make people behave in prison, and we \nneed opportunities to tell people that if you behave behind bars, we \nwill give you good time off for good behavior.''\n  My interest is in establishing order on American streets. We don't do \nthat by letting violent criminals out of prison before the end of their \nsentence. If they have trouble managing violent offenders in prison, \nthink of what happens when those violent offenders get back on our \nstreets.\n  Let me end where I started. One-third of all violent crimes committed \nin this country are committed by people who are on probation, parole, \nor pretrial release. We know who they are, we know what they do, and we \nknow what they are going to do. We ought to decide to get smart on \nthese issues. In the Federal system we can decide that they will spend \nthe entire time in prison, without good time off for good behavior. I \nam introducing my legislation which would do that. I invite my \ncolleagues to cosponsor it. Recognizing we won't be able to advance it \nthis year, I hope next year we will be able to have a vote on this \npiece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10536-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, for some time now, we have \nattempted to have the freshmen of the Senate come on to the floor, from \ntime to time, to talk about issues we think are important. We call this \n``Freshman Focus.'' We appreciate this time to do that. I will be \njoined by at least one of my associates, very soon. Many of the others \nhave departed for home.\n  Mr. President, we wanted to talk a little today about choices--\nchoices that we have in a Government like ours, the one that President \nLincoln said was a Government ``of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people,'' which we all, of course, want to maintain. In order to do \nthat, then each of us, as citizens, as the people who will run this \nGovernment, need to make choices, need to make decisions, and need, of \ncourse, to be as informed as we can be with respect to those choices.\n  In order to be informed voters, and in order to participate in those \ndecisions that will guide the country, not only in the short term but \nin the long term, I think we have to decide what those fundamental \nchoices are and then, of course, decide for ourselves how we approach \nthem. And there are fundamental choices, choices that have impact over \ntime, choices that affect this country and the way it is organized, in \nits purpose, and its goals--not just the short-term issues that sort of \nare instant gratification for each of us. Of course there are those, \nand we always like that. But the fact is that there are basic issues \nthat really will affect the way we operate over the years, not only for \nthose of us who are now voting, but for our kids and our grandchildren. \nThose are the ones that, it is my belief, we should really focus on and \nseek to bring out in our own minds, at least how important they are.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n  I am concerned, because it seems to me that we are increasingly \nmoving away from basing our views on those fundamental decisions and we \nget engrossed in all the short-term kinds of things that we talk about. \nThis administration, frankly, has done more to seek to blur issues than \nany administration that I have ever seen. It is fairly easy to do that. \nIt is fairly easy to say, ``Yes, I am for that, too.'' I think the best \nexample that I have seen over the last number of years--and \nparticularly in this session--is where we have spent a great deal of \ntime talking about balancing the budget and a balanced budget amendment \nto ensure that that in fact happens. I don't think there has been a \nsoul that has risen and said: ``I am not for balancing the budget.'' \nThey have said, ``I am for balancing the budget, but. . .'' So we \nestablish that initially, at least in rhetoric, and don't do that. We \nhaven't balanced the budget in 25 years.\n  So it is very easy to blur the issues, very easy to make it difficult \nto ascertain where people are on these issues. And issues is what \nelections are about. Those are the choices that you and I have to make \nas November comes. I think it is more and more difficult to really \nidentify where people are, where parties are, where candidates are, for \na number of reasons. It is almost an irony that--just imagine, 50 years \nago, 100 years ago, how little information we all had about what went \non in our Nation's Capital or around the world. Now, because of \ntechnology, we know instantly. If we fire a rocket at Iraq, we know \nabout it right away, and we actually see it. Despite that technological \nopportunity to know more, it seems as if it is more difficult for us to \nclarify the choices that we have. One of the reasons, of course, is the \nmedia. We get much of our information--most of our information and, \nindeed, almost all of your information--through public media. I don't \nthink it is any secret that the media most often tries to pick out \nthose things that are controversial and emotional, and those things \nthat create debate rather than the ones that clarify the issues. I \nunderstand that. That's the way it is. But it makes it difficult.\n  More and more of our decisions and our choices and our information \ncome from advertising, political advertising, which is generally \ndesigned to skew issues in one way or another. It is not the exclusive \nprovince of either party, but it is something that is done, almost \nentirely, in almost all the ads we see. So that does not help to \nclarify issues.\n  We see right here in this Chamber all kinds of amendments. Yesterday \nwas a great example of amendments designed simply for some kind of \npolitical statement, which really had nothing to do with the bill we \ntalked about. Frankly, it had very little to do with the prospect of it \npassing. But it was something thrown out there to create an image. It \nmakes it difficult to decide on choices. We even find, Mr. President--\nlike yesterday--a delay tactic going on here. Instead of moving \nforward, because we have a couple more weeks to finish a lot of work, \nwe spent 25 hours on one bill, with 100 amendments. Why? I think simply \nto delay. I think simply to increase the potential--frankly, the \npossibility of a shutdown of the Government and Congress would be \nblamed for that. So, when you're dealing with things like that, it is \nvery difficult to really come down on the bona fide choices and \ndirections that will guide this country into the future.\n  There are differences. There are choices. There are legitimate \nchoices and, frankly, they are fairly clear. It is a legitimate choice, \nbut there are those who want more Government, who think there ought to \nbe more taxes, who think that money collected in taxes and spent by the \nGovernment is better spent. I don't happen to agree with that, but I \nagree that it is a legitimate choice.\n  Indeed, if we can make it a little more clear between those kinds of \nthings, then people could choose. The other choice, of course, is less \nGovernment, moving Government closer to people through the State and \nlocal governments, and actually having tax relief so people spend more \nof their own money rather than collecting it and spending it out \nthrough the Federal Government. Those are choices. Those are quite \ndifferent, and that is what elections are about--to decide which of \nthose directions we want to take.\n\n  Imagine, for a minute, that you have a ballot. You go into the \npolling booth and the ballot has on it a number of issues. You check \nthose issues that you agree with. What is your choice on the issue of a \nbalanced budget amendment? Do you want that? You go down a series of \nquestions of that kind, and then, rather than selecting a candidate, \nbecause of what you have selected with the issues, the candidate is \nautomatic. The ones who represent what you most nearly represent is \nyour choice. That would be an interesting exercise, wouldn't it?\n  I suppose you could talk about the size of Government--smaller, \nlarger? Federal Government--smaller, larger?\n  Cost? Do you think the cost is too much? Do you think the Federal \nGovernment costs too much as it increases, or should it be less? It is \npossible to be less.\n  Tax relief? If we pay nearly 40 percent of our income on average in \ntaxes, should we have tax relief, or have the system continue like it \nis? Yes or no?\n  Welfare reform? We have talked about that for the last 2 years. The \nPresident had it in his campaign in 1992. Finally, after the third \ntime, it was passed and signed. Now, of course, the same people who \nsaid they were for welfare reform are now saying, ``Well, as soon as we \nget back in Congress, we will change it. We will take out some of that \nstuff. We really do not want this welfare reform.'' So welfare reform \nought to be one of the questions for voters.\n  Do you want welfare reform? Regulatory relief? We talked a lot about \nthat. We tried to do that this year. Lots of people are not for \nregulatory relief. Many of us on this side of the aisle are. They are \nlegitimate issues, and legitimate choices.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply want to say that I hope as we move on in \nthis election that each of us has a responsibility to vote, each of us \nwho has the responsibility in this kind of Government to participate in \nthe decision as to where we go in the future, take a look at the issues \nand choose, because there will be fairly clear choices, but it may be \nhard to determine that.\n  I guess that is the essence of what I am talking about this morning--\nthat we need to have choices. I believe that we have two pretty \ndifferent philosophies--one for more Government, more taxes, more \nregulations; one to reduce the size of Government, have tax relief, \nreduce the regulations so that we have more jobs and more economic \ngrowth. Those are the clear choices.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the Senator from \nMinnesota, who also wants to comment on some of the choices that are \navailable to us as part of today's Freshman Focus.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank, very much, my colleague \nfrom Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10536-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10537-S10538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OUR AMERICAN AGENDA\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, my freshman colleagues and I have come to \nthe floor this morning to share our thoughts about the future. It is a \nvision for tomorrow not bound in political partisanship, because ours \nis not a Republican agenda, but an American agenda: A message every \ncitizen can embrace, whether they are just starting out on the job, a \nnew parent, an executive working their way up the ladder, a long time \nemployee in a union shop, a student, a senior citizen. Anybody who is \nsearching for something better, and the freedom to achieve it, is \nwelcome.\n  And our message for the future can be spelled out in just six words: \nLower taxes, less Government, more jobs.\n  The vision those six words embodies contrasts sharply with the \nreality that has been imposed on the American people by their own \nGovernment.\n  Instead of making real achievements on behalf of America's families, \nthe last Congress, the 103d, was most noted for enacting the largest \ntax increase in American history. The $265 billion in new taxes it \ndemanded from the middle class could not have been further from what \nthe taxpayers wanted or deserved.\n  This Congress heard their calls and we have pointed Washington in a \nnew direction by seeking dramatically lower taxes for working \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\n  We heard the people when they told us that they, not some tax \ncollector or career bureaucrat in Washington, know what is best for \ntheir families and how to spend their money which they worked so hard \nfor.\n  The Government has never raised a child--it does not pay the dental \nbills when the kids need braces, or buy the groceries for the dinner \ntable, or write the checks for the college tuition.\n  Parents make those decisions, and with more of their own money in \ntheir wallets, parents will be empowered to raise their children as \nonly parents can.\n  Unlike the preceding Congress, which built its reputation by \nattempting to expand the reach of Government into our lives, the 104th \nCongress has made middle-class tax relief the centerpiece of our \nAmerican agenda of returning power to the people.\n  And we have pledged to continue our efforts--to strengthen our \nefforts--in the 105th.\n  We offered middle-class families the $500 per-child tax credit.\n  Under the blueprint for economic renewal proposed by our former \ncolleague, Bob Dole, the child tax credit would return more than $1,800 \nto the average Minnesota family of four. With a Republican President in \nthe Oval Office, we will enact the $500 per-child tax credit into law.\n  Congress cut the capital gains tax, too, to protect small investors, \nseniors, farmers, and families from having their savings and \ninvestments unfairly penalized.\n  With a Republican President, our reduction in the capital gains tax \nwill become law as well, and so will tax credits for families caring \nfor elderly relatives and an end to the marriage penalty in our IRS Tax \nCode.\n  Here is the bottom line, Mr. President: By enacting each of these \nideas today, we have the power to inspire dramatic change for \ntomorrow's families. Cutting taxes puts money back into the community \nand directly into the hands of working Americans, where it belongs in \nthe first place, and where it ought to stay.\n  It stands to reason that once we train the Federal Government to run \nitself more efficiently, it will need fewer tax dollars to accomplish \nthe people's work.\n  The public's desire for less interference from Washington, therefore, \ntranslates into a smaller, more efficient government, reduced \nbureaucracy, and, ultimately, less waste of the Nation's precious \nfinancial resources.\n  When we achieve that, we can begin fulfilling what I consider to be \nour most solemn obligation: erasing our deficit and finally eliminating \nour cancerous national debt. The future we envision for our children \nand grandchildren is one free of debt imposed by this generation. No \ngeneration before in this country has left the next generation a debt. \nThis generation will be the first to do that, and we should take every \nstep possible to make sure we eradicate that responsibility.\n\n  With our eye on that promise, Congress has made great progress, \ncutting spending by more than $50 billion over these past two years, \neliminating more than 270 wasteful programs, and privatizing four major \ngovernmental agencies.\n  Most importantly, our budgets balance--a sure sign of our commitment \nto ushering in a new era of fiscal responsibility.\n  Still, Americans say we can do better, and my colleagues and I agree. \nWe must do better.\n  But I am not sure the people understand that if we are going to fully \ncarry out their agenda, it will likely take a different President to \nlead us there.\n  Our third goal for the future--more and better jobs--will follow once \nwe have energized the economy by freeing America's families and job \nproviders from the burden of high taxes and once we have reduced the \nmountains of regulations and overhauled the Tax Code to forever end the \nIRS as we know it.\n  Without a Federal bureaucracy blocking the path to success, wage \nearners and investors will find the freedom to do what a free-market \neconomy encourages them to do: spend their own dollars, stimulate \ngrowth, and create new, better-paying jobs.\n  When my colleagues and I think to the future, we envision a hopeful, \nvibrant place. It is an America where any citizen who wants to achieve \nprosperity for themselves and their families--whatever their background \nand however they define that prosperity--is given the opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  It is an America where government enables their success, and does not \nstand in its way. Mr. President, I am proud of the progress we have \nmade in this Congress toward opening those doors, toward fulfilling the \nAmerican agenda of lower taxes, less government, and more jobs.\n  I can say with certainty that our work is not finished. But I say \nwith equal certainty that we have not wavered in our commitment to \nseeing it through. We will make every attempt as we enter the 105th \nCongress to finish the job we have started in the 104th.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I see there is no other Senator in the Chamber so \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10537-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a week ago, I was the only Member of this \nbody to vote against a mild resolution of support for our military \noperations in Iraq last week. I did so, Mr. President, because it \nseemed to me that our response fell between two more appropriate \nresponses and, as a consequence, was totally ineffective and \ninappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I felt last week--and I continue to feel the same way \ntoday--that we could have determined that in a civil conflict between \ntwo groups of fighting Kurds, one backed by Iraq and the other by Iran, \nthat we had no interest, simply that we had no dog in that fight.\n  On the other hand, by reason of the protection that we have provided \nfor Kurds, however uncivil in their conduct to one another, we could \nalso have responded militarily. Almost without exception, however, Mr. \nPresident, thoughtful academics, military scholars, and national \nsecurity experts have felt that the United States should not use its \nArmed Forces in combat in response to a challenge from another nation \nwithout doing so disproportionately.\n  What does that mean, Mr. President? It means that we should make \nabsolutely certain when we use our Armed Forces that the cost exacted \nof an aggressor, of an enemy, is considerably greater, measurably \ngreater, than the gains sought by that aggressor. If we don't use it \nwith that philosophy, we almost certainly will be disappointed in the \nresults of the use of our armed services and, of course, with respect \nto our national prestige.\n  I was convinced, Mr. President, that what we did last week was 5 \ncents worth of damage in response to a dollar's worth of gain on the \npart of Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi forces.\n  We launched 44 cruise missiles against Iraq last week in response to \nmilitary adventures on the part of Iraq in a northern protected zone in \nKurdistan. The act, as I have said, came in the midst of a civil war \nbetween two Kurdish factions, one backed by Iran and one by Iraq. We \nresponded not only inadequately, but we responded in the south part of \nIraq, while the fighting and the brutality was occurring in the north. \nThe result, according to the administration, was a U.S. victory. As one \nadministration official described it, ``We really whacked him.'' Now, a \nlittle more than a week later, the reality is considerably different.\n  Saddam Hussein has regained control over the northern part of his \ncountry. After many years of oppression of its people, whom he has \nbitterly oppressed, thousands of whom he has killed, he is continuing \nto fire at U.S. warplanes in the south. The administration is in the \nmidst of a review of its policy. Under most circumstances, Mr. \nPresident, when you are victorious, when you really whack them, it is \nthe other guy who changes what he is doing--not us.\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\n  But this is precisely the flaw in the administration's policy; rather \nthan respond to Iraq's military adventure in a manner that ensures that \nany such adventure costs far more than it is worth, we offered Band Aid \nsolutions. The result has been less than glowing. Almost certainly at \nthis point a reaction which will cost Iraq more than it has gained will \nrequire a greater investment and a greater risk than the investment and \nthe risk which we engaged in a week ago.\n  Let us reflect for just a moment on what last week's military \nresponse achieved. Is Saddam Hussein treating his people better? Has he \nbeen compelled to abide by a U.N. cease-fire? Has Iraq been contained? \nIs the United States better off now than it was before the military \naction? Do we have solid support from the allies and the anti-Iraq \ncoalition? The answer to each one of these questions is clearly no.\n  The coalition, masterfully constructed during the gulf war by \nPresident Bush, is frayed, if not defunct. Saddam Hussein is brazenly \nflaunting both U.S. and U.N. warnings and is scurrying to rebuild the \nvery sites we destroyed last week and told him not to rebuild. In the \nlast 2 or 3 days he has fired missiles at the aircraft patrolling the \nno-fly zone.\n  My friend, the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, said night \nbefore last that ``decisions about the dimensions of our response are, \nof course, the President's to make.''\n  Yet, the confusion continues. The day before yesterday the Secretary \nof Defense said that our response would be ``disproportionate.'' \nYesterday the Department of Defense says that the response will be \n``measured.'' Perhaps today we will have action that is \n``disproportionately measured.''\n  In any event, Mr. President, it seems to me that it is vitally \nimportant, first, that the President consult with our allies in the \nMideast in the coalition--something that he did not do earlier--second, \nthat he follow the War Powers Act and consult with the Congress. \nWhether he believes the War Powers Act to be constitutional or not, he \nwould be extremely wise to consult with the representatives of the \npeople of the United States before such an action rather than simply to \nask for ratification after that action.\n  We are worse off than we were a week ago, Mr. President. We face very \nserious dilemmas. We are almost without bases from which to mount any \nmilitary attack. The President is simply going to have to pay much more \nattention to the issue than he has in the past and build a much broader \ncoalition if we are not to lose everything that we gained at such high \ncost during the gulf war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10538-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, the music world lost one of its most devoted \nartists on Monday when the legendary Bill Monroe passed away at the age \nof 84. The Bible says:\n\n       The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if \n     by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their \n     strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we \n     fly away.\n\n  Bill Monroe lived to be 84.\n  His bluegrass music--the hybrid of folk, country, blues, and gospel \nstyles--originated in the United States more than 60 years ago and \ncontinues to be popular across the country. Nowhere is this more true \nthan in the Appalachian States, where it embraces the spirit of that \nregion. Bluegrass is brought to life by combining high tenor vocals \nwith instruments like the mandolin, fiddle--or violin--guitar, banjo, \nand bass, and is most often associated with Monroe, the creator and \nmaster of the style.\n\n  I was fortunate to have been able to play my fiddle with Bill Monroe \nin Boone County, West Virginia, when he appeared there years ago. I \nremember how enlivening it was to make music with such a first-rate \nmusician. Monroe's stage performance exuded the passion and dedication \nhe had for music. He told me how he believed in a, ``good, clean \nshow.'' Bill Monroe was a true gentleman. He never drank, smoked, or \nused offensive language. I remember he referred to liquor as ``slop,'' \nand would tell aspiring musicians to go onto the stage, ``looking right \nand smelling right,'' meaning that they should have no traces of \nwhiskey on their breath. Indeed, Monroe was a role model for the more \nthan 200 performers who played with The Blue Grass Boys throughout all \nof their Saturday evening appearances at the Opry. Musicians would \ntravel to Nashville just to be able to say they had had a chance to \nwork with the legendary performer.\n  And I would imagine that the Senator who is presently presiding over \nthis great body has been out to the Grand Ole Opry himself on a few \noccasions, being fortunate in that the Grand Ole Opry was in his native \nState of Tennessee.\n  Musicians would travel to Nashville just to be able to say they had \nhad a chance to work with this legendary performer.\n  William Smith Monroe was born in Rosine, Kentucky, on September 13, \n1911. His parents died when he was still young, and he went to live \nwith his Uncle Pen, a fiddle player.\n  There is a tune called ``Uncle Pen,'' and I am sure that it was the \nproduct of Bill Monroe's prolific musical mind and written in honor of \nhis uncle, Uncle Pen.\n  As the youngest of eight children in a musical family, Monroe learned \nabout music early on, influenced by secular and religious folk \ntraditions, gospel, blues, and Scottish and Irish fiddle tunes. He \nwould later tell people that his mastery of the mandolin stemmed from \nthe fact that his older siblings took their first pick of other \ninstruments. Later on, this proved to be a blessing, since much of \nMonroe's success is attributed to his mandolin's unique sound which \nbecame the signature instrument of his bluegrass music. Monroe and two \nof his brothers--Charlie, who played the guitar, and Birch, who played \nthe fiddle--moved to Chicago in 1930. The music they played there for \ndances and house parties was a traditional country style, but even in \nthose early years, it was characterized by a faster tempo and the high-\npitched harmonies that later evolved into Monroe's bluegrass trademark.\n  In 1938, Monroe auditioned for the Grand Ole Opry. The audition with \nOpry chief George Hay--the solemn old judge--was such a success that \nwhen Hay signed Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, he told them, ``If you \never leave the Opry, it'll be because you fired yourself!'' Monroe's \ndebut at the Opry marked the first time in the hall's history that the \naudience demanded an encore.\n  By the 1940's, Monroe's style was moving further from traditional \ncountry music and toward its own distinct sound. The country music \nscene considered his music too old fashioned to be called country music \nand the folk music scene wanted to maintain its image as a more \naffluent style. Monroe finally found a place for his music where he \nalways wanted it--in its own class. His style became known as \nBluegrass, as identified with his band, the Blue Grass Boys. In the \nlate 1940's, the classic Blue Grass Boys lineup featured Lester Flatt \non the guitar, and Earl Scruggs, who mastered the three-finger-roll \nbanjo technique which added to their distinct sound.\n  As a boy, I used to listen to people in West Virginia play the banjo. \nThey\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\nplayed it claw-hammer style. But when Bill Monroe came along--Earl \nScruggs developed a three-finger roll, which was very lively. That \nthree-finger roll had a great deal to do with putting the stamp on the \nmusic as bluegrass music.\n  Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys continued to please crowds at the Opry \nthrough the 1950's, and, in the 1960's, they began to appear in \nauditoriums throughout the country. In 1970, Monroe was inducted into \nthe Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n  Bluegrass music is no longer confined to rural communities in the \nheart of the Appalachian States. Today, Bill Monroe's songs are not \nlimited to public radio or the Nashville Network. The popularity of \nBluegrass has expanded, and is now an internationally recognized and \nappreciated form of music. Monroe's legacy will endure through the \nsounds that he invented, and in the bands that play his songs. He was \nan innovative and very gentlemanly performer who was an inspiration to \nother musicians, especially to country musicians. And I am thankful to \nhave had Bill Monroe as a friend. Although Bill Monroe will be missed \ndearly, his music and his legend will live on. His influence has \nforever changed the shape of the American music industry, and I know \nthat his sounds will continue to reverberate throughout the Appalachian \nMountains and through the hills and mountains and hollows of West \nVirginia and throughout the world for all years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10539-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the sunlit, wind-tossed, rolling plains of \nKansas have produced many leaders whose long vision and open minds have \nhelped to shape this Nation. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum is one of \nthose leaders. Her three terms in the Senate have left an enduring \nlegacy, one with roots as deep as the prairie grasses in the rich black \nKansas soil and covering issues as diverse as the many-colored \nwildflowers nestled among those blades. The Senate has been enriched by \nher civil, thoughtful, presence.\n  Senator Kassebaum's political inclinations are strongly rooted in the \nKansas earth. Her father, Alf Landon, a former Governor of Kansas, was \nnominated for President in 1936 to run against President Franklin \nRoosevelt. When Governor Landon died at age 100 in 1987, he had \nwitnessed in his daughter's election to the Senate and her rise to \nprominence in this body a part of the quiet revolution in American \nsociety that brought women into so many new fields. First elected in \n1978, Senator Kassebaum in 1994 became the first woman to chair a major \nSenate committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, since \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine led a special Committee on Rates \nof Compensation from 1953 to 1955.\n  Now, I had the great honor and privilege to serve with Margaret Chase \nSmith here in the Senate for a number of years, a woman whose \ndeclaration of conscience will always reverberate in this Chamber and \nwill always grace the pages of the great Record of this Chamber's \ndeliberations.\n  In the 104th Congress, Chairman Kassebaum--some would say \n``chairwoman''--has addressed some of the most contentious issues \ndebated in recent years, including health care reform, welfare reform, \nminimum wage increases, and striker replacement. Her fairness and her \ncivility in dealing with these contentious matters has been matched by \nher tenacity and her resourcefulness in crafting legislation that can \nbe passed by the Senate and signed by the President. I have not always \nagreed with her proposals--and she has not always agreed with mine--\nindeed, on many issues like the repeal of Davis-Bacon, on striker \nreplacement, we have been on opposite sides of the issue. But I commend \nSenator Kassebaum for her willingness to tackle difficult issues and to \npropose sweeping overhauls of complex and overlapping programs, such as \nwelfare, health insurance, Medicaid, and job training programs, and to \ndo so with courtesy and affability and respect for the others' views. \nNo one would ever underestimate the quiet strength of Senator \nKassebaum's convictions on these issues, but everyone can always count \nupon her straightforward, mannerly, courteous approach to debate and \ncompromise.\n  Senator Kassebaum has also chaired the African Affairs Subcommittee \nof the Committee on Foreign Relations. She was instrumental in both \nimplementing a sanctions regime against the white apartheid government \nof South Africa and in lifting those sanctions, once a new government \nwas installed. She has been a strong voice for tolerance and compassion \nin a part of the world all too often racked by violence and ethnic \nhatreds. It was for these noble reasons that she called in June, 1992, \nfor the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Somalia, after \nvisiting that strife-torn nation. She steadfastly spoke up for these \nhumanitarian concerns, even as I led an effort to withdraw U.S. troops \nfrom Somalia as the situation there deteriorated, eventually resulting \nin the tragic loss of 18 U.S. military personnel. But in the final \nvote, acknowledging the reality that the United States public would not \nsupport committing still more military men and women to Somalia, a \nrequirement if the humanitarian mission was to be carried out in \nrelative safety, Senator Kassebaum voted for an orderly withdrawal from \nthat sad nation.\n\n  One issue upon which Senator Kassebaum and I see eye-to-eye on is \nschool prayer. Despite the differences in topography, Kansas and West \nVirginia share in their solid small towns and on the farms and among \nthe country folk a closeness with the earth and a reverence for the \ndeity, a reverence for the church and for the community. Senator \nKassebaum offered an amendment in 1994 to withhold Federal funds from \nany local school district found guilty of willfully violating a court \norder to allow constitutionally-protected prayer. Her amendment passed \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 93 yeas to 7 nays.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kassebaum shares in the strength of her Kansas \nupbringing, the solid strength of her Kansas forbearers. She sets her \neye on a distant legislative target and she plows a straight furrow \ntoward it, undaunted by distance or by difficulty. She speaks plainly, \nsoftly, and honestly, preparing the seedbed of civil bipartisan \ncompromise. She is willing to cross party lines to vote for programs \nthat result in the greatest common good as she sees it. By her actions, \nshe has shown herself to be concerned more about the future of the \nNation than the future of partisan politics. Her twin strengths of \nperseverance and courtesy have earned for her the respect and the \ngenuine admiration of her peers and of the Nation. It is these \nqualities that have been in short supply during the bellicose and often \nbitterly partisan past several years in the Senate, and which will be \nso sorely missed when she retires from office.\n  And so I thank Nancy Kassebaum for her service to the State of \nKansas, to the Senate, and to the United States, and wish her well in \nher retirement. Senator Kassebaum has said that she wants to spend more \ntime with her grandchildren. Robert Southey (1774-1843) wrote in the \npoem, the ``Battle of Blenheim'':\n\n     It was a summer evening,\n     Old Kaspar's work was done,\n     And he before his cottage door\n     Was sitting in the sun,\n     And by him sported on the green\n     His little grandchild Wilhelmine.\n\n  I hope that Senator Kassebaum, her battles in the Senate over, past, \nand done, may treasure the pleasures and joys of sporting in the Kansas \nsun with her children and their children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I note the change from Senator Frist \nto you, Madam President, and so I address you properly as Madam \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10540-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10540-S10546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE BURDENSHARING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to report \nbriefly on a trip which I made from August 16 through August 31 of this \nyear. Madam President, the trip focused on a number of key items in my \ntravels which took me to Korea, Japan, and\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nChina, then to the Gulf States of Oman, Saudi Arabia, then to Israel \nand Syria, with a brief stop in Paris, and back to the United States.\n  One of the themes of concern to me, Madam President, was the issue of \nthe enormous U.S. military expenditure, and the need to have \nburdensharing from our allies where we are maintaining so much of the \ncost of defense.\n  The Japanese are paying 70 percent of the cost. But it seems to me \nrealistic that with their enormous gross national product, and their \nability to pay their own defenses, that even 70 percent is not \nsufficient in the context of spending so little of their own money on \nnational defense. The 70-percent figure is much larger than the moneys \npaid by the Saudis, where we have recently seen plans to move our base \nfrom Dhahran to the desert with a 50-percent sharing by the Saudis. But \neven there, when we are there to protect their interests and they are a \nvery affluent nation, it seems to me that more ought to be undertaken \nby the Saudis. In South Korea, we have 37,000 American troops, and \nthere have long been suggestions that some of those troops ought to be \nwithdrawn.\n\n  South Korea, again, is a very prosperous nation. Some of their \ndefense planning is long range, not on the immediate potential threat \nfrom North Korea. And there again, it would be reasonable to have more \ncost sharing by the South Koreans. I suggest that our defense policy \nought to undertake a look globally beyond NATO as to burdensharing with \nthe specific reference to Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.\n  During the course of travels, we also had a considerable focus on the \nnuclear threat, and, potentially, real problems in North Korea, where \nthey have the wherewithal to have nuclear weapons, and where they have \nballistic missiles which are reported to have sufficient thrust to \nreach Japan or Alaska, and far beyond.\n  The situation in North Korea is very unstable. I had hoped to visit \nNorth Korea personally, and had some preliminary indications, up to the \nstart of the trip, that we could do so, but at the last minute we were \ntold we could not visit North Korea.\n  The situation there is unstable because of the shortage of food, and \nI think that we have to engage the North Koreans. We have to do what we \ncan to see that there is a stable government there. Assistance on food \nis elementary. Japan and South Korea are aiding. We are to some extent, \nbut we have to keep a close watch on the volatility, and the potential \ninstability in North Korea.\n  When we traveled to China, a key focus of attention was the trade \nissue, and we were told that trade is not calculated properly because \nof certain statistics coming from Hong Kong. But we made the point as \nemphatically as we could that there needed to be more reciprocity and \nmore openness of the Chinese markets. We visited the city of Harbin in \nManchuria and saw really great potential for American growth, the \ngrowth of American trade, meeting with United States businessmen in \nthat community.\n  While in China, we also took up the issue of freedom of religion, \nnoting the fact that Christians were not permitted to practice \nreligion, and recent activities by the Chinese Government inhibited \nfreedom of religion by Christians, and by Jews, and those with \ndifferent religious views. We were assured, but I think vacuously, in \ntheir statements that there was freedom of religion, but the facts are \nvery much to the contrary. And we asserted that point with some \nforcefulness.\n  We also took up the issue of the sale of M-11 missiles from China to \nPakistan. We protested that very strongly. We were told by the Chinese \nthat they had not violated international accords, and there again a \nstalemate in our discussions.\n  There is a real question as to how we deal with the Chinese, whether \nby sanctions or totally by diplomacy. My sense is we have to consider \nsanctions. With the Chinese destabilizing the subcontinent of Taiwan, \nfiring their own ballistic missiles close to Taiwan, it seems to me \nthat we have to be forceful and really consider the imposition of \nsanctions there.\n  Moving on to Saudi Arabia, we had an opportunity to view the Khobar \nTowers site at Dhahran, a subject I reported on briefly in a floor \nstatement yesterday--an enormous tragedy, 19 Americans killed, hundreds \nwounded. Seeing the perimeter fence less than 60 feet from Khobar \nTowers, it was apparent, on a cursory inspection, that it was an open \ninvitation to terrorism. As noted in my floor statement yesterday, it \nwas my conclusion that there had been ample warnings about the \npotentiality of terrorists at the perimeter fence, and the possible use \nof a large bomb.\n  That is something that will be considered in greater detail by the \nDowning Task Force, but there is an urgent need for stepped-up force \nprotection, certainly in places like Khobar Towers, and doubtless \naround the world considering the escalating threat of terrorism.\n  We had a chance to meet with Defense Minister Sultan, Crown Prince \nAbdullah, and urged cooperation with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation on the inquiries to determine who the terrorists were at \nKhobar Towers, and reregistered our complaints that the FBI had not an \nopportunity to interview the four men who were executed for the \nNovember 13, 1995, car bombing in Riyadh, and raised the issue about \nthe need for Saudi Arabia to undertake a greater share of the cost of \nthe defense burdens.\n\n  Before arriving in Saudi Arabia, we made a brief stop in Mongolia, an \nindependent nation, landlocked between China and Russia, quite a \nproduct of an emerging democracy, having thrown off the yoke of the \nSoviet Union even before its disintegration. There we saw an effort for \ndemocratic process succeeding in its embryo stage, and an effort for \nthe free market.\n  Coming to the Mideast, we had an opportunity to confer with Prime \nMinister Netanyahu, Syrian President Assad, and Palestinian Chairman \nArafat. There is obvious difficulty with the new government being beset \nby problems on all sides. We find disagreements within the Likud \ngovernment, but it is my impression that Prime Minister Netanyahu is up \nto the challenge.\n  We had an extended discussion with Chairman Yasser Arafat, and I must \nsay that every time I meet with Chairman Arafat, it is a wonder to me \nthat we are doing business with a man who has had such a long record of \nterrorism. Going back to September 13, 1993, when then Prime Minister \nRabin, and then Foreign Minister Peres shook the hand of Yasser Arafat, \nit seemed to me that if the Israeli leaders were prepared to do so, the \nUnited States should be supportive of their efforts toward the peace \nprocess. Certainly the Israelis have suffered the major burden of the \nterrorist attack by the PLO in the Mideast area.\n  In the conversations with Chairman Arafat, we discussed the \nresolution that Senator Shelby and I had introduced, which was enacted, \nwhich conditioned U.S. aid on a change of the PLO charter. Chairman \nArafat assured us it had been done. And when he produced the document, \nit was evident on its face that it was insufficient, the document \nsaying merely that all provisions inconsistent with the September 13, \n1993, agreement would be revoked. That is not sufficient, and we made \nthat point as emphatically as we could.\n  We then talked about terrorism, and with Yasser Arafat, a man who has \nbeen on a first-name basis, and has dealt with the terrorists of the \narea, Abu Nidal, Abu Abbas and Hamas, and emphasized as strongly as we \ncould the need for the Palestinian authority to be proactive in \nstopping terrorist attacks in that area.\n  Chairman Arafat assured us that he was doing what he could, \nemphasized the point that he himself was subject to terrorist \nassassination plots, and said that he would do what he could. But I \nthink that is an area which requires increasing U.S. pressure. We need \nto be as emphatic as we can that if we are to continue United States \nmilitary aid to the Palestinians, they are going to have to take \neffective action against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, in accordance with my practice to report on foreign \ntravel, this floor statement summarizes a trip taken from August 16 \nthrough 31, 1996, to Asia and the Mideast, focusing on the North Korean \nthreat, the question of sanctions against China for selling M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan and for firing a ballistic missile 100 miles from\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\nTaiwan, the June 25 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the Mideast \npeace process and terrorism, with a stop in Paris for discussions on \nterrorism and trade en route back to the United States.\n  We had hoped to visit North Korea to personally inspect the North \nKorean nuclear facility and to meet with North Korean leaders. But, \ndespite several months of efforts, the North Koreans ultimately refused \nto allow my visit.\n  We were able, however, to discuss the North Korean situation with \nlocal American authorities and with leaders of North Korea's immediate \nneighbors: Japan, South Korea, and China. Specifically, we met with \nAmerican military leaders, including our commanders in Japan and South \nKorea; Japanese, Korean, and Chinese foreign affairs and trade \nministers; and with our ambassadors and embassy teams. We wanted to \ninvestigate not only the North Korean threat, but whether we should ask \nSouth Korea to shoulder a larger share of the defense burden--no small \nmatter when we face deficits and difficult domestic spending cuts.\n  Upon arrival in Japan on the evening of August 18, we met with Marine \nBrig. Gen. Terrance Murray, deputy commander of United States forces in \nJapan. I continued my discussion with General Murray and his top aides \nthe next morning, focusing largely on the North Korean threat and the \nallocation of United States resources in Japan. It struck me that our \narrangement with Japan, in which the Japanese Government pays 70 \npercent of the cost of United States forces in Japan, offered a model \nfor renegotiating with South Korea, and our costs in defending Saudi \nArabia. When dealing with such prosperous nations, there is no reason \nwhy they should not pay the full cost of their own defense.\n  Following our second meeting with General Murray, we met with Rust \nDeming, our Charge d'Affaires, and the Embassy team in Tokyo. We agreed \nthat Congress should focus on unfair trade practices in Japan that cost \nAmerican companies millions of dollars and American workers tens of \nthousands of jobs. By demonstrating sustained interest in trade issues, \nand by more congressional visits to Japan, we can send Japan a message \nthat the United States has staying power.\n  Mr. Deming and his team of issues experts discussed how American \ncompanies find themselves competing for a small portion of various \nJapanese markets, or find themselves shut out entirely, as networks of \nJapanese firms buy only from each other, while enjoying the profits as \nAmerican firms buy from them. We do not even have the recourse of some \ndeveloping nations, which are allowed under GATT to set formulas that \nrequire, for example, that the Japanese build one automobile in a host \ncountry for every given number of cars they sell there.\n  Industries in which American firms suffer from unfair Japanese market \nrestrictions include semiconductors, automobiles and auto parts, \ninsurance and civil aviation. Several major corporations in my own \nState of Pennsylvania are being handcuffed.\n\n  Following my meeting with the Tokyo Embassy team, I took up trade \nissues in an hour-long meeting with Masaki Orita, Director General of \nJapan's North American Affairs Bureau. I told Mr. Orita there was a lot \nof anger in America, which I see almost every time I hold an open-house \ntown meeting in Pennsylvania, that American markets are open to Japan, \nbut Japanese markets are closed to America. I told Mr. Orita I did not \nagree with him that the atmosphere has improved on United States-\nJapanese trade, when we face a $59.5 billion deficit even though it has \nbeen reduced from $65 billion.\n  After our meeting, I asked Mr. Orita to pose for a photograph with \nme. As I prepared to snap the photo, Mr. Orita remarked with pleasure \nthat my Olympus pocket camera was made in Japan. I told Mr. Orita that \nwe believed in free markets, and were pleased to buy Japanese products, \nif they were the best available at the best prices. I said Japan ought \nto allow Kodak to compete with Fuji in its film market.\n  When my flash failed to fire, Mr. Orita immediately said the problem \nwas with the batteries, and not with the camera. I told Mr. Orita that \nmy batteries were also made in Japan.\n  I brought up trade again at my next meeting, with Kenzo Oshima, \nDeputy Director General of Japan's Asian Affairs Bureau. During our \nhour-long talk, we also focused on the North Korean situation and the \nprospect for Four Power Talks among the United States, North Korea, \nSouth Korea, and Japan.\n  Mr. Oshima told me he was apprehensive about North Korean military \naggression.\n  North Korea is already over the line, I said. By legal definition, an \narm raised in a threat to strike--or missiles massed on the DMZ--\nconstitutes assault. The actual act of striking constitutes battery.\n  We agreed that food should be given to North Korea for humanitarian \nreasons, even at the risk that some of our contributions would be \ndiverted to uses that increase friction on the Korean Peninsula.\n  On costs, I pressed Mr. Oshima that Japan should contribute more to \nthe North Korean process, especially in light of an additional $25 \nmillion in United States aid recently approved by the United States \nSenate. Mr. Oshima promised a meaningful contribution from Japan, but \nwould not offer a figure.\n  On Tuesday, August 20, we met in Seoul, South Korea, for 2 hours with \nAmbassador James Laney, members of the Embassy team, and Marine Maj. \nGen. Frank Libutti. Our experts stressed that we faced a threat of \nmiscalculation or desperation from North Korea. Ambassador Laney and \nGeneral Libutti, like the experts in Japan, thought the North Korean \nregime was weakening, and was near destabilization.\n  Mr. Laney noted that the room where we were sitting at the United \nStates Embassy in Seoul was 23.4 miles from the North Korean border. \nGeneral Libutti added that a North Korean rocket could reach Seoul in \nless than 1 minute.\n  We also discussed efforts to find remains of the 8,000 United States \nsoldiers unaccounted for during the Korean war. Until recently, those \nefforts have been stymied by North Korea's refusal to admit United \nStates search teams. But recently, joint United States-Korean \nteams have found some remains.\n\n  I told Mr. Laney that South Korea should pay more of the costs of the \nprotection it enjoys from the 37,000 United States troops stationed \nthere. Under a 1954 treaty, the United States pledged to defend South \nKorea, a rare and sweeping commitment. I noted that Japan pays 70 \npercent of the cost of the United States forces within its borders, \nwhile South Korea now pays only one third of its cost, and is scheduled \nto pay an additional 10 percent each year. I told Ambassador Laney that \nI did not find that arrangement adequate.\n  We met next at Yongsan Garrison, headquarters of the combined United \nStates-Korean force, for an hour with Gen. John Tilelli, the United \nStates commander in chief. We discussed the North Korean threat and \nmilitary strategy in some detail. General Libutti also attended and \nparticipated in that meeting. We discussed, in greater detail than I \nhad with General Murray in Japan, the massive, 3-week war game that \nUnited States and its allies had just begun involving various scenarios \nof military conflicts with North Korea. I told General Tilelli I \nthought it was essential, apart from the game's value as training, to \nshow the North Koreans that we are ready.\n  Afterward, we met with Ambassador Yoo Chong Ha, South Korea's Senior \nPresidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs. We \nhad a somewhat tense conversation about whether South Korea could not \nshare more of its defense costs. I pointed out that Congress was very \nuneasy about the amount of money we are spending in South Korea, and \nabout the number of United States troops stationed there. I pressed Mr. \nHa that South Korea should contribute more toward its own defense. I \nasked him why South Korea should not bear the entire cost of its \ndefense.\n  Mr. Ha replied that South Korea is already buying substantial amounts \nof United States armaments, and is increasing its share of defense \ncosts. Stating my own personal disagreement, I said that South Korea \nwas not paying enough.\n  Our final meeting in Seoul was with South Korean Foreign Minister \nGong Ro Myung. We talked at length about\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nNorth Korea's terrorist threat. I noted that North Korea remains on our \nterrorist nations list, which bars most United States contact.\n  While North Korea has not been charged with committing a terrorist \nact since 1987, Mr. Myung said he was investigating allegations that a \nNorth Korean agent had murdered a South Korean man in China just a week \nearlier, in mid-August.\n  On August 20, we traveled to Harbin, China, a sprawling city of 3 \nmillion in Heilongjiang Province. We were especially interested in \nvisiting China's outlying provinces to get a feel for United States \nmarket potential. In Harbin, we continued our talks on trade. We were \naccompanied throughout by United States Consul General Carl Wycoff.\n  We met with Gov. Tian Fengshan, leader of the Heilongjiang Province, \nand discussed opportunities for development and American industry \nwithin his borders. The Governor said he was encouraging Americans and \nother foreigners to invest in his province, and was working on a \ncooperative agreement with the State of Alaska.\n  I met next with a group of American businessmen working in the Harbin \narea. They reported frustration with China's redtape. A fiberglass pipe \nmanufacturer, for example, complained about Chinese requirements that \nhe secure a separate permit for every shipment of the same type of \nimported materials.\n\n  We were warned that the Chinese often welcome innovators, learn their \ntechniques, and exploit them or force them out.\n  In the evening, we attended a dinner with the Deputy Governor and \nseveral of his aides. We covered a gamut of subjects, including free \nelections and the democratic process. The Deputy Governor, proposed by \nthe State committee, had been elected without opposition. In response \nto my question, he said he found Boris Yeltsin's recent campaign for \nPresident of Russia, including campaign stops at a disco, effective in \nappealing to voters.\n  On August 21, I met with the Vice-President and several professors at \nthe Harbin Institute of Technology, all of whom had been among the \nfirst wave of Chinese academics who studied in the United States in the \nearly 1980's. One computer science professor had briefly been one of my \nconstituents, when he studied for 2 years at Carnegie Mellon University \nin Pittsburgh.\n  I toured the city, including stops at an open market and a western-\nstyle department store, and was struck by the strong demand for western \nmechanized goods, and the opportunity for American firms. I chose to \nvisit Harbin largely because it was not a westernized southern port, \nwhich draws most foreign traffic and interest.\n  On August 21, we traveled to Mongolia, largely to investigate what \nthe United States could do to foster the fragile democracy and market \neconomy that only recently freed itself from the Soviet yoke.\n  Upon arrival in the evening in the capital city of Ulaan Baatar, we \nmet with Charge d'Affaires Llewellyn Hedgbeth, members of the Embassy \nteam, Peace Corps Director Mark Zober, and three Peace Corps volunteers \nassigned to Mongolia.\n  In the morning, we met with the economic adviser to the Prime \nMinister, an American policy expert named Jim Bikales; with the Chief \nof the Mongolian National Intelligence Agency, Dalhjavyn Sandag; and \nwith the Secretary of the Mongolian National Security Agency, \nJargalsaihany Enkhsaihan. We discussed the host of economic travails \nthreatening Mongolia's fledgling market economy, including a banking \ncrisis that spurred a credit shortage; a budget crisis; and shrinking \nGDP growth.\n  We met next with Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, Chairman of the Hural, \nthe Mongolian Parliament. Mr. Gonchigdorj said U.S. assistance is \nvital, especially for a Mongolian economy so weak that social services \nare an unaffordable luxury. I told the chairman that his country was a \nshining example of the trend toward democracy, and that we wanted to \nhelp, and would help, but faced a deficit problem of our own.\n  Asked for my suggestions, I urged the chairman and his colleagues to \nprivatize as soon as possible the two-thirds of the Mongolian economy \nthat they have not yet privatized.\n  Later in the day, we returned to the Government complex to meet with \nPrime Minister Mendsaihny Enkhsaihan, an economist by training. For \nalmost an hour, we discussed primarily economic and fiscal matters. The \nPrime Minister told me his goal was to privatize 60 percent of state \nassets by the year 2000. I urged him, as I had urged Hural Chairman \nGonchigdorj, to privatize the rest of the economy as fast as he could.\n  We spent the evening with Sanjaasurenglin Zorig, a key government \nleader who holds the title Chairman of the Standing Committee on State \nStructure, and several other members of the Hural. During a wide-\nranging, 2-hour conversation, I urged Mr. Zorig, as I had urged the \nPrime Minister and Hural Chairman earlier, to privatize the rest of the \neconomy.\n  I was struck to learn that Mr. Zorig and several of his colleagues \nhad followed the 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice \nClarence Thomas, which they had watched on then-Soviet television. I \nwas heartened that they grasped, through the often-heated proceedings \nand Soviet censorship, the theme of judicial independence that we \nAmericans prize.\n  From Mongolia, we flew to Beijing, China, on August 23 for a series \nof meetings with Chinese national leaders and with United States \nAmbassador James Sasser, a former Senate colleague, and his Embassy \nteam.\n  My concerns included China's sales to Pakistan of M-11 missiles, \nwhich could potentially deliver nuclear warheads to India; Chinese \nballistic missile tests near Taiwan; China's relationship with North \nKorea; our trade deficit with China; and human rights violations, \nincluding alleged persecution of Christians.\n  After an hour-long discussion with Ambassador Sasser and his experts, \nwe attended a luncheon with Chinese Friendship Association President \nLui Shuqing, who serves as an ambassador to American Government \nleaders. After much prodding, he allowed that China fired ballistic \nmissiles within 100 miles of Taiwan as a warning to the breakaway \nrepublic not to go too far down the road to independence.\n  We met next for an hour with Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who also \nserves as China's Foreign Minister. Mr. Qian was also guarded, from the \noutset. Mr. Qian flatly maintained that China had not sold missiles to \nPakistan in violation of international agreements, despite evidence and \nacknowledgments. ``We'll just have to disagree about that,'' I told the \nVice Premier. I added that the Senate was considering taking action \nagainst China, including sanctions.\n  Mr. Qian said the Chinese opposed sanctions on principle, because \nthey were unwarranted. He added that sanctions would not work against \nChina, and were a two-edged sword that could hurt both China and the \nUnited States. On trade, the Vice Premier and I again reached an \nimpasse. I maintained that a $35 billion trade imbalance was \nunacceptable. Mr. Qian dismissed the disparity as a matter of my \nstatistics, which he said improperly included trade with Hong Kong. \nWhen I told the Vice Premier we were concerned about freedom of \nreligion for Christians in China, he assured me that China allows \nfreedom of worship for all sects.\n  We ended the day with a meeting, followed by a formal dinner, with \nDeputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cao Cangchuan, the equivalent to our \nvice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Our substantive \nconversation focused on defense budgets and manpower allocation.\n  We traveled to Muscat, Oman, on August 24, to begin a series of \nMideast stops, focusing on the Mideast peace process; the Khobar Towers \nbombing and terrorism; Iran's role in the region and its relationship \nwith the United States; and Saudi Arabia's role in and reimbursement \nfor its own defense.\n  After a briefing by Ambassador Frances Cook and members of her \nEmbassy team, we met for an hour with Sayyid Badr, Chief of the Omani \nOffice of the Foreign Minister. I complimented Mr. Badr for Oman's \nrecognition of and rapport with Israel, including the two nations' \nexchange of trade representatives and Oman's lifting of its boycott \nagainst Israel several months earlier. Mr. Badr said Oman's \nrelationship with Israel was complicated by Oman's need to maintain\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nrelations with its Arab neighbors who were hostile to the Jewish State.\n  We began the morning of August 25 by having breakfast with \nPennsylvanians on the Embassy staff. Afterward, I fielded questions \nfrom Omani journalists at an airport news conference, mostly offering \nmy assessments on the prospects for Mideast peace and for combating \nterrorism. We have to be tougher with Iran, which may be sponsoring \nterrorism and fundamentalism, I told the reporters. On the issue of the \nJune 25 Khobar Towers bombing, which may have been state-sponsored, I \nsaid terrorism today is an act of war, and we did not intend to be \nvictims of acts of war without reprisal.\n  We spent August 25 in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, inspecting the Khobar \nTowers Air Force apartments that were hit by the June 25 truck bomb, \nand discussing the situation with base commander Maj. Gen. Kurt \nAnderson, Brig. Gen. Dan Dick, Consul Gen. Doug Green, Capt. Rick \nReddecliff of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and FBI \nand CIA officials. My staff and I conducted interviews, then held a \ndetailed discussion at the Consul General's headquarters and toured the \napartment complex. Afterward, I met with 20 officers and airmen who had \nbeen in Khobar Towers when the bomb exploded, including many who were \ninjured.\n  Khobar Towers Building 131 was a horrible sight, more ghastly up \nclose than even television or news photographs can convey. The \nbuilding's front wall had been sheared off by the blast, exposing \ntwisted wreckage and blood-stained walls. The wire fence in front of \nthe building, the subject of so much controversy, measured 60 feet as I \npaced it off--far less than the 80 feet as previously reported.\n  The officers and airmen who had been at Khobar Towers on the night of \nJune 25 described, calmly and precisely, how the blast blew out their \nwindows, lacerating them with glass shards, and propelled them across \ntheir living rooms. I told them that the United States now has \nextraterritorial jurisdiction, based on a 1984 law that I helped draft, \nto investigate terrorist attacks against Americans anywhere in the \nworld. I told them terrorism is a war, and that we would do our utmost \nto bring those responsible to justice.\n  We traveled to Riyadh in the evening, and discussed the Mideast \nsituation with Charge D'Affaires Theodore Kattouf, the Embassy team, \nand senior Air Force, focusing on Saudi Arabia's contribution to \nregional defense.\n  I expressed the opinion that Saudi Arabia, with its oil wealth, \nshould pay more of the costs of United States forces committed to \ndefend the kingdom, citing as an example Japan's 70 percent \ncontribution to the cost of United States forces there. We have vital \nnational interests in the Mideast, but it is, first, a Saudi property \nright that we are protecting. I noted there was great concern in the \nCongress about Saudi Arabia's refusal to let us interrogate the four \nsuspects in the November 13 car bombing in OPM-SANG in Riyadh that \nkilled five Americans.\n  In mid-morning of August 26, we flew to Jeddah for meetings with \nSaudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz Saud and Saudi Defense \nMinister Prince Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud.\n  In each hour-long meeting, we focused on the Khobar Towers bombing \nand Mideast terrorism. In response to my questions, each Saudi leader \nsaid some suspects had already been arrested in the Khobar Towers \nbombing, some had been released, and the process was continuing. I \nasked whether the Saudis would allow the CIA and FBI to interrogate \nsuspects in the Khobar Towers attack when they are found, noting our \nconcern that United States officials were denied the chance to \ninterrogate the OPM-SANG suspects before they were beheaded. The crown \nprince was noncommittal, but the defense minister indicated such \ninterviews would be permitted.\n  At each meeting, I asked whether the United States would be justified \nin taking military action against any nation which might be responsible \nfor the Khobar Towers bombing. By reference, I cited our bombing raid \nagainst Libya in 1986, in retaliation for the German discotheque blast \nthat killed two American soldiers and our missile attack on the Iraqi \nIntelligence headquarters following discovery of the Iraqi plan to \nassassinate former President Bush.\n  Neither agreed with such retaliatory action. The crown prince \nvolunteered a reference to Hizbollah and said if Hizbollah is found to \nbe involved, retaliation should be directed against them.\n  Each Saudi leader rejected my suggestion that Saudi Arabia exchange \nambassadors or trade representatives with Israel. Such an exchange \nwould work against peace, the defense minister said.\n  We traveled to Israel on the afternoon of August 26, and proceeded \ndirectly to a gathering in Tel Aviv for Israel's new ambassador to the \nUnited States, Eliahu Ben Elissar.\n  We began the next morning with an hour-long briefing from United \nStates Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, focusing on the dynamics of \nIsrael's new Likud Government and the challenges it faces, at home and \nfrom its Mideast neighbors.\n  From there, we met for an hour with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu said he wanted to begin peace negotiations \nwith his Arab neighbors, and felt bound by the Oslo Accords that \nIsrael's Rabin/Peres government had signed before Mr. Netanyahu took \noffice, even though those agreements did not reflect Mr. Netanyahu's \nown position. The Prime Minister said, however, that he was not \nobligated to go beyond those contracts, which were vague. He said that \nfriction with Syrian President Assad, among others, centered on \ndifferences over the extent of Israel's commitments.\n  Mr. Netanyahu said he was eager to get to the negotiating table with \nSyrian President Assad. I noted that years earlier, I had urged Mr. \nAssad, without success, to meet with Mr. Shamir when he was Israel's \nPrime Minister. Prime Minister Netanyahu asked me to carry a message to \nPresident Assad, whom I was scheduled to meet with the next day.\n  We next met for an hour with Natan Sharansky, the dissident and \nformer Soviet prisoner turned Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade. \nMr. Sharansky, whose immigrant party now holds seven seats in Knesset, \nsaid he wanted to accelerate immigration into Israel, but was \ncontending with Israeli housing that, as he put it, took the worst from \ncapitalism and socialism. I told him my father had immigrated from \nUkraine to the United States as a boy in 1911, and that I understood \nthe immigrant's position. We agreed that Russian Jews should have a \nchoice where they emigrate, rather than being limited to Israel.\n\n  We met next with David Levy, the Israeli Foreign Minister. Mr. Levy \nsaid he was not satisfied that Palestinian Chairman Yasir Arafat was \ndoing enough to combat terrorism. I told Mr. Levy that legislation I \nsponsored with Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, which is now law, \nrequires the Palestinians to crack down on terrorism and to delete \nreferences in their charter to the destruction of Israel, in order to \nreceive $500 million in United States aid.\n  Mr. Levy replied that Mr. Arafat had told him the charter changes \nwould have to go before a committee and would take 6 months. Mr. Levy \nsaid he told Mr. Arafat those efforts did not satisfy Israel. I told \nMr. Levy I had pressed Mr. Arafat about the charter changes in the \npast, and that I would press him again when I met with the Palestinian \nleader later in the day.\n  I also asked Mr. Levy if he wanted me to convey any message to Syrian \nPresident Assad. Mr. Levy asked me to tell Mr. Assad to cease creating \nan atmosphere of terrorism, and that the Israelis were willing to enter \ndirect negotiations with the Syrians without preconditions.\n  We met next with former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Mr. \nShamir maintained unequivocally that Israel must be strong and hard in \nits negotiations with its Arab neighbors, or will get nothing. He \ninveighed against any Israeli concessions, including land for peace.\n  His position has always been the same, I told the former Prime \nMinister.\n  We met next with Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, the former \ngeneral. Mr. Sharon said Israel is struggling to accommodate an ongoing \nimmigration in the face of increasing water shortages. One of Mr. \nSharon's deputies said the water crisis is more\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\ndifficult than the Arab-Israeli situation. But Mr. Sharon, touting the \neducation and skills of Israeli immigrants, said the desert nation \nwould find a way to provide enough water for all its newcomers, even if \na million Jews emigrate from the United States.\n  In response to a question about the controversy over a possible \nIsraeli withdrawal from Hebron, Minister Sharon produced a map of the \ncity and detailed the thousands of years of Jewish presence there. The \nminister stated that Israel would give the 100,000 Palestinians who \nreside in Hebron control of the city only under an arrangement that \nprotects the rights and interests of the Jewish population there.\n  We ended August 27 with an evening meeting with Palestinian Chairman \nYasser Arafat at Mr. Arafat's Gaza headquarters. Chairman Arafat opened \nour 90-minute session with a litany of complaints about his treatment \nby the Israelis, including the demolition of a community center earlier \nin the day.\n  I pressed Chairman Arafat about his obligations, under the Specter-\nShelby amendment, to crack down on terrorism and to delete from the \nPalestinian charter all calls for the destruction of Israel, in order \nto receive the United States aid.\n  Chairman Arafat claimed that he had deleted all references to \ndestroying Israel from the Palestinian charter, at great personal and \npolitical cost. He said he had cut so much from the Palestinian charter \nthat nothing remained of the document, and that the charter would have \nto be redrafted, probably in November or December. The Chairman showed \nme documents that he said proved he had made the required changes. \nAfter reviewing those documents, I said the changes were insufficient. \nAll that was said was that all references to Israel were revoked where \ninconsistent with the September 13, 1993 agreement.\n\n  Chairman Arafat told me he had been warned that Iranians would \nassassinate him for changing the charter. I asked Mr. Arafat what we \ncould do to stop terrorism. He replied that it was very difficult. He \nsuggested we pressure Libya through the United Nations, rather than by \ntaking unilateral action.\n  The next day, August 28, we traveled to Damascus to meet with Syrian \nPresident Assad. Our meeting lasted 3\\1/2\\ hours. We focused on the \nMideast peace process and on terrorism. I conveyed Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu's message that Israel had only peaceful intentions \ntoward Syria, that both sides should move immediately to reduce \nmilitary tensions, and that Mr. Netanyahu wanted to reopen direct \nnegotiations between Israel and Syria.\n  President Assad replied that Syria would not go back to the table \nuntil Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirms the land-for-peace basis of \nnegotiations, and agrees to pick up where Israel's previous Labor \nGovernment left off. President Assad dismissed current Syrian troop \nmovements in Southern Lebanon as merely technical and routine, and not \nthreatening. He rejected a Lebanon-first approach, the Israeli offer to \nnegotiate the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon as a first step \nbefore re-opening bilateral peace talks.\n  I urged President Assad to sit down with Prime Minister Netanyahu, \neven if they seemed to have no common ground.\n  On the issue of terrorism, I told President Assad the American press \nhad reported that the bomb-making materials used in the Khobar Towers \nblast had passed through Syria. He said that this was possible. He said \nit was unlikely that Iran was involved in the bombing. I urged \nPresident Assad repeatedly to share with us any information that he may \nget about the Khobar Towers bombing.\n  President Assad suggested the United States adopt a law-enforcement \nresponse to terrorism, rather than a military response. As for the \nHizbollah and other terrorist groups reputed to operate within Syria, \nPresident Assad asserted he had no control over what some individuals \ndo, and that it was inappropriate for the United States to ask Syria to \ngo to war against these groups, even though Syria had the power to \ndestroy them. Hizbollah considers itself to have the political and \nreligious duty to liberate its land, President Assad said, and has \ntaken a leading role in the struggle with Israel.\n  After returning to Israel in the evening, I met again with Israeli \nPrime Minister Netanyahu, to brief him on my discussion with President \nAssad, and telephoned Foreign Minister Levy for the same purpose.\n  We made a final stop in Paris on the way back to the United States, \nto explore the French and European response to terrorism and France's \nrelationship with Iran and the Middle East.\n  We met for an hour with French Interior Minister Jean Louis Debre, \nwho is roughly equivalent to the United States Attorney General, and at \nlength with United States Ambassador Pamela Harriman and her Embassy \nteam.\n  Madam President, there is a great deal more to be said, but I know \ncolleagues are awaiting floor time for morning business. So I will \nconclude this summary, noting that a much more extensive comment than \nmy floor statement is contained in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the conclusion of \nmy remarks, an article which I wrote for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]\n\n        Host Nations Must Cover More Costs of U.S. Troops Abroad\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       The truck bomb that killed 19 Americans at the Khobar \n     Towers Air Force apartments June 25 has left Building 131 a \n     faceless, four-story mass of twisted wreckage and blood-\n     stained walls that bakes in the Saudi Arabian sun. The \n     destruction is more grisly up close than in any news \n     photograph, as I discovered last month while inspecting the \n     complex during a Senate Intelligence Committee trip to Asia \n     and the Mideast.\n       After a total of 24 Americans were killed in Saudi Arabia \n     in the Khobar Towers bombing and in a 1995 terrorist blast at \n     a U.S.-run training facility in Riyadh, our troops are moving \n     from Dhahran to Kharj, in the middle of the desert. The \n     relocation will cost an estimated $200 million, and Defense \n     Secretary Perry has arranged with the Saudis for each nation \n     to pay half the cost.\n       Saudi Arabia is not an isolated situation. Around the \n     globe, American troops in harm's way defend our vital \n     national interests, such as Saudi oil, while protecting our \n     host nations and their interests in the process. We cannot, \n     of course, put a price tag on the lives and limbs of our \n     young soldiers cut down by terrorist bombs. But we can, and \n     should, ask our allies to shoulder more of the cost and \n     responsibility for defending them and their property.\n       While the number of U.S. troops deployed around the world \n     has sharply declined since the height of the Cold War, the \n     United States still spends huge sums and deploys thousands of \n     troops on foreign soil, while facing massive deficits at \n     home. Several nations I recently visited, including Saudi \n     Arabia, South Korea and Japan, could pay the entire cost of \n     our defense efforts on their soil, or at least more of it. If \n     we toughen our bargaining position, we certainly can get a \n     better deal.\n       In each country I visited on my recent trip, I asked if \n     there was any reason the host nation could not pay its entire \n     defense bill, including the cost of U.S. forces committed to \n     that nation's defense. Generally, our embassy experts shook \n     their heads and said there was not. The foreign leaders \n     disagreed, offering statistics about the volume of U.S. arms \n     they buy, their incidental expenses such as land values of \n     U.S. bases, and their own budget deficits. I found their \n     arguments unconvincing.\n       At an absolute minimum, we should bill host nations for 70 \n     percent of our costs of defending them, following the formula \n     we apply with Japan. And in Japan, which has a $4.5 trillion \n     economy, and in many other countries, the share should be \n     higher.\n       Saudi Arabia is an extreme case. Between World War II and \n     1975, the United States gave Saudi Arabia a total of $328.4 \n     million in economic and military aid, according to the U.S. \n     Agency for International Development. We trimmed and ended \n     this largesse as oil revenues filled Saudi coffers. But we \n     still post 5,000 U.S. troops on Saudi soil.\n       ``The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital \n     interest to the United States,'' as President Bush said in \n     1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait. If a hostile nation seized \n     Saudi oil wells, the largest reserve in the world, the \n     American economy and world markets could tumble.\n       That state of affairs should stimulate debate in the United \n     States on the dangers and disadvantages of reliance on \n     Mideast oil, on exploring alternative sources of energy, on \n     conserving oil and gas, on lower speed limits, and perhaps \n     even on higher taxes for oil and gas to stimulate \n     conservation. It is not a reason for us to bear the bulk of \n     the Saudi defense burden.\n       Why shouldn't the Saudis foot the whole bill? Why shouldn't \n     they at least pay the entire $200 million cost of relocating \n     our troops to safer ground, after terrorist bombs murdered \n     two dozen Americans? As The Washington Post reported, ``On \n     the scale of Saudi Arabia, which has paid out about $50 \n     billion\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\n     to nations that fought in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the \n     extra $100 million amounted to a modest commitment, whatever \n     reservations the Saudis may have.''\n       We never went into the Persian Gulf War expecting to remain \n     a permanent presence. At a recent meeting with Secretary \n     Perry, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, one of the Senate's most \n     respected voices on military matters, noted that we deployed \n     troops to the Persian Gulf on an emergency basis, expecting \n     the Saudis to take over. At that meeting, Senator Nunn said \n     the Saudis could afford the military hardware and could \n     recruit troops to provide for their defense.\n       To add insult to injury, several nations are skinning us on \n     trade, while also skinning us on defense costs.\n       Saudi Arabia, for example, is our largest trading partner \n     in the Middle East. In 1994, the last year for which figures \n     are available, the Saudis exported an estimated $8 billion to \n     the United States and imported an estimated $6.4 billion from \n     us, for a trade deficit of $1.6 billion.\n       The United States has played a major role in fostering \n     South Korea's massive economic growth, to the point that \n     South Korea is now the world's 11th-largest economy. But \n     South Korea retains obstacles to free trade and restrictions \n     on market access, and poorly protects intellectual property \n     rights, all of which costs U.S. firms and U.S. workers.\n       Meanwhile, South Korea pays only one third of the $900 \n     million annual local-currency cost for the 37,000 U.S. troops \n     stationed on its soil. South Korea spends millions on its own \n     long-term military preparations, while we handle and finance \n     the lion's share of day-to-day defense.\n       Our whopping $59.5 billion trade deficit with Japan fuels \n     our budget deficit. In Japan, American companies find \n     themselves competing for small portions of various markets, \n     or find themselves shut out entirely, as networks of Japanese \n     firms buy only from each other, while enjoying the profits as \n     American firms buy from them. Several major corporations in \n     Pennsylvania are being handcuffed.\n       Meanwhile, the United States stations 47,000 troops in \n     Japan, at a cost of more than $8 billion per year. The \n     Japanese government contributes almost $5 billion per year. \n     But total Japanese defense spending represents less than 1 \n     percent of Japan's GNP, compared to the 4 percent of our GNP \n     the United States spends on defense.\n       I am not suggesting that we turn American troops into \n     mercenaries, or that Saudi Arabia or most other host nations \n     could defend themselves alone as well as we can jointly \n     defend them. But there must be equity. There must be shared \n     responsibility.\n       After inspecting Khobar Towers last month, I met with 20 \n     officers and airmen who had been in and around the complex \n     when the 5,000-pound truck bomb went off. For an hour, in \n     turn, these men and women calmly recounted their own injuries \n     and the efforts, by those who were able, to aid more \n     seriously wounded comrades and to remove bodies. At the end \n     of our talk, a young captain said that despite all we do in \n     Saudi Arabia, our troops are not even allowed to fly the \n     American flag above the U.S. compound. Something is wrong, he \n     said.\n       I agree.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the hour \nto which I was assigned begin at 1:10, and conclude at 2:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10540-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10546-S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TAX REFORM AND TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, it is our intention during the hour \nunder our control to continue the discussion of the importance of tax \nreform and tax relief for the American people at this time in which \nthey are bearing the highest tax burden in American history. We have \nbeen joined by my distinguished colleague from Wyoming. I yield up to \n10 minutes to the Senator for the purpose of expounding on this \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Georgia for setting up some time \nto talk about the issue that most of us talk about all the time, and \nthat is taxes. It is an issue we should talk about. It is an issue that \ncuts very deeply into our lives. We spend an average of nearly 40 \npercent of our income on taxes at various levels. So it is something we \nought to talk about.\n  I think part of the focus today--I talked about this earlier, as a \nmatter of fact--is on the philosophical idea of taxation, whether you \nhave less or more, whether you have smaller government or larger \ngovernment, and that is a choice. But, more specifically, I think this \nhour was to look a little bit at simplification, to look a little bit \nat the difficulty of collection, to look a little bit at some of the \ndebates and discussions that go on with respect to the IRS. Many people \nare very disillusioned with the IRS, and I do not defend that agency \nparticularly, but I do tell you basically you have to have a \nsimplification of taxation if you are going to have simplification of \ncollection. Probably there is nobody here who would disagree with that. \nBut it never seems to happen.\n  Every year we talk about simplification. Every year we talk about \nmaking it easier. But we keep going on. The current tax system is a \nmess. It is extremely difficult. It is a result of probably 80 years of \ndebate and discussion and, frankly, abuse, by lawmakers, by lobbyists, \nby special interests--perhaps unintentionally. But, in any event, I \nthink no one would argue with the fact that we have, now, a tax system \nthat is extremely difficult, extremely cumbersome, extremely \nineffective and unfair. It is certainly too complex and much too \ncostly. And of course the tax system itself punishes the idea of \ninvestment, punishes the idea of incentive, punishes the idea of \nsaving. And all those things go together.\n  I have already mentioned the figures. We pay nearly 40 percent. That \nis an astounding figure, really, in terms of a working family who--most \nfamilies are working families--has to work until late May to pay their \ntaxes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In this debate about the working family there are two \nfigures that are constantly quoted. One is 40 percent. I typically use \n50. I wonder if the Senator would agree, when you add on the regulatory \ncosts and that family's share of higher interest rates because of the \nnational debt, you end up with another $9,000 coming out of the \nchecking account of the average family. It really takes it to over 50 \npercent, dealing with the cost of government.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am sure that is correct. And it is an even more \nastounding figure than we have.\n  It is set up so we do not think about it a lot. I do not object to \nthe idea of withholding. It is probably the only way to do it. But \nwithholding sort of slips in there and you hear people talking all the \ntime, ``Well, gee, I got money back.'' It is my money. It is my money. \nBack from where?\n  Anyway, it is a very high figure. But it seems to me--and I wanted to \nfocus on this, and I am going to speak for just a few minutes about \nthis--it is too complicated, much too complicated, and too difficult to \nfigure. Again, an estimate is 4.5 billion hours a year are spent in the \npreparation of tax returns. That is an astounding number as well.\n  Each of us knows how difficult it is to figure our taxes. They are \ntoo hard to enforce. The more complicated, the more difficult it is in \nthe tax system, obviously it is more difficult to enforce. And \nenforcement is important. You have to ensure that, when you have a tax \nsystem, that everyone is treated fairly in that tax system, that \neverybody contributes what under the law they are supposed to \ncontribute. So the tax system makes it most difficult.\n  Probably there are too many loopholes. They are often called \nloopholes. The fact is, over time, the Tax Code has been used to affect \nbehavior. When we wanted someone to do something we changed the taxes \nand made it an incentive to do it. So we have all these series of \nthings which have very little to do, frankly, with paying taxes. They \nactually have very little to do with the fairness of taxation, but have \nmore to do, in fact, with seeking to modify behavior. Maybe that is a \nlegitimate function of taxes. But I can tell you, it makes it much, \nmuch more difficult. It probably makes it much, much more unfair, in \nterms of the total collection.\n  I think we had, this year, as an example, a real demonstration of how \nfrustrated people are when there was the kind of discussion and \nacceptance, frankly, of the so-called flat tax. Obviously the most \nattractive thing about a flat tax was the ease with which it could be \ncollected. There is argument about the fairness of it. Those who have \nstudied it feel it is even more fair. I do not argue with that.\n  Politically, it probably is not going to happen. There are some \nthings like homeowners' interest and those kinds of things that are \ngoing to be very difficult, politically, to change. The argument is, of \ncourse, if I am an investor in your company and you pay me a dividend, \nthat dividend has been paid after\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\ntax, so I should not have to pay it again on the dividend. But when you \nsee someone with a large income from dividends, politically that is \nprobably not going to happen.\n  Nevertheless, the point is, it was very attractive for Americans to \ntalk about a simpler, easier, more fair tax system, whatever it is. I \nam no expert on that, but I think it must be possible to do that. It \nmust be possible to find a way to come up with a system that makes it \neasier to enforce. So we get away from the idea of having an agency \nlike the IRS, that has to do the things it has to do. I am not being an \napologist for some of the behavior that IRS might use on people to do \nthis. But, nevertheless, the fact remains that they have a terribly \ndifficult job, to enforce this kind of a convoluted tax system.\n  So, Madam President, I think there are lots of things we could too. I \nhave a hunch, if we eliminated a lot of the exemptions, the lower rate \nwould offset some of the things that are now in there as exemptions. We \nwould find it would work better. I think collections would be higher if \nit were simpler, and we would have fewer problems.\n\n  There are many reform and simplification ideas out there. Frankly, I \nwould support a plan, obviously, that deals with fairness. You have to \nbe fair as to whoever pays their fair share; simplicity ought to be an \nissue, we ought to be able to make it much more simple, particularly \nwith some of the equipment that we have now. I think we ought to reduce \nthe burden. We have to pay for the Government we have, but we can do \nwith substantially less. We can do with shifting many of these \nactivities closer to home, so voters would know, when they made a cost-\nbenefit analysis. Expenditures at the Federal level are very difficult \nto measure.\n  At home, in the school district, when they say we are going to have a \nbond issue and we are going to build a science room and it is going to \ntake $400,000, then you say OK, is it worth it? Am I going to do it? \nYou have a cost-benefit ratio. How do you do that in the Federal \nGovernment, tell me, in a $1.5 trillion budget where even people here \nare not certain what is in the thing? So we can do that. And the result \nwould be to rein in the role of the Internal Revenue Service and we can \ndo that by simplifying, reducing, making easier a tax system.\n  Madam President, I hope that we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, \nonce again, for the contributions he makes in general to this Nation, \nbut I appreciate his being here this afternoon to talk about the issue \nof the Internal Revenue Service and its broader implications on taxes.\n  As you know, Madam President, one of the centerpieces of Senator \nDole's economic plan is to focus on the IRS and how it interacts with \nthe American people.\n  I am going to read an article that recently appeared on June 7, 1996. \nIt refers to a General Accounting Office report on the Internal Revenue \nService, which I am going to quote from in just a moment.\n  This article says:\n\n       A congressional audit of the Internal Revenue Service \n     asserted yesterday that the agency that scrutinizes \n     taxpayers' finances cannot properly--\n\n  Cannot properly.\n\n     keep track of the $1.4 trillion it collects each year.\n\n  Given the stories--and all of us are familiar with them, of the way \ntaxpayers are treated from time to time by this agency --it is a bit \nironic that the General Accounting Office would say that they cannot \nkeep track of the money they collect.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       ``The agency that is so strict on the way Americans keep \n     their books cannot itself pass a financial audit,'' \n     complained Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) chairman of the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee. Stevens, reviewing the fiscal \n     1995 audit by the General Accounting Office, raised the \n     possibility of Congress appointing an outside control board \n     to run the IRS.\n\n  That is an interesting idea, somebody that they would have to be \naccountable to, like the citizens have to be accountable to them.\n  He says:\n\n       It would be a board similar to the one overseeing the \n     District of Columbia Government.\n       In the House of Representatives, Representative Jim \n     Lightfoot (R-IA) chairman of the appropriations subcommittee \n     controlling the IRS budget, said an outside board would be \n     something worth considering.\n\n  And I certainly concur with that.\n\n       ``Management has been a problem there,'' he said. The GAO \n     audit said fundamental persistent problems remain uncorrected \n     --\n\n  Madam President, uncorrected for the fourth year in a row. For the \nfourth year in a row, these problems remain uncorrected. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer, from time to time, has had to fill out her tax \nreturns and remembers that the agency did not allow the Senator 4 years \nto work things out. They had to be done on a deadline date certain.\n\n       The IRS report said it cannot reconcile--\n\n  Let me just read from the report rather than this article. This is \nthe General Accounting Office financial audit, dated July 1996, \n``Examination of IRS's Fiscal Year 1995 Financial Statements.'' It is \nvoluminous, but it says:\n\n       The following five financial management problems, which \n     have undermined our ability to attest to the reliability of \n     IRS financial statements for the past 4 fiscal years, provide \n     the basis for these conclusions.\n       1. The amounts of total revenue--\n  That's taxes.\n\n     $1.4 trillion and tax refunds, $122 billion, cannot be \n     verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for \n     individual taxpayers in the aggregate.\n       2. The amounts reported for various types of taxes \n     collected--Social Security, income, excise taxes, for \n     example--cannot be substantiated.\n       3. The reliability of reported estimates of $113 billion \n     for valid accounts receivable and $46 billion for collectible \n     accounts receivable cannot be determined.\n       4. A significant portion of IRS's reported $3 billion in \n     nonpayroll operating expenses cannot be verified.\n       5. The amounts IRS reported as appropriations available for \n     expenditure for operations cannot be reconciled fully with \n     Treasury's central accounting records showing these amounts, \n     and hundreds of millions of dollars in differences have been \n     identified.\n\n  Madam President, if this was the report that an individual taxpayer \ngot--``cannot be reconciled,'' ``cannot be verified,'' ``cannot be \ndetermined,'' ``cannot be identified''--that taxpayer would be in a \nworld of hurt and trouble. It would be unthinkable that you could \nengage this agency and have them finding that you could not reconcile \nyour records, you could not determine what your income was, you could \nnot put anything together, you could not account for it. You would be \nin deep trouble.\n  This agency needs to reflect on that. There are over 100,000 \nemployees, and we know they are very dedicated employees, but this is \nunconscionable that they would receive a report like this and demand \nthe kind of adherence to specificity and to timing that they ask of the \nAmerican citizens but do not subscribe to themselves.\n  This issue of the Internal Revenue Service has taken on new \nproportions of late, because Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington \nin a speech made a remark that basically said the agency ought to \nadhere to standards that it demands of people. And I just talked about \nthat. The Government findings are that the agency can't manage its own \naffairs to the extent that they are demanding of the American people.\n  We have been in a discussion this afternoon about the Internal \nRevenue Service. I have alluded to the General Accounting Office this \nyear has found grave fault with this agency and the manner in which it \nmaintains its own financial records.\n  There are even suggestions in both Houses now for a control board to \noversee the agency. I pointed out very recently this issue has been \nelevated because Congresswoman Dunn, Jennifer Dunn, from Washington, \nhad said, you know, the agency ought to be held to the same kind of \nstandards that the American people are held to. And that irritated the \nagency. And the agency indicated, in a letter to Ms. Dunn, among other \nthings, by Margaret Milner Richardson, who is the Commissioner of the \nInternal Revenue Service--she said she was dismayed and confused to \nhear this Congresswoman suggest that there was something less than \nperfect going on at the Internal Revenue Service. And she goes on to \nsay, ``Taxpayers now pay about 87 percent of what they owe. \nNoncompliance is a serious problem that deprives our\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nGovernment of more than $90 billion in revenue annually.''\n  I am sort of curious, how do they know? How does the Internal Revenue \nService know what legitimate taxes are not being paid? The tone of this \nsuggests, ``These American citizens out here, we need to be watching \nover them, make darn sure they pay what they are supposed to pay!'' It \nis kind of like all of our citizens are looking for a way to defraud \nthe American Government, for Heaven's sake.\n  I will read this report and then I will turn to my colleague from \nUtah. This is a copyright 1994 News World Communications, Inc., the \nWashington Times, August 2, 1994. The headline of the article, ``IRS \nBullies.'' ``Last week the House was debating discharge position 12 \nwhich would ensure that the taxpayer is innocent''--not guilty, as this \nmight suggest--``is innocent until proven guilty.''\n  We have two sets of laws in America: You are innocent in America \nuntil you are proven guilty, but that is not always the case if you are \ndealing with the IRS.\n  About the same time, ``Inside the Beltway'' disclosed for the first \ntime Washington lawyer, Susan Allen's incredible encounter with John \nRichardson, the husband of Internal Revenue Service Commissioner \nMargaret Richardson, who wrote this letter to Congresswoman Dunn:\n\n       Mr. Richardson, the lawyer told us, had parked his black \n     Volvo across an alley driveway leading from her Northwest \n     home, preventing her from driving out of her garage. When Mr. \n     Richardson was summoned from a nearby restaurant, she said he \n     huffed, ``Margaret Richardson'' [that is the commissioner of \n     Internal Revenue Service] ``is my wife, and she is the IRS \n     commissioner, and I hope you paid your taxes.'' The surprised \n     lawyer couldn't believe her ears, so Mr. Richardson gladly \n     huffed again: ``My wife is the commissioner of IRS and I hope \n     you paid your taxes.''\n\n  We have an attitude issue here, Madam President. It is not just this \nagency. About 85 percent of the people that come through my office are \nconcerned, in one way or another, about the treatment they receive from \ntheir Government. I grew up thinking the Government was supposed to be \na partner, not a bully or a boss. I think these things deserve some \nserious attention.\n  We have been joined by my colleague from the good State of Utah. I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have two points to make with respect \nto the IRS.\n  Let me preface this by saying that the IRS has a large facility in my \nState, in Utah, in Ogden, and by and large the overwhelming majority of \nthe people who work in that facility are honest, hard-working, \ndedicated Americans who are as anxious to do a good job as anybody in \nany other agency.\n  I learned when I was in the business world that when something is \nwrong, seriously wrong with an organization, it is usually not with the \npeople. It is usually with the system that they are operating and with \nthe culture.\n  I wish to make two points about the IRS system and culture, with the \nunderstanding that I am not criticizing hard-working, dedicated \nindividual civil servants who are doing the best they can in a \ndifficult circumstance.\n  First, the system. Rather than discuss individual horror stories--I \nwill get to that when I talk about culture--I want to go to formal \nexaminations of the IRS that are before us as Members of Congress and \ncall the attention of my fellow Senators and others to two reports. One \nis from the GAO, the General Accounting Office, that came out in August \nof this year. It says ``Tax Systems Modernization.'' That is the \nstandard headline, but look at the subheadline that is right there on \nthe front of the report. It says, ``Cyberfile Project Was Poorly \nPlanned And Managed.''\n\n  Then on the heels of that, in September 1996, hot off the presses, if \nyou will, the General Accounting Office ``Internal Revenue Service''; \nthe subhead, ``Business Operations Need Continued Improvement.''\n  These were both submitted to the Governmental Affairs Committee, the \nchairman of which, Senator Stevens of Alaska, has shared them with me. \nLet me give a summary of what is in these reports. Again, I look at \nthis as a businessman, and I must say, Madam President, I am appalled. \nThe IRS has not passed an audit during the 5 years they have been \naudited. Their major failures are they cannot account for revenues from \ntax returns and refunds. They cannot account for goods received against \npayments made, and there are computer security weaknesses that have \nallowed IRS workers to view and alter returns. Think of the movies we \nhave seen of the hacker getting into the system. Well, IRS employees \ncan get into the system and not alter grades the way they do in the \nmovies or set off nuclear wars, but at least alter the returns of some \nof their friends, if they want to.\n  The recent GAO audit found that interim computer security procedures \nhave been improved, but these weaknesses still remain. The amounts of \ntotal revenue, $1.4 trillion, and tax refunds, $122 billion, cannot be \nverified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual \ntaxpayers in the aggregate. In other words, we have a business here \nthat for 5 years has been unable to close its books because they cannot \nbring them into balance. They cannot reconcile the numbers on this side \nwith the numbers on that side. I find that astounding--5 years and they \nstill cannot reconcile the amounts of total revenue and tax refunds to \ntheir accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers. I wonder \nhow forgiving the IRS would be in an audit of a business that said for \n5 years we have been unable to reconcile these amounts.\n  Next, the amounts reported for various types of taxes collected--for \nexample, Social Security and income taxes and excise taxes--cannot be \nsubstantiated.\n  Next, the reliability of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid \naccounts receivable and $46 billion for collectible accounts receivable \ncannot be determined.\n  Next, a significant portion of IRS's reported $3 billion in \nnonpayroll operating expenses cannot be verified. The amounts IRS \nreported as appropriations available for expenditure for operations \ncannot be reconciled with the Treasury's central accounting records \nshowing these amounts. The differences are in the hundreds of millions \nof dollars. Again, how would the IRS react to a company that showed \ndifferences in accounts between one division and the other that were \nhundreds of millions of dollars in size, and was unable to reconcile \nthem?\n  Now, the reason the IRS says it is so difficult for them to pass an \naudit on these issues is that they were never required to do so until \nthe Chief Financial Officer Act was passed. Therefore, they say their \nfinancial management systems and procedures were never set up to be \naudited.\n  This is incredible. For 5 years, they have been unable to pass an \naudit. They cannot reconcile their accounts, either internally, or with \nthe Treasury. Yet, they ask us to have a high degree of confidence in \nthe way they handle our taxpayers' money. So that is my first point \nwith respect to the structure.\n  Now, if I may, I will talk about the culture of the IRS. As my \ncolleague from Georgia has done, I will use examples out of my own \noffice as a Senator. Here is one.\n  A taxpayer pays the tax he figures he owes; he sends the tax in to \nthe IRS. The payment sits there for a year and a half, and he hears \nnothing back. Then, for some reason, the entire amount he paid is sent \nback to him, with no explanation. The IRS simply sends it back after a \nyear and a half--no explanation, no indication. Two days later, they \nsend him a notice saying that he owes tax for that year at a lesser \namount than the amount he had sent them and demands that it be paid \nimmediately. And then, a few weeks later, a notice comes that interest \nand penalty are now due on the tax that he just paid. He pays the tax, \nthey keep it for a year and a half, send it back to him, with no \nexplanation, then send him a new tax bill. He pays that, and he is told \nhe owes interest and penalty on the new tax bill because he hadn't paid \nhis taxes on time a year and a half before. Well, he thinks, surely, \nwhen he explains this, somebody will straighten it out. He goes to the \nIRS and gets no assistance whatsoever. He was told he owed the interest \nand penalty, and if he did not pay it, the penalty would continue to \naccrue.\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\n  Finally, he came to my office. My constituent liaison person made \ninquiry with the local IRS people and was told there is no way, \nlegally, to cancel the interest and penalty in this case. Well, \nfortunately, the members of my staff are as persistent as I would hope \nthey would be. They did not accept that as an answer and, ultimately, \nthe case was resolved. But what does it say about the Agency when it \ntakes the muscle a U.S. Senator to get them to resolve something that \nis so absurd, as this was?\n  The second case, which is not an individual case but a series of \ncases that we see--and I would assume that my colleagues see--in our \noffices often as well. Homemakers, women in marriages that go along for \na while, and then they don't work out. They always filed joint returns. \nThe husband fills out the joint return, signs it, hands it to his wife, \nsays, ``Sign it here, I am sending off the tax return.'' They sign it \nwithout really understanding what is going on. And then the marriage \nbreaks up, a divorce takes place. The woman has to find a job. She goes \nout and gets a job, only to discover that her wages are now being \nattached by the IRS for back taxes that her husband never paid. He did \nnot tell her that he wasn't paying them. He, indeed, lied to her and \ntold her they were being paid and they were all taken care of. She was \nbeing defrauded by her husband. But instead of coming after the \nhusband, the IRS comes after her. Why? Because she is the one working. \nThe husband disappeared. She is working and she has to put her life \nback together. Many times children are involved that she has to \nsupport. But instead of saying, yes, we recognize that in the situation \nyou were in before, you, in fact, had no control over the family \nfinances, they are now saying, no, because you signed that return, you \nare due for those taxes because we can't find your husband.\n\n  Even in those cases where the woman can prove she did not sign the \nreturn, the husband signed her name, forged it, the IRS says, no, your \nname was on there, there was a signature, and you are coming into the \nwork force, trying to put your life back together, trying to take care \nof your kids, and you are now responsible for the taxes that your \nformer husband refused to pay. The women in these circumstances feel \nintimidated, scared, frustrated and, above all, confused.\n  We had one who finally came to my office asking for assistance \nbecause the collection officer was abrasive, intimidating, and \ndemanding. Once again, it was only after my congressional liaison \nperson got involved that this woman got some degree of relief from \nthis.\n  So those are the two points I leave you with, Madam President. First, \nthe system, as indicated in these two reports, has very serious \nsystematic problems--trillions of dollars, and they can't make their \nbooks balance, internally or with the Treasury books. Second, the \nculture, where IRS agents find themselves intimidating and demanding, \nand where ordinary citizens are seeking some kind of redress and \nprotection and ultimately come to Members of the U.S. Senate for help.\n  One final comment. I don't know how true this is of other Senators. I \nam one who has gone through an IRS audit. I found it a relatively \npainless kind of experience. I was fully prepared. The individual on \nthe other side recognized that, and we went through things in a civil, \nproper fashion, and I commented on that to another friend, saying I had \nbeen through an IRS audit, and it's not all that bad. He looked at me \nand he said, ``Bob, it is entirely the luck of the draw. It depends on \nwhich agent you get that day. You were lucky enough to get the \nintelligent, properly motivated, properly directed, dedicated civil \nservant. I got the other kind. I can tell you, it depends on which one \nis on duty when your number comes up.''\n  It should not be that way, Madam President. We should have equal \njustice under the law, and everybody should be treated the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nvery revealing comments. He was on target. I appreciate very much him \njoining us this afternoon. I am now going to yield up to 10 minutes to \nmy colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, when 2,000 American job providers came to \nWashington last June to attend what was called the Third White House \nConference on Small Business, they brought with them hundreds of ideas \non how to make Government more responsive--to the taxpayers and to \nsmall business alike.\n  They condensed their suggestions into a list of 60 to send on to the \nWhite House. Even though their recommendations covered a tremendous \nrange of concerns, one point generated near universal agreement from \nthat conference, and that was that something must be done about the \ncomplex and costly Federal tax system.\n  Well, there's nothing simple about taxes anymore, as you have heard \nhere today. As any taxpayer will tell you, the IRS today is five times \nbigger than the FBI, and it's twice as large as the CIA. To run such a \nmassive operation takes the equivalent of more than 3 million full-time \nemployees. We have more Americans collecting taxes than we have serving \nin the Armed Forces.\n\n  The IRS manages a library of 437 separate tax forms. The IRS mails \nout over 8 billion pages of tax instructions every year.\n  Now, our colleague in the House, the distinguished majority leader \nfrom Texas, points out that American workers and businesses spent 5.4 \nbillion hours in 1990 just preparing their taxes. That is more time \nthan it takes to build every car, truck, and van that is manufactured \nin the United States every year. Just to administer a tax system so \nunwieldy costs our taxpayers almost $14 billion a year.\n  Even though the IRS demands strict compliance from the American \npeople, it has set far lower standards for itself, as our colleague \nfrom Utah points out. It has long permitted itself severe abuses within \nits own accounting practices--something they would not tolerate from \nbusinesses or individuals.\n  In a report issued last year, the General Accounting Office took the \nIRS to task for failing to keep its own books and records with the same \naccuracy that it demands of the taxpayers.\n  For the last 2 years, in fact, the GAO has not been able to express \nan opinion on the financial statements of the IRS, and that was due to \nserious accounting errors and internal control problems. More than 20 \nmonths later, the problems still remain.\n  In testimony before Congress in June, Gregory Holloway of the GAO \nreported:\n\n       We have made 59 recommendations to improve the IRS's \n     financial management systems and reporting. IRS agreed with \n     these recommendations and has worked to implement them and \n     correct its financial management systems and information \n     problems. However, many of the more significant \n     recommendations have not yet been fully implemented.\n\n  There are other ways in which the management problems within the IRS \nare manifesting themselves. And far too many of my constituents are \nforced to deal with the fallout on a daily basis.\n  Madam President, every American has experienced the frustration of \nfiling their Federal tax returns. Even though Congress has tripled \nfunding for the IRS over the last 7 years to the tune of $7.5 billion, \nthe level of service provided to the taxpayers has not grown \nproportionally. In recent years, the IRS has invested billions of \ntaxpayer dollars in its efforts to modernize its operations, including \nits information systems--but the GAO has dubbed the results \n``chaotic.'' As an ironic consequence, the IRS, the Nation's tax \ncollector, is perhaps the least taxpayer-friendly agency in the entire \nFederal Government.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal tax system continues to grow more complicated \nand hard to understand. In the mid-1950's, the Federal Income Tax Code \nwas comprised of 103 sections and 400,000 words.\n  Today, it has ballooned to 698 sections--a 578-percent increase--and \nnearly 1.4 million words.\n  Adding to the aggravation of the Nation's taxpayers, tax regulations \nhave multiplied just as rapidly.\n  Between 1955 and 1994, the number of words in the regulations of the \nInternal Revenue Code increased more than 550 percent, from just over 1 \nmillion words to 5.7 million in the IRS Code.\n  Even if you are a trained speed reader who can read 1,000 words a \nminute, and you did not do anything else but\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\ndevote every hour of every business day to reading these regulations, \nit would take you almost 3 years to wade through them.\n  The rapid growth of the Federal Tax Code and its regulations has \ndramatically increased the complexity of our tax system, to the point \nwhere no one but a very few tax specialists can understand it. Even IRS \nagents are often confused by their own tax laws. The complexity of the \nFederal tax system means that tax assistance for ordinary American \ntaxpayers is even more urgent now than ever before.\n  But this desperately needed assistance has not been adequately \nprovided. For example, my State office receives complaints daily from \nconstituents frustrated they cannot get through to a human being at the \ntoll-free lines established by the IRS: The lines are constantly busy. \nIn some cases, my constituents have tried for 3 or 4 days before they \nfinally reached a real, live person.\n  In July, I received this letter from a taxpayer in St. Paul who was \nbeing threatened with a lawsuit by the IRS:\n\n       I am one of those middle-age, lower-middle-class citizens \n     who have pulled myself from extreme tragedy to the point \n     where I am trying to buy my house, I've never had the \n     government or any agency help me.\n       And now my entire life is threatened because I can't talk \n     to a human being about my taxes. Please help me. I have sent \n     a copy of this to the IRS, the White House, Senator \n     Wellstone, and no one seems to be able to help. I can't \n     believe that I cannot find a human being in the IRS to talk \n     to.\n\n  Another constituent of mine who tried repeatedly to reach someone at \nthe hotline shared their frustration with the IRS operator when their \ncall was finally answered. ``Blame it on Congress. They cut our \nbudget,'' said the operator. The IRS employee ended the call by \nadvising my constituent to telephone me and demand more tax dollars for \nthe IRS.\n  Let us go back over that again. He finally got through after days and \nwas finally able to talk to an operator at the IRS. And the answer he \ngot was ``Blame it on Congress'' because ``they cut our budget.'' And \nbefore he got off the phone the operator, the IRS person, told them to \ncall me in Washington and demand more money for the IRS.\n  I suggest, Madam President, that throwing more dollars at an agency \nthat already cannot account for $1.4 trillion tax dollars it takes in \nannually is hardly the solution.\n  The Federal Government enacts laws that we require the people to \nobey. But in the case of the IRS telephone hotline service, we have \nfailed to provide sufficient assistance to enable average Americans to \nunderstand and comply with the laws.\n  And when innocent incompliance occurs due to the complexity of the \ntax system, we punish the taxpayers by imposing all sorts of penalties. \nThis is simply not fair.\n  Let me give you two examples. A certain individual in Minnesota told \nme about a problem he had. He paid about $35,000 in taxes but didn't \nfile his return until October. But he had filed all the necessary \nextensions that he needed to file to get the extension on his return. \nThe IRS had already collected about $35,000. But he was still short \nabout $4,000, which he paid plus interest. But even after paying all \nthose taxes he still was find $700 for being late.\n  Another individual that is self-employed told me that he pays his \ntaxes every year quarterly estimating his taxes, and at one time he \nreceived more money in payments from his clients than he expected, and \nwhen he paid taxes on that, IRS came back and fined him $500 because he \nhad failed to report that correctly.\n  Madam President, I do not know if that is fair, or what is intended \nwhen we have taxpayers out there trying to meet the laws, obey the \ncodes, and yet are fined by this agency.\n  Madam President, I am pleased the Senate took action this week to \nresolve this most frustrating situation by accepting my amendment to \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations legislation. The amendment will help \ncorrect the problem by making the IRS prioritize its toll-free \ntelephone service and allocate the necessary resources to ensure that \ntaxpayers receive adequate assistance and answers to their questions.\n  This will not solve most of the problems plaguing the IRS, of course, \nbut it marks a start. I am happy to see additional solutions being \nproposed, and I am especially pleased that our former majority leader, \nBob Dole, is speaking loudly about our need to forever end the IRS as \nwe know it.\n  He has pledged to ``free the American people from tax tyranny,'' and \nthe ideas for IRS reform he has put forward in his economic blueprint \nhave raised the level of this debate.\n  They deserve a close look by the taxpayers, as we seek to build an \nIRS that will be a tool for the taxpayers, not a weapon against them.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, when Senator Dole left the Senate, I \nlooked down at this desk, and I said that I would ``never forget or \nlook at this desk without seeing him or thinking of him.''\n  He is now engaged in a very long journey. As the Senator from \nMinnesota just alluded to, he put forward a very broad economic plan \nthat deals with the IRS that we have just been discussing, along with \nother policies such as the 15-percent across-the-board tax break, and \nothers.\n  Yesterday, my good colleague from Nebraska came to the floor--and, of \ncourse, he was the longest serving Governor of Nebraska, and he has \nbeen in the Senate 18 years--and I was taken aback by his comments \nabout Senator Dole.\n  Just to quote here, he calls it:\n\n       The latest ``Follow the Yellow Brick Road'' path of \n     wizardry blends $550 billion in tax breaks, unspecified \n     spending cuts, and rosy economic scenarios into one shameless \n     political ploy. When the unsuspecting Dorothys of the world \n     pull back in wonderment the curtain, they discover a huffing \n     and puffing candidate, Bob Dole, as the wizard. This is the \n     same wizard who for the first 72 years of his life forswore \n     such economic nonsense. Bob Dole's transformation from a \n     deficit hawk into a carrier pigeon for supply * * *\n  Well, anyway, I just do not think those kinds of remarks are fitting \nin public discourse, and certainly here in the Hall of the greatest \nlegislative Chamber in the history of the world I do not think they are \nfitting remarks. We can debate our differences about our views on tax \nrelief and economic policy without resorting to this kind of language. \nI do not think it is fitting for the Senate, and I wanted to say so \nhere rather than off in some klatch someplace.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska went on to ridicule the economics of the \n1980's which, I might point out, was the longest peacetime economic \nrecovery in the history of the United States. He apologized to America \nfor having supported the Reagan tax cuts, and he said it was worst vote \nhe had ever cast and a mistake.\n  I find it hard to characterize beginning the longest peacetime \nrecovery as a mistake; or ending double-digit inflation, which had been \n13 percent, he now characterizes trying to correct that and correcting \nthat as a mistake; getting interest rates down--people do not remember \nbut they were as high as 22 percent, and this economic recovery, of \ncourse, reduced it dramatically, but he characterizes that as a \nmistake; or was creating 20 million new jobs in that glorious decade a \nmistake, as he characterizes it and regretted having ever voted to \nsupport it; or rebuilding our national defense and economy, winning the \nwar over communism, ending the cold war, and he characterizes that as a \nmistake.\n  Madam President, right now I talk a lot about the American family. I \ndo not think we can talk enough about them. In my State, after they pay \ntheir Federal taxes, State taxes, local taxes, their share of the \nincreased interest on the national debt, their share of the costs of \nthe burden of regulation in America which is now $7,000 for an average \nfamily of four, they have less than half the money they earn in their \nchecking account. They are left with only 47 percent of their wages--\nunbelievable. No wonder there is much anxiety and pressure and worry in \nmiddle-income families of America.\n  This administration which promised to lower that pressure--it was a \nvery major political statement to the country--really did not get its \nbags unpacked before it imposed a $491 billion tax increase--the \nhighest in American history.\n  Madam President, $491 billion, what does that mean to this family I \nwas\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\njust talking about? It means that they lost in the last 3 years \nsomewhere between $2,000 and $2,600 per year less in their checking \naccount which was already under duress.\n  The result of this tax increase is that we now pay 30.4 percent of \nthe gross domestic product in taxes. This is the highest that it has \never been in American history. The tax burden has never been higher, \nand under the current economic plan as proposed by President Clinton it \nwill rise to its highest level ever, 19.3 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  The point I am making here is that for Senator Dole to come forward \nand say we ought to lower this burden, it means that this family that \nhas lost $2,000-plus per year under the 15 percent across-the-board tax \nrelief will get about $1,200 to $1,400 of that back. That makes a lot \nof sense. If a family cannot even keep half the wages they earn, I \nthink it is sound policy to try to reverse that and get some of those \nresources back in that family's checking account so that they can see \nto the raising of the children, the education, the housing, \nthe transportation, the food, all of that which we depend on the \nAmerican family to do. We have made it almost impossible for the \nAmerican family to do that which they are supposed to do.\n\n  In addition, that plan embraces a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I might point out that Senator Exon of Nebraska was one \nof the seven that changed his vote which caused the failure of passage \nof the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Senator Dole has embraced that. We have talked about the IRS here, \nsaying we are going to get into that agency and produce a cultural \nattitude that is consistent with being a partner to America and not a \nboss over America, saying that you are going to balance the budget by \nthe year 2002 which will lower interest rates--it will lower what this \nAmerican family has to pay on the mortgage for their home, car, \nrefrigerator, their credit card.\n  All of these proposals make a lot of sense, and it is all right that \nwe disagree and debate about the conditions of these, but we ought to \ndo it in a very civil and appropriate way. There ought not to be any \nname calling on either side of the aisle. The American people expect \nthat of this body.\n  In closing, Madam President, I cannot think of any policy that is \nmore important for our working families than to try to get this burden \ndown to a more rational level. If you ask all our families, it does not \nmatter what walk of life they come from, what their income strata is, \ntheir education, they all say that the appropriate tax burden should be \nabout 25 percent. It is double that. And so I think Senator Dole's \nsuggestion that we ought to pass a little relief back to those family \nchecking accounts makes every bit of sense.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that in the intervening time \non the schedule, the Senator from Minnesota be added to the end of our \ntime. I think it will take us until about 2:17, or something like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10546-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONSTITUENT'S BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue of great \nimportance to the people of northern Minnesota and others who care \nabout Voyageurs National Park.\n  In 1971, Voyageurs National Park was created in northern Minnesota \nafter years of contentious debate in my home State and within the halls \nof the Federal Government. While there were some who were opposed to \nthe park's creation, many others supported it under the promise that it \nwould not only protect the area for future generations but would also \nbe an economic benefit for northern Minnesota as well.\n  Federal officials estimated the park would attract 1.3 million \nvisitors annually, yet 25 years later the National Park Service \nestimates that the actual number of visitors is 200,000 per year. That \nis less than one-sixth of its initial projection. Why is the visitor \nrate so low in Voyageurs? Ask the National Park Service. Ask them about \nthe countless numbers of regulations that they have imposed that would \nlimit the ability of recreationists to enjoy the park such as the \nrestriction under the Endangered Species Act recently repealed by a \ndistrict court judge and a de facto wilderness designation never \napproved by Congress.\n  Perhaps the most significant example of how the Federal Government \nhas failed in its mission to promote visitor use is the Park Service's \ncontinued reluctance to conduct a visitor use and facilities study \nmandated by Congress 13 years ago.\n  This study, supported by the Park Service back in 1983, was to be a \ntool that would help the Park Service determine why its visitor-rate \nprojection had not been met. Yet, to date, this study has still not \nbeen completed--at the expense of the people of northern Minnesota and \nthose who seek reasonable access to their public lands.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that economic interests should be the \ndetermining factor in the management of this national treasure, but \nthere is no question that the economic survival and security of the \nmen, women, and children who live in the communities surrounding the \npark must be taken into consideration. More importantly, when the \nFederal Government gives its word to the people, it must live up to it.\n  For this reason, I intend to offer an amendment to Interior \nappropriations which will help restore one of the unfulfilled promises \nmade to the people of northern Minnesota. My amendment, which I will \nnot offer today, would require the Park Service to begin its \ncomprehensive visitor-use and facilities study in consultation with \nappropriate private and public entities. It does not set a rigorous \ntimetable on when the study must be completed and in no way \nmicromanages the Park Service's activities; it simply requires the Park \nService to work with the State of Minnesota, the park's surrounding \ncounties, and individuals to develop a framework under which the study \nwill be completed.\n  Madam President, the groundwork is set for a team effort to develop \nthis study. I have spoken with county commissioners in northern \nMinnesota who have expressed strong support for this study and stand \nready to help the Park Service develop it. The study was discussed \nduring five hearings before the 104th Congress--both in Minnesota and \nWashington--and the strong, majority opinion during those hearings, \nincluding that of the Park Service, was in favor of the study. It is \nalso my understanding that the Voyageurs Park Superintendent has \nmentioned that some funding may be available in the coming months to \nbegin the study--for which I commend her. All of these developments \nmake me optimistic that this study can be done. Again, after 13 years \nthat it was directed to do so, the study finally may be done. The time \nhas come for this study to be done.\n  My amendment will create the framework to accomplish this task and to \nbegin restoring the commitments made long ago to the people of northern \nMinnesota. I certainly hope that my colleagues in the Senate--including \nmy fellow Senator from Minnesota--will lend their support to this \namendment and for doing what is right for the Voyageurs National Park \nand those who love it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10551-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I did not have an opportunity to speak \nduring consideration of the Defense of Marriage Act, so I would like to \ntake a moment now to explain my vote.\n  I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act for a very simple reason. For \nthousands of years, marriage has been an institution that represents a \nunion between a man and a woman, and I do not support changing the \ndefinition of marriage or altering its meaning.\n  Those of the same sex who have a long-term relationship and who wish \nto provide a legal framework for that relationship should aspire to \nenact legislation in the States that creates such a legal framework. \nBut that should not include changing the definition of marriage to \nallow same-sex marriages, and it should not require all States to \nrecognize that legal relationship.\n  I simply do not believe that we should in any way dilute the meaning \nof this important institution. Marriage is what binds a husband, wife, \nand children into a single unit--a family--which is the cornerstone of \nour society. Those who would say that this important tradition should \nbe altered are simply wrong.\n  For that reason, I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10552-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SITUATION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been glued to the television today \nin order to keep myself updated on the situation in Iraq. Needless to \nsay, I am more than a little frustrated that no attempts have been made \nby the President to consult the Congress on this swiftly evolving \nsituation. I do not say this lightly, Mr. President, but CNN reporting \nis not what I would consider fulfillment of the President's reporting \nobligation in the War Powers Act.\n  The War Powers Act states that the ``President in every possible \ninstance shall consult with Congress before'' introducing troops into \nimminent hostilities and shall also consult with Congress regularly \nafter the introduction of combat troops. Mr. President, that also \napplies when situations develop into hostilities. This obligation was \neasily overlooked for the incident on August 31. The Congress was \nadjourned on recess, making it difficult, if not impossible to brief \nMembers prior to taking action. The Congress stood with the President \nin an effort to fully support our troops and his decision as Commander \nin Chief. However, the current situation is quite different. The \nCongress is here, and we are waiting. Let me be clear, Mr. President, \nsupport for our troops is steadfast. But the President cannot assume \nthe continued support of Congress if he fails to keep us informed.\n  Mr. President, the President acted to counter Saddam Hussein's \naggression against the Kurds, and quickly declared victory. The \nPresident's policy to-date is not a victory. In less than a week's \ntime, the premature declaration has soured into a situation that has \nour pilots being shot at in the Northern No-Fly Zone, Hussein gaining a \nstrong foothold in the former Kurdish safe-haven, and a movement of \nAmerican personnel and equipment into the Persian Gulf. If a strong and \nclear policy is not defined soon, the President's policy in the gulf \nwill most assuredly become an abject failure. It's time to come to the \nCongress and the American people with a defined mission, goals and exit \nstrategy. It is time for the President to fulfill his obligations under \nthe War Powers Act.\n  In my speech on the situation in Iraq, just a week ago today, I \nexpressed concerns about the President's failure to maintain the \nalliance with our gulf war partners. Without the coalition, we risk \nlosing the necessary strategic advantage we how hold, and our defensive \npresence in the gulf will necessarily deteriorate. Saddam Hussein is \ntesting our resolve in the Persian Gulf by his efforts to play divide \nand conquer with the United States and our coalition partners from the \ngulf war. Without a clearly defined missioned and policy, we will \ncontinue to be pulled into a situation that will isolate us in the \nregion and leave few, if any, positive options to resolve the \nsituation.\n  Saddam Hussein is not an individual to be toyed with. He understands \nlittle other than aggression, and we should be wary that for him, \nembarrassing the United States at any cost may be considered a victory. \nThis is very important, Mr. President, because that cost could include \nAmerican lives.\n  Mr. President, the reporting on CNN provides good and timely \ninformation, but it does not provide insight, direction, or a clear \nmessage about the policy you intend to pursue. Therefore, it is my hope \nand my purpose to encourage the President to fulfill his obligation to \nthe Congress under the War Powers Act for the American people and for \nour troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10552-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10552-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10552-S10553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 168\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on developments concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 of March 15, 1995, and matters relating to the measures in \nthat order and in Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995.

This action was in response to actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. A copy of the order was provided to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President of the Senate by letter dated March \n15, 1995. Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to \nthe development of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to \nengage in activities that represent a threat to the peace and security \nof all nations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 to further \nrespond to the Iranian threat to the national security, foreign policy, \nand economy of the United States.\n\n  Executive Order 12959 (60 Fed. Reg. 24757, May 9, 1995) (1) prohibits \nexportation from the United States to Iran or to the Government of Iran \nof goods, technology, or services; (2) prohibits the reexportation of \ncertain U.S. goods and technology to Iran from third countries; (3) \nprohibits transactions such as brokering and other dealing by United \nStates persons in goods and services of Iranian origin or owned or \ncontrolled by the Government of Iran; (4) prohibits new investments by \nUnited States persons in Iran or in property owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran; (5) prohibits U.S. companies and other United \nStates persons\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\nfrom approving, facilitating, or financing performance by a foreign \nsubsidiary or other entity owned or controlled by a United States \nperson of certain reexport, investment, and certain trade transactions \nthat a United States person is prohibited from performing; (6) continue \nthe 1987 prohibition on the importation into the United States of goods \nand services of Iranian origin; (7) prohibits any transaction by any \nUnited States person or within the United States that evades or avoids \nor attempts to violate any prohibition of the order; and (8) allowed \nU.S. companies a 30-day period in which to perform trade transactions \npursuant to contracts predating the Executive order.\n  At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to authorize through specific licensing \ncertain transactions, including transactions by United States persons \nrelated to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, \nestablished pursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other \ninternational obligations and United States Government functions, and \ntransactions related to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant \nto preexisting contracts consistent with section 5712(c) of title 7, \nUnited States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing \nUnited States persons through specific licensing to participate in \nmarket-based swaps of crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian \ncrude oil in support of energy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, and \nTurkmenistan.\n  Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A \ncopy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives and the President of the Senate by letters \ndated May 6, 1995.\n  2. On March 8, 1996, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended \nthe current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran in effect since \nMay 1995. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade with Iran is \nprohibited except for information and informational materials and \ncertain other limited exceptions.\n  3. There were no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations, \n31 CFR Part 560 (the ``ITR'') during the reporting period.\n  4. During the current 6-month period, the Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) made numerous \ndecisions with respect to applications for licenses to engage in \ntransactions under the ITR, and issued 24 licenses. The majority of \ndenials were in response to requests to authorize commercial exports to \nIran and the importation of Iranian-origin goods. The majority of the \nlicenses issued authorized the completion of commodity ``string \ntransactions'' entered into by United States parties with respect to \nforeign commodities and having no knowledge or control over the Iranian \ninterest in the contracts; the export and reexport of goods, services, \nand technology essential to ensure the safety of civil aviation and \nsafe operation of certain commercial passenger aircraft in Iran; \nlicenses relating to Iranian participation in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic \nand Paralympic Games; the importation of Iranian-origin artwork for \npublic exhibition; and certain humanitarian imports and exports. In \nlight of statutory restrictions applicable to goods and technology \ninvolved in the air safety cases, the Department of the Treasury \ncontinues to consult and coordinate with the Departments of State and \nCommerce on these matters, consistent with section 4 of Executive Order \n12959.\n\n  In consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem and bank regulators in New York and California, OFAC revoked the \nlicenses of all Iranian banking agencies in the United States. State \nregulators then required them to convert to Representative Office \nstatus. There are now no Iranian banks authorized to conduct banking \nbusiness in the United States. Activities have been restricted to \n``limited representation,'' allowing only research and coordination \nwith U.S. holders of affiliate correspondent accounts.\n  Bank Saderat, Iran's New York Representative Office, was nominated by \nthe Central Bank of Iran to act as its agent for procedures outlined in \nthe ``Airbus'' settlement at The Hague. Accordingly, Bank Saderat was \nseparately licensed by OFAC for the limited purpose of collecting \ninformation for the Central Bank of Iran about U.S. commercial claims \nagainst Iranian banks. The information will be forwarded to and cleared \nby Iranian and State Department officials and used in making \nindependent determinations as to which claims can be paid from a \nspecial escrow account established at the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork.\n  The U.S. financial community continues to interdict transactions \nassociated with Iran and to consult with OFAC about their appropriate \nhandling. During this reporting period, OFAC took decisive action to \nprevent the U.S. clearing of third country dollar travelers checks sold \nby Iranian banks.\n  5. The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures \nof Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the \nimport prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried \nover from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \nviolations are being aggressively pursued. Since March 11, 1996, OFAC \nhas collected two civil penalties totaling $6,000. The violations \nunderlying these collections involve unlicensed exports to Iran. Civil \npenalty action is pending against 12 U.S. companies and financial \ninstitutions for violations of the Regulations.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 15 through September 14, 1996, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are \napproximately $850,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of Political-\nMilitary Affairs, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and the \nDepartment of Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the \nGeneral Counsels Office).\n  7. The situation reviewed above continues to involve important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an extraordinary and unusual threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \nThe declaration of the national emergency with respect to Iran \ncontained in Executive Order 12957 and the comprehensive economic \nsanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 underscore the United States \nGovernment opposition to the actions and policies of the Government of \nIran, particularly its support of international terrorism and its \neffort to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. The Iranian Transactions Regulations issued pursuant to Executive \nOrders 12957 and 12959 continue to advance important objectives in \npromoting the nonproliferation and antiterrorism policies of the United \nStates. I will exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I offer legislation that would \nremove a costly and unnecessary burden imposed by Washington upon our \nState and local governments.\n  Current Federal law requires States and counties to pay unemployment \ntax and benefits for people who work as election officials--even if \nthey work as few as two days a year.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n  This requirement has created a serious inequity for State and local \ngovernments. Under the law, polling place officials are considered as \nemployees for unemployment insurance purposes, regardless of the number \nof days they work. Local governments are liable for payment of \nunemployment insurance for those election workers who apply for it \nafter the elections, since they are being ``laid off from the \nemployment through no fault of his or her own.'' As a consequence, \ntheir unemployment benefits could far exceed the stipend they receive \nfor services on election day, because unemployment benefits are based \non income from the previous year.\n  During this time of belt-tightening at every level of government, \nmany communities are having difficulty financing even the most \nfundamental activities, including election administration. Requiring \nlocal governments to spend their precious tax dollars paying \nunemployment benefits for such short-term employees would add a \ntremendous financial burden to budgets that in many cases are already \nstrained to the breaking point.\n  Mr. President, this current requirement does more harm than good to \nthose it intends to protect. It hurts those civic-minded Americans who \nplay a vital role in our democratic system through their willingness to \nserve as election officials, because it diverts limited public funds \nthat would otherwise be used to balance local budgets or increase the \nsalaries of election workers. It also makes it more difficult to retain \nand recruit an adequate number of qualified people to serve as election \nofficials in our communities.\n  My legislation seeks to free our communities and the taxpayers from \nthis costly and unnecessary, federally imposed burden. It simply \neliminates the requirement that state and local governments must pay \nunemployment compensation tax on the basis of services performed by \nelection workers. Instead, it gives the States the freedom to design \nand run their own unemployment compensation programs for their election \nworkers.\n  I might add that according to the Congressional Budget Office, this \nbill is budget neutral.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable and moderate attempt to correct \nan inequity for our States, cities, and counties, whose budgets are \nalready tightly stretched providing the services upon which our \ncommunities depend. I therefore urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2074. A bill to repeal the Federal estate and gift taxes and the \ntax on generation-skipping transfers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        estate taxes legislation\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ndiscussing reform of our tax system. I commend the Senator from \nGeorgia, for his leadership on this issue. I wish to address another \naspect of our unfair tax system--the estate tax.\n  Today I am introducing a bill to repeal the Federal estate and gift \ntaxes and the tax on generation-skipping transfers. This bill is very \nsimple. It repeals, in its entirety, subtitle B of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986. This repeal is effective for estates of decedents dying \nand gifts and generation-skipping transfers made after the date of \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, the Federal estate and gift tax structure is perhaps \nthe most unfair and inefficient revenue source used by our Government. \nFirst, these taxes represent multiple taxation on savings and \ninvestment. Income is initially taxed when it is earned. If any of that \nincome is saved, the earnings on the savings are taxed. A third level \nof taxation occurs as capital gains taxes are paid. Finally, after a \nlifetime of savings and investment, estate and gift taxes are assessed. \nEstate and gift tax rates are much higher than income tax rates.\n  Second, these taxes inhibit economic growth and job creation. Family \nowned businesses, farms, and ranches are the source of most new jobs \ncreated in the United States. Yet it is these family owned businesses \nthat are most affected by estate and gift taxes. In many cases, family \nbusinesses do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay estate taxes \nupon the death of the owner. Frequently the business is liquidated or \nthey sell the farm. As a result, jobs are lost and economic activity \nceases.\n  Estate and gift taxes further stifle economic growth because of the \nincreased cost for capital accumulation. When lifetime savings are \ntaxed at high rates, the incentive to save is reduced. Spending and \nconsumption replaces savings and investment. As a result, wage rates \nand employment suffer.\n  Third, estate and gift taxes result in economic inefficiencies, as \ntaxpayers attempt to avoid or minimize these taxes, or allocate \nresources for estate planning. A survey by the Center for the Study of \nTaxation found that 80 percent of owners of family businesses reported \ntaking some steps to plan for estate taxes. Such mechanisms included \nlife insurance, buy/sell agreements, restructuring family partnerships \nand trusts, and charitable bequests. According to a report on this \nsurvey, 62 percent of the family businesses stated they would not have \nspent the time or money on estate planning. They did so because they \nfelt estate and gift taxes threatened the survival of their businesses.\n  Mr. President, with all the negative economic consequences resulting \nfrom estate and gift taxes, one must ask if these taxes are worth the \ncost. I, and many others, have concluded they are not.\n  There is a misconception that such taxes only affect the very wealthy \nand that these taxes generate large amounts of revenue. The fact is, \nthese taxes impact everyone, directly or indirectly. Furthermore, these \ntaxes are a minor revenue source for the Federal Government, accounting \nfor only 1 percent of total Federal receipts. The amounts actually \ncollected must be offset by the billions spent each year for \nenforcement and compliance activities.\n  Mr. President, it is time to abolish Federal estate and gift taxes. \nThese taxes are unfair and inefficient. They hinder economic growth, \ndestroying family businesses and jobs. They result in resources being \ndiverted to estate planning activities, away from economic growth. \nThese consequences, as well as the actual costs of collecting these \ntaxes, do not justify such taxes or the minimal revenues they produce. \nI urge my colleagues to support repeal of the Federal estate and gift \ntaxes. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed \nfollowing my remarks.\n\n                                S. 2074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Estate and Gift Taxes Repeal \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal estate and gift tax structure is an unfair \n     and inefficient revenue source. Such taxes represent a \n     multiple tax on earnings. After paying income taxes, capital \n     gains taxes, and property taxes, lifetime savings are finally \n     subjected to estate taxes at rates that are generally higher \n     than income tax rates.\n       (2) Owners of family-owned businesses and farms are among \n     those who suffer the greatest impact of such taxes. Many \n     businesses fail after the death of the founder because of \n     estate taxes. Families faced with these taxes are often \n     forced to liquidate farms or businesses to pay estate taxes. \n     In the process, jobs and financial security for family \n     members and employees are destroyed.\n       (3) The estate tax results in inefficiency in the economy \n     because of ``estate planning'' and other tax avoidance \n     mechanisms.\n       (4) Estate and gift taxes have a negative impact on \n     economic growth. Such taxes foster spending and consumption, \n     rather than savings and investment. Repeal of these taxes \n     would result in increased capital formation, additional jobs, \n     and a higher gross domestic product. Increased economic \n     activity and investments would also result in additional \n     personal and corporate income tax revenues.\n       (5) Estate and gift taxes are a minor revenue source for \n     the Federal Government. In fiscal year 1995, estate and gift \n     taxes accounted for only 1 percent of total Federal receipts. \n     Furthermore, the Government spends billions of dollars each \n     year for administrative and compliance costs for these taxes.\n       (6) The repeal of Federal estate and gift taxes is \n     consistent with and will be a major step toward establishing \n     a tax code based on fairness, simplicity, neutrality, \n     visibility, and stability.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF FEDERAL TRANSFER TAXES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is hereby repealed.\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The repeal made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to the estates of decedents dying, and gifts and \n     generation-skipping transfers made, after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n

ENTERPRISE DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 291\n\n       Whereas American prosperity is founded on the free \n     enterprise system of individual opportunity and economic \n     freedom;\n       Whereas the roots of American free enterprise can be found \n     in the experiences of the people of Jamestown and Plymouth, \n     the earliest American colonies;\n       Whereas the basis of free enterprise is the right to \n     ownership of private property, which ensures to individuals \n     the fruits of their own labor and encourages the virtues of \n     self-reliance, thrift, and industriousness;\n       Whereas the settlers at Jamestown and Plymouth were \n     initially deprived of the fruits of their own labor and \n     therefore lacked the incentive for private initiative and \n     hard work;\n       Whereas William Bradford, Governor of the Plymouth \n     Plantation, wrote that in response to the misery and want \n     experienced by the people of Plymouth he decided ``that they \n     should set corn every man for his own particular; and that \n     regard trust to themselves . . . This had very good success, \n     for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn \n     was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the \n     Governor or any other could use.'';\n       Whereas on November 18, 1618, ``The Great Charter'' endowed \n     the colonists of Virginia with the right to profit from \n     property under their individual control for the first time; \n     and\n       Whereas the result of the Great Charter was a blossoming of \n     individual initiative and self-sufficiency that laid the \n     foundations for the American tradition of economic freedom, \n     propserity, and self-government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the men and women of our first colonies who \n     began the American tradition of hard work and individual \n     initiative;\n       (2) honors all those who have defended the right of \n     individuals to own property, pursue their own initiative, and \n     to reap the fruits of their own labor; and\n       (3) designates November 18, 1996, as ``American Free \n     Enterprise Day''.\n\n     The President is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States and \n     Federal, State, and local administrators to observe the day \n     with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10556-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10556-S10557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 292--DESIGNATING ``NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DAY''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States should celebrate \n     children as the most valuable asset of the Nation;\n       Whereas the children represent the future, hope, and \n     inspiration of the United States;\n       Whereas the children of the United States should be allowed \n     to feel that their ideas and dreams will be respected because \n     adults in the United States take time to listen;\n       Whereas many children of the United States face crisis of \n     grave proportions, especially as they enter adolescent years;\n       Whereas it is important for parents to spend time listening \n     to their children on a daily basis;\n       Whereas modern societal and economic demands often pull the \n     family apart;\n       Whereas encouragement should be given to families to set a \n     special time for all family members to engage together in \n     family activities;\n       Whereas adults in the United States should have an \n     opportunity to reminisce on their youth to recapture some of \n     the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams that they may have \n     lost through the years;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     emphasize to children the importance of developing an ability \n     to make the choices necessary to distance themselves from \n     impropriety and to contribute to their communities;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children of the Nation will emphasize to the people of the \n     United States the importance of the role of the child within \n     the family and society;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should emphasize to \n     children the importance of family life, education, and \n     spiritual qualities; and\n       Whereas children are the responsibility of all Americans, \n     thus everyone should celebrate the children of the United \n     States, whose questions, laughter, and tears are important to \n     the existence of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the second Sunday in \n     October of 1996 as ``National Children's Day'' and requests \n     that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people \n     of the United States to observe the day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as a parent myself, I understand the \npride and joy we all have in our children. Along with many of my \ncolleagues, I am submitting a resolution today declaring the second \nSunday in October,\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n``National Children's Day.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nresolution for the seventh consecutive year. As it has been for the \npast 6 years, National Children's Day is about hope--the hopes we have \nfor children and the hope they must have for themselves. The \nsignificant contributions children make to our lives should not go \nunnoticed.\n  National Children's Day gives Americans the opportunity to reflect on \nwhat we as parents, community leaders, and policymakers can do for the \nchildren of today and tomorrow. The future of today's children looks \nbright for a number of reasons. Republicans in Congress are serious \nabout balancing the budget. We would like to give America's children a \nunique gift of freedom--freedom from national debt. By balancing the \nbudget and reducing the debt, children will have a chance to experience \nas adults a far better quality of life than we enjoy today. A balanced \nbudget means lower interest rates, which would make a college education \nand a first home more affordable. Positive welfare reform, improved \naccess to health care, and some of the toughest-ever child protection \nlaws have helped to make the United States an even better environment \nfor our children.\n  Technology, too, has opened up an exciting new world of possibilities \nfor young people. Computers are becoming commonplace in classrooms. By \nutilizing advanced telecommunications, we can expand distance learning \nopportunities, especially for children in small cities and towns. When \nI was a kid growing up in Humboldt, SD, library books were my windows \nto the world. Today's children can sit at their computers, access the \ninternet, and literally see, learn about, and talk to the world. These \nopportunities are truly remarkable.\n  While the outlook for our children is very positive, we must not lose \nsight of the challenges that lie ahead. National Children's Day also is \nabout protecting our children from all evil forces, internal or \nexternal. Children were the tragic victims in Oklahoma City and, of \ncourse, on TWA Flight 800. These and other acts of terror cannot be \ntolerated. Our children deserve the continued assurance of a childhood \nfull of hope and free from fear.\n  Each day, children from across South Dakota write letters to me \nasking for my help. Recently, I received a letter from Brandon Rausch, \na young boy in South Dakota working toward a Boy Scout award. He wrote \nurging me to do something about gangs and school violence. South Dakota \nrecently has experienced an increase in juvenile violence, drug and \nalcohol abuse, and other destructive behavior. Although South Dakota \nstill has one of the lowest crime rates in our Nation, we no longer are \nimmune from the social problems that used to impact only our Nation's \nlargest cities. I would tell Brandon, his friends, his parents, and his \nteachers that I will do my best to help his community keep the streets \nsafe. Ultimately, we all must work together to defeat crime. Parents, \nteachers, law enforcement officers, religious and community leaders, \nand yes, even our kids, must work together. Teamwork is the best work. \nThat is more true today than ever because we live in a world where \nchildren are asked to grow up faster than ever.\n\n  Mr. President, children from across the Nation visit our Senate \noffices every day. Among those children from South Dakota who have \nvisited my office recently are Karna Lillebo; Jennifer, Kayla, and \nJeremy Nebelsick; Travis and Ryan Oorlog; Matt, Nick, and Katie Padron; \nRobb, TJ, and Tiffany Rolfing; and Michael and Timothy Wrenn. I am \npleased they had the great opportunity to visit Washington to \nexperience the splendor and beauty of our Nation's capital. These \nchildren and all others deserve the very best we can offer them.\n  My colleagues may be interested to learn that Father Robert Fox from \nmy home State of South Dakota serves as the national chairman of \nNational Children's Day. He has been the chair for some time now. He \nstill keeps in contact with Mary McCusker, who, along with her husband, \nDr. Patrick McCusker, began celebrating National Children's Day on the \nsecond Sunday in October 47 years ago. Father Fox has been instrumental \nin gaining worldwide recognition for National Children's Day. In fact, \nImmaculate Heart Messenger, a publication that Father Fox edits, \nrecently promoted the celebration of children across our Nation and in \ncountries around the globe.\n  Over the past 47 years, the meaning of National Children's Day has \nremained the same. National Children's Day promises children, as a \nNation, that we will stand by them. As a Nation, we adults will strive \nto provide for them, to look out for them, and to be their friends and \ntheir partners. National Children's Day reminds us we live both for \ntoday and tomorrow. National Children's Day is a celebration of our \nNation's pride and hope in our children now and for the future.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Graham, DeWine, Chafee, \nGorton, Kassebaum, Spector, Stevens, Thurmond, Frist, Warner, and Lott \nfor their continued support of this effort. Our bipartisan efforts \nduring this Congress ensure that every day will be National Children's \nDay, but on the second Sunday in October, we should all pause for a \nmoment and remember those for whom we all work--our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10556-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10557-S10563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 5317\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Lott, Mr. \nAbraham, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Pressler) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (H.R. 3662) making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1997, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the ______, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ______.

It is of particular concern \nthat over 5 million children go hungry at some point each month, and \nthat there has been a 60-percent increase in the number of children \nneeding foster care in the last 10 years. It is also appropriate that \nadults in the United States have an opportunity to reminisce on their \nyouth to recapture some of the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams \nthat they may have lost through the years.\n  There are times when Congress can enact simple measures that ensure \nthat the needs of our Nation's children are being recognized. It is the \nleast we can do to celebrate the contributions children make in each of \nour lives and to all America.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring National Children's \nDay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10564-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            H. JOSEPH GERBER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this time \nto remember Joseph Gerber, the founder and chairman of Gerber \nScientific, Inc. and a Connecticut resident, who died in early August \nwhen Congress was out of session. I will sorely miss this great \nConnecticut businessman and innovator and send his family my sincere \nsympathy for their loss.\n  Mr. Gerber was nicknamed ``Thomas Edison'' in the apparel industry \nfor his countless inventions--he was awarded over 650 U.S. and foreign \npatents for his technological innovations. His contributions to \nadvanced manufacturing transformed many sectors including signmaking, \ngraphic arts, printed circuit boards, optics, and automotive and \naerospace technologies. He generously donated some of his inventions to \nthe Smithsonian Institution--they can be found in the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of American History as part of its permanent \ncollection.\n  Mr. Gerber was a champion of invention from very early on. As a \njunior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he invented a \nrevoluntionary graphical numerical computer. This product--the Gerber \nVariable Scale--was rolled out to launch the Gerber Scientific \nInstrument Co. In a matter of five decades, Gerber Scientific grew from \nan initial investment of $3,000 to a major supplier of automated \nmanufacturing systems. Today, Gerber Scientific, head- quartered in \nSouth Windsor, CT, boasts worldwide sales exceeding $350 million. Mr. \nGerber's creativity, motivation and business savvy propelled this \ncorporation into success.\n  H. Joseph Gerber received many honors, awards and honorary \ndoctorates. In 1953, he was chosen as one of The Ten Outstanding Young \nMen of the United States for contributions to his community, State, and \nNation by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. He accepted the \nConnecticut Medal of Technology awarded by the Governor in 1994, was a \nmember of the National Academy of Engineers and the Connecticut Academy \nof Science and Engineering and served as a trustee of Rensselaer \nPolytechnic Institute. In 1994, President Clinton awarded Mr. Gerber \nthe National Medal of Technology.\n  H. Joseph Gerber was equally inspirational in his personal \nachievements. He was born in Vienna, Austria in 1924, but his family's \nlife was shattered by Nazi occupation. He was imprisoned in a Nazi \nlabor camp when he was 15, but he and his mother were able to flee \nAustria to the United States in 1940. He quickly learned to speak \nEnglish, and, while working to support his mother, graduated from \nWeaver High School in Hartford in 2 years and then from Rennselaer \nPolytechnic Institute in less than 3 years with an aeronautical \nengineering degree. I salute H. Joseph Gerber and pause for a moment of \nreflection in memory of this very accomplished and generous \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10564-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10564-S10565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nimportant achievement by this body, as well as to congratulate my \ncolleagues on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \nbeing signed into law. Last year, I joined Senators Kassebaum and \nKennedy in introducing this important piece of legislation. It has \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support in both the House of Representatives \nand the U.S. Senate.\n  Last summer, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, of which I \nam a member, reported out this legislation unanimously. This spring, \nthe bill passed with overwhelming support in the Senate. Mr. President, \nas you may recall, the vote was 100 to 0.\n  I regret that this very popular bill--that the General Accounting \nOffice told us would help 25 million Americans--was filibustered for 94 \ndays by our Democratic colleagues and therefore enactment was \nunnecessarily delayed.\n  First, we heard from our friends across the aisle that the bill \ncontained poison pills--provisions that would jeopardize support for \nthe overall bill.\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\n The most fiercely opposed was inclusion of a medical savings account \nprovision.\n  To back up a bit, I would like to read the language of an amendment \nthat I offered, and that passed, during consideration of the bill by \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Specifically, the committee \nadded a sense of the committee that the establishment of medical \nsavings accounts should be encouraged as part of any health insurance \nreform legislation passed by the Senate through the use of tax \nincentives relating to contributions to, the income growth of, and the \nqualified use of, such accounts.\n  Although the Labor Committee does not have jurisdiction over the \nInternal Revenue Code, this amendment articulated our support that MSAs \nshould be a part of the final package. Furthermore, the Kassebaum-\nKennedy legislation addressed the issue of medical savings accounts \nwithin its area of jurisdiction, the Public Health Service Act. The \nbill allows health maintenance organizations [HMO's] to offer \ndeductibles in conjunction with a medical savings account. This was a \nnecessary change to current law because the current HMO Act prohibits \nmanaged care plans from offering significant copayments and deductibles \nwhich would typify a catastrophic plan design. By including this \nlanguage, the committee hoped to level the playing field for all health \ndelivery systems in offering a medical savings account product. My own \nMSA legislation, introduced last year, also accomplishes this goal.\n  The medical savings account provisions included in the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act are much more narrow than \nthe bill I introduced last year to establish MSA's. However, I believe \nthe provision has much to offer the population it is directed toward: \nsmall employers and the self-employed. This population could greatly \nbenefit from expanding their choices of affordable health plan options. \nIn addition, it is worth encouraging individuals to become better \nconsumers of their health care dollars. The MSA provision included in \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act attempts to \naccomplish this goal.\n\n  Mr. President, the Journal of the American Medical Association \nrecently published a study by the RAND Corp. regarding medical savings \naccounts. RAND currently conducts the largest private program of health \npolicy research in the United States. RAND has an exceptional program \nof health care research that has helped advance knowledge about how \ncost, quality, and access to care can be improved. Its research agenda \nhas kept pace with the Nation's emerging health policy concerns and has \nhelped shape the way policymakers, health professionals, and the public \nthink about these issues.\n  We should note that the RAND study concludes that MSA's could prove \nattractive to some sick and lower income people as well as to the \nhealthy and well-to-do. The report implies that this is an effort worth \ndemonstrating--and certainly not poisonous--especially when we focus on \nextending the option to populations that now have difficulty finding \naffordable health care options.\n  Above all, the goal of the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act continues to be the implementation of the very basic \nreforms of portability and limits on pre-existing conditions. The \nSenate has debated both these issues for the past 6 years. The bills \nhave even passed the Senate in previous years, but ultimately failed to \nbecome law. These reforms represent what we all support and are \nimportant to the many people who experience a sense of job-lock or pre-\nexisting conditions. The General Accounting Office [GAO] estimates that \n25 million people will benefit from this bill.\n  Yet, even once the MSA provision was resolved the group-to-individual \nportability provisions came under attack. We need to remember why \nhealth insurance reform legislation was pursued by this Congress. The \ngoal of this bill has always been to insure that people who play by the \nrules will not be denied access to health insurance. That must be the \nlitmus test for the ultimate success of this legislation. The \nconference agreement continues to insure that individuals who change or \nlose their jobs will have access to a choice of health insurance \npolicies. The goal of portability remains strong in the bill.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has delivered on its promise to enact \nmarket-based insurance reforms that increase everyone's security that \nthey will not lose their health insurance. I congratulate the majority \nleader, Senators Kassebaum and Roth, and the other conferees for \nultimately refusing to allow politics as usual to stand in the way of \nadopting these national rules.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2074 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of calendar No. 575, H.R. 3553.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3553) to amend the Federal Trade Commission \n     Act to authorize appropriations for the Federal Trade \n     Commission.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, H.R. 3553, the Federal Trade Commission \nReauthorization Act of 1996, would reauthorize the Federal Trade \nCommission [FTC] for the next 2 fiscal years. The bill would authorize \nappropriations of $107 million in fiscal year 1997 and $111 million in \nfiscal year 1998. The expenditures authorized by this bill would be \nsufficient to permit the FTC to maintain existing staffing levels of \n979 full-time equivalent employees.\n  H.R. 3553 is identical to S. 1840 which I introduced along with \nSenators Gorton, Hollings, Bryan, and Snowe. Before we introduced S. \n1840 on June 5, 1996, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation held a hearing on May 7, 1996, to review the FTC's \nactivities. The Commerce Committee ordered the bill favorably reported \nduring executive session on June 6, 1996. Because the House and Senate \nbills are identical, I am asking the Senate to adopt the House passed \nversion so that we may send the bill to the President without the need \nfor a conference.\n  The FTC was created as an independent regulatory agency in 1914 by \nthe Federal Trade Commission Act. The agency is charged with the dual \nmission of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement.\n  Congress last authorized appropriations for the FTC in 1994. That \nauthorization expires at the end of fiscal year 1996. The 1994 \nauthorization followed a 12-year period in which appropriations to the \nFTC were not authorized. In that authorization act, significant changes \nwere made to the FTC's authorizing statutes.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 3553, like its identical companion bill S. 1840, \nmakes no further changes in the authorizing statutes. It is a simple \nauthorization of appropriations and S. 1840 was in no way controversial \nduring its committee consideration. I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 3553 \nas received from the House.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe deemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3553) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10565-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 2073\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nConstitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication \nUnion [ITU], with annexes, signed at Geneva on December 22, 1992, \nTreaty Document No. 104-34, transmitted to the Senate by the President \non September 13, 1996; that the treaty be considered as having been \nread the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that \nthe President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Constitution and Convention of \nthe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), with Annexes, signed \nat Geneva on December 22, 1992, and amendments to the Constitution and \nConvention, signed at Kyoto on October 14, 1994, together with \ndeclarations and reservations by the United States as contained in the \nFinal Acts. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Constitution and \nConvention and the amendments thereto.\n  The 1992 Constitution and Convention replace the ITU Convention \nsigned in Nairobi in 1982. Prior to the 1992 Constitution and \nConvention, the ITU Convention had been routinely replaced at \nsuccessive Plenipotentiary Conferences every 5 to 10 years. The 1992 \nConstitution and Convention represent the first basic instruments of \nthe ITU intended to be permanent. Basic provisions on the organization \nand structure of the ITU and fundamental substantive rules governing \ninternational telecommunications matters are embodied in the \nConstitution. The ITU Convention is comprised of provisions on the \nfunctioning of the ITU and its constituent parts.\n  The 1992 Constitution and Convention reflect the effort by ITU Member \ncountries to restructure the ITU to make it more effective in \nresponding to the changes taking place in telecommunications. The \nUnited States is pleased with the restructuring of the ITU. The changes \nadopted are expected to enable the ITU to meet challenges brought on by \nthe dynamic telecommunications environment.\n  The 1994 ITU Plenipotentiary Conferences was convened less than 4 \nmonths after the entry into force of the Constitution and Convention to \namend the 1992 Constitution and Convention. Recognizing that more time \nshould be allowed to evaluate the extensive changes to the structure of \nthe ITU, the Conference adopted only a few minor amendments, which were \nacceptable to the United States.\n  In signing the 1992 Constitution and Convention and the 1994 \namendments, the United States made certain declarations and \nreservations. The specific declarations and reservations are discussed \nin the report of the Department of State.\n  The 1992 Constitution and Convention entered into force July 1, 1994, \nfor states which, by that date, had notified the Secretary General of \nthe ITU of their approval thereof and, in the same manner, the \namendments to the Constitution and Convention entered into force on \nJanuary 1, 1996.\n  Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I \nbelieve the United States should be a party to the ITU Constitution and \nConvention, as amended. They will improve the efficiency of management \nof the ITU and will allow it to be more responsive to the needs of the \nUnited States Government and private sector. It is my hope that the \nSenate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 13, 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/13/senate-section/article/S10566-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMENDING THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
