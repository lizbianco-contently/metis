Mr. President, today, the Senate returns to session for the \nfirst time since the tragic accident on April 3 that took the lives of \nSecretary of Commerce Ron Brown and 32 other Americans.\n  The majority leader, with agreement of the Democratic leader, has \nrequested that the first action of the Senate be the reading of a \nresolution honoring Secretary Brown and those lost in the accident.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nthat it be read for the information of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Brown and \n     other Americans who lost their lives on April 3, 1996, while \n     in service to their country on a mission to Bosnia.\n       Whereas, Ronald H. Brown served the United States of \n     America with patriotism and skill as a soldier, a civil \n     rights leader, and an attorney;\n       Whereas, Ronald H. Brown served since January 22, 1993, as \n     the United States Secretary of Commerce;\n       Whereas, Ronald H. Brown devoted his life to opening doors, \n     building bridges, and helping those in need;\n       Whereas, Ronald H. Brown lost his life in a tragic airplane \n     accident on April 3, 1996, while in service to his country on \n     a mission in Bosnia; and\n       Whereas, thirty-two other Americans from government and \n     industry who served the Nation with great courage, \n     achievement, and dedication also lost their lives in the \n     accident; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States pays tribute \n     to the remarkable life and career of Ronald H.

The Senate also pays tribute to the contributions \n     of all those who perished, and extends condolences to the \n     families of: Staff\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n     Sergeant Gerald Aldrich, Duane Christian, Barry Conrad, Paul \n     Cushman III, Adam Darling, Captain Ashley James Davis, Gail \n     Dobert, Robert Donovan, Claudio Elia, Staff Sergeant Robert \n     Farrington, Jr., David Ford, Carol Hamilton, Kathryn Hoffman, \n     Lee Jackson, Steven Kaminski, Katheryn Kellogg, Technical \n     Sergeant Shelley Kelly, James Lewek, Frank Maier, Charles \n     Meissner, William Morton, Walter Murphy, Lawrence Payne, \n     Nathaniel Nash, Leonard Pieroni, Captain Timothy Schafer, \n     John Scoville, I.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of the resolution to each of the families.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is the intention of the majority leader \nto bring the resolution up for final passage sometime after tomorrow's \npolicy luncheons. That will allow those Members who desire to come to \nthe floor and pay tribute to Secretary Brown and other public servants \nand industry leaders who lost their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under a previous order, the Senator \nfrom Utah [Mr. Hatch] is recognized to speak for up to 40 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I requested through our leadership to be \nalso included on the list. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nafter Senator Hatch for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional 2 minutes so that I can personally pay my respects to Ron \nBrown and his family.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not say much here today except that \nI knew Ron Brown very well. I thought he was one of the finest people \nin this town. I knew him when he was a leader on the Judiciary \nCommittee under Senator Kennedy, and we were friends ever since.\n  Many times I have lamented that we did not have as competent and \ntremendous a leader in our party as then Chairman Brown was. We had \ngood people. We can be proud of them. But Chairman Brown did one of the \nbest jobs I have ever seen done in a national election.\n  I also have traveled around the world and have seen some of the work \nthat he has done with regard to the Commerce Department's work and \nopportunities, and he did a terrific job. He was well recognized all \nover the world as somebody who advanced America's business.\n  I personally want to send a message to his family and to those who \nloved Ron Brown that I did, too, and I had cared for him. Had I not \nbeen in the Balkans during that time--we left the day after the \naccident--with the minority leader and Senator Reid, I would have been \nat his funeral to pay my respects to him and his family. Of course, I \nam very grieved and hurt by this tragic accident.\n  I also want to extend my sympathy to all of the families of those who \ndied in that tragic accident. Having traveled over there, I can see how \nthat could occur. I can see how difficult that must have been for all \nof those families who lost loved ones as a result of that tragic crash.\n  I could not speak more highly of a person than I am presently \nspeaking of Ron Brown.\n  I knew some of the others on the plane. I actually met with some of \nthe people who were friends of the crew who flew the plane. We had a \ncrew that flew us into Sarajevo and into Tuzla who basically had worked \nday in and day out with all of the members of that crew.\n  I know that I speak for everybody in the Senate and across this \ncountry in extending our sympathy to all those folks who lost their \nlives. I hope Ron's wife, Alma, will be comforted, and I hope that the \nfamily will be comforted as well. He has my respect, and I am very \nhappy to have had this time to pay my respects this morning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record a \ntribute to Ron Brown which I gave last Tuesday evening at the \nMetropolitan Baptist Church here in Washington. There were a number of \nspeakers who reflected on Secretary Brown's very considerable life, \nfrom early beginnings to really an outstanding distinguished career, \nand spoke with great tenderness and sensitivity and thoughtfulness, not \nonly about Ron but also about his family.\n  I would like to take just a few moments of the Senate's time today to \nread those remarks into the Record:\n\n       Alma, Tracey, Michael and Tami, Gloria Brown, friends and \n     fellow mourners:\n       I speak this evening in tribute to Ron Brown, because I \n     knew him well and loved him dearly. But I join as well in \n     tribute to the thirty-four others we have lost, who have now \n     given the last full measure of devotion. Our hearts are \n     breaking now. Our minds can hardly conceive the loss, or \n     compose the words to express the depth of what we feel.\n       The poet could have been thinking of Ron Brown when he \n     wrote of another who died too young, in words used about my \n     brothers too: ``What made us dream that he could comb gray \n     hair?''\n       Ron and I were supposed to have lunch this Friday. It had \n     been too long. We wanted to catch up. The Senate would be in \n     recess, and Ron would be back from Bosnia.\n       He said he wanted to show me the large fish tank in his \n     office. When he and Alma were at our home one evening, I had \n     shown them the modest tank we have. He winked at me and told \n     Vicki and our two children: ``Come on over to my office--and \n     bring Curran and Caroline too. I'll show you a real fish \n     tank. I'll even tell Ted where you can get one.'' That was \n     Ron--always the best in everything he did, and wanting it for \n     everyone else too.\n       We also had a few items of business to discuss. Ron was \n     Chairman of the Senior Advisory Committee of the Institute of \n     Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. For \n     him, it was a long and lasting labor of love. As he had been \n     inspired in his youth, so he always found time for the next \n     generation. While he was busy electing a President in 1992, \n     he was never too busy for those whose election would come in \n     2012. He was there, year in and year out, for every meeting \n     at the Institute of Politics. He would stay overnight in \n     President Kennedy's room at Winthrop House and eat and talk \n     with the undergraduates. He inspired students as he inspired \n     CEOs. He was equally at home in the classroom and the \n     boardroom, in Harlem and at Harvard.\n       So at lunch on Friday, we were to discuss the meeting in \n     Cambridge that was coming up later this month. The committee \n     had a couple of vacancies to fill. And now there is an \n     unfillable new vacancy.\n       Ron was first in so many things--his career was so \n     brilliant and conspicuous--that he was almost certainly bound \n     to be a target for some as surely as he was a role model for \n     others. He was prepared to pay that price to advance his \n     country and his beliefs. And something now demands to be \n     said. This, my friends, was a man of great honor who proved \n     anew my brother's ideal that public service is a great and \n     honorable profession.\n       I first came to know Ron almost half a lifetime ago during \n     his years at the Urban League. He was in the vanguard of the \n     new generation of civil rights leaders.\n       He already had then what he would later bring to the \n     highest places of power--a rare quality of double vision in \n     public life, which enabled him to see the issues clearly and \n     see the politics just as clearly too. He knew how to steer by \n     the stars, not just by the fading signals of each passing \n     ship.\n       He honored me by becoming part of my campaign for President \n     in 1980. He came on board as deputy campaign manager for \n     civil rights, and soon became deputy for everything else as \n     well. He was Will Rogers in reverse. I never met a person who \n     didn't like Ron Brown.\n       In 1980, I lost the nomination. But in Ron, I gained \n     another brother.\n       He was irrepressible and undefeatable. For him, ``no you \n     can't'' always became ``yes you can.'' You can integrate that \n     college fraternity. You can win the California primary. You \n     can rebuild the Democratic Party and elect a President in a \n     year when almost no one else thought it could happen. Then \n     you can reinvent government and invent a new commercial \n     diplomacy for a new post-Cold War world. You can make the \n     Commerce Department work--and if you'll pardon a partisan \n     note today, don't let anyone on Capitol Hill tell you you \n     can't.\n       Ron believed in government and all of you and in public \n     service. He detested cynicism and the shameful politics of \n     running for office by trashing the institutions you seek to \n     lead. He helped to write history, and not a single word he \n     wrote was petty or mean.\n       I have been through other moments like this, and I know how \n     tightly we grasp the memories in order to keep the man. We \n     recall what was only yesterday, and smile through our tears.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n       I still see Ron, coming to play tennis on early mornings \n     before work. He'd arrive with three rackets, dressed to the \n     nines, looking like he was ready to play at Wimbledon. He \n     always won, and that's why I always made sure he was my \n     partner in doubles.\n       He had a style and a soaring spirit. He had a host of \n     friends who were honored to serve with him--many of us \n     assembled here today--those who were with him on his last \n     journey--and one other I must mention who was with him on \n     that remarkable journey to victory at the DNC--his sidekick, \n     Paul Tully. Ron, of course, never had his tie out of place, \n     while Paul never had his shirt tucked in. What a marvelous \n     combination they were for their party and their country. Ron \n     saw and called on the best in Paul, and in all of us.\n       The great physicist Lord Rutherford was once asked how he \n     always happened to be riding the crest of the wave, and he \n     replied, ``Well, I made the wave, didn't I?'' That's how I \n     felt about Ron Brown. He was one of those few who make the \n     waves that carry us to a better distant shore.\n       For his nation, Ron was more than an ambassador of \n     commerce. His missions were pilgrimages of peace, of economic \n     hope and democracy's ideals.\n       For his party and his President, he was close to the \n     indispensable man.\n       For his friends, he was a Cape Cod day and a cloudless sky.\n       For his family, he was everything--as they were for him. \n     Sometimes, I'd call during the day to see if he and Alma \n     could drop by that evening. He'd call back and ask for a rain \n     check. Michael and Tami were going out, and Ron and Alma were \n     babysitting for their twins. How he loved those two young \n     boys, Morgan and Ryan. His whole face would light up when he \n     talked about them.\n       And how proud he was and how much he loved his children, \n     Michael and Tracey. Everyone who knew Ron knew how special \n     they were to him, how much pride he took in their \n     accomplishments, how close he was to them.\n       And Alma, dear Alma, how he loved you. I remember vividly \n     one time when Vicki and I were talking to Ron and we saw Alma \n     across the room. I mentioned how beautiful she looked, how \n     extraordinary she was. Ron's face lit up with that sparkling \n     trademark smile, and he said, ``She's pretty spectacular, \n     isn't she?'' That said it all, and the word ``spectacular'' \n     was made for Ron Brown too.\n       Now Ron's journey of grace has come to an incomprehensible \n     end. But for this generation and generations to come, he is \n     spectacular proof that America can be the land of opportunity \n     it was meant to be.\n       We love you and we miss you Ron--and we always will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3251-6", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3253-S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CIVIL RIGHTS POLICY AND THE NATION'S FUTURE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our country stands at a crossroads in the \npath it travels in relations among the different races and ethnic \ngroups that make up the American people. Down one path is the way of \nmutual understanding and goodwill; the way of equal opportunity for \nindividuals; the way of seriously and persistently addressing our \nvarious social problems as America's problems. It is the way, \nultimately, of greater unity among our people. Down the other path is \nthe way of mutual suspicion, fear, ill will, and indifference; the way \nof group rights and group preferences. On this path we march toward \ngreater division. And, on this path, the signpost is marked: equal \nresults for groups, not equal rights for individuals.\n  This is a time when our national leadership needs to lead us down the \nproper path. I am concerned, however, that the President views this \nsubject too much as a political issue. It has been an issue which he \nhas sought to manage in order to avoid an intra-party challenge or \nindependent candidacy from his left, rather than simply base policy \nsolely on the merits. Thus, he has firmly and resolutely defended, in \nprinciple, the current racial, ethnic, and gender preference regime in \nthis country. And, in practice, he has preserved the vast bulk of the \nactual preferential programs, of which there are dozens at the Federal \nlevel and many more at other levels of government, that make up this \nregime. At the same time, he apparently believes he can nibble at the \nedges of this problem of preferences, to look like he is doing \nsomething meaningful about it.\n  We must start with a genuine dialog on race, ethnicity, and how \npublic policy can be changed for the better.\n  In my opinion, the discussion of this issue must begin with the \nunderstanding of this country's history of discrimination against some \npeople because of their membership in a particular racial, ethnic, or \ngender group.\n  Indeed, one aspect of this history, the continued subjugation of \npeople enslaved because of the color of their skin, is not merely an \nunspeakable evil that mocked our principles and ideals; in fact, \nslavery, together with the continuing discrimination following its \neradication, still has consequences today.\n  I think many members of the white majority in this country have \ndifficulty appreciating just how significantly different and less \nhospitable an experience black people, and members of other nonwhite \nminorities, have had in our country. This does not mean, of course, \nthat Irish, Italian, Eastern European, and other peoples in the white \nmajority did not suffer discrimination in America, or that religious \nminorities in America, such as Catholics, Jews, and Mormons, have not \nbeen victimized because of their religion. Some of this discrimination, \nregrettably, still occurs. But the color line in this country, was, and \nis, one of the harshest lines that has ever confronted our people.\n  It was not so long ago that State Governors stood in schoolhouse \ndoors to bar black students from entering. Black and Hispanic \nyoungsters were discriminated against at all levels of education in \nmany parts of the country. It was not so long ago that U.S. marshals \nand Federal troops had to protect public school children and college \nstudents in exercising their constitutional rights. People were \nmurdered because of their black, brown, and yellow skin--a crime still \ncommitted in our country in recent years. And people lost their lives \nin trying to remove the color line in our law.\n  It was not so long ago that Americans of black and brown skin could \nreturn from service in our Armed Forces, be able to afford an apartment \nor house, yet be lawfully turned away because they were regarded as the \nwrong color for the neighborhood. Many of the basic necessities of \nlife--jobs, housing, public accommodations, the right to vote--were \nlegally denied or curtailed because of race, color, and ethnicity.\n  We will never go back to those days. But we must never forget them. \nAnd it is necessary for white Americans to have understanding in their \nhearts, empathy in their actions and attitudes, and a willingness to \naddress social problems in this country--not just the problems they and \ntheir neighbors face, but problems all of our people face.\n  We need, in my view, a mutual understanding among the races that the \nlegacy of past and present-day discrimination, and its social effects, \nmust be addressed, and that our actions and remedies addressing these \nproblems must be fair and must avoid penalizing innocent persons. We \ncan do this.\n  This mutual understanding might be summed up this way: The legacy of \ndistant discrimination, committed beyond the statute of limitations of \nour civil rights laws, must be treated as a socio-economic problem, and \nnot as a problem calling for preferences against innocent persons \ntoday. Further, present-day violations of our civil rights laws, of \ncourse, must be vigorously pursued; but, again, persons not victimized \nby present-day violations should not be preferred over innocent persons \nin any remedy.\n  One way to illustrate this point is this: While title VII, which \nprohibits discrimination in employment, can ensure that the best \nqualified person not be denied a job because of race, ethnicity, or \ngender, title VII does nothing to help anyone become the best qualified \nperson for a job.\n  We need a mutual understanding that our pride in our racial, ethnic, \nand religious backgrounds in America is exactly that, pride in an \nimportant part of ourselves, and hostility to no other person on its \naccount.\n  We need a mutual understanding that we live in a free and \ngood society, with all of its flaws, where opportunity and the ability \nto dream big dreams remain open to us, where progress has been made in \nmaking the great possibilities of America available to all, and where \nwe are not yet finished.\n\n  Indeed, I say to my fellow Americans, we are not ultimately defined \nby our race, ethnicity, or color, but by our common humanity and our \ncommon citizenship. American values, American principles, American \nideals must be our guide. Our Declaration of Independence says it well: \n``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\nunalienable rights * * * .'' We had to learn that this included women \nand men other than white men, but we have learned it. We must make it \nwork in every generation. We are in life's journey together. We are \ninextricably bound together by our God-given humanity, common \ncitizenship, and common heritage as Americans.\n  Over 200 years ago, a very wise member of our founding generation, \nBenjamin Franklin, referred to his fellow ragtag rebels in 13 \ndiscordant, often quarreling colonies fighting the world's greatest \nsuperpower and said: ``if we do not hang together, we will all hang \nseparately.''\n  Today, I say, if we Americans do not progress together as a people, \nwe will surely decline in our own separate, squabbling groups.\n  Today, Americans face many challenges: world economic competition; \ninstability in parts of the world, hostility in others; international \nand domestic terrorism; crime in our streets; improving our educational \nsystems. We must face these challenges together.\n  Some things must come from within the individual, and from within our \nfamilies, our neighborhoods and communities. These are clearly the \nplaces where our work must begin and where our progress must occur. But \nwe must help each other and work together.\n  While we cannot, and should not, compel people to associate with one \nanother socially, if all we have done is replace a government imposed \ncolor line with a voluntary color line imposed by our indifference, \nfear, mistrust, or superior attitudes, we will all be the losers. And, \nif all we have done is replace one set of discriminatory practices with \nanother, in the name of nondiscrimination no less, we will never reach \nour full potential as a united people.\n  I think it is useful to pose this fundamental question: What is it \nour fellow citizens whose skin color is other than white really want?\n  I claim no special expertise. I speak for myself only as a citizen \nand public servant, to offer this observation: Americans who are part \nof a racial or ethnic minority group want decent and secure jobs; good \nschooling for their children; safety in their streets and \nneighborhoods; decent housing; a chance to go as far as their abilities \nand drive take them; a chance to earn some of the finer things in life.\n  Am I not describing the very same things the white majority in this \ncountry wants? As different as our experiences may be, and as different \nas our skin color may be, are we Americans really so very much \ndifferent from one another? My answer is no.\n  If I am right, two things follow. First, sound general public \npolicies that help all of our citizens are needed. These include \npolicies to strengthen and nurture families. These policies include an \nemphasis on traditional values such as honesty, hard work, individual \nresponsibility, compassion, and respect for others. I believe that \nreligious institutions must play a vital role in helping foster these \nvalues in our young people and that government should encourage such a \nrole, not place needless obstacles in the way. Sound general policies \ninclude tough anticrime and antidrug strategies. They include welfare \nreform aimed at fostering greater independence and self-sufficiency. \nThey include sound policies for generating economic growth and job \ncreation, including job training; improving our schools; and policies \nfavoring housing construction and low interest rates. Reducing trade \nbarriers, reducing taxes, lightening the regulatory burden, creating \nand sustaining a growing economy--all of this is the foundation of our \nprogress as a people. To borrow what has become a familiar phrase--a \nrising tide lifts all boats.\n  But second, Americans must understand, that for the descendants of \nslaves and for others whose history in this country includes a color \nbarrier, there are special problems in achieving their piece of the \nAmerican dream. These problems require acknowledgment and response. A \nmix of focused private and public action, guided by fair play for all, \nis called for.\n  It is to this second point I now wish to turn.\n  Racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, of course, regrettably, \ncontinues down to the present day.\n  Fortunately, this Nation finally adopted an array of civil rights \nlaws aimed at eradicating discrimination based on race, ethnicity, \ncolor, disability, and gender. Our civil rights laws should be \nvigorously and sensibly enforced.\n  But, Mr. President, there is danger and risk as we address problems \nstemming from past and present discrimination. You don't put out a \nforest fire by pouring gasoline on it, and you do not cure \ndiscrimination--past or present--with more discrimination.\n  Every individual is made in God's image and should be treated in the \nworkplace, the business world, schools, public accommodations and the \nlike without regard to race, ethnicity, or gender. If we cannot stand \nas a nation for that simple, powerful, yet historically elusive \nprinciple today, when will we ever stand for it? And what do we stand \nfor, as a nation, if we do not stand for equal opportunity for every \nindividual?\n\n  I stand for the primacy of the individual. Our rights as Americans do \nnot turn on the color of our skin, our ethnic background, or our \nreligious faith. Just as we should never forget that America has often \ndeparted from her founding principles and ideals of equal opportunity \nfor individuals, we should never forget that those are the principles \nand ideals we should ever be striving to fulfill. And in our necessary \neffort to right old wrongs, let us not create new wrongs.\n  A person denied a job, a promotion, a contract, a training program, \nor admission to school because of race, ethnicity, or gender should be \nmade whole. In the case of employment discrimination, for example, back \npay and the next available job with retroactive seniority should be \nmade available to the victim of discrimination. The discrimination \nshould be enjoined.\n  But, no innocent third party should be forced to lose or delay a job, \na promotion, a training opportunity, or be laid off in favor of a \nperson not victimized by discrimination because that person is the same \ncolor as someone who was, in fact, discriminated against. That is the \ndifference between a policy of individual rights versus group rights.\n  President Clinton, in defending policies of group rights that are one \nsignificant part of the modern day affirmative action structure says, \nmend it, don't end it. I say, with respect to the preferences that are \na significant part of affirmative action, two civil wrongs do not make \na civil right.\n  Affirmative action that utilizes or encourages preferences on the \nbasis of race, ethnicity, or gender in actual selection decisions--\nhiring, promotion, layoff, contract awards, school admissions, \nscholarship awards, government benefits--whether labeled goal, quota, \nor otherwise, is wrong and should be ended. These preferential devices \nare merely another form of discrimination. I stress that preferences \ncome in many forms--not just quotas and not just in numerical \nformulations.\n  It is acceptable, in contrast, for an employer to engage in \naffirmative action that calls for reviewing personnel practices to \nensure they are free of discrimination. It is acceptable for employers \nto make an effort to recruit applicants from among those who \ntraditionally do not apply for the job--or in other contexts, for a \ncontract, or school admission--after which the selection is made \nwithout regard to race, ethnicity, or gender. In appropriate \ncircumstances, other affirmative steps, targeted to disadvantaged \npersons, but open to all on a nondiscriminatory basis, are acceptable. \nThus, a job training program aimed at the chronically unemployed, or \nthe urban unemployed, is fine, so long as no one is ever turned away \nbecause of race, ethnicity, or gender. If such a job training program \nis established in New York City or Washington, DC, for example, no \ndoubt many racial and ethnic minorities should be able to take \nadvantage of it. But nonminorities also live in these cities and if \nthey otherwise qualify for the program, they should not be denied entry \nbecause of race or be subject to express or implied numerical \nlimitations. Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch testified on October \n23, 1995, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, that he was \nunhappy at one point with the low numbers of minorities passing police \nexams in New York City. He put a training course in Harlem--open to \nall. That is affirmative action in the right sense.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  Instead of government setting aside a percentage of contracts on the \nbasis of race, ethnicity, or gender, why not establish and foster a \nmentor program whereby established, experienced contractors provide \nadvice, guidance, and contacts to new or small businesses, regardless \nof the race, ethnicity, or gender of their owners? This will benefit \nminority- and women-owned businesses without denying anyone such help. \nState and local governments, instead of trampling on equal opportunity \nby setting racial numerical requirements or goals, could sponsor \nseminars about the contract bidding process, methods of obtaining \nbonding, and so on--open to all, but located where they can benefit \nminority- and women-owned businesses. Rather than discriminate, why not \nenhance people's abilities to compete? This is what the Federal \nGovernment should be encouraging State and local governments to do.\n  The September/October 1995 issue of The American Enterprise mentions \nan Austin, TX nonprofit organization called the National Council of \nContractors Association [NCCA]. It was formed with a small grant from \nthe city of Austin. It is 2 years old, and its help is available to all \nsmall businesses, though most of the businesses it helps are minority \nor women owned. NCCA provides firms with expert advice on how to win \ncontracts, donates accounting services, and helps them win bonding. In \na year and a half, NCCA helped 83 firms win 171 contracts. We should \nencourage such programs, open to all, but located where they can \nbenefit minority and women owned businesses.\n  I think we ought to take some calculated risks to help small \nbusinesses. I am willing to support a small pilot program at the Small \nBusiness Administration, where the Government insures the bonding of \nnew, small companies owned by persons of any race or gender--with less \nnet worth, fewer capital reserves, and less experience than current \nprograms require. I am willing to see whether such an approach, \nespecially if coupled with technical assistance, can make a difference \nin getting new small businesses off the ground and able then to compete \nin the marketplace. If it turns out that reducing current requirements \nin providing this help does not work, and these businesses do not \nsuccessfully perform, we should then drop the program. If it does make \na difference, we can expand it in an orderly way. But we have to try \napproaches that get us away from race and gender lines.\n  Government can look for more opportunity to contract out some of its \nservices--creating more opportunity for businesses, at less cost.\n  Instead of racially exclusive scholarship programs operated by \ncolleges, colleges could make aid available based on need, without \nracial preference. Instead of preferences in college admissions based \non race, we need to strengthen elementary and secondary education so \nchildren are better able to perform pursuant to the same standards. Of \ncourse, taking into consideration an applicant's overcoming poverty or \nother barriers to success, as one part of the evaluation of an \napplicant, is acceptable in college admissions so long as those \ncriteria are applied equally to all races, and are not thinly veiled \nproxies for race. But we need to start earlier than that. Then New York \nCity Schools Chancellor Cortines proposed a math and science institute \nfor 350 seventh and eighth graders to help prepare them for the \ndifficult examinations for admission to three academically selective \nhigh schools. Students of all races and all parts of the city are \neligible under that proposal, but the emphasis would be on those parts \nof the city that send the fewest kids to those high schools. Mostly \nblack and Hispanic kids would benefit from the extra preparation. And \nthe standards for admission for the three high schools would not be \naltered. As I understand it, there is to be no racial or ethnic \npreferences for admission to the preparatory program or to the three \nhigh schools--but an effort to improve people's abilities in this urban \nschool district.\n  We need to evaluate the concept of public and private school choice, \nthrough vouchers or similar programs. Businesses need to lend a hand to \nour public schools. It is in everyone's interest. Businesses need \nworkers who can perform, or they lose out in this global economy.\n  I received in the mail a report of the Lindahl Foundation, founded in \n1991 and privately endowed by the chairman of State Industries, Inc. of \nTennessee, the largest manufacturer of water heaters in this country. \nJohn R. Lindahl established the foundation to ensure that any child of \nhis employees has the financial aid to get an education after high \nschool. He expanded it to other students in the county. It is based on \nneed, aimed at academically worthy kids who may not be scholastic \nsuperstars, but who could do the work in college or vocational school, \nif only they could afford it. Nearly 350 young people have received \nawards of $1,000 to $4,000 as a result of this patriot's effort. The \nbrochure has pictures and words of thanks from grateful young men and \nwomen, black and white, including one young woman who was able to \nfulfill her dream of attending Brigham Young University.\n  Our public schools need to improve. The August 20, 1994, New York \nTimes carried a statement from Albert Shanker, president of the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers. He tells the story of the principal of \nan inner-city elementary school in Baltimore. The principal eventually \nprevailed upon the Baltimore school system to use a private school's \nmodel for teaching. The model is conservative in both educational \nphilosophy and curriculum, with a strong emphasis on reading and \nwriting, and specific week by week, year by year benchmarks of what the \nchildren should learn. The performance of the kids at this school is \nway up--a school which is 94 percent minority and where 82 percent of \nthe kids are eligible for free or reduced price lunches.\n  Prof. Susan Estrich has written about the efforts of the new \nCalifornia Superintendent of Education. I'll summarize the gist of the \ncolumn by citing its title: ``A Novel School Plan: Back to Basics.''\n  Some of us believe at least part of the answer also lies in reducing \ngovernment barriers. This should include a meaningful entry level \ntraining minimum wage for teenagers, enterprise zones, repeal of the \nDavis-Bacon Act, and encouragement of private sector initiatives for \neverything from job training and mentoring young people from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, to ways of strengthening the family.\n  Local and State governments need to remove barriers to entry into \ndifferent occupations.\n  I do not claim to have all the answers. I expect others have \ndifferent ways of looking at these issues, and different solutions. But \nI do believe we need to talk about this in a civil and serious way.\n  And I believe that a stubborn defense of preferences sidetracks us \nfrom finding better, fairer solutions. I will have more to say about \nthis in later remarks.\n  But, let us engage in this dialog. Let us examine the ramifications \nof our choice of the road to take. And let us not sweep these issues \nunder the rug in our national debate. Let us deal openly with these \nissues and help lead our country down the road to a more united people.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1668 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, we will be dealing with some interesting \nand very important issues here in the U.S. Senate this week. This \nfollows a break during which, in the intervening couple of weeks, most \nof us spent time in our States. I was in North Dakota, and I met a \nwonderful man in North Dakota who was our State's oldest citizen, 110 \nyears old. His name is Nels Burger. He is a wonderful Norwegian man who \ngrew up and lived on a farm in North Dakota. He has a vivid \nrecollection and memory of farming in North Dakota all those many \nyears.\n  I was thinking, as I was preparing to come to the floor today, of the \nthings\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\nthat have changed during the lifetime of Nels Burger. It you think of \nwhat has changed in 110 years in this country, it is really quite \nremarkable. Nels was born in 1885. There was once a story about an old \nfellow being interviewed by a radio interviewer, and the interviewer \nsaid to him--he was 85, 90 years old--``You must have seen a lot of \nchanges in your life.'' The old fellow said, ``Yep, and I was against \nevery one of them.'' Well, there are people like that. They are against \nevery change as it is proposed. Yet, a series of changes have made life \nbetter in this country.\n  We are going to talk this week about the minimum wage. Some say, \nwell, we ought not have the minimum wage at all. Others say we ought to \nhave a minimum wage. For those that are working at the minimum wage, \nthey ought to at least be able to keep pace with inflation.\n  We will have all kinds of economists weigh in on this subject. We \nhave economists on one side and economists on the other side. It makes \nyou yearn for the old days when Roman priests in ancient Rome were \ncalled augurs, performing something called augury, which was the body \nof knowledge we now know as economics. Augury. They would read the \nentrails of sacrificed cattle, or read the flights of birds, and from \nthat portend what the future may or may not hold. Actually, the science \nof economics or the field of economics is probably not much more \naccurate than augury, but we will have plenty of economists weigh in on \nboth sides of this issue.\n  It seems to me that the issue of the minimum wage ought to be simple \nfor this Chamber. It ought to ask two questions: One, should there be a \nminimum wage? Some will answer no, but I think the prevailing mood in \nthe Congress would be yes. We have had a minimum wage in our country \nfor a long time. It has benefited those at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder. Should we have a minimum wage? If the answer is yes, \nthen the question is, What should it be? We now have a minimum wage \nthat is about $4.25 cents an hour. Eleven States have a higher minimum \nwage than the Federal Government has. There are a few States that have \na lower minimum wage. Most of the States have a State minimum wage that \nis exactly the same as the Federal minimum wage.\n  If one thinks there ought to be a minimum wage in our country, then \nthe question is, What should it be? Or, should it ever be changed? \nShould we decide that the minimum wage shall remain where it is, while \nothers on the economic ladder in this country move up? During the past \nyear, there was a story in the newspaper that said CEO's at major \ncorporations got a 23-percent raise in 1995. The average salary has \nincreased to $991,000, but that was only a quarter of their earnings. \nThe average stock option was $1.5 million. The average bonus was $1.2 \nmillion. So, they received a salary of $991,000, a stock option of $1.5 \nmillion, and a bonus of $1.2 million. That is a 23-percent jump in \ncompensation in 1 year. These are the folks at the top of the economic \nladder.\n  Now, the question is, What about the people at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder? It is interesting, when we discuss topics here in the \nChamber, that there is a room off the Chamber called the reception \nroom, where visitors come and where people who are interested in \nlegislation will congregate. I can recall when we passed the \ntelecommunications legislation, it was full. It was a traffic jam in \nthe reception area in the hallway outside the Chamber of people who \nwere interested in this legislation and of companies that had an \ninterest in this legislation. When we passed the defense authorization \nbill, the hallways were jammed with people who had an interest in that \nlegislation. Even when Senator Bumpers and I brought to the floor a \nproposal to eliminate the National Endowment for Democracy, we had a \n``Who's Who'' in corporate America, a ``Who's Who'' in the Republican \nParty, a ``Who's Who'' in the Democratic Party, a ``Who's Who'' in the \nchamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all sitting out there trying to \nkill our amendment because they all got money from the National \nEndowment for Democracy. So, there was a traffic jam outside this \nChamber. All kinds of people who had an interest in the legislation \nwere hanging around.\n  It is interesting, when we talk about the minimum wage, there is no \none outside this Chamber. No one is waiting, no one is lobbying--except \nagainst it--no one is out there saying, ``We have some people who get \nup in the morning and make breakfast for a couple of kids, and then \nwork for 8 or 10 hours at $4.25 an hour, and come home and try to \nfigure out how far that stretches, how much milk can you buy with \nthat.'' Will it pay for the medicine, the milk, and the diapers? They \ndo not have time to come out here and lobby. They do not have the \ncapability. They do not have the money.\n\n  So, there is not a traffic jam out in the hallways when we talk about \nminimum wage because no one is speaking for the people who do not seem \nto have much of a voice in this system of ours. At least, not many are \nspeaking for them. We have people in this Chamber who would not know \nthe price of diapers or milk or bread who tell us $4.25 is just fine. \nNever mind the fact that inflation means that $4.25 purchases less than \nit did 6 years ago. It does not matter to us, they say. Never mind the \nfact that the top of the economic ladder gets a 23-percent pay raise. \nLet us freeze the bottom of the ladder, they say. Well, it may not \nmatter to some people in here, but it matters to millions of people \naround the country who are trying very hard to go to work and to care \nfor their families.\n  The vast majority of the people working for minimum wage are adults. \nSixty percent of them are adult women. Forty percent of the people on \nminimum wage are providing one-half of their families' income, and \nthere are more than 1 million working for the minimum wage who are \nproviding the sole support for themselves and their children.\n  I know some who will say minimum wage is for kids. That is not true. \nWe ought to at least debate the facts. There are kids working for the \nminimum wage. I understand that. I accept that. But there are plenty of \npeople who have nothing who are out there trying every day in every way \nto make a living on $4.25 an hour, and after 6 years their wages have \nbeen decreased because $4.25 an hour buys less. The question is, Who \nwill speak for them? Who will stand up for their interests? This is our \njob.\n  Our responsibility is not to decide that the market system does not \nwork. The market system does work. This is a wonderful country with a \nmarket system that has produced the richest capitalistic society that \nvery few people could ever have imagined. I pay great tribute to the \nmen and women who risk their resources, who work long hours in the day \nand night to start a business and try to make a go of it. I understand \nthat as well. We have also understood that part of this system requires \nsome rules and that we are the referee in this system.\n  Someone stood up at a luncheon meeting I attended the other day and \nsaid, ``How do you justify speaking on behalf of the minimum wage?'' I \nsaid, ``Do you not support a minimum wage?'' He say, ``No.'' I said, \n``Do you think there is not a minimum at all?'' He said, ``That is \nexactly the case.'' He said, ``I don't think you ought to interfere \nwith the market system in any way. There should be no minimum wage in \nAmerica.'' Then I asked, ``Should you be able to hire 12-year-olds and \nwork them 12 hours a day? Should you be permitted to do that?'' The \nGovernment has said with child labor laws that there are certain things \nthat are not appropriate. We used to have 6-, 8- 10-year-olds working \nin textile mills in this country. We said, ``That is not appropriate.'' \nSo we passed child labor laws. Even then we had people that said it is \nnot appropriate for us to interfere with the market system, that \nchildren ought to be able to work, that people ought to be able to \nemploy 10- or 12-year-olds in the mill. But we thought through that \nissue a little bit as a country and we decided no. The better part of \njudgment was to decide that there are certain rules within this market \nsystem which represent basic fairness. And among those rules was the \nminimum wage.\n  I am not here to suggest that there is anyone in here that does not \ncare about people at the bottom of the economic ladder. I do not want \nto be judgmental about that. I do hope, however, that all of us in the \nSenate--and in the House--will understand a little\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nbit about what it is like to be on the bottom of the economic leader.\n  I encourage everyone in the Senate to some morning before we vote on \nthe minimum wage again to get up and go downtown to a homeless shelter \nand talk to a young woman whose husband left her, who has two or three \nchildren, who has no skills, who has no money, and who has no place to \nlive. Talk to her about her experience working at minimum wage. When \nshe works she loses AFDC. When she works she is told she cannot save \nany money to prepare for her first month's rent and 1-month security \ndeposit. There is not any way she can save money to try to get an \napartment to shelter her and her kids. After you have talked to her for \na bit, think, ``If it were me, how would I get out of this \ncircumstance?'' I will bet you that you would have, as I did, a \ndifficult time understanding how you pull yourself up and out of that \nkind of circumstance.\n\n  I ask everybody in this the Senate as they think about the minimum \nwage to think about the people who are struggling to try to make a \nliving every single day and who find now that their $4.25 an hour buys \na whole lot less than it did 6 years ago. We are now near in terms of \npurchasing power a 40-year low in the minimum wage. And we ought to pay \nas much attention to the needs of those at the bottom of the economic \nladder as we seem to day after day to pay for those at the top of the \neconomic ladder. My hope is that we will--Republicans and Democrats--\nunderstand that there are people who have no voice out there, or who \nfeel they have no voice, and that we should raise our voices on their \nbehalf. There are people out there who work hard but still feel they \nhave no hope. We ought to offer hope to those people. That is what we \nought to be about.\n  The easiest thing in the world is to be negative. The easiest thing \nin the world is to oppose and reject. The hardest thing in the world is \nto be a builder and to try to understand what is right and what \nimproves life in this country. I hope we can decide in a bipartisan way \nto do that in the coming day or two, or week, when we discuss once \nagain the minimum wage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3255-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3257-S3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ISSUE OF TAXES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on the issue of taxes, today is tax day, \nApril 15. And there will be a lot of discussion--I think even later \nthis morning--on the floor about taxes. I do not think anyone in this \ncountry particularly likes to pay taxes. I understand that. I \npersonally take great pride in paying taxes to help create wonderful \nschools that will educate our children. All of us ought to beam a \nlittle about that. We created opportunities in our country--building \nroads, building schools, doing a lot of things that have made life \nbetter in our country. So I understand that. But I understand that on \ntax day most people would prefer to pay a lesser amount of taxes, and \nmost people do not very much like the Tax Code that we have. It is too \ncomplicated. It is sometimes unfair. And there is not any reason that \nwe ought to have a Sears Roebuck-style catalog in order to try to have \nto read through and understand the rules of our Tax Code. We ought to \nbe able to do this simpler than that. I hope working together that we \nwill find a way to do it.\n  But I want to focus on a couple of things in the Tax Code that kind \nof relates to what I was talking about on the minimum wage. There is \nalways a way for the bigger interests to fill the hallways out here \nwith really smart people who conceive of ways themselves to avoid \npaying taxes, or of ways for someone else to pay a little less in \ntaxes. I will give you some examples of that. We have a provision in \nour Tax Code that I have talked about half a dozen times that says to \ncompanies close your plants in America, move it and your jobs overseas, \nget rid of your American workers, hire foreign workers, get a foreign \nplant and foreign work, produce the same product, and then ship it back \nto our country and we will make you a deal. If you do that, we will \ngive you a tax cut. Most people would think that cannot be the case. \nAnyone who proposed that would have about a 2-second political life. \nNo. That is true. It is in the Tax Code. I have tried to get it out of \nthe Tax Code. I lost last year by a 52 to 47 vote on the Senate floor. \nWe are going to vote on that again this week. I am going to offer an \namendment to the immigration bill that proposes that we shut down the \ninsidious tax loophole that encourages somebody to shut their American \nplant, move their U.S. jobs overseas and then produce the same product \nand ship it back into our country. We will have another vote this week \non that.\n  We also have had this debate about the budget balancing proposal that \nwas vetoed by the President. And it is interesting. When you take a \nlook at some of these details that are put into these large pieces of \nlegislation, which by the way alters in favor of the line-item veto \nwhich I supported--I am delighted the President will now have that--but \nin that big budget bill there a number of little provisions. Let me \ncite one of them.\n  One was a provision which called to repeal section 956(A) of the Tax \nCode. There are not two people awake in America who understand what \nthat is except the companies who are going to benefit from it. That was \na little provision stuck in the bill that was supposed to balance the \nFederal budget that went to the President and he vetoed it, a little \nprovision that says, by the way let us spend $244 million making it \nmore attractive on top of the already perverse incentive we have in the \nTax Code to move your jobs overseas--repeal of section 956(A). I have \nasked on four or five occasions, is there someone in the Chamber of the \nSenate--of course, there is no one here now because we are not having \nvotes today--when everyone gets here who would stand up and raise their \nhand and say, ``Yes, I support that. That is my provision. I sure like \nthat notion. Let us provide more benefits to people who move their jobs \noverseas?'' Do you know something? I could not find one Senator who \nwould stand up and support it. It is like the blimps in the defense \nbill. We wrote in $60 million to buy blimps in the defense bill.\n  So I said, ``Will anyone in the Chamber tell me who thought we should \nspend money in the defense bill to buy blimps?'' I could not find a \none. It is funny how difficult it is to find people in the Senate when \nyou discover a provision in law or a provision that is proposed in the \nBalanced Budget Act that would actually reward, above the current \nincentive, companies for moving their jobs overseas.\n  Most of us understand what has happened to American jobs. There have \nbeen some jobs created in the service sector, but we have lost about 3 \nmillion good-paying manufacturing jobs in this country since 1979--3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs. When you talk about manufacturing, then you \nare not talking about minimum wage. Manufacturing represents the seed \nbed of good jobs with good income in this country, and that is why I \nhave talked again and again in the Chamber about measuring America's \neconomic progress not by what we consume but by what we produce, \nbecause what we produce is what matters. That is what economic health \nis about. Do we retain a strong manufacturing sector in this country? \nDo we retain strong jobs that pay well in this country?\n  At the same time we are all talking about wanting to do that, we have \nin the Tax Code--and I bring it to the attention of the Senate on tax \nday--a provision that says we would like to reward you if you leave \nAmerica. Take your jobs and go, take your plant and run, and we will \ngive you a reward. In fact, all the rest of the American taxpayers will \npay for it; $2.2 billion is the reward for companies that move their \njobs overseas--$2.2 billion.\n  That does not come from me. That comes from the Joint Tax Committee. \nThat is their estimate of how much revenue is lost in this country \nbecause we provide an incentive for those who would close their \nAmerican plants and move their American jobs overseas, produce the same \nproduct they used to produce here and then ship it all back to United \nStates. And what has happened? The only thing that has happened is that \nwe no longer have the jobs in America. Somebody overseas has those \njobs, and someone who controls those jobs makes more money and pays no \ntaxes.\n  In my judgment, that is no way on tax day to celebrate. What we ought \nto do on tax day is talk about things we all talk about--complexity, \nyes. Let us simplify the Tax Code. Let us make it\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nmore fair even as we make it more simple. But at the same time let us \ndecide that that Tax Code ought to be neutral on the subject of moving \njobs. The Tax Code ought not be tilted in favor of taking your jobs and \nleaving the United States of America.\n  Those are the kinds of issues that I think we as a Senate will have \nto confront in the rest of 1996. I know it is an election year, and I \nknow some predict that not much can be done because we have all the \ntensions, and so on. The businesses of this country will not wait for \nan election. We will be hard pressed to explain to someone who is \nstruggling out there at the minimum wage that, well, we cannot really \ndeal with this now because there is an election coming. That is just \nsomething we cannot deal with. There is too much controversy, and we \njust are not able to do it. That is going to be lost on a lot of people \nwho are trying very hard to make a living day after day.\n  There is not in this Senate one side of the aisle that cares a lot \nabout people and the other side that does not. That is not the case I \nam trying to make. But there has been a confluence of public policies \nin the last year and a half that represent a more extreme view of where \nwe ought to head--the notion that somehow the only thing that makes the \nAmerican engine work is if you pour in some petroleum from the top. It \nis classically the old trickle-down approach; if you help everybody at \nthe top, somehow everybody at the bottom gets damp or somebody at the \nbottom benefits.\n  Hubert Humphrey, who was our neighbor over in Minnesota, a wonderful \nman, said, ``I have a different view of this. My view is the `percolate \nup' theory in our country. You give everyone in this country a little \nopportunity to be able to do well and things percolate up and make this \nAmerican engine run.'' He said ``This trickle down, that is the \napproach where if you give the horse some hay, at some point maybe the \nsparrows will have something to eat.''\n  We ought to understand in this country that the American economic \nengine works best when all of the American people are working. The \nincentive in the minimum wage is to try to be fair to those at the \nbottom of the economic ladder. And it is not fair to say after 6 years, \n6 years of freezing you, because you lose purchasing power year after \nyear, that we are going to continue to do that. That is not fair. And \nit is not fair to those on the minimum wage that our Tax Code on tax \nday contains a provision that says, ``By the way, the job you aspire \nto''--you are on minimum wage, but you aspire to a better job, a \nmanufacturing job perhaps--``is gone, because in our Tax Code we paid \nsomebody to take it out of America.'' That is not fair either.\n  There are provisions, it seems to me, that we can and ought to agree \non as Democrats and as Republicans that represent a fair economic \napproach which would benefit this country, all people of this country, \neven those who do not have the capability of sending an army of special \ninterest folks to surround this Chamber as we debate their favorite \nissue.\n  Mr. President, we will have a great deal of discussion on these \nissues this week, I am certain, and my hope is that we will, on the \nfirst question I asked today, answer with reasonable unanimity: Should \nthere be a minimum wage? I hope most Members of this Chamber will \nanswer yes.\n  And if they answer yes, then let us spend the rest of the time asking \nthe question: If there should be a minimum wage, then what is a fair \nlevel for that minimum wage? Is it fair having it frozen for 6 years? \nWhen the top of the economic ladder gets a 23 percent pay increase to \nan average $3 million a year, is it fair then to say to the bottom, at \nthe lowest rung of the economic ladder, ``By the way, we will freeze \nyour pay for 6 years?'' I do not think that is the answer most people \nwould come to if you think about it reasonably and you think about it \nin the context of what would be best for the millions of people in this \ncountry at the bottom who are struggling very hard to make ends meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if he were still alive, President \nRoosevelt would say April 15 is ``a day that will live in infamy.'' We \nhave all come to know this very special day as one of great dread in \nour country, as we come to grips with the enormous burden every \nAmerican family, every Georgia family, every citizen comes face to face \nwith--the direct burden of Government and the enormous consumption of \nthe wages of labor that are consumed by the U.S. Government and \ngovernment in general.\n  Depending on what you count, today Americans work from January 1 \nuntil about June 31 for the Government before they are able to keep the \nfirst dime for themselves, their families, their educations, their \ndreams. I think Thomas Jefferson must surely have many times rolled in \nhis grave because he could never, ever have anticipated that there \nwould come a time that nearly half the resources of those who labor for \nit are removed from those families and those individuals and sent to \nsome government to redetermine what ought to be done with the wages of \nthe person who earned it.\n  To just quickly summarize--and I am going to yield to my good \ncolleague from Tennessee--but in my own State, I have asked that a \npicture be made of the average Georgia family. This is the perfect day \nto reveal what that picture looks like--April 15. That average family \nearns about $40,000 a year. Both spouses work and they have two \nchildren. Remember, now, they earn around $40,000 a year. They spend \n$4,183 in Federal income tax liability of the $40,000. They spend \n$3,118 in FICA taxes. They spend another $844 in other direct and \nindirect Federal taxes. They forfeit $5,061 in local taxes, State and \nlocal. This family's share of the new regulatory apparatus we have been \nbuilding for the last some 30-odd years--this is an unbelievable \nfigure--is $6,615. This family's share of added interest costs because \nof our $5 trillion national debt is $2,957. That comes to $22,778, 51 \nor 52 percent of all wages. Every average family in Georgia is working \nhalf time for somebody else--the Government.\n\n  America depends on these families to raise the country. We ask them \nto house the country, to educate the country, to feed it and clothe it, \ntransport it, and see to its health. But we only leave them half of all \ntheir earnings to do this great work that we have depended upon for so \nlong. The end result is middle America, the average hard-working \nfamily, has been marginalized, has been literally pushed to the wall \nbecause of the consumption, the insatiable consumption of Government.\n  I would have to say this is also the result of certain elitists in \nour country that have concluded that this average family in Georgia is \nunable to make decisions for itself and that decisions about its \nfuture, its health, its welfare are best made by some Washington wonk \nin the belly of one of these buildings in the Capital City, and it is \nbetter that their wages come here so that some bright person can \ndetermine how best this family ought to be preparing for its future and \nits needs.\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\n  I reject that theory outright and I believe America does too. I did \nnot believe I would ever be standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \ntalking about average families in my State forfeiting nearly half their \nearned wages to support this burgeoning, growing, unfettered \nconsumption by Federal and other governments.\n  With that opening statement on this infamous day of April 15, 1996, I \nyield to the good Senator from Tennessee up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in recent years the words ``tax and \nspend,'' have been used together so often that, today, rarely do you \nhear one word, ``tax,'' without hearing the other word, ``spend.'' The \nphrase has become so common, so acceptable, so recognizable it \napproaches the use of words such as ``hand in glove'' or ``horse and \nbuggy.'' It is just when you think of taxes, you think of spending.\n  Like cliches that become popular because they deliver the truth with \nclarity and simplicity, ``tax and spend'' boils the point down to its \nessence. There is only one reason for raising taxes and that is \nspending more.\n  We just heard my distinguished colleague from Georgia boil down this \ntax burden to the effect on an individual family. That tells the whole \nstory. But I cannot help but to share with you this morning a \nconversation at breakfast, as I sat around the table with my wife and \nthree boys, Jonathan, 10; Bryan, 8; and Harrison, 12.\n  Jonathan said, ``You are coming back from recess, dad. What are the \nissues? What are you going to be talking about?''\n  I said, ``Today is a big day for the American people. It is tax \nday.''\n  And Jonathan said, as any young child does quite innocently, ``What \nis tax day? What does that mean?''\n  I said, ``Jonathan, it has an impact on every, every family in this \ngreat country.''\n  He said, ``What sort of impact?''\n  I said, ``Today, people will be writing checks, where a huge portion \nof what they earn goes to Washington, DC, to the Federal Government.''\n  He said, ``What do you mean?'' He said, ``Don't you pay sales \ntaxes?''\n  I said, ``Yes.''\n  And he said, ``How much?''\n  And I said, ``About 38 percent, on average, around this country, of \nincome, of money that you take in, goes to government at the State, \nlocal, and Federal level, 38 percent; 38 cents on the dollar,'' I said.\n\n  He looked up again with those innocent eyes and said, ``Well, why \ndoes anyone work if you have to give 38 cents away?''\n  Clearly, it is much more complicated than that, but through those \ninnocent eyes of a child, it does bring us to that real question of, \nwhy do we tax so much and spend money so extravagantly?\n  Mr. President, unlike the current occupant of the Oval Office, \nPresident Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words. However, the thoughts \nhe expressed when he chose to speak were quite precise; it hit the nail \non the head.\n  On the subject of Government spending, he once, very accurately, \nobserved, ``Nothing is easier than spending public money--it does not \nappear to belong to anyone.''\n  Apparently not.\n  Federal spending has risen steadily and continuously over the last 40 \nyears, and to pay for it, so has the burden on the American taxpayer.\n  Thirty-eight percent of a family's income is paid in Federal, State, \nand local taxes and, as we just heard, in Georgia it is even higher \nthan that. But, on average, 38 percent. And the problem is getting \nworse. It was only 28 percent in 1955. Today, a taxpayer has to work \nmore than 3 hours out of an 8-hour day just to get enough funds to pay \nthe tax man.\n  And if paying taxes were not bad enough, to add insult to injury, the \nGovernment makes it as hard as possible for everyone to comply. There \nare now 555 million words in the Tax Code with 4,000 changes made just \nin the last 10 years. There are 480 different tax forms provided by the \nIRS, and there are another 280 forms just to tell us how to fill out \nthose 480 forms.\n  Every year, in fact, the IRS sends out 8 billion pages of forms and \ninstructions to 100 million taxpayers. This feat alone requires the \npulp of 293,760 trees just to accomplish.\n  This year, individuals will spend 1.7 billion hours filling out their \ntaxes. Businesses will spend another 3.4 billion hours to fill out \ntheir taxes, and complying with tax laws will cost all of us about $200 \nbillion above and beyond the taxes themselves.\n  But for some people, enough is never enough. In the first major \naction that President Clinton took, you guessed it, he raised our \ntaxes, and when Republicans cut taxes as part of the Balanced Budget \nAct last December, the President vetoed the bill. Why? You guessed it, \nbecause he wanted to spend another trillion dollars on Government, not \nthe people's, priorities.\n  Tax and spend--one cannot live without the other.\n  And what are those priorities of the American people? Today, all \nacross America, the problems of crime, drug trafficking, and illegal \nimmigration are out of control. Yet, while we have 24,000 FBI agents or \n6,700 DEA agents or 5,900 Border Patrol personnel, we have 111,000 \npeople working for the IRS. The Government cannot stop illegal drugs or \nillegal immigration, but it sure knows how to collect your money, even \nif it cannot manage its own.\n  This month, the GAO audited the IRS. What it found was truly \nastounding. The General Accounting Office found that the IRS could not \naccount for $10 billion it says it collected. The IRS could not fully \nexplain $2 billion in expenses, and it could not use the sophisticated \nnew computer equipment that cost taxpayers more than $3 billion. So it \nis still using the old recordkeeping and billing system designed in the \n1950's.\n  Perhaps that is why when Money magazine hired 50 tax experts to \nprepare the return of a hypothetical typical American family it got 50 \ndifferent results. They found the Tax Code to be so vague, so \nconfusing, so contradictory that, as Money's editor put it, ``The \ntypical taxpayer has no way of knowing how much they actually owe.''\n  Mr. President, it is time that Americans pay less taxes, not more. It \nis time Congress simplified the maze of regulations, penalties, \ndeductions and credits that make compliance so difficult. And it is \ntime we made it harder for the IRS to make hard-working Americans pay \nfor its mistakes. That is why I have cosponsored the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights 2.\n  Among its more than 30 provisions, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights will \nwaive interest charges when the IRS, not the taxpayer, is at fault. It \nwill allow taxpayers to sue the IRS for up to $1 million for reckless \nor negligent collection actions. It will prohibit the IRS from issuing \nretroactive regulations.\n  Yes, the era of big Government is over. So is the era of tax-and-\nspend. For, as Calvin Coolidge also so accurately observed, ``The \nappropriation of public money is always perfectly lovely until someone \nis asked to pay for it.''\n  He continues: ``I favor the policy of economy, not to save money, but \nto save people. The men and women of this country,'' he continues, \n``who toil are the ones who bear the cost of Government. Every dollar \nwe carelessly waste means that their life will be so much more the \nmeager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will \nbe so much more the abundant.''\n  Mr. President, when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States, \nthe portrait of Calvin Coolidge hung in a place of honor in the Cabinet \nroom as one of the Presidents Mr. Reagan admired the most. Mr. Clinton \nhas borrowed much from Ronald Reagan. Perhaps he would do well to \nborrow President Reagan's appreciation of Calvin Coolidge as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a moment ago, as we began this \ndiscussion, I outlined the impact of Government and regulations and the \ncosts on an average family in my State. As I said, it comes to almost \n50 percent.\n  I think it might be interesting, and I am going to yield in just a \nmoment to my good colleague from Idaho, but I would like to make a \npoint about what\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\nhas been the impact on this average family of this administration.\n  On the Federal income tax liability, I said that we are currently \npaying $4,183, but if we had not put in place the policies of this \ncurrent administration, that is, the largest tax increase in American \nhistory in August--that hot August--of 1993, then that tax burden would \nbe considerably less. It would be $3,656.\n  FICA would be $2,754 instead of $3,118. The regulatory costs, Mr. \nPresident, are considerably different, as well. They would be paying \n$5,892 instead of $6,615.\n  The bottom line is that without the policies of this administration \nof taxing and growth and regulation, the total tax burden would have \nbeen $20,112 instead of $22,778 or, bottom line, this administration \nhas added almost $3,000 of new costs to this average family.\n  If you are making gross about $40,000 and you have a new $3,000 bill \nto send to the Government, it is a wake-up call. That is 15 percent of \nlost disposable income as a direct result of the policies of this \nadministration. It is incredible.\n  As I recall, during the debate we were only going to affect the \nwealthy. I do not believe any family making $40,000 a year considers \nthemselves in the league of wealth, but their contribution--we remember \nthat--the contribution that they would be asked to make is almost \nanother $3,000 for every average working family in my State.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my good colleague from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding me time, but \nespecially for taking out this special order on this very important day \nin the lives of every working man and woman in the United States, the \nday when your Federal taxes are due.\n  I say that because it is also an important day for us to pause and \nrecognize what paying your taxes means and the kind of impact that it \nhas on us as a society. Obviously, my colleague from Georgia has spoken \nabout how it impacts his State. And let me also congratulate him on his \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit retroactive taxation. I am a \ncosponsor of that. I appreciate him leading in those areas something \nthat our Founding Fathers were very, very clear on, while this \nGovernment seems to have been a bit confused on it.\n  Also, today, the House, our neighboring body, will take up the two-\nthirds majority to raise taxes as a requirement of our Constitution. \nSome would argue that is putting economics in the Constitution that \nshould not be there. I disagree with that. I think it is the \nappropriate thing to do because, clearly, within the Constitution we \nhave required two-thirds votes on other procedures that are required.\n  Obviously, they are proposing an amendment today. That amendment \nrequires a two-thirds vote. Somehow nobody suggests that that is the \nwrong thing to do or that is the wrong test that ought to be made. So I \nhope the House is successful today both in their debate and in their \nvote to require a supermajority to raise taxes. I think it is high time \nthat we in this body and in the Congress of the United States become as \nsensitive to taxation as the taxpayers of this country that we suggest \nthat we represent on a regular basis.\n  My guess is that if you vote for increased taxes in this body, you \nare not representing taxpayers very well because the taxpayers of our \ncountry have consistently said for a long while that they are being \novertaxed. A recent poll in the Readers Digest suggests that the \naverage citizen believes that taxes ought to be no higher than about 25 \npercent of their income, and they would even say in this poll that if \nsomebody was paying 40 percent, even though they might be making more \nmoney, they were probably being taxed too much. Even the poorer of our \nsociety would suggest that those that are being taxed at a higher level \nought to be taxed at a lower level because, for some reason, higher \ntaxation was just blatantly unfair. I have to agree that that is the \ncase.\n\n  Today, as mentioned, is April 15. Americans will work until May 7 of \nthis year just to pay their taxes. And, as we all know, that day just \nkeeps increasing. I am talking about January 1 to May 7 of every year \nnow for the average taxpaying working American to meet their tax \nrequirement. If you went to work at 8 o'clock this morning, the first 2 \nhours and 47 minutes of your 8-hour working day were worked just to pay \nyour Federal tax requirement.\n  Obviously, you live in another taxing district besides the Federal \ntax realm. You live in a State tax realm. Probably you would work \nanother 35 minutes to an hour just to pay your State taxes. So it all \nadds up, and the average working person out there is going to spend the \nfirst 3-plus hours of their working day not putting one dime in their \nown pocket, not putting one dime to the purchase of a loaf of bread for \nthe toast for the family breakfast, not putting one dime in the savings \naccount that they are building to send their child to college, not \nputting one dime against the purchase of a new car or a new house, \nbecause for the first 3 hours, on the average, they will be putting all \nof those dimes either in the Treasury of the U.S. Government or the \ntreasury of State government.\n  That is why most every American agrees that they are overtaxed. That \ndoes not mean that Americans are antitax. I cited the poll a few \nmoments ago where I think all Americans recognize the importance of \nsome government, the importance of the basic services of government, \nand the need to pay for it, and the need to have budgets balanced. But \nwhat they cannot understand is why the average two-wage-earner family, \na family of four, pays 38 percent of all of their income to pay taxes \nfor all levels of government. It is simply too high, and we know it. \nAnd Americans know it more, I think, than we do.\n  This last week during the Easter recess I had a rare privilege of \ntaking my parents, who were here visiting, my wife and I to \nWilliamsburg. I have been a student of Jefferson and Washington and \nMadison, as I hope many Senators have been on this floor. We visited \nthe colonial capital of the colony of Williamsburg, better known as the \nHouse of Burgesses. Again, it was a remembering of why this country \nwent through a revolution, why our Founding Fathers finally said, \nenough is enough, why they put their lives and their property on the \nline, simply saying they could not tolerate an oppressive Government, \nprimarily because of the level of taxes that that Government was \nlevying against a society of people who did not have a vote, who had, \nas we now know, taxation without representation.\n\n  Of course, as mentioned in several of the books I have read about \nThomas Jefferson, following the great revolution and a new country and \nan America under a Constitution in which we had representation, he was \nvisiting in Europe and a British parliamentarian said, ``Well, you went \nto war because you had taxation with no representation. Now what do you \nthink? You have got taxation with representation.''\n  I think we all recognize by that statement and 208 years of history \nthat central Government, if not controlled, can become oppressive, and \nthe greatest tool of oppression on the rights and freedoms of an \nindividual, of family, a working person, is the ability of Government \nto tax.\n  Since this country instituted the income tax and since we instituted \nautomatic withdrawal from our wages of the Government's share of those \ntaxes, we all know that that 38 percent that gets taken out of the \naverage family of four's salary, while it seems to go very easily and \nwe forget about it being in or having been there, we fail to recognize \nthe tremendous purchasing power that that would have or the additional \nfreedoms that that could afford the individual family that is now taken \naway from them and, therefore, the freedom to choose, the freedom to be \nfinancially independent, the ability to make for themselves and their \nchildren a better life. All of that is part of why Americans become \nincreasingly frustrated when they see a government that progressively \nadds taxes to their ability to earn money.\n  In 1992, as we all know, President Clinton talked about a middle-\nclass tax cut. He was the champion during that Presidential year of \nwanting tax cuts for middle-income Americans. Somehow this President \nforgot or lost his way. We know what happened just a\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nyear later, in 1993, when he pushed through the largest tax increase in \nthe history of this country.\n  Oh, I know argumentatively he played class-war politics by suggesting \nit would only go on the backs of the rich, but, as my colleague from \nGeorgia has so clearly pointed out, it did not go on the backs of the \nrich; it went on the backs of everybody. It went on the backs of \nmiddle-income wage earners in his State of Georgia, in my State of \nIdaho. It hit all levels. And when it hits all levels, it hurts all \nlevels of our economy and the ability of families today to make their \nown way.\n  So we now have taxation with representation. But at the same time, \nwhat I think we, those who are the agents of representation, have \nfailed to recognize is the real impact that taxes have on the ability \nof the wage earner to function for himself, herself, or for their \nfamily, or even the incentive in a society.\n  You know, I talked about that first 2 hours and 47 minutes of work to \npay the Government. If you decide you will not work that 2 hours, 47 \nminutes because that money goes to the Government, think again. It does \nnot work that way. What I am suggesting by that is that it has become, \nby increased rates of taxation, a blight on the ability of our economy \nto produce and the right of the individual to produce.\n  Why can we not get above about 1.5-percent growth in our economy? \nRemember, growth is a factor of job creation, greater opportunity, \nupward mobility for wage earners starting at lower levels to move to \nhigher levels, to provide for themselves and their families to have a \nbetter home, a better car, to seek a better education, to put a better \ncoat on their back. If you deny growth in the economy, you deny those \nkinds of opportunities that have been historically true in our society.\n  Taxation is a factor that puts that kind of blight against economic \ngrowth, dampers it down and, of course, as we all know in a society \ntoday, in an economy where we do not compete just with our neighbor \ndown the street, we compete with our neighbor in China, our neighbor in \nJapan, if we and our level of taxation is not similar, certainly our \nability to produce is less.\n  I have talked about income tax and its impact on the family. If I \ncould for just a moment move to something else that I think is grossly \nunfair, but it fits into all of this element of taxation. That is the \nissue of estate taxes. Somehow we have developed an attitude in our \ncountry, Mr. President, that if you collect wealth during your \nproductive years, you work hard, maybe you do not work the 8-hour day, \nmaybe you work the 12-hour day, maybe you work a 14-hour day and you \naccumulate wealth, you own a home free and clear, you have money in a \nbank, you have a savings account, you have stocks and bonds, you are \nnot allowed to move those through to your children when you die, or not \nall of them.\n  Again, the Government steps in and says, ``No, we will take that away \nfrom you.'' That is an estate tax that I have for so many years \nbelieved to be so wrong. I have watched farmers and ranchers in my \nState work for a lifetime to pay off a mortgage, to own something, only \nto sell it and find out that they have to give a high percentage of it \nback to the Government. Why? The Government did not earn it. It is not \nthe Government's right to have it. Somehow that is something that our \ncountry has slipped into and something that April 15 of every year \nreminds me is just fundamentally wrong.\n  I hope today is a day of reckoning, a day of better understanding. It \nappears I am out of time. Could I have an additional 2 minutes yielded \nto me?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator is yielded 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I hope today is a day of reckoning. Again, a time when we \nall awaken to the fact of what our Government does to us--not for us. \nThere are many things that Government can do for us, but this is an \ninstance where I believe Government takes too much of our money and \nspends it unwisely.\n\n  That is why, along with the amendment that the House will be voting \non today to require a two-thirds supermajority to raise taxes, why the \namendment by my colleague from Georgia dealing with retroactivity in \ntaxation, why the $500 tax credit that we have offered in our balanced \nbudget bill that we sent down to the President, that he vetoed, is so \nimportant. Why trying to deal with a capital gains tax, trying to deal \nwith an estate tax, reducing those rates, creating less impact on hard-\nworking, saving, earning Americans is what this day ought to be about.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Georgia, for leading Members \nin this important debate on this important day. I hope other colleagues \nwould join with us and come to the floor, talking about how all of this \nimpacts their States and their citizens' lives. It truly does. When you \nwatch that kind of money, whether it is 38 or 40 percent that you earn \nbeing taken away from you for purposes that in many instances you find \nunnecessary, it is a question that that has to be on a monthly, daily \nbasis, brought before this Congress.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for bringing this matter to our \nattention.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in my opening comments I was talking \nabout an average Georgia family, and I alluded to the fact that \nvirtually half their income has been absorbed by one government or \nanother. You and the Senator from Tennessee have used the figure 40 \npercent. I thought we might clarify that a bit.\n  Would the Senator agree that a family's interest payments that are a \ndirect result of our national debt should also be added into what is \nbeing taken from them?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Absolutely. I think it is clearly the appropriate day to \ndebate what is the total impact of our current Government's need based \non net, based on taxation on the lives of the average citizen. When you \ndo that, I think that is absolutely right. It gets well past the 40 \npercent mark in many instances. You have to factor in, as I think you \nhave, and when I talk abut 38 percent I am not factoring in State \ngovernment in many instances, but you are doing so, I think, and that \nis a very important part.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would the Senator also agree, the impact that families \nshare of the regulatory costs, those have to be paid by that family, \nare also a factor that have to be weighed in as to what the total \nimpact is on our working family?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. No question about it. That is something that you and I \nhave struggled on for a good many years. We busily write an awful lot \nof laws around here with no sense of the kind of cost that it will have \non the average citizen through regulatory compliance or making sure \ntheir businesses operate within the framework of those regulations. \nThose are real costs, and they get passed on to the consuming taxpayer, \nand ultimately that is a form of taxation.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have enjoyed the Senator's remarks immensely, but I \nconclude by saying that in our colloquy, that the effect of all of this \nis that you have essentially removed half the earning wages of our \nworking families, no matter where they are.\n  I am reminded here, because it has been brought up several times, of \na statement that the President made in a campaign commercial on January \n16, 1992, Mr. President. It said, ``I'm Bill Clinton, and I think you \ndeserve a change. That's why I have offered a plan to get the economy \nmoving again, starting with a middle-class tax cut.'' However, 1 month \ninto his Presidency, that promise was dramatically altered. The message \nin the State of the Union speech that was made by the President on \nFebruary 17, 1993, said, ``To middle-class Americans who have paid a \ngreat deal over the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution \ntonight.''\n  Mr. President, that contribution turned into a $250 billion tax \nincrease which resulted in every working family paying a lot more money \nto Washington and having a lot less in their checking account to take \ncare of their own needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank my friend from Georgia for organizing an effort \nto talk about something that we especially are aware of on tax day, on \nApril\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\n15, but certainly should be talked about every day. Unfortunately, I \nthink not many of us often recognize the fact that nearly 40 percent of \nour revenue, of our income to our families, is taken in taxes.\n  It has been talked about here today, that we work more than 3 hours a \nday out of our 8-hour day simply to pay taxes.\n  Although I am quite sure that will not become the tax system, some \nbelieve--and perhaps there is merit in it--if we had this sales tax, we \nwould be more aware of the level of payment that we make, where now \nmuch of it is withheld. We talk about our wages after taxes, and so it \nsort of disappears and fades off. So I think it is appropriate that we \ntalk about it today.\n  It seems to me that there are at least two important areas that need \nto be talked about. One, of course, is money--dollars. What does it \nmean to us and our family income? We probably ought to ask the \nquestion, of course, who should spend it? We work to support our \nfamilies. Who should spend that money that we earn? Obviously, we would \nexpect to be taxed if we want public activities to continue. Then we \nask ourselves, how much is enough? How much should go? Is 40 percent \ntoo much? It seems to me that perhaps it is.\n  Then, of course, there is a direct relationship between taxes and the \namount of Government we have. It seems to me that is a principle we \nought to talk about. Many of us believe--and I am one of those--we \nought to have a limited Government at the Federal level, that we ought \nto, as it describes in the Constitution, do those things that are \ndescribed in the Constitution and leave to the States and to the people \nthose other activities. Taxes have a great deal to do with that.\n  There is a relationship between the size of Government and spending. \nOf course, if we are responsible at all and we want to do this \nspending, then we should pay for it. That is where taxes come in. \nUnfortunately, we have not done that very well. We have wanted to do \nthe spending, but we put it on the credit card for our kids. We need to \nchange that, and we are in the process, hopefully, of doing it. The \nreal measurement is not what Government can do for people but the kind \nof environment that can be set that allows people to do for themselves. \nSo when we talk about taxes, we are also talking about the size of \nGovernment that we envision.\n  I think we should talk about where we are now. As Paul Harvey says, \n``What is the rest of the story?'' We are beginning to hear a lot about \nhow ``the deficit is down, the economy is up, and we are saving \ntaxes,'' and so on. The fact is that Washington has never spent more on \nthe Federal bureaucracy than we are and have under this administration. \nThe fact is that we are spending less on defense, and that may be right \nor wrong. But it means we are spending more, then, in the nondefense \nareas, these programs that simply continue to grow. America's tax \nburden, State, Federal, and local combined, has never been higher than \nit is under this administration. It has never been higher as a \npercentage of GDP. Americans will pay more than one-half trillion \ndollars more in taxes as a result of the President's tax increase of \nlast year.\n\n  So despite what we hear and what we heard in the State of the Union \nAddress on January 23, part of which said, ``We know big Government \ndoes not have all the answers''--I am quoting the President--``We know \nthere is not a program for every problem, and we know we have to work \nto give Americans a smaller, less bureaucratic Government in \nWashington, and we have to give the American people one that lives \nwithin its means.'' He said, ``The era of big Government is over.'' \nYet, we have the largest expenditure for Government that we have ever \nhad under this administration.\n  So, Mr. President, this is tax day. It has already been noted that \nthe typical family spends more than 38 percent of its income on taxes--\nmore than it spends for food, clothing, and shelter combined. It has \nbeen mentioned that more than 3 hours of our 8-hour day is spent to \nproduce taxes. It is also mentioned, I think importantly, that there \nare more than 100,000 employees at IRS, which is more than at the FBI, \nDEA, and Immigration Service combined. There is something wrong with \nthat, when you take a look at the billions of dollars that are spent \nsimply to prepare the forms that we have to use.\n  It is also interesting, in terms of spending, that for every dollar \nin new taxes, the Government spends $1.59. The rest of it goes on the \ncredit card. So what we have had, of course, is what we might call \n``the Clinton crunch.'' The President has promised a tax cut and \ndelivered a tax increase, which is very difficult on small business, \nand it holds down the creation of new jobs. It is difficult for senior \ncitizens on fixed incomes. There was a tax increase for everyone, among \nthem a gas tax, which hits my State of Wyoming very hard. The new \nbudget contains $60 billion in new taxes.\n  So we have not moved toward the end of big Government. On the other \nhand, I think that in this session of Congress the majority party has \nmade a real effort to do that. We passed tax cuts last year, a $500 per \nchild tax credit, marriage penalty, capital gains tax, expanded IRA's, \nadopted tax credits, student loan interest deduction--all, of course, \nwhich was vetoed.\n  Today the tax limitation amendment will be considered in the House. I \nhappen to think it is a good idea. It is like saying we do not need to \namend the Constitution. It is the same thing I heard when we were \ntalking about a balanced budget amendment. Everybody stood up, and \nbefore they began to talk, they said, ``I want to balance the budget, \nbut we do not need an amendment to do that.'' Maybe we ought to remind \nthem that it has been 25 years since we balanced the budget. And 43 \nStates have that amendment. In my State, the legislature cannot spend \nmore than it takes in. I think, similarly, we need that same kind of \namendment on spending. There is no reason why, if spending is \nimportant, you cannot generate more support than 50 percent to do that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is an issue we ought to talk about \nevery day, and it is appropriate on tax day. Keep in mind, it is not \nonly dollars. It is also how much Government do you want? I think that \nis a question that each of us, as citizens, ought to ask ourselves. \nUnfortunately, we do not have the kind of cost-benefit measurement in \nthe Federal Government that we do at home. If the school district \nthinks they need a new school building or a sign, they say, ``Here is \nwhat it costs and here is what you have to pay,'' and you make a \ndecision as to whether it is worth it. That is not what happens on the \nFederal level. We send in an amount of money, and we do not even know \nwhat it is really being spent for. We do not make any real decisions in \nterms of those programs that are funded.\n  I am persuaded that we can have a much leaner Government and still \nprovide for the things that most of us believe are necessary for the \nGovernment to perform. Remember, the measure of good Government is not \nwhat the Government can do for the people, but the kind of environment \nit sets so that we can do for ourselves. That is what the tax system, \ntax amendments, and being concerned about taxes is all about.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia for organizing the time to talk about \nthis important issue. I look forward to our doing something about it as \na followup.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. He \nmade an interesting observation. Not only did he talk about the effect \nof the tax increase of this administration, but he began to talk about \nthe advantages that would have accrued to working families if the \nBalanced Budget Act that was sent to the President--which he vetoed--\nhad passed.\n  A moment ago, I was talking about this average Georgia family paying \nalmost $3,000 more because of the policies of this administration. The \nSenator from Wyoming reminded me that if the Balanced Budget Act had \nbeen signed by the President, the immediate effect to this average \nfamily would have been to return to their checking account $3,000 a \nyear, or thereabouts. Here is a family making $40,000, and they would \nhave $3,000 in additional income in their checking account--not on \nApril 15 being shipped to Washington. Think what they could do with \nthat. That is the equivalent of a 10- to 20- percent pay raise, Mr. \nPresident. It is not insignificant.\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nleadership on this very important day, April 15, the day taxes are due \nfor American citizens. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the \nissue of the high-tax policies of the President Clinton administration. \nThe high-tax policies of this administration are policies toward the \nhighest taxes in the history of the country. More money is coming in \nfrom taxes now than ever before in history, and of course, that money \ncomes from the people.\n  The tax bill which we find so burdensome is President Clinton's tax \nbill of 1993, which passed this body. But even all the Democrats would \nnot vote for it, and there was a tie-breaking vote by Vice President \nGore. The President's 1993 tax bill, OBRA 1993, was very \ncontroversial. President Clinton raised everyone's taxes by a record \namount--again, the biggest tax increase in the history of our country.\n\n  It also happens that the President had misgivings about his tax \nincrease legislation. He was speaking in October of last year to the \nattendees at a Clinton fundraiser in Texas when he said that he thought \nthat he raised taxes too much in 1993. I agree with the President.\n  I want to remind everybody, as the Senator from Georgia does, of the \nvarious ways in which the President went about raising taxes at the \nhighest level that they have ever been raised in one tax bill.\n  He increased the tax on Social Security benefits. Some Americans have \nto report 85 percent of their Social Security income so it can be taxed \nagain after they have already paid tax on it once.\n  In addition, he added a new and higher income tax rate which also set \nthe situation in order, which we call the marriage tax penalty, \nexacerbating it so that people are going to pay a lower tax living \ntogether than being married.\n  He also added new and higher estate and gift tax rates.\n  He decreased the business meals deduction for the truck driver and \nfor the small business people of America. He hit farmers, truck \ndrivers, and everyone who drives a car or truck with a 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon increase in the gasoline tax.\n  In Iowa--I do not know about the rest of the country--this Clinton \ngas tax costs every two-driver family an average of an extra $53.32 per \nyear.\n  For small business people, the President hosted a White House \nconference on small business. He waxed eloquently on the need for \nexpensing deductions, for creating IRA's, for pension simplification, \nand for estate tax reductions, to name a few. But when Congress passed \nlegislation on those very same issues, President Clinton vetoed not \none, not two, but every one of those ideas that he spoke eloquently \nabout at his conference.\n  For education, he talked about a new tax deduction. But when Congress \nsent the President my new student loan interest deduction last fall, \nPresident Clinton vetoed it, again contrary to what he said he wanted \nto do. He even hurt families trying to relocate to new jobs by \ndecreasing their deductible moving expenses.\n  These, Mr. President, are just a few among many of the new, \nunpopular, and economically hurtful Clinton tax increases.\n  The troublesome irony is that the President has many people still \npaying their extra 1993 Clinton income tax increases. People are still \npaying their 1993 income taxes because the President accomplished \nsomething that no other President had done before him. The President \nmanaged to raise taxes even before he was sworn into office because the \ntax rate increase of 1993 was made retroactive at his request.\n  So those with the mind of softening the blow on people who would have \nto pay a retroactive tax increase insisted the President at least allow \ntaxpayers to pay the retroactive portions of their 1993 taxes in three \nseparate installments. The first installment was due in 1994. The \nsecond was due in 1995. And people just paid their third and final \ninstallment of their fiscal 1993 Clinton tax increase today, Monday, \nApril 15, 1996.\n  So, in October 1995, when the President testified in Texas at his \nfundraiser that he had raised people's taxes too much, perhaps he meant \nthat he would feel their pain again on April 15, 1996. This is because \ntoday the President has given many taxpayers the unique opportunity to \nbe taxed on income of three different years.\n  Today many taxpayers will pay the last installment of their fiscal \n1993 taxes, the balance due on their now higher regular 1995 taxes, and \ntheir first quarter estimated taxes for 1996.\n  Indeed, the only taxable year of the Clinton Presidency that \nPresident Clinton is not taxing this very day is 1994. Fortunately, Mr. \nPresident, no one is perfect. Even though President Clinton has done \nhis best to raise taxes in a Democratic Congress, and to keep them just \nas high in a Republican Congress. He did this by vetoing efforts of the \nnew Republican Congress to reduce taxes, particularly the tax deduction \nthat gives a family of four with two children an additional $1,000 more \nin their pocket to spend.\n  I believe that we should credit public servants for their good deeds \nand hold them responsible for their harmful ones.\n  Apparently, President Clinton must love to raise taxes almost as he \nloves to deficit spend.\n  Do not forget Mr. President, that he sent Vice President Gore to this \nvery Chamber to cast that tie-breaking vote on the 1993 tax increase \nbecause even all the members of his own party would not go along with \nit. The voters remember it mostly because they are still paying for it, \nand will continue to pay for it every day.\n  In addition, we passed last year a taxpayers bill of rights so that \nthe taxpayer will not have to be intimidated by the IRS during audit, \nand the President even vetoed the taxpayers bill of rights.\n  So, Mr. President, annually, this day April 15 brings to mind the \ncomplexities and the enormities of the Tax Code.\n  April 15, 1996 of this year further serves to remind us of the \ndangerous precedent that President Clinton set with his 1993 tax \nincrease, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, and \nthe only one retroactive to a period of time before the President was \nsworn into office.\n  With his retroactive tax increase, President Clinton is the first \nPresident in the history of the Nation to have raised taxes before, \nduring, and after his term of office. Of course, if we are not careful \nin the future, this may prove to be one of the most memorable and \ndangerous of the Clinton legacies.\n  In addition to increasing taxes at the highest level in the history \nof the country with that tax bill of 1993, the President set in motion \nan economic situation in which money that would be invested for job \ncreation has created less jobs than during the period when the country \nwas recovering from the recession of 1991 to 1992 by some 3 million \njobs.\n  So, somewhere out there, even though we do have a high level of jobs \nbeing created, there are 3 million more people who could be employed if \nthe tax increase of 1993 had not stymied the economy to the point that \nthe people who create jobs were afraid to do it to the tune of 3 \nmillion jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  As a former native son of Iowa, I always enjoy listening to him \naddress this Chamber.\n  A moment ago, I was talking about the effect of the President's tax \nincrease on the average citizen in our State, but just for the general \nrecord I think it worthwhile acknowledging what some of the impacts of \nthat tax were. That tax increase created a 4.3-cent per gallon gas tax \nincrease levied on all Americans. Once again, when we heard the debate \nto impose the tax increase, which was only passed by one vote, the Vice \nPresident casting the deciding vote here in the Chamber late in August \n1993, it was just supposed to affect the wealthy. But a 4.3-cent-gallon \ntax affects every farmer, trucker, every family, every carpool, every \nbusiness--everyone. Under the provisions of that tax increase, senior \ncitizens making as little as $34,000 a year--I guess that is another \nrich person--found their taxes hiked as a result of a 70-percent \nincrease in the taxable portion of their\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nSocial Security benefits. We all can hear people on the other side of \nthe aisle talking about their concern for protecting Social Security \nbenefits. One of the first things the administration did was to tax \nthem.\n  Small businesses were clobbered by the Clinton tax hike. More than 80 \npercent of small businesses file their returns as individuals. As a \nresult, small businesses were forced to pay the higher individual rates \nof up to 44.5 percent. I repeat, Mr. President, 44.5 percent. That is \nmuch higher than the 35-percent rate for big businesses. If you had to \npoint to one sector of our society that was the most ravaged by that \nhuge $250 billion tax increase, it would be small business. And this is \nthe reason why. Because of paying taxes as individuals, they really got \ntheir marginal rate pushed up.\n  As a result of Clinton's tax increase, the local hardware store in \nour State must pay a higher tax rate than a corporation like General \nMotors. Now, think about it. Most corporations in America, 60 percent \nof them, have four employees or less, and they were the fixed target of \nthis tax increase. It was just like a Mack truck coming down the \nhighway, bowling over them and left the situation where these smaller \ncorporations are paying higher tax rates than, of all things, \ncorporations like General Motors.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the Nation's \nlargest small business organization, called Clinton's tax increase \n``about as antismall business as you could ever see.'' That was \npublished in the White House bulletin on June 18, 1993.\n  I have focused a lot of my attention on the effect of taxes on the \naverage family. I would like to visit that just a bit more, if I might.\n  I have often referred to the quintessential average family in the \n1950's. I refer to the television family that we saw so often, ``Ozzie \nand Harriet.'' They were the picture of what we all thought the \nAmerican family ought to be. At that time, Ozzie was sending to the \nFederal Government 2 cents--2 cents, Mr. President--out of every dollar \nhe earned. If Ozzie were here today, he would be sending 24 to 25 cents \nout of every dollar to Washington.\n  It is hard to envision or believe. When I was growing up, I was told \nthat the single largest investment any American would ever make would \nbe the purchase of a home. That is not true anymore. The largest single \ninvestment that any American or American family will make today is in \nthe Federal Government, not the home.\n  In fact, the Federal Government's consumption from the wages of this \naverage working family equates to housing, food, and clothing combined. \nWho would have ever thought that working families in this country would \nbe faced with this sweeping hand of the Federal Government coming \nthrough families and removing over a quarter of their income, removing \nmore resources from the family than it took to build their home or buy \ntheir home or rent or to feed the family or to clothe it combined; that \nthe Federal Government alone would come in and sweep more out of that \nfamily's checking account than all those fundamental functions we count \non that family to do for America.\n  I became very curious about this about a year ago because in the \n1950's the typical family had one parent working and one parent at home \nwith the family, doing the business of raising the family. As you know, \ntoday that has been turned upside down.\n  I mentioned a little earlier this average family in Georgia. It \nrequires both parents to work. I got curious about that, and I wondered \nat what pace families started to have both spouses out in the \nworkplace. If they had one in the workplace and one at home in 1950, \njust how quickly did it get to the point we are now where the majority \nof them have both parents in the workplace.\n  So we tracked it on a chart from 1950 to 1990, the percentage of \nfamilies for which both spouses were working. It is really interesting. \nIf you take that line of the number of families where both spouses now \nwork, as it grew over the last 40 years, and you take another chart and \nyou map out the increases from the 2 cents to 25 cents that they are \npaying in taxes, those two lines are within 6 percentage points of each \nother all the way.\n\n  What does that mean? It means that as the Government took more and \nmore and more out of that working family, the Government was making the \ndecision that for the family to keep fulfilling their needs in housing, \neducation, et cetera, they had to send the second spouse out. And each \nyear as that tax increase grew, many more families had to make that \ntough decision.\n  It is incredible. There is no institution that has had a more \nprofound effect on the behavior of the working family in America than \nthe Government. It is not even Hollywood. We all talk about Hollywood \nand the violence in films, and I am sure that has had an effect, but it \ndoes not compare to the effect of the Federal Government taking more \nand more and more away from the family, leaving it with no option but \nto produce another worker, often even more.\n  I said that those lines track each other; the number of working \nfamilies that had to put both spouses in the workplace followed \nidentically the increase in the tax burden. There is another way to \nlook at it. How much had the tax burden increased over that period of \ntime? It comes out about $10,000 to $12,000 per family. It is \ninteresting that the average income of the second spouse is within \n$1,000 of the increased tax burden. In other words, we made the second \nspouse work so that they could pay the added tax burden. That is what \nthey are doing in the workplace.\n  Obviously, there have been other changes. There have been people who \nhave made a choice about their careers. That is fine. But when you \nsurvey the second spouses in the workplace and ask them their choices \nabout it, 85 percent would make a choice different than it is now. A \nthird of them would not work at all. A third of them would work part \ntime. And a third of them would direct their work at charitable \nactivity instead of the necessity to be out in the workplace, just to \npay Uncle Sam another tax bill so we can redistribute these resources \nfrom Washington. Back to the point I made a little earlier, Mr. \nPresident, we have a school of thought here that it is better for the \nwages to come to Washington because Washington can determine more \neffectively where those priorities for that family ought to be.\n  That reminds me of a story that Senator Gramm, the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, often tells. He was in a debate in Texas with somebody from \nthe Education Department and they were going back and forth about the \npriorities of education. Senator Gramm finally, in frustration, turned \nto the person and said, ``Hey, look, I love my children more than \nyou.'' Whereupon the representative from the Education Department said, \n``No, you don't.'' And then Senator Gramm said, ``Well, OK, you tell me \ntheir names.''\n\n  It is not a question of spending, it is a question of who is going to \ndo it. Is the family more equipped to make these choices about \neducation, housing, where to live, how to expend those resources? Or \nshould we continue this idea of moving it up here so somebody who does \nnot even know that family can be determining where those resources go?\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield up to 10 minutes for the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for yielding me this time. I thank him for making arrangements \nto have this time to talk today about the tax burden on the American \npeople. It is appropriate that we talk about this issue today, April \n15.\n  When the poet T.S. Eliot wrote, ``April is the cruelest month,'' he \nhad in mind something other than the income tax deadline of April 15, I \nam sure. But for most Americans, the middle of this month, despite all \nits beauty, is a time of resentment and disaffection. Over this past \nweekend, over the past weeks, maybe over the past couple of months, \nmaybe even today, there are people all over America who are scrambling \nto try to figure out their ``simplified'' tax forms.\n  That is always good for a laugh when I am home in Mississippi, \nspeaking about how we developed simplified income tax return forms. \nThey get more complicated every year. The average person is just not \nable to do it by himself or herself. It is a hodgepodge of 3 million \nwords in the law and in regulations and requirements with regard to\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nour Tax Code. It is a mess. It is unfair. It is cumbersome. It is \nunmanageable. And something must be done about the tax burden on the \nAmerican people.\n  It might be argued that the tax burden on the American people is not \nall that great compared with some of the other countries around the \nworld. But this is not other countries around the world. This is \nAmerica. As a matter of fact, there are some countries that have a \nhigher tax burden than us, others less. But I understand the average \nAmerican pays about 37 to 40 percent of his or her income for taxes.\n  Some of them obviously go much higher than that. It gets in the range \nof 50 percent or more when you figure all the taxes: Federal income \ntax, the FICA tax, the State tax, the local property tax--all the taxes \nthat are heaped on the American people--even the cruelest of all, I \nthink, the estate tax. That is one where we tax people's death. I \nwonder how we ever came to that, where we put American people in the \nsituation where they worked all their lives to build a small business, \nperhaps they are third generation farmers, and when they die and they \nwant to pass on their estate to their children, many times they wind up \nhaving to sell it because they cannot pay the taxes on this farm that \nhas been in their family for many, many years. Or, because they cannot \npay the taxes on the small business that they worked hard for, labored \nfor, and built up, then they wind up having to sell it because of the \ntax burden.\n  So, this is a cruel time. I understand, now, the average American \nalso has to work until May 7 to pay the taxes that he or she owes. Way \nback in the beginning of this country it was only until January 31 that \nyou had to work to pay the taxes for the year. Then it was February, \nMarch, right on through April. Now, average Americans work over 4 \nmonths just to pay the tax burden that they are faced with today. \nSomething must be done about this. There must be a way to have a fairer \nTax Code. Changes should be made to make it more fair and changes \nshould be made to provide, I think, overall basic reform.\n  It is not that most of the American people do not want to pay any \ntaxes. People understand they get a tremendous benefit from Federal \nGovernment, from State government. There are certain guarantees that we \nwant. We do want the shores to be defended. We do have an obligation to \nsupport a strong national defense. We do need infrastructure. We do \nneed the Interstate Highway System. There are some things the Federal \nGovernment can do to help with education. So there are some positive \nthings that the Government can run, where it can be helpful, and we \nwant that to continue.\n\n  But I remember the days not so many years ago that most taxpayers \nsigned their IRS returns with a kind of pride, a self-satisfaction \nthat, by golly, you are getting a good deal, you are doing your part, \nyou are pulling your weight. Sure we always griped about taxes and \njoked about them, but we knew that, while there was a price to be paid, \nthere was some benefit that we all basically supported coming from \nthat.\n  I believe that has changed in many respects now, and not for the \nbetter. With a steady expansion of Government, both at the State and \nFederal level, the percentage of family income going for taxes has \ngrown tremendously. For most households today, taxes are the largest \nsingle outlay in their budgets. I hate to think how many families now \nhave two earners these days, both mom and dad, in order to compensate \nfor the lost income siphoned off by official Washington. That is why \nthe Republican Contract With America last year promised tax relief for \nfamilies. That is why majorities in both the House and the Senate \ntranslated the contract's promises into carefully crafted legislation.\n  We all know what happened to it. Tax relief for families with \nchildren was vetoed by President Clinton, along with many other revenue \nprovisions that would have curbed Washington's appetite for the \npublic's earnings. Today, April 15, is an appropriate time to remember \nthat outcome and to consider why it occurred. It happened because there \nare still too many elected officials who believe they know best how to \nspend the people's money. They believe that big Government can take \ncare of families better than they can take care of themselves and of \ntheir children. And it takes cash, hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars to do that, if you are going to let Washington look after all \nthese problems.\n  That attitude is fading fast over most of the Nation. I found it is \nfading, certainly, in my home State while I was home during the Easter \nrecess break. But it persisted in many high places here in this city. \nOnly in official Washington is it called a tax expenditure when you \nallow people to keep their own money. That was a bit of ingenious \nwordsmithing, some few years ago. I think it really started in the \n1970's, when we started calling it a tax expenditure. Only inside the \nbeltway is a tax cut considered a loss. Only within the shrunken ranks \nof Federal dogmatists is broad-based tax relief called a tax cut for \nthe rich.\n  It is almost as if the opponents of tax reduction disbelieve in the \nAmerican dream of hard-earned success. It is as if they think people \nwho strive and contribute are bad, while those who depend on Government \nshould be encouraged to stay that way. More than any other factor, I \nbelieve that attitude, that set of ideological blinders, accounts for \nlast year's opposition to the tax provisions of our Contract With \nAmerica.\n  Let me just mention, again, the major provisions in that tax package \nthat we considered last year, but the President vetoed. We eliminated \nthe marriage penalty. How many years have we been talking about how it \nis unfair, when a young couple--or couple, not even necessarily young--\ngets married, if they both work, when they get married they pay more \ntaxes even though their income does not go up? There is nobody who can \ndefend the marriage penalty.\n  How about the spousal IRA? Why is it that the only group in America \nthat cannot have an IRA is a spouse working in the home? Should we \nallow that? Should we encourage the spouse in the home to be able to \nsave a little bit for his or her retirement days? Absolutely we should \ndo that.\n\n  Another thing that we included in that tax package was relief for our \nseniors who still want to work. We would raise the limits on the \nearnings that you can have and still get Social Security. Why should \npeople just between 65 and 70 lose part of their income if they make \nover $11,500 a year? Thank goodness we have now passed separate \nlegislation to do that, but that is another example of what was \nincluded in our package.\n  Certainly, we should provide families the $500 tax credit if they \nhave children. Some people argued, ``Oh, what difference would it make \nto a family with one or two children?'' Let me tell you, in my State, \nfor a couple making $30,000 a year with two children, a $1,000 tax \ncredit would make a significant difference, and then they could decide \nwhat their children needed most instead of the Federal Government.\n  Finally, and not least, it did provide a capital gains tax rate cut. \nIf you are going to reduce the deficits, you can only do it by three \nways fundamentally: by controlling spending, by raising taxes or, \nhopefully, by doing some things with Government and regulatory relief \nand by changing the Tax Code to provide growth in the economy. The \ncapital gains tax rate cut would do that.\n  In my State of Mississippi, if we cut the capital gains tax rate on \ntimber and on timberlands, there would be an explosion of activity in \nthe turning over in the timber area. It is probably the biggest \nindustry we have in our State. Yet, people are hesitant to sell that \ntimber, to sell that land because so much of it is taken in capital \ngains. It is just, basically, not fair.\n  So those are the things we had in our tax package last year. It would \nhave provided some relief to families with children and to individuals \nwhen they are newly married and to a spouse working in the home. Tell \nme that is helping one group over the other. That helps everybody.\n  Our tax package was not a giveaway to the rich. It was a give-back to \nhard-working people, and there is a big difference. If President \nClinton had signed, instead of vetoed, the Republican tax package last \nDecember, 88 percent of its tax relief would have gone to families with \nincomes under $100,000 and 72 percent would have gone\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\nto families with incomes under $75,000. That is certainly not rich. \nThat is families in which both husband and wife are maybe \nschoolteachers. It is a family whose sole breadwinner is perhaps an \nauto worker in Detroit or a shipyard worker in Pascagoula, MS. It is \nthe self-employed, heads of households. It is the men and women \nstarting up small businesses. It is the parents who could well use that \n$500 tax credit for their children, which was all vetoed by the \nPresident. After all, in the private sector, this $500 can go a long \nway toward clothing, food, and education of our children.\n  The hopes of those middle-income taxpayers were splattered by ink \nwith that veto last year. But they should not give up hope. There is \nstill an opportunity for this Congress this year to make some needed \nchanges in our Tax Code that will help middle-income Americans and \nothers, also.\n  But now to the heart of the matter. Just what is the price that has \nbeen paid?\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Georgia if he \nwill yield me just another minute to finish up.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield another minute to the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, why could the President and his allies not \naccept tax relief for the American people? The answer is profamily, \nprogrowth tax reform puts a crimp in Government spending. If you allow \nthe people to keep more of their money, it is a little less the \nGovernment would have had to gobble up and to spend. It makes it harder \nfor practitioners of business as usual around this institution to \nprovide favors to their constituents. It slows down the Government \nspending machine.\n  That is why most Americans have paid more in Federal taxes than they \nshould have paid. Big government in Washington needed their money to \nstay big and to grow bigger. I really believe that by giving some tax \nrelief to the people, in many instances--in fact in most instances--you \ncan actually wind up getting more revenue coming into the Government \nbecause the people are given more incentives to work hard, keep their \nown money, pay taxes, and everybody benefits from that.\n  As of midnight tonight, tax year 1995 will be history. It is maybe \ntoo late to lessen the burden on that year, on the past, but we can, \nindeed, do something about the future in the hope that on this same day \nnext year, taxpayers will be able to celebrate the tax give back that \nthey so justly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, as always. I am going to yield our time until 1 \no'clock to the Senator from Arizona, with this logistical comment: If \nthe senior Senator from Georgia has not arrived at 1, I will ask \nunanimous consent to extend our time another 10 minutes so that the \nSenator from Arizona will have sufficient time to complete his remarks. \nI think we can achieve that. I will not know until 1 o'clock.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Senator from Georgia \nfor conducting this particular discussion on tax policy on this day, a \nday which we might paraphrase will live in infamy at least in the lives \nof many Americans. By midnight tonight, millions of Americans will have \ncompleted their tax returns and may agree with T.S. Eliot who \ncharacterized April as the cruelest month of all. I am not sure this is \nwhat he had in mind, but perhaps it applies.\n  According to estimates by the Internal Revenue Service, individuals \nwill have spent about 1.7 billion hours on tax-related paperwork. \nBusinesses will have spent another 3.4 billion hours to comply with \ntheir Tax Code preparations this year. The Tax Foundation estimates \nthat the cost of compliance will approach $200 billion.\n  If that is not evidence that our Tax Code is one of the most \ninefficient and wasteful ever created, I do not know what is. Money and \neffort that could have been put to productive use solving problems in \nour communities, putting Americans to work, putting food on the table, \nor investing in the Nation's future are instead devoted to wasteful \npaperwork.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are frustrated and angry, as \nI found in the townhall meetings and other visits with constituents in \nthe last 2 weeks in Arizona. They are demanding real change in the way \ntheir Government taxes and spends.\n  There are, of course, a number of proposals that have been generated \nfor comprehensive tax reform. Senator Richard Shelby and House Majority \nLeader Dick Armey have proposed a flat tax. Versions of the flat tax \nhave also been suggested by Steve Forbes and Senator Phil Gramm. Former \nHUD Secretary Jack Kemp has issued a report at the request of Speaker \nGingrich and Majority Leader Dole which recommends a single rate \nsimpler tax system. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee \nhas recommended that the income tax be pulled out by its roots and \nreplaced with a national sales tax. Senator Lugar has proposed a sales \ntax as well.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee just concluded a hearing on a proposal \nto change whether we move to some version of a flat tax or sales tax or \nsome other alternative. Indeed, it is a change that should be made \nwhether comprehensive tax reform occurs or not. I am talking about a \nchange that requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate in \norder to approve tax increases. The House of Representatives is \nscheduled to vote on its proposal later on this evening.\n\n  The tax limitation amendment it is called. The tax limitation \namendment, which I proposed in the U.S. Senate, with the support of 20 \nother Senators, would require a two-thirds vote of approval in both the \nHouse and the Senate in order to increase the tax base or to increase \nany tax rate.\n  The two-thirds supermajority that many of us believe should be added \nto the U.S. Constitution was recommended by the National Commission on \nEconomic Growth and Tax Reform, as I said, appointed by Senate Majority \nLeader Dole and Speaker Gingrich and chaired by former HUD Secretary \nJack Kemp who testified at this Judiciary Committee hearing this \nmorning, along with former Governor of Delaware Pete du Pont and a host \nof other experts on tax policy.\n  This Commission that Secretary Kemp chaired advocated the \nsupermajority requirement in its report on how to achieve a simpler \nsingle tax rate to replace the existing maze of tax rates, deductions, \nexemptions, and credits that make up the Tax Code as we know it today.\n  In fact, in the words of the Commission, and I am quoting:\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past two \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low tax \n     rates of the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment \n     and anger when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in \n     less than 7 years. The commission believes that a two-thirds \n     super-majority vote of Congress will earn Americans' \n     confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of \n     any new tax system.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation from the Kemp Commission report.\n  In the 10 years since the last attempted comprehensive tax reform, \nthe Congress and the President have made some 4,000 amendments to the \nTax Code--4,000 amendments. In the future, without the protection of \nthe tax limitation amendment, taxpayers will be particularly vulnerable \nto tax rate increases, particularly if the tax reform eliminates many \nof the deductions and exemptions and credits in which they sometimes \nfind refuge today.\n  In short, Mr. President, the tax limitation amendment will make it \nmore difficult for Congress to raise taxes, and it will also help \nrestore confidence, stability, and predictability to the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, I have more of the statement which I would like to \npresent. I wonder if, in view of the hour, it would be appropriate for \nthe Senator from Georgia to ask for an extension of time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent that our side be granted an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Ideally, Mr. President, the tax limitation amendment would be put \ninto place after comprehensive tax reform is accomplished. This is \nbecause tax reform necessarily aims to broaden the tax base, \neliminating the maze of deductions and exemptions and credits that make \nup the Tax Code today, and then apply one low tax rate to whatever \namount of income is left. So a two-thirds majority vote requirement \nwould make comprehensive tax reform more difficult.\n  I would note parenthetically that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 would \nhave met the two-thirds test because it passed both the House and the \nSenate with more than a two-thirds majority. So advocacy of tax reform \nis not necessarily a reason to oppose the tax limitation amendment at \nthis time. But in any event, it is important that this debate begin \nnow, Mr. President, because of course, constitutional amendments such \nas this are going to take a long time to get adopted.\n  It probably will not be approved this year in the House or the \nSenate. It would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and \nSenate, and then three-fourths of the States to approve it. So the last \nthing I am worried about is that we will accomplish this constitutional \namendment before we accomplish fundamental tax reform. I think we need \nto begin the debate now on the constitutional amendment, and by the \ntime we get finished with fundamental tax reform, perhaps the \nconstitutional amendment can then be put in place to make it difficult \nthereafter to change the Tax Code.\n\n  I think it is also important to make three other quick points. First, \nthe tax limitation amendment cuts no taxes. It only raises the bar on \npassing future tax increases. Many people, including myself, already \nbelieve that taxes are far too high. This amendment in effect says, \n``Enough is enough.'' It makes Congress find a way to meet its \nobligations without taking more from the pockets of the American \npeople.\n  Understand that the average family today pays more in taxes than it \ndoes on food, clothing, and shelter combined. I would refer you to the \nchart, Mr. President, entitled ``Family Budget 1995'' in which you can \nsee the amount spent on savings; recreation; transportation; medical \nneeds; then food, shelter, and clothing; and then, finally, Federal, \nState, and local taxes. We pay more in Federal, State, and local taxes \nthan we do on food, shelter, and clothing all combined. Clearly, this \ntax burden on the average family is too high.\n  Let me also note that it has obviously been fairly easy for Congress \nto raise taxes. Here is the Federal tax burden per capita just in the \nlast 15 years, the years 1980 through 1995. You can see that in 1980 it \nwas about $2,286 per capita. Today it is over $5,000 per capita. \nClearly, it is not hard to raise the tax burden on taxpayers. We need \nto make it harder.\n  If you want to look at the macrochart, the chart that shows the \nFederal Government revenues from taxes since 1950, look at this chart. \nIt clearly shows that tax increases have skyrocketed. It is not hard to \nraise taxes. It is too easy to raise taxes. That is why we need a two-\nthirds supermajority to raise taxes. What the tax limit amendment says \nis that it ought to be harder to raise taxes, that we are already \ntaking too much from working American families and therefore we ought \nto take less.\n  I also note that our Constitution already provides several--10 \nspecifically--supermajority requirements. My guess is that that is \nbecause the Framers wanted a consensus to be developed to make really \nimportant changes. That is why it takes a two-thirds vote to override a \nPresident's veto, for example. My guess is the Framers would say today \nthis is out of control. It is important enough that a broader consensus \nthan a mere simple majority should be required in order for us to raise \ntaxes.\n  Mr. President, there is no small irony in the fact that it will take \na two-thirds vote for us to cut taxes since the President has vetoed \nour tax cut proposal and yet the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe country in 1993 was passed not even with a majority, technically, \nbecause the Senate vote was tied 50 to 50, and it took the vote of the \nVice President to break that tie.\n  It ought to be as hard to raise taxes as it is to cut them. The \namendment will make it harder to raise taxes. That is the point. I know \nthat is the objection of the opponents, but that is the whole point \nhere. I think we would all agree that a lower tax rate would be more \nbeneficial, not only for the American family, but for our economy. As a \nmatter of fact, lower tax rates, research shows, results in more \ntaxable income, more taxable transactions, and eventually more tax \nrevenues to the Treasury. So we actually are benefited by reductions in \ntax rates, not increases in tax rates.\n  The tax cuts of the early 1980's are a case in point. They spawned \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's history. \nRevenues to the Treasury increased as a result--from $599.3 billion in \nfiscal year 1981 to $990.7 billion in fiscal year 1989, up about 65 \npercent.\n  High tax rates, on the other hand, discourage work, production, \nsavings, and investment, so there is ultimately less economic activity \nto tax. That is precisely what Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of \nthe President's Council of Economic Advisers, found when he looked at \nthe effect of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase. He found that \ntaxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal tax rates imposed by \nthe Clinton tax bill by reducing their taxable incomes by nearly $25 \nbillion. They did that by saving less, investing less, and creating \nfewer jobs. The economy eventually paid the price in terms of slower \ngrowth. So increases in tax rates do not usually translate into more \ntax revenue.\n  It is interesting to note that revenues as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product [GDP] have actually fluctuated around a relatively \nnarrow band--18 to 20 percent of GDP--for the last 40 years. Revenues \namounted to about 19 percent of GDP when the top marginal income tax \nrate was in the 90 percent range in the 1950's. They amounted to just \nunder 19 percent when the top marginal rate was in the 28 percent range \nin the 1980's. Why the consistency? Because tax rate changes have a \ngreater effect on how well or how poorly the economy performs than on \nthe amount of revenue that flows to the Treasury relative to GDP.\n  In other words, how Congress taxes is more important than how much it \ncan tax. The key is whether tax policy fosters economic growth and \nopportunity, measured in terms of GDP, or results in a smaller and \nweaker economy. Nineteen percent of a larger GDP represents more \nrevenue to the Treasury and is, therefore, preferable to 19 percent of \na smaller GDP.\n  Requiring a supermajority vote for tax increases is not a new idea. \nIt is an idea that has already been tested in a dozen States across the \ncountry. In 1992, an overwhelming majority of voters in my home State \nof Arizona--72 percent--approved an amendment to the State's \nconstitution requiring a two-thirds majority vote for tax increases.\n  There is a reason that the idea has been so popular in Arizona and \nother States. Tax limits work. According to a 1994 study by the Cato \nInstitute, a family of four in States with tax and expenditure limits \nfaced a State tax burden that was $650 lower, on average, 5 years after \nimplementation than it would have been if State tax growth had not been \nslowed.\n  The tax limitation amendment will force Congress to be smarter about \nhow it raises revenue. It will force Congress to look to economic \ngrowth to raise revenue, instead of simply increasing tax rates. It \nwill protect taxpayers from additional tax increases.\n  We are going to have to confront this issue of raising taxes sooner \nor later because the burden on the American family is simply too high. \nIt seems to me this is a good time to do it. Starting this debate on \ntax day, April 15, is a propitious time when people's attentions are \nfocused on the issue. I hope that the House of Representatives later \ntoday approves the tax limitation amendment pending there. I hope that \nLeader Dole will be able to schedule this amendment sometime soon on \nthe Senate floor for a vote here.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee making time \navailable for our hearing this morning. It was an informative hearing \nwhich certainly sustained the case that the time\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nfor a tax limitation amendment is upon us and an amendment that would \nmake it hard to raise taxes by requiring a two-thirds vote in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend the Senator from Georgia for making \nthis time available. I hope that we can get on with this prospect of \nmaking Americans' lives a little bit easier by taking less of their \nhard-earned income.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, how \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Georgia has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Arizona for his legislative \nefforts to make it only possible to pass new burdens on the American \npeople with a two-thirds vote. I think there should be an extra burden \non any legislative chamber before it has the right to pass on even \ngreater burdens.\n  We have spent the entire morning here talking about the size of the \nburden which is just--I am convinced, if any of our Founders were here \ntoday, Jefferson in particular, they would be absolutely stunned at the \nscope of the amount of wages that a laborer must forfeit to the \nGovernment. He said we needed a frugal Government which did those \nthings that absolutely had to be done, but other than that, the fruits \nof labor should be left to those who earn it, and allow them to choose \ntheir own pursuit of happiness.\n  We have talked a lot this morning about the scope of the tax increase \nthis administration put on the American people. The effect and burden \nit added, in our case, is almost $3,000 for the average family annually \nthat they are having to forfeit from their wages, preventing them from \ndoing the things they ought to do.\n  But I want to close with one piece that is particularly egregious \nabout that tax increase. That tax increase which was passed in August \n1993 changed the Tax Code backward even beyond the administration \ntaking office. For the first time in history, it changed the Tax Code \nall the way back into a former administration, the Bush administration, \nJanuary 1993.\n\n  Mr. President, the Russian Constitution does not allow you to tax \nretroactively. It is wrong. It is morally incorrect. Families and \nbusinesses and communities have to know what the rules of the road are. \nThey have to be able to plan their lives, plan their families, plan \ntheir tax burdens in advance. They cannot get to the end of the year \nand have a Congress of the United States and President come forward and \nsay, ``Whoops. We're changing all that to take effect back a year \nearlier. So all your planning was for naught. We don't care.''\n  Mr. President, that is wrong. When I leave this Chamber, I will be \ngoing to a hearing on a constitutional amendment which I and others are \nsponsoring that, like the Russians', would prohibit Americans from \nbeing subjected to retroactive taxation.\n  Whenever I speak to any American group--it does not matter where they \nare, my State or any other--and you talk about retroactive taxation, \nthere is a unanimity that that is wrong. Our Government has all too \nfrequently in current years gotten into the business of changing the \nrules midstream. It has had a very deleterious effect on the planning \nof our families, planning for our businesses, particularly small \nbusinesses.\n  This retroactive tax that was dumped on the American people by the \nPresident's last tax increase, I believe, is horribly wrong, and has \nhad a terribly negative impact. We ought to do everything we know to do \nto assure that it never happens again--not in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3258-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3268-S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEBT LIMIT EXTENSION AND SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, because we recently shouldered the \nimportant matter of extending the debt limit, I feel obliged to address \nthe provision in that bill that increases the earnings limit for Social \nSecurity beneficiaries aged 65-69. As my colleagues know, this is a \nchange that I have expressed serious concern about in the past. Now \nthat enactment of this provision has come to pass, I want to state my \nviews about the general issue of the earnings limit.\n  First, let me pay tribute to a fine chap, my esteemed colleague from \nthe great State of Arizona, Senator John McCain for his dogged \ndetermination and tireless efforts to effect this change in the law. I \nknow that my past intervention on this issue has not always been truly \nwelcome to my colleague--but I trust that my intentions, which were \nalways constructive, were apparent.\n  It has never been my intention to permanently forestall all changes \nto the earnings limit. I trust that the provision attached to the debt \nlimit extension provides the best available means of achieving the \nobjectives of my friend from Arizona and all others who are interested \nin raising the earnings limit for seniors.\n  Clearly, I appreciate the fundamental principle behind the earnings \nlimit legislation. Americans are living longer, are productive for more \nyears, and our retirement systems need to recognize these facts. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security and \nFamily Policy, I have a demonstrated interest and responsibility to see \nthat we adapt wisely and properly to these changes. One of my charges \nis to monitor any changes in Social Security policy and to ensure that \nthose changes are not detrimental to the long-range solvency of the \nSocial Security system. I have expressed my misgivings about previous \nfunding mechanisms to ``pay for'' this legislation, and I am pleased to \nnote that the offsets now come in a more straightforward manner from \nSocial Security spending.\n  Ultimately, Congress must come to grips with the fact that American \nsociety is aging. For the benefit of today's workers, we must act to \naddress these issues very soon, or the cost to our children and \ngrandchildren will be catastrophically high. We must make changes to \nensure the solvency of future retirement programs--we should increase \nthe retirement age while at the same time offering inducements for \nAmericans to work longer without suffering penalties that discourage \ncontinued participation in our work force.\n  We can't have it both ways--handing out plums that allow workers to \nstay in the work force in a productive way, while at the same time \navoiding the hard choices that must follow--meaning raising of the \nretirement age. I hope that this first step will lead Congress to \nconfront the next necessary decision. Increases in the Social Security \neligibility age must be enacted soon, and the change will have to be \nphased in over a long period--perhaps 20 years--in order to be fair and \neffective. Such a plan will allow today's workers to plan for these \nchanges.\n  This legislation to increase the earnings limit is offset in large \npart by terminating the disability benefits for drug addicts and \nalcoholics. Many have considered the payment of benefits to these \ngroups to be an abuse of the Social Security system. This measure \npassed by the Senate makes a clear choice that we will subsidize the \ncontinued working activity of senior citizens instead of subsidizing \nthese addictions of alcohol and drug use. Clearly, the Senate is \nappropriately going on record as to what activity we wish to encourage \nand what we want to discourage.\n  Another change that will offset the cost of this legislation is the \nincrease in reviews of those people who are currently receiving \ndisability benefits. Such payments were never intended to be a lifetime \nallowance to substitute for employment or self-employment. For years, \nthe Social Security Administration has been unable to complete these \nrequired reviews--the result of which is that people are receiving \ndisability payments long after their disability has either ceased or \nimproved to the point where a return to work is possible. Not only will \nthese reviews result in savings for the trust funds, but they will \nplace able Americans who can return to work back in the workplace.\n  I congratulate Senator McCain for finding the offsets that enable us \nto pay for the increased earnings limits for seniors. I am very \npleased--you can hardly know how much--to be able to speak to this \nissue without having thrown a monkey wrench into the works and \nfrustrating my colleague from Arizona. I am most hopeful that\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nthis measure will be merely a prelude to Congress coming to grips with \nthe much larger issue of the aging of America and the future of our \nretirement programs. The steps that we must take in the future will \nnever--in any way--be as popular as this measure, but we must have the \npolitical fortitude to make those decisions as well. That is our job, \nthat is our duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3268-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WORKER TRAINING AND THE BOSTON HARBOR CLEANUP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Ben Franklin once said that ``an \ninvestment in knowledge always pays the best interest.'' The same can \nbe said about an impressive initiative on worker training undertaken in \nrecent years by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as part of \nthe current environmental cleanup of Boston Harbor.\n  In replacing outdated and obsolete water treatment plants with new \nstate-of-the-art facilities, MWRA invested in retraining its existing \nwork force in the skills needed to operate the new facility, rather \nthan lay off hundreds of employees and recruit new workers with the \nneeded skills. The strategy worked, and has led to lower costs for the \nnew plant, lower costs for ratepayers, and a newly skilled work force \nwith high employee morale.\n  I commend MWRA for this practical demonstration of the effectiveness \nof job retraining and the wisdom of tapping the untapped potential of \nits experienced work force.\n  Too often, such retraining initiatives are the exception, not the \nnorm. We live in an era when workers are too easily under-valued and \nunder-appreciated by employers. The MWRA example can be a lesson to the \nNation that a wise course is available. I ask for unanimous consent \nthat an article by Douglas B. MacDonald, executive director of MWRA, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 19, 1996]\n\n                     Everyday Heroes of Deer Island\n\n                       (By Douglas B. MacDonald)\n\n       The first phase of the new Deer Island sewage treatment \n     plant has been up and running for a year. The ``filthiest \n     harbor in America'' is quickly succumbing to visible signs of \n     environmental recovery; seals and porpoises in the water, \n     swimmers at the beaches, fishermen on the shore. Those are \n     striking testimony that the new infrastructure of pumps, \n     valves and tanks really can retrieve our environment from the \n     careless ravages of a neglected sewer system. Within the new \n     plant there is another less publicized but equally \n     inspirational, success story; the workers themselves.\n       When the MWRA began design and initial construction of the \n     new Deer Island treatment facilities in the late 1980s, it \n     wrestled with the question of how more than 200 workers at \n     the old Deer Island and Nut Island plants would fit into the \n     new plant. Those workers, experienced only in operating \n     treatment facilities with antiquated technology, might have \n     been considered as obsolete as the old plants themselves.\n       Happily, neither MWRA management nor its workers ever \n     accepted that fatalistic view. The workers were challenged, \n     and they challenged themselves, to staff the 21st century \n     facility arising in their midst.\n       The old plants were decades past their prime, underfunded \n     and neglected. Workers had to almost hand-process raw sewage. \n     They kept the old plants functioning with little more than \n     their own dedication.\n       But from their years of working with outmoded and failing \n     equipment, the workers had become pros at troubleshooting the \n     nuances and complexities of the MWRA's sewer system, which \n     takes in over 400 million gallons of wastewater each day from \n     43 communities. They managed to operate the old plant with \n     countless jury-rigs, even bringing in their own tools to keep \n     the plants functioning. Collectively, the old plant workers \n     has over 4,000 years of experience. Their knowledge was an \n     enormous potential asset.\n       Still, decisions about staffing the new plant were \n     difficult. Managers and collective bargaining units wrestled \n     with how to mesh the workers' pride and old-plant experience \n     with yet-to-be-attained technological skills and computer \n     literacy. Discussions were candid and sometimes heated.\n       Slowly, however, trust took root. MWRA management agreed \n     that existing workers would be the core of the new work \n     force. Workers who upgraded their abilities were promised \n     jobs in the new plant. The notion that a new generation of \n     technology must make redundant a generation of workers was \n     rejected outright.\n       Armed with this guarantee, each worker developed a training \n     plan, and MWRA invested several million dollars in courses, \n     workshops and support for outside schooling. Programs covered \n     everything from basic reading and math skills to advanced \n     computer training.\n       Giving workers a sense of ownership in the new plant was \n     another important step, and began with plant familiarization \n     tours of each new building at the earliest points of \n     construction. As the new plant was being designed, plant \n     staff provided engineering firms with ``will it work?'' \n     critiques, relying on their own knowledge of the \n     idiosyncrasies of the old system.\n       Today the human side of the new Deer Island treatment plant \n     is a remarkable story, and underscores the resilience of the \n     American worker. For example, a 20-year veteran worker staffs \n     a three-screen computer console, clicking the mouse like a \n     kid playing a video game. Three years ago this man feared \n     that computer illiteracy would land him outside the plant \n     gate. But he and his computer-trained coworkers know from \n     experience exactly what the computer tells them is going on \n     with a valve 500 yards away.\n       This new productivity benefits MWRA and its rate-payers. \n     Three years ago, cost projections foresaw 500 workers as the \n     necessary staffing level for the Deer Island plant. Today, \n     MWRA plans to run that plant with about 400 workers.\n       For all the money spent on the new tanks, valves and pumps, \n     the best time and money expended to date on the Boston Harbor \n     Project has been invested in the workers who are running our \n     facilities. For the public we serve and for the people we \n     employ, it was the smart thing to do and it was the right \n     thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3269-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, now that the initial shock of the \nhorrific jet crash in Croatia has passed, we are forced to accept the \nfact that my friend Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 34 other talented \nprofessionals have perished. Today, almost 2 weeks later, it's still \nhard to describe the echoing sense of loss and deep sinking sorrow that \nstill remains in all of us--man, woman, black, white, Republican, \nDemocrat.\n  There has been much written and said about Ron Brown over the last \nfew days, and that is fitting, because there is so much to say. He was \nmany things: key strategist, mesmerizing speaker, wily politician, \nsavvy businessman, superb lawyer. Most of all, he was an exemplary \npublic servant for this country. On his last day, he was on the road in \na faraway place aggressively promoting U.S. business interests abroad. \nAnd, in this case, he was trying to bring peace and economic recovery \nto the war-weary Bosnian people. He took very seriously his \nresponsibility to preserve the American dream for the next generation \nof Americans, so that they will have economic opportunity rather than a \ndeclining standard of living. To him, championing the economic \ninterests of the United States was tantamount to championing the people \nof the United States, and so, in a very literal way, he died serving \nhis country.\n  Ron Brown was the most effective Secretary of Commerce I have known \nin my years in the Senate. It is fair to say that he was the most \nenergetic and outstanding individual to ever serve in that post. \nThroughout his distinguished career in private industry, politics and \nthe executive branch, Ron Brown served as a role model for all \nAmericans. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, international business has \nbecome the new realm for competition. Ron Brown understood that and \nworked tirelessly to promote U.S. exports and business overseas. It was \nquite typical for Secretary Brown and me to meet after he had returned \nfrom a long trip abroad. Lack of sleep and shifting time zones never \nset him back. Jet lag wasn't in his vocabulary. It just was not in \nRon's nature to take time to rest up.\n  Ron Brown was an especially strong role model for African-Americans. \nHe never forgot his roots, and he took special pride in his efforts to \nmake Commerce Department programs more inclusive and to provide equal \nopportunity in the work force. He took pride in his efforts to \nrevitalize the Minority Business Development Agency and the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. Most of all, he set an example for those \nwho would follow in his footsteps with his determination, his \nintelligence and his optimism.\n  Secretary Brown came into the Commerce Department with a tremendous\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\ntask: to shake one of the Government's largest and most diverse \ndepartments out of its dormancy, and turn it into forceful, focused, \nand effective agency. At his confirmation, he expressed the following \namong his priorities for the Department of Commerce: ``Expanding \nexports, promoting new technologies, supporting business development--\nthese all require integrated action, crossing old lines between \nbusiness, labor and government.'' Ron Brown was an expert in crossing \nold lines, whether racial or bureaucratic, whether he was rejuvenating \nthe Democratic Party or reinvigorating the Department of Commerce. He \ncould see potential where others couldn't, and he had that unbeatable \ncombination of vision and determination that was contagious. He \ninspired those around him.\n  In addition to his political acumen and leadership abilities, Ron \nBrown was extremely likable. I remember walking down the corridors in \nthe Hoover Building seeing signs on employees' office doors that read \n``Ron Brown Fan Club.'' Even those misguided few in Congress who spent \nthe last year trying to abolish the Commerce Department found their \nefforts thwarted by the simple fact that so many businessmen and \nMembers of Congress not only believed in the importance of Commerce--\nbut also that everyone simply liked Ron Brown.\n  This is a tragedy that hits home for me, Peatsy, and my staff. Ron \nBrown was a good friend. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to Alma, his \nchildren, and all the families of the passengers and crew of the \naircraft.\n  Mr. President, let's all remember Ron Brown for his firebrand style \nof engaged public service. We'll all miss him. I wish we had more like \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3269-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS F. WEAVER\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Thomas F. \nWeaver, a man who devoted his life to ideas and to education. Tom died \nearlier this month at home in Rhode Island and his sudden passing came \nas a shock to all who knew him.\n  Although he was in his midsixties, Tom was an active athlete and an \ninspired educator. As chairman of the department of environmental and \nnatural resource economics at the University of Rhode Island [URI], his \naggressive intellect, his warm spirit, and his enthusiasm all reflected \nthe energy of a much younger man.\n  Tom worked closely with my staff for more than a decade in planning \nthe $24 million construction of buildings that will comprise URI's \nCoastal Institute on Narragansett Bay. Indeed, the building to be \nerected on the university's main campus will include a policy \nsimulation laboratory that would have been his pride and joy.\n  Although the Coastal Institute will be the result of work by many \ntalented and committed individuals, Tom stood out as the workhorse who \nfollowed every development. He helped nudge the process along to assure \nthat USDA matching construction funds were secured. My staff and I were \nonly too glad to help.\n  The University of Rhode Island is now perfectly positioned, as both a \nland grant and a sea grant college, to develop the Coastal Institute. \nIt is my hope, and a hope I know Tom shared, that these closely related \nnatural resources disciplines will meet and grow at the Coastal \nInstitute.\n  The University of Rhode Island's Coastal Institute went though the \nmost rigorous USDA feasibility review, including a peer review. Its \nfunding has been approved step by step in a painfully rigorous \nappropriations process that began in the 1980's.\n  Tom was there every step of the way, providing information, drafting \ntestimony, and helping me to pave the way for approval.\n  As I advised Congress, using information that Tom polished with my \nstaff, the primary mission of the Coastal Institute will be to carry \nout research and analyze policies to better enable society to manage \nits coastal resources wisely.\n  In Tom's words:\n\n       The strength of the Coastal Institute will be \n     multidisciplinary teams addressing complex problems in a \n     holistic manner. The Institute will take advantage of the \n     information superhighway and long distance interactive \n     communication.\n\n  The Rhode Island-funded half of the Coastal Institute facilities are \nnearing completion of URI's Narragansett Bay campus. The federally \nfunded half are in the bid preparation stages for buildings there and \non URI's Kingston campus.\n  I am deeply saddened that Tom did not live to see the completion of \nthe Coastal Institute. It will be an institution that is unique in the \nworld and will include, housed in the building on the Kingston campus, \na policy simulation laboratory that also will be unique.\n  The private sector has been involved almost from the start, thanks to \nTom, in the concept and design of the policy simulation laboratory. \nWhen the lab is up and running, the private sector is expected to be an \nactive participant in its programs.\n  The policy simulation laboratory will represent, more than anything \nelse at the Coastal Institute, the vision of Tom Weaver. He conceived \nit, helped design it, and looked forward to running it as a unique \nresource for educators, businessmen, and government officials.\n  The Coastal Institute represents an extraordinary mix of scientists \nand researchers from disparate academic disciplines. As I mentioned, it \ncombines two of the greatest strengths of the university--which has an \ninternational reputation for both land grant and sea grant programs.\n  Anyone who knows of academic politics at the university level can \nimagine how difficult it must have been to forge that alliance. With \nhelp from countless friends and diplomatic guidance from colleagues, \nTom's determination was one of the forces that made it happen.\n  I have focused on Tom's work on the Coastal Institute, simply because \nI shared his enthusiasm for the academic adventure, the scientific \npossibilities, and the very real benefits that it will provide. But he \nwas a far more complex man.\n  My staff and I noticed that Tom, who always kept his eye on the goal, \ncould be stunned by a well-deserved compliment. He was so busy driving \ntoward his objective and encouraging others, that he never seemed to \nnotice the excellence of his own hard work and leadership.\n  I know he will be missed by all who knew him or were touched by his \nteaching, but I hope everyone who uses the policy simulation laboratory \nwill remember him. They will be there working side by side with his \ndetermined spirit.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3270-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3270-S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACCOLADES TO LANE KIRKLAND\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Joseph Lane \nKirkland, who last summer announced he would not seek reelection as \npresident of the AFL-CIO. Lane Kirkland has been a friend since I \narrived in Washington in 1972. He and his wife, Irena, are a great \npartnership, a great team, and my wife Colleen and I have been very \nhonored to be their friends.\n  Lane Kirkland is the son of the modern South. Born in 1922 in South \nCarolina, he is the son of a cotton merchant and was raised in the \ntextile town of Camden. As a child in the 1930's, Lane Kirkland had \nclassmates who lived in mill villages and worked as sweepers in the \nmills after school. Seeing the conditions under which they lived and \nworked convinced Lane that unions were needed to protect workers. He \nheld that view and still holds that view. He certainly devoted his life \nto that view.\n  Like some of his childhood friends, Lane's wife, Irena, endured a \npainful, indeed, a traumatic and tragic ordeal early in her life. Irena \nsurvived the concentration camps of World War II, and when the \nCommunists took over her native Czechoslovakia, she was imprisoned just \nbefore she escaped the country. Irena's firsthand experience of \noppression and, indeed, terrible, terrible tragedy, deepened Lane \nKirkland's already strong concern for the freedom of people all over \nthe world. Irena has been a strong partner\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nin the Kirklands' dedicated quest for freedom of people behind the Iron \nCurtain and indeed throughout the world.\n  Upon conclusion of high school, Lane was a student at Newberry \nCollege. He later graduated from the United States Merchant Marine \nAcademy in 1942. During World War II, Lane served as a deck officer on \na number of merchant marine vessels that transported ammunition for our \ntroops on the front lines. After his service in the merchant marine, \nLane enrolled in the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.\n  Following his graduation from Georgetown in 1948, Lane began his work \nas a researcher for the American Federation of Labor and rose through \nthe ranks serving as an assistant to the late George Meany, and was \nelected as Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO in 1969. Ten years later, \nhe was elected president of the AFL-CIO, a post he held for the next 16 \nyears.\n  During Lane's almost three decades in the highest ranks of labor \nleadership, he played a critical role in unifying what he termed the \n``House of Labor.'' Under his leadership, the International Brotherhood \nof Teamsters, the United States Automobile Workers, the International \nLongshore and Warehouseman's Union of the West Coast, and the United \nMine Workers of America came back into the overall AFL-CIO fold.\n  Although I certainly did not vote for labor's legislative position as \noften as Lane would have liked, I always respected his views. He \npresented those views to Capitol Hill with courage, with conviction, \nand with honesty and integrity. Lane was tough, erudite and unwavering \nin his promotion of workers rights. Lane Kirkland never lost sight of \nthe needs of America's workers, but his concern also included workers \naround the globe, particularly those behind the Iron Curtain. Lane \nKirkland has been a stalwart advocate of human rights and he led the \nAmerican labor movement by providing critical practical help at crucial \nmoments.\n  In my view, Lane Kirkland has done as much as any living American to \nhold America to a steadfast course during the long cold war and to \nencourage freedom throughout Eastern Europe and throughout the world. \nLane was the stalwart supporter of a strong national defense. He never \nwavered in his conviction that a strong America was essential not only \nto protect America but to promote freedom across the globe.\n  Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, the defense budget, \nthe whole idea of a strong national security, was under severe attack. \nWe were coming out of the Vietnam War. We had been disillusioned by our \nparticipation in that conflict. The defense budget itself, indeed, \nAmerica's national security, was under very severe scrutiny and attack. \nLane Kirkland stood up many, many times, many times quietly but \neffectively making sure that his support for strong national security \nwas known by people on Capitol Hill. That made a big, big difference in \na period of time where our military forces needed strong voices and \ncourageous voices.\n  We need only also recall Lane's effort in the early days of the \nSolidarity movement in Poland. As an editorial in last summer's Detroit \nNews so accurately recounted:\n\n       When the trade union Solidarity bravely emerged in the \n     1980s to fight the Polish communist regime, Mr. Kirkland and \n     other labor officials smuggled money, printing presses and \n     even electronic equipment to keep the fledgling anti-\n     communist movement alive. . . . When it came time to confront \n     the gravest security threat this country has ever faced, Mr. \n     Kirkland did not flinch. He fought communism and supported \n     fledgling democratic movements that contributed to the demise \n     of many totalitarian regimes. For that effort, he deserves \n     everyone's appreciation.\n\n  Mr. President, I certainly endorse that editorial.\n  Lane Kirkland truly deserves America's appreciation. He has devoted \nhis life to improving the lives of all Americans and to extending our \ndemocratic values throughout the world. Lane Kirkland is an able and \ncourageous individual whose leadership at the head of the labor \nmovement will be sorely missed. I am confident that he will continue to \nmake a very strong national security contribution as well as a \ncontribution to the well-being of workers here in America and, indeed, \npeople all over the world. I am confident that he and Irena will \ncontinue to serve their country, the workers of America, and the cause \nof freedom in whatever they undertake. I extend my sincere thanks to \nboth the Kirklands, Lane and Irena, for their devotion to their fellow \nman, and I wish them the very best in all of their future activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3270-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3271-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE UNLIMITED SAVINGS ALLOWANCE TAX PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, much attention has been paid in recent days \nto proposals for fundamental tax reform. By fundamental tax reform, I \nmean the replacement of the current tax on individual and business \nincome with a better alternative.\n  A significant share of the debate over fundamental tax reform has \noccurred in Congress. Last year, Senator Domenici and I introduced, \nalong with Senators Kerrey and Bennett, S. 722, the unlimited savings \nallowance tax, or the USA tax. Senator Shelby and Congressman Dick \nArmey have introduced legislation proposing a flat rate tax. We have \nall heard considerable debate about that in the Presidential campaign. \nSenator Lugar and Congressman Archer have argued for a national sales \ntax. Other proposals, perhaps variations on these ideas, will appear in \nthe coming months.\n  If we are to have fundamental reform, this sort of congressional \ndebate and activity is absolutely necessary-- necessary, but not \nsufficient. The American people must be involved in this discussion, \nand the sooner the better. They must decide this matter in the long run \nbecause they and their children will live with the results.\n  None of us can be absolutely certain what our fellow Americans would \nchoose if fully aware of the various tax reform proposals now before \nthe Congress. Not enough debate has occurred for that awareness to take \nplace throughout our country, and certainly there has not been enough \npublicity giving the details and analyses of these various proposals. \nIt may be that after inspecting alternative ideas, in spite of being \nfrustrated with the existing Tax Code, Americans may decide to stick \nwith the current tax regime regardless of its serious faults. I hope \nnot.\n  But whatever the decision, one must be made. Public apathy and its \nclose relative, public cynicism, are not appropriate to the challenge \nof fundamental tax reform, which I, for one, believe is essential for \nthe Nation.\n  If citizens are to make a reasoned judgment about the merits of \nvarious proposals, they must have recourse to a set of constant \nstandards upon which to rely. This is the only commonsense approach \nthat is possible and effective, and it applies to the evaluation of tax \nreform proposals even more than to other areas.\n  When the summer Olympics comes to Atlanta this year, athletes from \nall over the world will be competing against each other and against the \nrecord book. It would really not matter if, say, the pole vault event \nwere measured in feet or in meters, provided the standard of \nmeasurement is consistently applied, and applied to all. But an athlete \nwould have every right to cry foul or unfair if his pole vaults were \nmeasured in meters while the vaults of his rivals were measured in \nfeet. The standard has to be the same. That is how you determine the \nbest.\n  So it is with tax reform. If the American people are to evaluate the \nvarying proposals that have been presented, they need us to talk with \nthem about our ideas in a way that makes those ideas readily \ncomparable. If proponents of reform and the media covering this debate \ndo not do that, then citizens will be trying to compare apples with \noranges, rather than apples with apples. I am afraid that is what has \noccurred thus far in this debate.\n  Let me offer several examples about what I mean.\n  First, for purposes of fair comparison, all tax reform proposals \nshould be designed to raise the same amount of money. That amount \nshould equal what is now raised by the part of the Tax Code that \nreformers want to replace. In other words, all the proposals should be \nrevenue neutral compared to the current code.\n  This is an important discipline. Indeed, it is a very critical \ndiscipline. Low rates are attractive. Accordingly, some reformers \nassume heroic cuts in\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nFederal spending and Federal tax requirements when they calculate their \nproposed tax rates. By doing so, they can present proposals with rock-\nbottom rates. If one proposal is going to have that advantage, then \nevery one should have that. Why not propose a 10-percent flat rate \ninstead of a 17-percent?\n  It is easy to see how we would have debate that completely obscures \nand, I think, brings no clarity to the issue if we do not have the same \nrules. This strategy is like selling a suit three times too small on \nthe assumption that the customer will lose 30 pounds. Maybe the diet \nwill work, but if it does not, or even if it is not quite as successful \nas hoped, the suit will not fit and the customer will be unhappy.\n  All of us believe that our proposals will accelerate economic growth \nand the standard of living of the American people, or we would not be \npromoting fundamental change. But if the proponents of one plan are \npermitted to use dynamic estimates even in their debate and \npresentations to the public, and the resulting lower tax rates, while \nother areas use conventional estimates and the result is higher tax \nrates, then this is not real debate. Rather, it is an exercise in \ncreative arithmetic.\n  I have long worked for reductions in Federal spending. I hope the \ncurrent budgetary impasse can be broken. We can and we should put the \nNation on a path toward a balanced budget. But this process, as I view \nit, must be separated from tax reform. It is imprudent to model a tax \nreform plan based on rosy revenue assumptions that have yet to be put \ninto place.\n  There is also the matter of what share of the tax should be collected \nfrom individuals and what share should be collected from businesses. I \nbelieve that all tax reform proposals should be modeled to collect from \nbusiness and individual revenues in the same proportion as what the \ncurrent code extracts from both.\n  There is nothing magical about that proportion. From an apples-to-\napples perspective, however, we must guard against the temptation, in \nmodeling tax reform proposals, to shift the tax burden from individuals \nto businesses, or vice versa, in order to play shell games with the \nrates. You can make a tax proposal sound very attractive if you lower \nthe individual rates dramatically and increase the rates on business. \nBut that, in my view, unless it is clearly spelled out as to why you \nare doing it and what the philosophy is and why that is going to \nimprove the lives of the American people, it makes no sense.\n  Just as all the tax reform proposals should be revenue neutral, so \ntoo should they provide enough detail to allow people a fair chance to \nassess them in their entirety. Architects of fundamental tax reform \nplans need not draw up a complete set of blueprints with every single \ndetail. The goal is to furnish enough of the foundation and framework \nto permit citizens to understand how the entire structure would \nfunction and to suggest ideas for its improvement.\n  Often when a proposal seems simple in concept, it does so because its \nadvocates have not explained how it would apply to the many economic \ntransactions that occur every day in our very complicated and complex \neconomy.\n  Transition issues are a good illustration. Replacing much of the \ncurrent code with an alternative system will entail more than just a \none-time transition cost. Over many years and using after-tax dollars, \nAmericans have amassed trillions of dollars in savings. Businesses have \ninvested trillions of dollars in plant and equipment. That has already \nbeen done.\n  If and when we move to a new tax system, what will happen to that \nsavings and investment? Some tax reformers are silent on that issue. \nDoes their silence mean that senior citizens, our best savers, will \nfind their savings taxed yet again under the new regime? Suppose \nsomebody saved all of their lives and they have $100,000 in liquid \nassets, and they are in their golden years and plan to retire. If you \npass a 20-percent sales tax and do not have a fundamental transition, \nthen you have said to that senior citizen, ``You have $100,000 which \nyou saved all your life, and you paid taxes on it. These are after-tax \ndollars, but now, as you spend that money, we are going to levy a 20-\npercent tax on everything you spend in the latter years of your life.'' \nDoes anybody really believe that is fair? Yet, those matters have not \nyet been discussed by many of the proponents of some of the plans.\n  Will businesses that invested in productivity-enhancing equipment be \npenalized for their foresight because they will be unable to amortize \nfully these investments? Is that the way we want to increase new \nproductivity, by penalizing previous modernization efforts for \nproductivity that have been made without a new code?\n  When Senator Domenici and I drafted our USA tax proposal, we devoted \nmuch of our attention to solving the transition problems. I do not \nclaim we have solved every one of them, but we have gone a long, long \nway. Under the USA tax, pre-transition savings would not be taxed and \nbusinesses would be given an opportunity to write off their previous \ninvestments.\n  Proponents of other reform plans have criticized the USA tax's \ntransition rules as overly complicated. That is easy to do if you do \nnot have any in your own proposal, and if you have not thought about \nthe results of not having any. Perhaps so; we welcome any suggestions \nfor improvement. But, to use an old poker expression, you can't beat \nsomething with nothing. Proposals for fundamental tax reform that do \nnot address transition are not simple--they are simplistic because they \nare not complete. They have avoided the hard questions and the hard \nwork which are essential for meaningful tax reform.\n\n  Transition is only one of the many details that require elaboration. \nFarmers must know how tax reform proposals will treat cooperatives. \nBankers and insurance companies will ask how financial and service \norganizations are to be taxed. When you give them an answer and you \nhave not really thought about that, and you say, ``Well, we will have \nto have a transition rule,'' that means your proposal is going to get \nmore complicated and more complex. That is inevitable. But when you \nhave not thought about these issues, it makes comparisons for the \npublic--and even for the news media people who follow it on a regular \nbasis--almost impossible.\n  Wage earners will wonder if fundamental tax reform will address the \nvery regressive payroll tax, which is one of our most regressive taxes \nand is one of the reasons why our American average working person has \nbeen hit so hard in the 1980's and even in the 1990's while people get \nup and talk about the overall rates having come down. Yes, income tax \nrates have come down. Of course, they came back up again 2 years ago. \nBut they have come down substantially when measured over the last 10 or \n12 years--very substantially. But guess what has happened during the \nsame time? The Social Security tax, which has more effect on many of \nour working people making lower incomes, that tax rate has gone up \ndramatically, and, therefore, many working people, during the Reagan \nyears where everybody talked about taxes going down, many working \npeople have seen their taxes go up.\n  Wage earners will not be the only ones who ask about that. There is \nnot a small business person in America who is not vitally interested in \nthe same issue because the payroll taxes for small businesses have also \ngone up dramatically in the last 10 or 15 years.\n  Advocates of fundamental tax reform must address these and many more \nmatters openly and early-on. The pass-it-now-and-fix-it-later \nphilosophy of tax legislation will not work. A lack of candor at the \nbeginning of the process invites precisely the public cynicism that now \nsurrounds the current Tax Code.\n  This issue of candor and thoroughness brings me to the final and most \nimportant apples-to-apples issue. Those of us calling for fundamental \nchange must explain why we think the Nation should embark upon such a \nlarge project. Only by knowing our motives and why we think change \nneeds to be made can citizens evaluate fairly whether our plans are \nlikely to succeed.\n  My own sense is that the authors of the various tax reform plans have \nmany goals in common. Those goals have little to do with tax rates and \neven allowable deductions. I am not\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nsaying tax rates and deductions are unimportant. They are of course \nimportant. But changing the tax rates or altering the number of \ndeductions does not require fundamental reform.\n  In 1986, Congress lowered tax rates and eliminated certain deductions \nwithout replacing the Tax Code. If it so chooses, Congress could today \nenact a flat or single rate individual income tax with minimal \ntinkering with the rest of the tax system. As a matter of fact, while \nSenator Domenici and I have offered a fundamental tax reform plan with \na progressive rate structure, we could easily adapt our proposal to a \nflat rate system if citizens so demanded without changing our essential \npurpose.\n  Mr. President, the debate on flat tax loses a great deal in terms of \nthe understanding that is required. You could take the current Tax Code \nwith all of its headaches, with all of its deductions, with all of its \ncomplexities, with all of its perceived unfairness, and you could apply \na national flat income tax rate to the current code. It is just a \nmatter of arithmetic. You take the amount you need to produce a break-\neven with the current revenue today, you take the rate that would be \nrequired to apply to the taxable income, and you apply it. Instead of \nhaving four, five, or six individual income tax rates, you could have \none. That could be done in just a few hours. You could have a national \nflat tax rate with the current code. But you would not have solved the \nproblem that is frustrating the American people in terms of complexity, \nunfairness, and the problem that bothers so many of us because you \nwould not have changed the basic disincentives to save and invest which \nare required if we are going to increase productivity and if we are \ngoing to increase the average income for our American citizens.\n\n  Our essential purpose is to change what we tax. This is true for the \nflat tax and the national sales tax as well as the USA tax and all the \nother proposals based on these models.\n  All of these plans aim to correct the bias in the current code \nagainst saving and investment. Marginal changes in the Tax Code cannot \neliminate that bias. It is ingrained in our current system. If you want \nto remove the bias in the tax base, you have to replace large parts of \nthe code.\n  What do we mean by bias some ask? Here is a simple example. If you \ntake $200 and buy a television set, you are not again taxed for \nwhatever enjoyment or enlightenment you may receive by watching it. If, \nhowever, you take that $200 and put it in a college savings account for \nyour children to go to school, all the interest you earn is subject to \ntax.\n  The act of consumption--using the $200 to purchase a television set--\nis taxed once, as income. The act of saving--putting the $200 away for \nfuture education expenses--is taxed twice. The original $200 has \nalready been taxed as income. The returns to that $200, in this case, \ninterest, is taxed again. Saving $200 for tomorrow is more expensive \nthan consuming it today.\n  So we have an inherent bias built into our tax system that tilts us \ntoward consumption and away from savings and, therefore, away from \ninvestment, productivity, and a higher growth standard with higher \nincome.\n  Millions of middle-class Americans own stock or shares in mutual \nfunds that own stock. They rely on this saving for retirement, health \ncare, and other future expenses.\n  I wonder if most realize how double taxation reduces the return on \ntheir investments. Because our tax law regards corporations and their \ninvestors as separate entities, it taxes corporate earnings twice: once \nas corporate income and again as dividends received by individuals. In \ncontrast, because corporations may deduct interest payments if they \nborrow, holders of corporate bonds are not penalized by double \ntaxation.\n  The current Tax Code says to citizens: faced with a choice between \nbuying today or saving so that you can buy more tomorrow, then you \nshould buy now. It says to corporations: faced with the choice of \nbuilding a strong foundation through equity financing or borrowing to \nthe hilt, borrow to the hilt.\n  This bias against saving is a bias against our future. We see its \ncrippling influences in our economic data. The saving rate in this \ncountry is at historically low levels. Because our savings are low, our \ninvestment has been correspondingly low. Continued low saving \ninescapably means continued low investment. Low levels of investment \nmean low productivity gains. Low productivity gains means stagnant \nwages and, therefore, little or no growth in our standard of living. We \nhave been on this treadmill for long enough--too long.\n  All of the major proposals for fundamental tax reform--the national \nsales tax, the flat tax, and the USA tax of Senator Domenici and \nmyself--would rid the Tax Code of its bias against saving. That is \ntheir central, core characteristic. While we debate the differences, \nthis core characteristic should not be overlooked. It is this focus \nupon the tax base that distinguishes fundamental reform from the \nincremental changes of previous years.\n  Although many of the details of the national sales tax proposal \nremain sketchy, its basic mechanism is familiar to most Americans. The \nsales tax is paid on purchases. Saving remains untaxed until spent. In \ntheory, every dollar of wages or salary is taxed once and only once at \nthe point of consumption.\n  The flat tax would be administered in much the same way as the \ncurrent income tax. The key difference is that capital income--that is, \nmoney earned as the result of saving and investment--is not taxed at \nthe individual level.\n  For example, citizens would not be taxed on interest earned on a bank \nsavings account. Nor would they be taxed on income from dividends, \ninterest on corporate paper, or capital gains. Corporate income would \nstill be taxed at the corporate level; by not taxing it again at the \nindividual level there would be no double taxation. While I certainly \nunderstand the theory behind this proposal, I would have a hard time \never explaining why the wealthy owner of a yacht living off of \ninvestment income would have to pull up to shore to let his captain off \nto file an income tax return each April 15 while the owner remains on-\nboard watching television and playing cards.\n  That is a burden I do not want to assume. So the theory has validity, \nbut the application seems to be, and I think would be perceived to be, \nvery unfair.\n  Senator Domenici and I took another tack. Like the flat tax, our USA \ntax proposal is administratively similar to the current income tax. \nSome people, of course, do not like that. But our method for relieving \nthe current code's burden on savings and investment departs in \nconsiderable and very significant degree from the flat-tax approach.\n\n  A major, perhaps insuperable, problem with the flat tax is the \nfailure to treat all income alike. An individual with only wage income \nwould file a tax return while his neighbor, with only capital income, \nwould not.\n  Now, it is true that the capital income would already have been taxed \nat the business level. Dividends, for example, would have been taxed at \nthe business level as corporate income, but I am afraid that would be \nfar from obvious to the wage-earning neighbor. Such a lack of clarity \nwould inevitably lead to a lack of public confidence.\n  When we designed the USA tax, we wanted to make the proposal as \nunderstandable and fair as possible so we chose to avoid the complex \nand confusing distinction between wage and capital income.\n  The USA tax is indifferent to the source of income. It is concerned \nwith how the income is used. In every taxable year, the amount of money \na taxpayer chooses to save would not be taxed. The taxpayer would be \ntaxed only on the amount he or she spent during the year. This removes \nthe double taxation of savings. Note, too, that no dollar ever escapes \ntaxation. Over a lifetime, every dollar would be taxed once and only \nonce in the year it was spent.\n  The USA tax grants to all America a power that today is reserved only \nfor the wealthy: the ability to lower their tax obligations. Exercising \nthat power does not require an army of tax lawyers to ferret out \nloopholes in the tax system. Merely by saving, taxpayers can reduce how \nmuch of their wages is subject to tax in any given year.\n  Under the USA tax, everyone will have the tools to take greater \neconomic responsibility for themselves\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\nand for their families. At a time when we must moderate the growth of \nentitlement programs, this sort of change, I believe, is absolutely \nessential.\n  I know that many of us in America do not think we can afford to save. \nMy response is that we have no real choice. Savings must become a \ngreater priority in every household budget, just as it must in the \nFederal budget by lowering the deficit. It is Government's \nresponsibility to help our citizens by providing a tax code that does \nnot penalize them when they try to do what is best for their future and \nfor their children's future.\n  Mr. President, I believe the U.S.A. tax offers a superior path to \nfundamental tax reform. Its savings deduction is understandable and \nequitable. Those who take the time to acquaint themselves with our \nlegislation--which we tried to write in plain English in the hope that \nAmericans will read it--will also see how the U.S.A. tax would simplify \nboth the business and individual tax; encourage American exports by \noffering a tax rebate on sales or exports from this country; it would \ninclude vital deductions for education, charitable giving and retain \nthe home mortgage interest deduction; and it would provide taxpayers \nand businesses with a credit for the payroll tax they must pay, which \nis enormously important to our small business community and, most of \nall, to our average working people.\n  Ultimately, however, neither Senator Domenici nor I see ourselves in \nsome sort of fundamental win-or-lose conflict with advocates of the \nflat tax or a national sales tax. Fundamental tax reform must be a \ncollaborative process. There are tremendous forces in favor of keeping \nthe Tax Code as it is. They are already well along in their job of \nscuttling change. We assist these defendants of the status quo when we \nfocus only on our differences and neglect what we have in common.\n  For all the conferences, column inches, research reports, and \nspeeches devoted to fundamental tax reform over the last year or so, \nthe truth of it is that those of us who want fundamental change stand \nat the beginning of a very long road. We must begin to travel that road \ntogether. We have to speak with the American people regarding what is \nreally at stake in fundamental reform. We must solicit their views \nrather than stir up their passions. We must challenge our critics to \nhelp improve our work, and when we offer proposals for reform, we must \nemploy similar revenue estimates and provide a comparable degree of \ndetail about what we wish to do. We must begin to make apples-to-apples \ncomparisons if people are going to be able to understand the debate and \nparticipate in it. Then and only then can the people of America decide, \nand the people will have to decide in the long run.\n\n  As we enter the Presidential election cycle, it is evident that the \nAmerican people are restive and uncertain about our collective future. \nThey wonder about which direction our country should take.\n  At another time of great national uncertainty, Abraham Lincoln \noffered some very practical advice. Quoting him, ``If we could first \nknow where we are and whither we are tending, we could then better \njudge what to do and how to do it.''\n  Those of us who believe that fundamental changes in the Tax Code are \none important element, a very important element, in getting the \ncountry's house in order should heed Lincoln's advice. Let us work \ntogether to encourage a public understanding of where we are \neconomically and how our current Tax Code constrains us and prevents us \nfrom fulfilling the American dream of a better life for all of our \ncitizens. If we can do that, we may safely leave it to the public to \njudge what to do and how to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before I proceed with my remarks, let me just offer my \nthanks and appreciation to my dear friend and colleague from Georgia \nfor the statement he has made, for the leadership he has given on this \nissue. He is known best, I suppose, for the extraordinary leadership he \nhas given on matters of national security now for more than two decades \nin the Senate, but he has been a courageous leader in other areas, \nincluding this one of tax reform. It reminds us about why we will miss \nhim next year and why I hope he will continue to push us in the \ndirection of reform from the private sector. I thank my friend for his \nsuperb words.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3271-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3274-S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMERCE SECRETARY RONALD H. BROWN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as we return to session today, it is \nspring in Washington. The blossoms are out. It is a beautiful time, and \nyet I am sure the experience I had in returning with my family \nyesterday was comparable with others coming back to Washington; it \nbrought home the terrible tragedy that occurred while we were away, \nthat of the plane going down in Croatia carrying Secretary of Commerce \nRon Brown and so many others, including two corporate executives from \nConnecticut, Claudio Elia and Bob Donovan. And coming back here to this \ncity, where many of us came to know Secretary Brown, filled me with a \nsadness and a sense of loss yesterday and today.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and share with my colleagues just a few \nthoughts about Ron Brown. I hope someday in the not too distant future \nto be able to offer to my colleagues some comments, if they did not \nhave the opportunity to know them, about Bob Donovan and Claudio Elia, \nwhose service to our country was extraordinary.\n  Today, however, I wanted to speak about Ron Brown. I am proud that I \nhad the chance to work with Ron Brown during his all too short tenure \nat the Commerce Department. I tremendously enjoyed working with Ron \nBrown in his various capacities as a private attorney, as a leading \nDemocratic activist, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, \nand most closely and I think most creatively in this last period of \nyears as Secretary of Commerce. I am honored that I can call him a \nfriend. We are all going to miss him--it's painful to think that my \nstaff and I won't have the sheer fun of working with him again--and the \ncountry will miss him even more. I have the greatest respect for him, \nas have so many others, as a wonderful, warm human being and as a \nleader who had a clear-eyed vision of how to make our people and our \ncountry better.\n  This is a case which is so often true where you interconnect with a \nperson in a professional capacity, but you never think of a man in the \nprime of life not being here. In a way, I suppose it is death that \nmakes you appreciate even more the great skills and the enormous \nservice that this individual, Ron Brown, displayed for our benefit.\n  Ron Brown, it seemed to me, truly loved the job he had at Commerce. \nHe always managed to fit well, wherever he was, and this job really did \nfit him like a glove, from the moment he took it. He had an early \nunderstanding that the mission of the Department of Commerce was to \npromote economic growth, that is job creation. He understood from his \nown experience the wide-open nature of our market system and that it \nwas the unique way America had for creating opportunity for its \ncitizens--the market, upward mobility.\n  Ron Brown never saw the business community as an enemy, he saw it as \nan ally in expanding opportunity, and he threw himself into this job \nwith a single-mindedness and joyous commitment to forcing the system, \nthe economic system, to deliver for all Americans.\n  Against this background, I want to talk about two areas of his time \nat Commerce that I think was so critically important. I believe that \nthey were truly extraordinary, and set a new performance standard for \nour government's relationship with the private sector.\n\n\n                                Exports\n\n  The first has been written about extensively in the last days since \nhis death, and even some over the preceding three years: The incredible \nexport promotion operation he put together at Commerce. But I do not \nthink that enough has been said about why that was so important.\n  Until the mid-1970's, the U.S. economy was on top of the world, \ndominating it. While our economic rivals, led\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nparticularly by Japan, were figuring out that selling advanced \nmanufactured goods for export was the key to economic growth and \nraising the living standards of people back home, our Government in a \nway was coasting on our success. We were not paying attention to that \nmessage.\n  Other countries built export promotion machines--and they were \nmachines--through the most intimate and comprehensive alliances between \nbusiness and government, the private sector and the public sector. But \nthe truth is that our Government paid too little attention to that need \nto build those alliances. American businesses--and I would hear this \nrepeatedly from business executives in Connecticut--would go abroad to \ncompete, and they would see what the business-government alliances of \nour competitors were doing for export promotion.\n  I remember being told a story by the executive of one of the \ncompanies in Connecticut, telling me that they were competing against \ntwo other companies, one from Asia and one from Europe, for a very \nlarge job in a foreign country. They went over there to participate in \nsimultaneous bidding among the three business competitors. This company \nfrom Connecticut, a big company, had its executives and lawyers in one \nroom. But in the other two rooms, the executives and representatives of \nthe Asian company and of the European company were teamed up with a \nrepresentative of the Asian government and of the European government, \nrespectively. In that case, the Connecticut company did not get the \ncontract. We lost some opportunity and jobs.\n  The State Department, I am afraid, continued to treat American \nbusiness as if it had to be held at arm's length. Too many \nadministrations went along with that distant attitude. Preoccupied with \nthe end of the cold war and retaining the political alliances required \nfor it, the State Department embraced a traditional and outmoded notion \nof what foreign policy was all about, what mattered to people here at \nhome. Too often they missed what was happening in the world economy and \nthe American economy which has been a grave error. They made export \npromotion a low priority, while our rivals made it the top priority. \nThe State Department treated U.S. business like pariahs, it was \n``Upstairs-Downstairs''--trade was beneath our diplomatic priorities.\n  This hasn't ended. A Business Week editorial this week notes that, \n``The U.S. foreign policy and security elite believe security should be \ndivorced from economic issues. Some go so far as to suggest that \nproviding security is a perk of global power.'' It concludes, ``We \ndon't. American workers can't be expected to suffer economically to \nprotect [other nations] from one another.'' Ron Brown shared this view, \nand he was the new momentum for bringing our economy into foreign \nrelations. The President was his staunch ally on this effort, and \nhelped him force change in this area.\n\n  Ron Brown, working together with President Clinton, understood that \nthey had to create a central position in our foreign policy for our \neconomic policy. Export promotion had to be at the core of our \ninternational outreach; that it was not a bad thing, but in fact it was \na very good thing, that if a President visited a foreign country with \nthe Secretary of Commerce and one of the items they discussed with the \nleadership of that foreign country was buying American goods.\n  I come from a very export-oriented State. In fact, it has the highest \nlevel of exports per capita of any State in the country. We know that \nexports create jobs, high-paying manufacturing jobs, and that each \nmanufacturing job has an economic multiplier effect, creating a chain \nof goods and services behind it, longer by far than most other types of \njobs.\n  The sad fact is that we have been disinvesting in manufacturing since \nthe mid-1970's, even though we need those kinds of jobs more than ever \nto develop a strong economy and a better standard of living for our \npeople which will continue America as the land of opportunity. Ron \nBrown, as Secretary of Commerce, understood this from the beginning of \nhis service.\n  When he began his export promotion effort, within days of arriving at \nthe Commerce Department, the leaders of the American business community \nthat I spoke to--and I particularly heard this from heads of firms in \nConnecticut--were in disbelief. Someone was finally paying attention to \ntheir priorities. Somebody was finally trying to help them pull \ntogether an American governmental countermovement to the vast efforts \nrival countries and their businesses had been mounting for decades, to \ntake jobs and exports away from us. Finally, someone with real power, \nthe Secretary of Commerce, understood the problem. The fact is, at the \nbeginning a lot of folks in the business community were skeptical that \nRon Brown could make this all happen.\n  But he proved them wrong, to their delight. He was great at this. \nTrained as a lawyer and always a superb advocate, he used those skills \non behalf of American businesses throughout the world. He knew how to \nrun campaigns, and he ran this export operation like a campaign, which \nis exactly how it was. Nobody had ever done this before in the way that \nSecretary Brown did, and our country has never benefited as much before \nas we did from his service.\n  He even set up, in the Commerce Department, something like a campaign \n``war room,'' where he would get reports on economic opportunities \nopening up to sell American products and create American jobs--an early \nwarning system. Then the letters and the phone calls would start \nflying--Ron Brown was a phone wizard, it was a technology invented for \nhim, he was forever reaching out to touch some business leader or a \nhead of state abroad. Then following those calls with visits, such as \nthe one he was on when his life on Earth ended. He was so enormously \nskilled, he was so hard working, he was absolutely and irresistibly \nlikable, he had such a great smiling charm, such sharp intelligence, he \nwas such fun, he had such energy.\n  The customers loved his performance. They all knew he spoke directly \nfor and to the President of the United States, and that he would relay \ntheir messages back to the White House. Even our friends in Japan, who \nhave systematically been denying entry for too many U.S. products for \ntoo long, liked him, as Ron Brown worked very hard at breaking down the \nbarriers.\n  U.S. business strongly appreciated his commitment to them, an \nenormous accomplishment. He was a terrific political operator in the \nvery best sense of this phrase--he was mobilizing the political system \nto serve the public's needs. The business community uncderstood this \nand respected it deeply--I've heard this again and again from U.S. \ncompanies. Ron Brown was a new kind of life force to them and they had \ngreat affection for him.\n\n  Ron Brown and his team's export success was only beginning when he \nleft us, because the historical changes he was starting are a long-term \nproject. But this new direction was a very important accomplishment for \nAmerica. A major job for Secretaries of Commerce from now on will be to \npromote U.S. goods, not just on the offhanded, random way of the past, \nbut with all the force of Ron Brown's campaigns, or they will be judged \nfailures. From now on, the Federal Government is going to have to get \ndown and get to work with business selling our economy. It's about \ntime, but it took Ron Brown to show us how to do it. Ron Brown has set \nan entirely new standard for the country by which all that come after \nhim will be judged.\n\n\n                               Innovation\n\n  A second remarkable thing he did as Commerce Secretary was to fight \nfor innovation. This has been almost nowhere mentioned in the press, \nand it is not well understood by the public or the fourth estate or \nCongress. But Ron Brown understood that for the American dream of \nopportunity to be sustained for a new generation, a higher level of \neconomic growth was crucial. In addition to exports, he concentrated on \nanother ingredient of that strategy: innovation. Even before he was \nsworn in as Commerce Secretary, his friend George Fisher, then \npresident of Motorola and now of Kodak, invited him to speak to a \nleading group of business thinkers, the Council on Competitiveness. Ron \nBrown set out in that speech an aggressive agenda of technology \ndevelopment and promotion. He recognized that innovation has been the \ngreat American competitive advantage for generations, that it is now \nunder attack as our competitors expand, and that it has to be renewed \nif we are\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\ngoing to keep expanding our economy. Economists estimate that \ntechnology development--coupled with a technologically trained work \nforce--has accounted for 80 percent of the increase in U.S. \nproductivity and wealth for most of this century.\n  Innovation is our bread and butter.\n  Brown understood that since the Second World War, the Federal \nGovernment has backed most of the long-term research and development \nand applied R that has gone on in the United States, while business \nfocused on shorter term product development. That is an economic \nreality--the risk and cost of R means that the private sector must \nfocus on what it can raise capital for--shorter term products. It is a \nclassic market failure problem, and until recently Congress on a \nbipartisan basis has supported the need for governmental support of \ninnovation. Brown picked up a series of small technology and technology \nextension programs that had been quietly started at Commerce in \nprevious administrations, and made them a central focus. With an able \nteam around him, he made the Commerce Department the administration's \nleader in civilian technology development, and supported a new system \nof cooperative R development with business, requiring business to \nmatch Federal funding to ensure sounder Government R investments and \nleveraging Federal research dollars. He also helped expand a new system \nof manufacturing extension centers around the country, now in over 30 \nStates, to bring advanced manufacturing techniques and technology to \nsmaller and mid-sized manufacturers desperately in need of it to be \nable to compete with global competitors. In a time of budget cutting, \nhe successfully found the resources to build these programs. He was \nalso head of the administration's information infrastructure task \nforce, formulating policies on the new information highway and how to \nexpand our population's access to it.\n  He was a true innovation supporter, and was moving quickly toward \nmaking the Commerce Department what it long should have been: a \ndepartment for trade and technology, where each of these two sides of \nthe department provides synergy for the other. It was becoming an \nagency which provided governmental leadership in these two areas in \nsupport of the private sector, not trying to dominate it, and much \nstronger because of this.\n\n  Ron Brown's clear success, of course, led to the usual Washington \npolitical reaction against signs of creativity. Unfortunately, for too \nmuch of this past year he had to spend time deftly deflecting attacks \non the existence of the Commerce Department. But he had helped make it \ninto an instrument for growth and job creation, and his efforts had \nstrong support among business and work force constituencies. He had \nbegun the process to put the Commerce Department on the map as a unique \nAmerican engine to support opportunity and growth in America. He had a \ngreat dream for his agency, and I respect that dream very much. I, for \none, pledge to him that I am not going to sit here in this body and let \nit get dismantled.\n  All around this city of Washington are statues of Union Army \ngenerals. This is a good thing--they remind us of the crisis the Civil \nWar represented to our country's future, of the great wave of sacrifice \nrequired thirteen decades ago to keep this country intact and to \nadvance the freedoms it stands for. Now we are engaged in a different \nkind of conflict, a global economic conflict. There are no particular \nenemies in this conflict, at most we have rivals, not enemies, although \nin some ways the real enemy is ourselves because we have not yet been \nable to mobilize to confront our problems. This new conflict will test \nwhether the great American dream of opportunity, of economic growth \nthat will allow all our citizens to grow, will endure for future \ngenerations. Someday, if we are successful in keeping our opportunity \ndream alive, we should think about putting up some statues of the men \nand women in the private and public sectors who are the new generals, \nnew kinds of heros, of that conflict. Ron Brown's statue should be one \nof the first we erect.\n\n\n                                Barriers\n\n  I have discussed his innovative role at Commerce, but I want to say \nsomething about barriers, too. Occasionally, I think about how Chuck \nYeager felt piloting his X-1 rocket plane when he was the first to \nbreak the sound barrier. Ron Brown was a great barrier-breaker, too, \nour first African-American to achieve many things. While Chuck Yeager's \ncourage enabled him to break his barrier, the sound barrier remained \nand had to be broken again by countless additional pilots. Ron Brown's \nbarrier breaking style was a little different. It also required \ncourage, but he had a way of breaking barriers that began to erase \nthem. He would get through a barrier in his wonderful, excited, buoyant \nway, and he would make everyone who watched him think, there goes \nanother one, and why didn't we do that long ago? When Ron Brown became \nCommerce Secretary, many were expecting the President to name an \nexperienced business leader, and were appalled when he named a friend \nand politician. Big business has long been a barrier for African-\nAmericans, but Ron Brown's outstanding performance as Commerce \nSecretary, and the depth of support he built in the business community, \nwas unlike anything any Commerce Secretary has been able to do before. \nWe watched and thought, there he goes through another barrier, the \nbiggest he had ever faced.\n  In so doing, Ron Brown broke an even bigger barrier. America has been \nblessed with a long line of outstanding African-American leaders. In \nthe past, those leaders typically have been leaders of the African-\nAmerican community, and that has been very important for the country, \ntoo, and we need many more. Ron Brown well-remembered and was intensely \nloyal to his African-American roots, but, like Colin Powell, he was \nalso a national leader, who was clearly understood, in his great \nenergetic way, to be battling for the well-being of every American. \nThat is a new, promising thing in America, it is a strong new step down \nour country's freedom road.\n  Mr. President, he led this effort to take some small, relatively \nunknown program in the Commerce Department--the Advanced Technology \nProgram is one--to build it into an engine for technology growth and \njob creation.\n  Much was said in the aftermath of Ron Brown's tragic death about him \nbeing a bridge builder. I say he was also a barrier breaker. I think \nsometimes about Chuck Yeager, how he felt piloting that X-1 rocket \nplane when he first broke the sound barrier.\n  Ron Brown was a breaker, too, but the thing about Yeager's \naccomplishment is that barrier has to be broken every time someone \nchooses to do it. Ron Brown broke barriers that erased them. When he \nbecame Commerce Secretary, many were expecting the Secretary to name an \nexperienced business leader. They were disappointed when he named a \nfriend and politician.\n  But Ron Brown, by his outstanding performance at Commerce and the \ndepth of support he built in the business community, broke another \nbarrier and brought with him the business community and a lot of \nAmericans.\n  Ron Brown was true to and proud of his African-American roots and the \ncommunity from which he came, but he became in his lifetime like Colin \nPowell: Not just an African-American leader, but a great American \nleader.\n  Mr. President, finally, I say this. All around our city of Washington \nare statues of our great military heroes. Now we are engaged in a \ndifferent kind of global conflict: an economic global conflict. If we \never start building statues for those generals who served as \ncourageously and with great success in the economic battles that affect \nthe quality of life and job opportunity for people in our country, we \nought to erect a statue to Ron Brown as one of the greatest of those \nleaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3276-S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Under the previous order, the \nclerk will report calendar No. 361, S. 1664.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1664) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to increase control over immigration to the United States \n     by increasing border patrol and investigative personnel and \n     detention facilities, improving the system used by employers \n     to verify citizenship\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\n     or work-authorized alien status, increasing penalties for \n     alien smuggling and document fraud, and reforming asylum, \n     exclusion, and deportation law and procedures; to reduce the \n     use of welfare by aliens; and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no amendment \nrelative to the minimum wage be in order to the immigration bill during \ntoday's session of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his superb work in this area. I \nhave not always agreed with my good friend from Utah with regard to \nimmigration issues, legal and illegal. And I say, too, to his fine \nstaff after some early misunderstandings, they have certainly been \nexcellent to work with. I appreciate that. To Senator Strom Thurmond \nwho was chairman when I started this rather unique work, always \nhelpful, always supportive, always there; to my old friend companion \nand colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who served as \nchairman of the committee when I came here in 1979, who then served as \nthe ranking member, then as chairman, then as ranking member, and it \ncertainly is much more fun having him as ranking member than as \nchairman! I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience and have the \ngreatest regard personally for him. We have worked together on these \nissues doggedly and persistently for 17 years.\n\n  It is a case of, in some ways, new players on an old field of battle. \nDuring my 17\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, I have literally spent weeks on \nthe floor of this historic Chamber debating immigration reform \nlegislation. Whether it was legislation to provide legalization for \nlong-term illegals or to prohibit the knowing employment of \nundocumented workers, legislation I sponsored and which this body \ndebated in the mid-eighties, or whether it was legislation Senator \nKennedy and I sponsored to increase immigration by nearly 40 percent in \n1990, it has always been a terribly difficult issue for all the Members \nof this body. We know that no matter how we vote on immigration issues, \nwe are going to assuredly upset and create anguish among segments of \nour constituencies.\n  But immigration policy is a critically important national issue, and \nCongress must deal with it. It is not for the States to deal with.\n  Immigration accounts for 40 percent, or more, of our population \ngrowth, which pleases some and distresses others.\n  Immigrants come here and work hard and they work cheap, which pleases \nsome and distresses others.\n  Immigrants bring cultural diversity, which pleases some and \ndistresses others.\n  And that is the nature of the immigration policy debate. Powerful, \npowerful forces tear at the country.\n  There are some members of our society who believe immigration is an \nunalloyed good. They consider it maybe something like good luck; you \nsimply cannot have too much.\n  Other segments of the population believe that immigration should be \nseverely restricted, if not eliminated altogether. They see America \nchanging in ways that they particularly--to them--do not wish to see.\n  I deeply believe that immigration is good, it is good for America, \nbut I firmly believe that this is not an eternally inevitable result. \nIt depends upon those of us in the Congress and in the other branches \nof Government to make it work. Immigration policy must be designed and \nadministered to promote the national interest or it may not have that \neffect.\n\n  So Congress created the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform in the \n1990 act. The Commission was chaired by that remarkable woman, Barbara \nJordan, a powerfully articulate and splendid woman of such great good \ncommon sense and civility and intelligence.\n  That Commission is composed of a truly impressive group of \nimmigration experts. Lawrence Fuchs, who was the executive director of \nthe Select Commission on Immigration when I started in this field, \nalong with Senator Kennedy, Senator Mathias, Senator DeConcini on that \nselect commission. The other names are people who are deeply respected \nin the United States: Michael Teitelbaum, Richard Estrada, Robert \nCharles Hill, Nelson Merced, Harold Ezell, Warren Leiden, and Bruce \nMorrison, a former Congressman.\n  That Commission had labored for more than 4 years, holding a very \nlarge number of hearings and consultations around the United States of \nAmerica, and issuing two reports--two reports--one on controlling \nillegal immigration and one on reforming legal immigration.\n\n  I have heard some people in the debate and in the country say, \n``Where did all of these disturbing ideas come from? Where did this \nissue come from, this discussion about the preference system and this \none about chain migration?'' and about a verification system, as if it \nwere all some scheme that was presented by some of the fringe elements \nof American society. Each and every one of the proposals in each and \nevery one of the bills presented has come from or out of the Select \nCommission on Immigration and Refugee Policy or the Jordan Commission.\n  They are not disturbing, they are not sinister; they are real. They \ncome from a group of people that I have just described who I think you \ncould surely say are very mainstream Americans. They are from both \nsides of the issue.\n  The Commission labored and found that--and I quote--``a properly \nregulated system of legal immigration is in the national interest of \nthe United States.'' The Commission also noted, however, that there are \nnegative impacts. It proposed a reduction--a reduction--in the total \nlevel of immigration. That is who is suggesting the reduction.\n  The Jordan Commission strongly recommended that the family \nimmigration visas go to those who are of the highest priority in order \nto promote a strong and intact ``nuclear family.'' A ``nuclear \nfamily''--would that we could have a better description than ``nuclear \nfamily''--but it is the one we think of as the tight-knit family; the \nspouse and minor children. Surely we want to be certain that we unite \nthose people, but that we also have measures adopted to ensure that \nfamily reunification does not create financial burdens on the taxpayers \nof this country.\n  I thoroughly support those findings and recommendations. I have tried \nto follow them very carefully and very honestly in the legislation that \nI have sponsored.\n  Regarding the issue of control of illegal immigration, the Commission \nreported--and I quote:\n\n       The credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a \n     simple yardstick; people who should get in, do get in--people \n     who should not get in, are kept out--and people who are \n     judged deportable are required to leave.\n\n  That seems pretty sensible, pretty darn clear, actually. Pretty \nJordan-like, I think.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report that the committee bill will \nmeasure up very well by that standard, by that yardstick. S. 1664 will \nprovide additional enforcement personnel and detention facilities. It \nwill authorize a series of pilot projects on systems to verify \neligibility to be employed and to receive public assistance. It will \nalso make improvements in both birth certificates and drivers licenses \nin order to reduce fraud.\n\n  The bill will provide additional incentives, additional investigative \nauthority, and heavier penalties for document fraud and alien \nsmuggling. It will streamline exclusion and deportation procedures. It \nwill establish special procedures to expedite the removal of criminal \naliens. There are additional enforcement-related provisions. It is a \ngood illegal immigration control bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The committee has also reported a legal immigration reform bill \nwhich, I regret to say, does not carry out the major recommendations of \nthe Commission on Immigration Reform chaired by Barbara Jordan and does \nvery little to address the problems and weaknesses in our present legal \nimmigration policy. There might have been some great expectations of \nthat at one time.\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\n  I am reminded of a story of my good friend Senator Howell Heflin, who \nis certainly wont to tell a story or two from time to time, especially \nthe ``No-tie'' Hawkins variety stories and others that I am sure we \nhave all heard from time to time and that we never tire of. At least I \ndo not. So one has to give credit when you have heard and retell a good \nstory, but you only do that once. The second time you just do not say \nanything. And the third time you claim it for yourself.\n  So the story is that this attractive elderly couple, both of whose \nspouses had passed away, were on a long airline flight together, very \nlong. They were sitting there enjoying visiting with each other. They \nwere in their late seventies. They talked about their children and \ngrandchildren and their interests and things that excited and spurred \nthem both on to a full life. And they had dinner, and they visited some \nmore. And after a highly convivial evening and long flight, they \nlanded. The lady reached over and patted the gentleman on the knee and \nsaid, ``You know, it has been wonderful. You remind me of my third \nhusband.'' And he said, ``How many have you had?'' She replied sweetly, \n``Two.'' You can think about that one when you get home. But that is \ncalled great expectations.\n  That is what was there with regard to legal immigration reform, at \nleast in accordance with what Barbara Jordan and her commission had \nreported to us.\n  Yet what we have here is something that will not solve our problems \nwith regard to legal immigration. These are the most vexing and the \nmost troubling results. These deficiencies are the ones that give rise \nto proposition 187, ladies and gentlemen. These are the omissions that \nwill see proposition 187's come to life in every single State in the \nUnion unless we ``do something'' at the Federal level. We are doing \nvery little in the area of legal immigration and badly need changes \nthere.\n\n  Then you want to observe the various proposals passed either \nincrementally or on immigration reform measures which allow States to \ndeny or impose charges for elementary and secondary public education \nfor illegal alien students. These will also be part of a very vexatious \ndebate. Do we continue to give support to the illegal community and \ndeny it to the American citizen community? That will be a good test. If \nyou want to be sure that we provide various things to mothers who are \nhere illegally, then where is the money coming from that offsets that? \nWho is paying for that? If you want to relieve in a compassionate way a \nsponsor from having to pay for the person they bring over here and we \nsometimes say we cannot do that--heavens no, for the fellow cannot \nafford that.\n  But, you see, ladies and gentlemen, you have to remember that you \ncannot bring an immigrant legally to the United States unless the \nsponsor agrees, and also the immigrant, that they will not become ``a \npublic charge.'' That has been on our books since 1882--1882.\n  This bill, these bills, tighten that singular requirement in an \nexcellent way. We do say now that the affidavit of support has teeth \nand, indeed it does. That is a very excellent step. What we find in at \nleast half a dozen or more States of our Union --and yet we just cannot \nsay that is for six States alone to deal with; or that we do not need \nto do a national bill; no, that would be a true flight from reality. In \nhalf a dozen or more States, current high levels of immigration are \nperceived as causing, rightly or wrongly, some very serious social and \ngovernmental problems.\n  Do they take more out than they put in? Do they leave more in than \nthey take out? Well, it depends on what side you are on. Do they pull \ntheir share? Do they really take the jobs Americans do not want, or \nwith millions lesser employed in the United States, and having done a \nwelfare reform bill, will there not be many people looking for work--\nall questions that will never go away, ever.\n\n  We are informed that in the California public school system subjects \nare taught in 100 different foreign languages. California must \nconstruct a new school building every day to keep up with immigrant \nstudent enrollment. It is not only illegal immigration, which is about \n300,000 entries a year, but also our historically high level of legal \nimmigration, about 1 million a year in the current years, that have \ngiven credence and impetus to the widespread view that immigration is \nout of control--perhaps even more tragically, beyond our control.\n  I do sincerely believe that if Congress fails to act to address these \nvery real and reasonable concerns of the American people, there is a \nvery strong possibility--and we have all been warned about this by the \nselect commission, and by the Jordan Commission--we will lose our \ntraditionally generous immigration policy. The American people will \ndemand a halt to all immigration. They will not stand still for the \nCongress-knows-best approach, as some would have us take this route on \nthis burning issue.\n  For these and other reasons, I will, at an appropriate time, offer an \namendment to provide a modest, temporary reduction in legal \nimmigration. It matters not one whit to me what the vote is on that, \nbut we will vote on that issue. It will attempt to reduce immigration \nto a level approximately 10 percent below current level and hold it at \nthat level for 5 years--a breathing space, if you will. For the first \ntime in more than 50 years, there will be no increase in legal \nimmigration over a 5-year period. At the end of the 5 years, the \nnumbers and the priority system will return to exactly what they are \nunder the present law--no change, back to business as usual.\n  During this 5-year breathing space, the visas will go first to the \nclosest of family members of citizens of the United States of America. \nThey will go first to citizens. Then they will go to the closest family \nmembers of permanent resident aliens, and then to other immigrants. Any \nthat remain will fall down logically to the lowest priority of family \nimmigrants. We can expect many amendments and several days of debate \nand much disagreement, but despite the emotion, fear, guilt, and racism \nthat is involved in the immigration issue, we have always--\nhistorically, at least--had a good, clean, honest, civil debate on \nimmigration in this body. I trust it will be no different this week.\n  Republicans will disagree among themselves, I can assure you. \nDemocrats will disagree among themselves, I assure you. I will have \nserious disagreements with my friend Ted Kennedy, and my friend, \nSenator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, who is a fine addition to this \nbody and adds greatly to the debate of this issue. This is not and \nnever should be and never has been a partisan issue. Anyone taking it \nto that level is making a serious mistake. You will find that in the \nrollcall votes. There is no partisanship involved in immigration \nreform.\n\n  I want to commend the new members of the Judiciary Committee and the \nsubcommittee of both parties, Senators Kyl, Feinstein, Abraham, DeWine, \nFeingold, and Thompson. They bring a special vigor, intelligence, \nenergy, and passion to the game. I like that.\n  Just a couple of things, and then we will go forward and proceed with \nour work. I want everyone to be aware of the usual fare that will be \npresented as the menu is spread before the Senate in this debate. \nFirst, the Statue of Liberty--that will always be a rather thorough, \nimpressive, rich debate, but we are not talking about the Statue of \nLiberty, because the words of Emma Lazarus, do not say on the base, \n``Send us everybody you have, legally or illegally.'' That is not what \nit says. We hear that. I hope the American people can hear that one and \nremember that we are seeing in this country groups of people who are in \nenclaves where they never learn or speak any other language. They are \nin New York, they are in San Francisco, they are in Los Angeles. We \nread about those things daily. That will not be improved by doing \nnothing.\n  Then we will hear--this is always a rich tapestry in itself--that we \nare all children and grandchildren of immigrants. We will all hear \nthat. I can tell my story and everybody in this Chamber can tell \ntheirs. We are not talking about that. We are not talking about \npopulating a country and settling the West. We are talking about people \nin the United States who are brooding about illegals in their midst and \nshow it in every poll, and then show it at the polls.\n  We had a man running for the Presidency of the United States who, \nperhaps if he were in the race, would pick\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\nup 17 to 20 percent of the vote based on a lashing out about \nimmigration or a move toward xenophobia, just as has happened in \nGermany, with a person receiving 17 to 20 percent of the vote, or in \nFrance, with another man with such views garnering 17 percent to 20 \npercent of the vote. Those things are out there. There is no question \nabout them being out there.\n  My grandfather came here from Holland. His parents died at the age of \n6. He was orphaned. He was a ragamuffin in the streets of Chicago with \na tin cup, as far as I can find. Every one of us can tell that kind of \nstory. Then he went to work as a clerk for the railroad, and he went \nwest. Horace Greeley was right, ``Go West, young man.'' He did. He not \nonly ended up working on the railroad, he ended up running and owning a \ncoal mine in a little town named Kooi, WY--named after him. He was, in \nevery sense, an American success. He died a very happy man after giving \nbirth to my mother, and assuring the wonderful heritage I have. We can \nall tell those stories, and we can go on to the Irish relatives, the \nGerman relatives. All of us can tell these stories--the stories of \npersecution, the stories of horror, the stories of pogroms. Those are \nreal. Those are stories of inspiration of which we can take--I think we \nshall call ``judicial notice.''\n\n  One other thing we should take judicial notice of, we are the most \ngenerous country on Earth. I have heard the phrase, ``why, why would we \nturn inward? What are we doing?'' What is American about that? Mr. \nPresident, we take more refugees in than all the rest of the world \ncombined. We take in more immigrants than all of the rest of the world \ncombined--combined. All immigrants, refugees, the whole spectrum.\n  Then we will see on the menu, passionate words about some national ID \ncard, which has never escaped the menu, as far as I have ever known in \nmy 17 years here. Some have played that card with a better look at a \npoker hand than any I can remember. I remember particularly a \nCongressman from California who was certainly vigorous in his pursuit \nof his feelings and the depth of his internalization of that. We have \nnever talked about a national ID card in the entire time I have been \nworking on this issue. I have put it in every single bill, that there \nwould not be a national ID card, under no circumstances. Yet, I still \nhear it bandied about.\n  In fact, one group of worthies has even spread a curious little \npacket about which describes the Smith-Simpson bar code tattoo, which \nis certainly a grisly looking thing. But that chap must, I think, keep \nhis day job, for he has wasted a lot of energy to try to put that kind \nof tilt on what we are trying to do.\n  We all know why employer sanctions did not work in the 1986 bill. \nEmployer sanctions did not work because so many engaged into a cottage \nindustry of making phony documents. We have employer sanctions but we \ndid not want to put the burden on the employer. So we said, whatever \ndocument you are shown, the employer, cannot be responsible for the \nvalidity of it. So they just took them. I always love to explain my own \nhere because it costs 100 bucks. We picked it up on the streets of Los \nAngeles. Alan Kooi Simpson, Turlock, CA, a very distinguished person of \nless than hirsute appearance reflected here on the card. And here is my \nphony Social Security card. I do not know what other poor soul shares \nthe same number with me--maybe none. But that is why nothing worked. \nThat is why, in this bill, something will work.\n  I think we will keep those provisions--I hope so--because we are not \ntalking about national tattoos. We are not talking about Nazi Germany. \nWe are not talking about an error-filled national data base. We are not \ntalking about a mess of an administration in some other agency of the \nGovernment. We are talking about ``doing something'' about illegal \nimmigration. And the oddest thing to me is that the people who seem to \nreally want to do something to illegal, undocumented people--other than \nthumb screws or the rack--as I often hear them speak, have failed to \nrealize that the one thing you can do that does work and is humane is a \nmore secure counterfeit-resistant card, or verification, or something \nlike a telephone verification, where you slide it through some kind of \nelectronic device, some type of computer link, or similar process. All \nof that can be studied under this bill in the form of pilot programs.\n  I will try to make an amendment that those pilot programs not simply \nbe authorized, but that six or seven of them be required to be looked \nat, and then ``of course'' a vote before they would ever go into \neffect. We cannot get there without this. You cannot do something with \nillegal immigration and moan and whine and shriek about it day and \nnight and not do something appropriate with some kind of counterfeit-\nresistant, tamper-resistant card, and also doing something with \nimposters who use the card and those who are gaming the system. That, I \nhope, will become a very clear fact of this debate.\n  And then I hope we do not hear too much about the ``slippery slope,'' \nbecause I have not seen any editorials about the fact that when you go \nto drop your bags at the airport, somebody asks you for a picture ID. \nIt is not even an agent of anybody, I would guess, except the airline. \nBut I have not seen any editorials that that is the first step, the \nfirst slide down the slippery slope toward a national ID. So it is with \nthe American public--at least in airline travel. I do not know what it \nis on the bus lines, but I have a hunch that not many people here ride \nthe bus lines. Maybe they do, but I wonder if they ask that there. If \nthey do or if they do not, is that the first step? Is that the slippery \nslope toward a national ID? I think people choose to hear only what \nthey will with regard to that.\n\n  Finally, we will hear about placing the burden on the employers. Why \nthe argument, ``Are we doing this to the employers of America? How can \nwe do this and make them the watchdogs of America and make them do the \nwork of a failed Federal Government?'' Fascinating. Without employers, \nwe would have no ability to administer the Internal Revenue resources, \nbecause the employer gathers up the withholding tax. I have not seen \nany editorials on that as to the burden on employers.\n  And now it is curious to me that I also saw an editorial the other \nday that said that what will happen if the bill is passed is that the \nAmerican employers will find out they will have to ask somebody whether \nthey are authorized to work. I tell you, that editorial writer has to \nhave drilling rock instead of brain, because that one is on the books \nalready. Since the 1986 bill, you have had to present to the employer \nthe fact that you had an I-9, which is a one-page form authorizing you \nto work in the United States of America. It has been on the books now \nfor 9 years. Did anybody miss that? I think not.\n  So you are going to find that that is exactly what employers already \nhave been doing. We are trying to say--and I hope we can get this in; \nwe will see--that if we go to a pilot program and the Attorney General \nfinds that it is accurate and it works, and it is reliable, you will \nthen not need to do the I-9. Skip it right there. Throw it out. But \nemployers are the core of anything we can do with regard to \nimmigration. We are trying to lessen the burden on employers.\n  The occupant of the chair cited to me a case of an employer in Alaska \nseveral years ago who asked the person in front of him for additional \ndocuments and therefore was charged with discrimination. We have \ncorrected that completely. Not only that, we do not let them ask for 29 \ndifferent documents. We have it down to six. And we say there has to be \nan intent to discriminate before you get nailed for it simply by asking \nsomeone for an additional document. And remember--I hope you can hear \nthis in the clatter of the debate--that whatever we do in the way of \nthe identifier, or more secure system, or whatever it is, will be used \nonly twice in the course of human life--when you get a job, or when you \ngo on some kind of public assistance, period. Whatever we have will not \nbe carried on the person, will not be used for law enforcement, will \nnot be any part of any other nefarious Big Brother scheme. That gets \nlost in the process along with so much that gets lost in the process. \nWhat we are trying to do is relieve the burden on employers. We think \nwe can do that.\n\n  Then we do something with birth certificates. I hope we can retain \nthat. I\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\nthink we have a good amendment which will offset the cost of that so we \ndo not make that an unfunded mandate, because the birth certificate is \nthe breeder document of the first order. You get the birth certificate \nand, with that, you go on to get the driver's license, Social Security \ncard. You can check the obituary columns and find out the death and go \nget the birth certificate. These things must be corrected.\n  Legal immigration reform is certainly not the most popular cause that \nI have been involved in in my 17\\1/2\\ years, yet I have often been \ninvolved in such causes. What we are trying to do there is simply stop \nthe phenomenon of chain migration. Chain migration is rather simple as \nyou define it. There is a preference system. Remember that if you are a \nU.S. citizen, you can bring in your spouse and minor children, and they \nare not any part of a quota system. Yet they are computed in the entire \nscope of how many come to the United States. And then you can bring in \nadult, unmarried children. And also adult, married children. And then \nwe have minor children and spouses of permanent resident aliens. Then \nwe have brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens.\n\n  What we are saying is let us take in the spouses and minor children \nfirst, and not let somebody bring in on a single-person petition 30, \n40, 50, 60, or 70 relatives--all from one U.S. citizen. That is called \n``chain migration.''\n  I commend the Jordan Commission report to those of you who wish to \nread about that phenomenon, and see whether you would ``join in'' in \ndoing something about that.\n  As I say, it is not a partisan issue. None of these tough ones will \nbe partisan issues. I am sure the Democrats will caucus, and the \nRepublicans will caucus, and we will pound each other around, and at \nthe end of it we will realize that it is the Nation's business, and \nthat it is always very difficult.\n  But one thing I want to make very clear. I note that since I will be \nexiting the Chamber at the end of this year, some will speak of this as \n``Simpson's swan song.'' This bird has never looked like a swan--\nneither me nor the legislation. It is about a corollary of legislative \nactivity that my friend from Massachusetts has learned well through the \nyears. Any time you look obsessed about a piece of legislation, you are \nhistory. I can tell you that. Yet we have come further in these two \nbills than we have in 10 years. There are people on my side in this one \nwho, if I had said those things 10 years ago, or 5, they would have run \nme out of town on a rail.\n  So we have some good things there. But I can assure you of this: Win, \nlose, or draw, up or down, I did not come here simply to have my name \nattached to immigration legislation. That is about the biggest \npolitical loser in the history of man. It never helped me get a single \nvote in three races for the U.S. Senate. In fact, people said, ``What \nare you doing? What are you up to? Forget it. It does not affect us.''\n  But it does fall upon those of us from the smaller States and \ndistricts, from areas such as Senator McCarran of Nevada, and \nRepresentative Walters of the 16th District of Pennsylvania, or Senator \nSimpson, and Mazzoli of Kentucky. The Kennedys of this body cannot \nhandle this issue; the Feinsteins of this body cannot handle this \nissue; the Wilsons--when he was here--cannot handle this issue because \ntheir constituents will not allow them to do it. Yet this is one issue, \none burning issue, that will not go away.\n  So be assured that your angular, western representative will not be \nchagrined in any sense with whatever this eventually looks like. But we \nare surely going to have a good debate. We are going to throw it all in \nthere, get it mashed around. And if I come up with a vote of 92 to 8 on \nthe losing side, that is fine with me. But we are going to have a vote, \nand we are going to have a debate. We are going to talk about things \nthat the American public is talking about. And that is, ``What are you \ngoing to do about illegal immigration so that our social systems are \nnot overwhelmed?'' And answer their question, ``You told us the first \nduty of a sovereign nation was to control its borders, and you did not \ndo it. Why? You told us that you would do things in the national \ninterest, and you did not do it. Why?'' And also watch what they do for \nthemselves. People from States that do not have any real tough \nimmigration problems at all are thinking about proposition 187 type \nlaws. And that is disturbing.\n\n  So I hope that we pay careful attention, have a good, rich debate, \nand not think of swans but maybe of turkeys, or of eagles, because \nthere is a little of each of them in all of this. There are some \nsoaring like-eagle parts in this. And there are some things that do not \nmatch any kind of other bird activity.\n  But this is one that will not go away. It seems to me it is best that \nwe address it while we are all here and in a knowledgeable, civil way, \nand I look forward to the debate. I look forward particularly to \nworking with newer members of the committee, the subcommittee, and with \nmy friend, Ted Kennedy.\n  I think it was either Henry James or William James who said, ``To do \na thing be at it.'' And we are at it. It is an election year. But \nanyone who wants to use this one for pure partisan political advantage \nis making a most serious mistake, it is much bigger than that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that legislative \nfellows Tom Perez, Bill Fleming, and Liz Schultz be granted floor \nprivileges during the debate on the immigration bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John Ratigan \nbe granted floor privileges during the pendency of S. 1664.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield for a moment to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3667\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that a balanced budget \n constitutional amendment should protect the Social Security system by \n excluding the receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds \n                            from the budget)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I understand the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wishes to give an opening statement. I appreciate \nhis indulgence. My son is having a birthday party in about 20 minutes. \nI promised I was going to be there, and I intend to keep that promise.\n  I wish to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and want to do that. \nBut before I do that, if the Senator from Massachusetts would indulge \nme for about 3 minutes, let me say that the Senator from Wyoming has \ndone extraordinary work in the Congress over these years. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming mentioned Simpson and Mazzoli. He is talking about \nhimself, Alan Simpson, and Romano Mazzoli, with whom I worked in the \nHouse of Representatives. They have left their mark on immigration and \nwill again with this legislation. Much of what the Senator from Wyoming \nhas done with respect to illegal immigration is going to be very, very \nimportant, and I commend him for his work.\n  We will have, of course, difficult amendments. But we will work \nthrough those. And I hope at the end of the day we will pass some \nlegislation that moves in this direction that will be good for this \ncountry.\n  Now that I have said nice things about the Senator from Wyoming, he \nwill probably now be upset with me for offering a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. But let me tell him that I will certainly agree to a time \nlimit that is very short. I expect tomorrow we will have a vote on \nthis.\n  The only reason I am constrained to offer this on behalf of myself, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator Hollings, Senator Ford, Senator \nConrad, and Senator Feingold is because this will be the only \nopportunity to do so prior to the majority leader bringing up a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  The majority leader has announced that he intends to take up his \nmotion to reconsider the vote by which the balanced budget amendment \nwas defeated. Some have said he will do it this week; if not this week, \nperhaps next week. Under the rules, there will\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nbe no debate on the balanced budget amendment this time around.\n  So in order to have the Senate go on record on this issue prior to \nthat, it was required that I offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. My \namendment is very simple. I will send it to the desk. It simply \nindicates:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that because Section 13301 of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act prohibits the use of the Social \n     Security trust fund surplus to offset the budget deficit, any \n     proposal for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \n     should contain a provision creating a firewall between the \n     receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds and \n     the rest of the federal budget, and that the constitutional \n     amendment should explicitly forbid using the Social Security \n     trust funds to balance the federal budget.\n  Because of the circumstances, there would have been no intervening \nopportunity to discuss this. I will offer this amendment, ask that it \nbe sent to the desk, and that it be immediately considered by the \nSenate.\n  Before the clerk reads it, let me say that I do not intend to hold up \nthe immigration bill, and I intend to agree to any reasonable short \ntime agreement. Understand that this does not relate to the underlying \nbill, but also understand that this will be the only opportunity prior \nto a vote that Senator Dole has already announced to the Senate and the \ncountry that he intends to require of us. It will be the only \nopportunity prior to that time for us to register on this question.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the immediate consideration of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Ford, Mr. Conrad, \n     and Mr. Feingold proposes an amendment numbered 3667.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON A BALANCED BUDGET \n                   CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that because Section 13301 of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act prohibits the use of the Social \n     Security trust fund surplus to offset the budget deficit, any \n     proposal for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \n     should contain a provision creating a firewall between the \n     receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds and \n     the rest of the federal budget, and that the constitutional \n     amendment should explicitly forbid using the Social Security \n     trust funds to balance the federal budget.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we begin to consider reforms in our \nNation's immigration laws, our thoughts also are with our Immigration \nCommissioner, Doris Meissner, and her children, Chris and Andy, as they \ncope with the loss of a husband and father. Chuck Meissner was serving \nably as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and he was on Secretary \nBrown's plane when it crashed in Croatia just 10 days ago. I know that \nthe thoughts and prayers of all of us in the Senate go out to the \nMeissner family during this very difficult time.\n  At the outset of this debate on immigration reform, I commend the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Senator Simpson, for his able \nleadership on this landmark legislation, as well as for his able \nleadership over many years on the many difficult issues involved in \nimmigration.\n  Senator Simpson has always approached these issues thoughtfully and \nfairly and with an open mind. He is steadfast in his commitment to what \nhe believes is best for America. And I know that all Senators of both \nparties join in expressing admiration and appreciation for his efforts.\n  As we consider immigration reform today, we must be mindful of the \nimportant role of immigration in our history and our traditions. \nImmigrants bring to this country a strong love of freedom, respect for \ndemocracy, commitment to family and community, fresh energy and ideas, \nand a strong desire to become a contributing part of this Nation.\n  As President Kennedy wrote in 1958 in his book, ``A Nation of \nImmigrants'':\n\n       There is no part of our nation that has not been touched by \n     our immigrant background. Everywhere immigrants have enriched \n     and strengthened the fabric of American life\n\n  Those ideals are widely shared and bipartisan. As President Reagan \nsaid in his final speech before leaving the White House:\n\n       We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw \n     our people--our strength--from every country and every corner \n     of the world. . . .\n       Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of \n     opportunity, we're a nation forever young, forever bursting \n     with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, \n     always leading the world to the next frontier. This quality \n     is vital to our future as a nation. If we ever closed the \n     door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon \n     be lost.\n\n  Across the years, both Republicans and Democrats have been true to \nthese ideals.\n  Three decades ago, I stood on this floor to manage one of my first \nbills, which became the Immigration Act of 1965. I believed strongly \nthen, as I do now, that one of the greatest sources of our success as a \ncountry is that we are a nation of immigrants. And I remain as \nconvinced today as I was then that immigration under our laws is as \nbeneficial and as needed in America today as it was in 1965 or at any \nother time in our history.\n  In 1965, it was clearly time for change in our immigration laws. We \neliminated the vestiges of the racist and discriminatory national \norigins quota system that had denied immigration opportunities to so \nmany for so long based on where they came from.\n  In the years since then, we have acted several times to strengthen \nand reform the immigration laws to deal with changing times, changing \nproblems, and changing circumstances.\n  Congress also passed important reforms in 1986 and 1990. In 1986, the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 set us on the course of \nremoving the job magnet for illegal immigration. That landmark law, \nsponsored by Senator Simpson, made it illegal for the first time for \nemployers to hire illegal immigrants. The reforms that we will consider \ntoday build upon that historic change in our immigration laws. And it \nlegalized the status of over 2.7 million undocumented immigrants who \nhad set down roots in America.\n  The Immigration Act of 1990--which Senator Simpson and I sponsored \ntogether--was the most sweeping reform of our immigration laws in 66 \nyears. It overhauled our laws regarding legal immigration, the bases \nfor excluding and deporting aliens, and naturalization.\n\n\n               the current problem of illegal immigration\n\n  Today, the paramount problem we face is to deal with the continuing \ncrisis of illegal immigration. As Barbara Jordan reminded us, ``We are \na country of laws. For our immigration policy to make sense, it is \nnecessary to make distinctions between those who obey the law, and \nthose who violate it.'' And that's what we must do today.\n  The Immigration Service estimates that the permanent illegal \nimmigrant population in the United States is now about 4 million, and \nthat the number increases by 300,000 each year. That number is a net \nfigure. The INS estimates that over 2 million illegal immigrants cross \nour borders each year. About half of them enter legally as tourists or \nstudents, but then stay on illegally, long after their visas have \nexpired.\n  About 1.7 million of the 2 million illegals remain only briefly in \nthis country to work or visit friends and relatives. But 300,000 stay \non as part of the remnant illegal alien population.\n  The illegal immigrants are easily exploited. They tolerate low pay \nand poor working conditions to avoid being reported to the INS. Their \npresence depresses the pay and working conditions of many other \nAmericans in the work force. They compete head-to-head in the job \nmarket with Americans just entering the work force and with working \nAmerican families struggling to make ends meet.\n  Part of the answer to this problem is the increased support in this \nbill for\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\nborder patrols in order to prevent the entry of illegal aliens.\n  But jobs are far and away the biggest magnet attracting illegal \naliens to the United States, and we cannot turn off that magnet at the \nborder. We must do more to deny jobs to those who are in the country \nunlawfully. The most realistic way to turn off the magnet is contained \nin the provisions that Senator Simpson and I sponsored which require \nthe President to develop new and better ways of identifying those who \nare eligible to work in the United States.\n  After 3 years of pilot tests, the President is required to present a \nplan to Congress for a new approach that will deny jobs to illegal \nimmigrants, will be easy for employers to use, will not cause increased \nemployment discrimination, and will protect the privacy of American \ncitizens.\n  Our provisions state clearly that this system will not involve a \nnational ID card. And our provision provides added insurance by \nrequiring that any plan the President develops must be approved by \nCongress before it can go into effect.\n\n\n                          refugees and asylum\n\n  A further goal for immigration reform is to provide safe haven for \nrefugees fleeing persecution. We should not place arbitrary caps on the \nnumber of refugees we decide to bring to the United States for \nresettlement. The Immigration Subcommittee chose instead to let this \nnumber to continue to be set annually, under the terms of the Refugee \nAct of 1980, and in cooperation with other governments. I was pleased \nto join with Senator Grassley in addressing this issue in the \nsubcommittee.\n  We should also oppose arbitrary limits on how long those fleeing \npersecution can wait before applying for asylum after they enter the \nUnited States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has already \nmade dramatic progress in addressing the abuses that have plagued our \nasylum system in recent years. In the past year alone, the number of \nasylum applications has dropped by 57 percent.\n  Mr. President, this chart indicates what progress has been made in \nthe very recent years. Going back to 1994: asylum claims, 120,000; the \ncompleted cases, 60,000.\n  This year, in 1995, INS received 53,000 new asylum claims and \ncompleted 126,000 cases. This is as a result of a variety of different, \nvery constructive actions that have been taken by the INS.\n  The blue line represents those completed cases. The red lines \nrepresent the new claims. So, clearly we see the asylum claims decline \nby 57 percent as productivity doubles in 1995. Clearly we are making \nimportant progress in this area. It has been as a result of a great \ndeal of time consuming, exacting, hard work that has been initiated by \nthe INS. Enormous progress has been made.\n  We will hear this issue debated. It seems to me we are on the right \ntrack already with the INS reforms, and the kinds of suggestions that \nhave been included in the current legislation should give many of us \npause.\n  I commend, in particular, Senator DeWine, who made a strong case that \na 30-day asylum application deadline, originally proposed in the \nlegislation, would exclude those who face the gravest persecution. They \nare the ones who take many months to organize their affairs, contact an \nattorney, and gain the confidence to approach the INS with their \npainful and tragic stories. I believe the 1-year deadline adopted by \nthe committee is a reasonable way to accommodate such humanitarian \ncases.\n  The bottom line is that the cases where there appears to be the \ngreatest validity of the persecution claims--the ones involving \nindividuals whose lives would be endangered by a forced return to their \nparticular countries--are often the most reluctant to come forward. \nThey are individuals who have been, in the most instances, severely \npersecuted. They have been brutalized by their own governments. They \nhave an inherent reluctance to come forward and to review their own \nstories before authority figures. Many of them are so traumatized by \nthe kinds of persecution and torture that they have undergone, they are \npsychologically unprepared to be able to do it. It takes a great deal \nof time for them to develop any kind of confidence in any kind of legal \nor judicial system, after what they have been through, and to muster \nthe courage to come forward.\n  That conclusion has been reached by a number of those who have been \nstudying this particular problem. The initial proposal of requiring \nthat there be action taken within 30 days of the person's arrival in \nthe United States failed to understand what the real problem is--and \nfails to understand the remarkable progress that INS has made in this \nparticular area.\n  I remain concerned that the so-called expedited exclusion procedures \nin the legislation will cause us to turn away true refugees. Under this \nprocedure, when a refugee arrives at a U.S. airport with false \ndocuments and requests asylum, that person can be turned away \nimmediately if the INS officer believes the person does not have a \ncredible claim. There is no hearing, no access to counsel, not even a \nrequirement for an interpreter.\n  If it were not for the courageous efforts of Raoul Wallenberg in \nproviding false documents to Jews fleeing Nazi Germany during World War \nII, many thousands of persecuted refugees would have had no means of \nescape. This provision runs the risk of turning away all those whom the \nRaoul Wallenbergs of the future seek to assist.\n  All we have to do is review the recent history in El Salvador and \nNicaragua, and be reminded of some of the egregious kinds of \ncircumstances have been revealed here in the last week or 10 days by \nmembers of the religious community, to understand what the real \nconditions were. To think that an individual who might be able to get \nout of that oppressive atmosphere with some false documents, with a \nvery legitimate fear of persecution, and come to the airports of this \ncountry and be turned away summarily and sent right back on the next \nplane, is something that I think deserves reevaluation during the \ncourse of this debate.\n\n\n                           PUBLIC ASSISTANCE\n\n  In addition, the immigration reforms in this bill will reduce access \nto public assistance by illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants should \nhave access to assistance only in limited situations, where the public \nhealth or similar overriding public interest clearly requires it. For \nexample, they should have emergency medical care, immunization, \ntreatment for infectious diseases. These benefit all, because they \nrelate to the public health and are in the public interest. Where the \npublic interest is not served, we should not provide the public \nassistance to illegal immigrants.\n\n  A main issue, however, is how to deal with public assistance for \nillegal immigrant children in public schools. In an extraordinarily \nunwise and inhumane action, Republicans in the House, at the urging of \nSpeaker Gingrich, voted to give States the option to expel such \nchildren from their schools. We all know why illegal immigrants come \nhere. As I have said, the magnet is jobs. It is ludicrous to argue that \nanyone would uproot their family, pay exorbitant sums to a smuggler to \ncross the border and risk their lives in the effort, all so their \nchildren can attend public schools in the United States.\n  A study by the Committee on Illegal Aliens during the Ford \nadministration concluded that ``the availability of work and the lack \nof sanctions for hiring illegal aliens is the single most important \nincentive for migration.'' That has been the conclusion of the Ford \nadministration, the Jordan Commission, the Hesburgh Select Commission \non Immigration and Refugee Policy--all have found that the magnet is \njobs. That is what we ought to focus on. That is where we ought to give \nour attention.\n  As I indicated, this finding was confirmed by the Hesburgh Commission \nin 1981, and again more recently by the Jordan Commission, which found \nthat ``employment opportunity is commonly viewed as the principal \nmagnet which draws illegal aliens to the United States.''\n  We are making steady progress in finding new and better ways of \ndenying jobs to illegal immigrants. It is a serious mistake, and \nhypocritical, for Republicans in Congress to oppose or weaken this \nbill's requirement on employers, who are at the heart of the problem, \nand then punish innocent children, who are not the problem, by \nexpelling them from school. So, I urge the Senate to reject the \nSpeaker's attempt to make Uncle Sam the bully in the schoolyard.\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\n  That kind of policy is not only cold and cruel, it is also \nshortsighted and counterproductive. It may cost money for those \nchildren to attend school. But, if they do not, society will end up \npaying for it in other ways. Police will have major new crime problems \non their hands from children out of school and on the streets and into \ngangs. Teachers will have to start checking the papers of all pupils, \nwhether they are citizens or not. Before starting school each year, \nchildren across America would be required to bring documents to school \nto prove they are American citizens or legal immigrants.\n  All across America, teachers will have to learn to distinguish \nbetween the new green card and the old invalid ones. They must know \nwhat refugee documents, passports and valid Social Security cards look \nlike.\n  School administrators and police have already spoken strongly against \nthis proposal. They are the ones who must deal with the crime and other \nsocial problems that will inevitably develop.\n  What we are basically doing is requiring our schoolteachers, in many \ndifferent school districts, to turn into police officers and truant \nofficers. Teachers are there to teach children. They have enough \nchallenges to face every day without adding this burden to them. Now, \nto put the burden on every one of these schoolteachers to become truant \nofficers, and effectively policemen, is unacceptable public policy.\n  The case has been made by the law enforcement officials, who say you \nare either going to pay one way or the other. You are going to pay for \nthe students who are going to the schools or you are going to pay for \nit in terms of crime and a host of other social problems if they do not \ngo to school.\n  You can imagine, too, Mr. President, a mother who comes over to this \ncountry with a child who is a toddler. She brings the child here, then \nhas a baby here in the United States who is an American citizen. That \nAmerican citizen child goes to the school and his older brother or \nsister, who is an illegal immigrant, does not. That child is out on the \nstreet. That is a wonderful situation, which we are going to absolutely \nface in this kind of proposal.\n  The parents would not leave America just because their children \ncannot go to school. The parents have no choice. They came here because \nthey could not find work at home and they will not go away as long as \nthey can get away with working here illegally and I urge the Senate to \nreject any such cruel and mindless attempt to punish the children for \nthe sins of the parents.\n\n\n          CONSIDERING ILLEGAL AND LEGAL IMMIGRATION SEPARATELY\n\n  In general, this bill does not address the issues of legal \nimmigration. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12 to 6 to consider \nthose issues separately and the House of Representatives voted 238-to-\n183 to do the same. I expect we will have a vote on legal immigration \nmatters later in the debate. I plan to oppose such a move. We must not \nallow our rightful concerns about illegal immigration to create an \nunwarranted backlash against legal immigrants who enter under our laws, \nplay by the rules, raise their families, pay their taxes, and \ncontribute to our communities. Combining these issues in a single bill \ncreates precisely that unacceptable possibility. Addressing these \nmatters separately does not mean deferring legal immigration reforms \nindefinitely. Reforms are required in legal immigration. It is my hope \nthat we can address them soon, but separately.\n\n\n                    Safety Net for Legal Immigrants\n\n  In fact, this bill does contain certain provisions relating to legal \nimmigration, and I voted against the entire bill in the committee \nbecause of these provisions. They go too far in denying a safety net to \nlegal immigrants. These legal immigrants enter under our laws, play by \nthe rules, pay taxes, contribute to our communities and also serve in \nthe armed services. They deserve a safety net when they fall on hard \ntimes.\n  The record is very complete, Mr. President, that those who are the \nlegal immigrants do not have a greater dependency in terms of these \nsupportive programs than Americans, with the exception of the SSI \nProgram for the elderly. But in these other areas, I can give as many \nstudies that demonstrate that legal immigrants make greater \ncontributions--in terms of paying taxes, by participating in the \ncommunity, by payroll taxes, by sales taxes, by all of the other \nfactors--than they absorb from the system. If we need to, we will have \nan opportunity to examine the various studies when we come to the \nparticular amendments. But I do believe the legal immigrants deserve a \nsafety net when they fall on hard times, and I support the provisions \nin this bill to make sponsors more accountable for the immigrants that \nthey sponsor.\n  Senator Simpson is right not to ban legal immigrants from any \nprogram. Instead, the bill's deeming provisions count the immigrant \nsponsor's income as part of the immigrant's own income in determining \nwhether the immigrant meets the eligibility guidelines for public \nassistance. For the first time, however, the deeming provision would be \nbroadened by the bill to apply to every means-tested program.\n  Under the current law, deeming applies only to SSI, AFDC, and food \nstamps. But under this bill deeming would apply to scores of other \nprograms including school lunches, homeless shelters, community \nclinics, and even one of the most important means of protecting the \npublic health, the Medicaid Program. Under this bill, illegal \nimmigrants get emergency Medicaid, immunization, treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, disaster assistance, and certain other types of \naid--no questions asked. But legal immigrants who come here under our \nlaws and play by the rules can get this assistance only after they go \nthrough the complicated deeming process. That gives illegal aliens a \nbenefit that legal immigrants cannot receive. It is unfair, and I \nintend to offer an amendment to correct this injustice.\n  I am also concerned with the denial of Medicaid to legal immigrants \nunless they overcome the deeming hurdle. As a practical matter, deeming \nmeans that virtually no legal immigrant will get Medicaid assistance. \nExperience has shown that deeming is very effective in denying access \nto public assistance programs. I am particularly concerned that this \nwill hurt children and expectant mothers.\n  I also believe legal immigrants who have served in our Armed Forces \nshould also have a Medicaid safety net for their families in hard \ntimes.\n  Legal immigrants can join the Armed Forces. We have over 20,000 legal \nimmigrants in the Armed Forces today. That young person, who might not \nhave been able to get into college, comes back from Bosnia and wants to \ngo to college and then makes an application and goes to that college \nand gets a Pell grant for 1 year--for 1 year. And then that young \nperson graduates. He might have been a 19- or 20-year-old kid that for \n1 year took the Pell grant. And as a result of that single action, for \nthe rest of his life, he is subject to deportation--immediate \ndeportation. This could occur even after he had served honorably in the \nArmed Forces.\n  There may be a lot of heat about doing something about illegal \nimmigration, Mr. President, but that is one of the most extraordinary \npositions for this country to take. We have a Volunteer Army, certainly \nnow, but when we did not have a Volunteer Army, we had the draft. Legal \nimmigrants are subject to the draft. Some had gone to Vietnam. A number \nof them were actually killed. Now we are saying if, at any time in the \nfuture, they have any particular need, in order to get a benefit, they \nare going to have the deeming process for the purposes of that \nparticular program.\n\n  That is going to be true with regard to the Stafford loans as well. \nThese are programs that are repaid. These are not considered to be \nwelfare programs. They are education programs. We will come back to \nthat issue later in the discussion. These are matters that need \nattention and focus and amendments.\n\n\n                           Family Immigration\n\n  Our immigration laws must continue to honor the reunification of \nfamilies. I agree it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the number \nof legal immigrants coming to the United States each year. Obviously, \nthe door is only partly open now and can fairly be closed a little more \nwithout violating the Nation's basic ideals of our immigrant heritage \nand history.\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\n  But in achieving such reductions, we must keep certain fundamental \nprinciples in mind. We must continue to reunite families. We must \nremain committed especially to the reunification of immediate family \nmembers. Spouses and minor children and parents should be together.\n  I also believe our citizens should have the ability to bring their \nadult brothers and sisters to America. We should act to reduce the \ntroubling backlogs that have kept husbands, wives and children \nseparated for many years.\n  The Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment, which Senator Abraham \nand I proposed, to reduce overall legal immigration, to establish new \npriorities for family-based immigration. Our proposal would make visas \navailable to more distant family members only if the more immediate \nfamily categories do not need them. For example, brothers and sisters \nwould not get visas as long as there are backlogs of spouses and \nchildren.\n  In this way, we address the concern raised by many about chain \nmigration, the ability of a citizen to bring in a brother, who in turn \nbrings in his wife and children. Once his wife is a citizen, she can \nthen bring in her parents and other family members, and there is an \nendless chain of immigration. We ought to address that issue.\n  We believe the amendment that was accepted by the Judiciary Committee \nrecognizes the important recommendations by the Jordan Commission that \nsaid give focus and attention to the immediate families. We have done \nthat. We have defined that in a way that we think also includes \nclearing up of the backlog before there can be any consideration of \nreunification by the brothers and sisters.\n  The Kennedy-Abraham proposal solves the problem of family categories \nthat create these chains. These are categories that Senator Simpson \nproposed for total elimination. Our proposal says that these categories \nremain, but they get visas only if the closer family categories do not \nneed them. And our proposal reduces the level of legal immigration \nbelow current law.\n  After the committee's adoption of the Kennedy-Abraham amendment, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service released higher projections of \nthe number of family immigrants expected to enter this country over the \nnext few years. Even under these new projections, our amendment reduces \nthe total immigration below current law. However, we will modify our \nproposal to provide added insurance that it does fall below the current \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, some in this debate will praise the contributions of \nimmigrants with one breath and then propose to slash family immigration \nin the next breath.\n  They say, ``We want your skills and ingenuity, but leave your \nbrothers and sisters behind. We want your commitment to freedom and \ndemocracy, but not your mother. We want you to help us rebuild our \ninner cities and cure diseases, but we do not want your grandchildren. \nWe want your family values, but not your families.'' I urge the Senate \nto reject this hypocrisy and treat immigrant families fairly.\n\n\n                         Diversity Immigration\n\n  Mr. President, reforms in legal immigration also must retain the \ndiversity program established in the Immigration Act of 1990. This \nsmall but important program provides visas to countries that have low \nimmigration to the United States and are shortchanged by our \nimmigration laws. A number of countries made good use of this program \nin the past 6 years. These countries otherwise would have little or no \nimmigration to the United States, such as Poland, South Africa, and \nIreland. The Judiciary Committee agreed to retain the program, but \nreduced the number of visas available each year from 55,000 to 27,000.\n\n\n                      Protecting American Workers\n\n  Increasingly, Mr. President, in recent years we have come to realize \nthat our immigration laws do not adequately protect working families in \nAmerica. Reforms are urgently needed here. I intend to offer them at \nthe appropriate time. In spite of the net creation of more than 8 \nmillion new jobs in the economy over the past 3 years, and in spite of \ncontinued low unemployment and inflation, and in spite of steady \neconomic growth--job dislocations and stagnant family income are \nleaving millions of American working families anxious and unsettled \nabout their future.\n  Since 1973, real family income has fallen 60 percent for all \nAmericans. More than 9 million workers permanently lost their jobs from \n1991 to 1993. Even as new jobs are created, other jobs have been \nsteadily disappearing at the rate of about 3 million a year since 1992.\n  In the defense sector alone, more than 2 million jobs have been lost \nsince the end of the cold war. About 70 percent of laid-off workers \nfind another job, but only a third end up in equally paying or better \njobs. What we are witnessing is a wholesale slide toward the bottom for \nthe American worker. According to Fortune Magazine, the percentage of \nworkers who said their job security was good or very good declined from \n75 percent in the early 1980's, to 51 percent in the early 1990's. In a \n1994 survey of more than 350,000 American workers, the International \nSurvey Research Corp. found that 44 percent of American workers fear \nthey may be fired or laid off. In 1990, the figure was only 20 percent.\n  For the first time ever there are more unemployed white-collar \nworkers than blue-collar workers in America. Yet most of the foreign \nworkers who come in today under our immigration laws are for white-\ncollar jobs. With corporate downsizing and outsourcing, a quarter of \nthe American work force is dependent on temporary jobs for a living. \nYet under the immigration laws, we admit hundreds of thousands of \nforeign workers for so-called temporary jobs which are defined in the \nimmigration laws as jobs that can last up to 6 years.\n  As working families in America try to put food on the table, \nemployers are bringing in hundreds of thousands of foreign workers into \ngood, middle-class jobs. Yet in most cases they are not even required \nto offer the jobs to Americans first. We understand that they are \nbringing in the foreign workers from overseas without even the \nrequirement to offer those jobs to Americans first.\n  As American workers become increasingly concerned about job security \nand putting their children through college, it is perfectly legal under \nthe immigration laws for employers to lay off qualified American \nworkers and replace them with foreign workers and offer them a lower \nwage.\n  A new study released last Friday by the Labor Department's inspector \ngeneral proves that the current means of protecting American workers \nunder the immigration law simply do not work. Charles Masten, the \ninspector general, reported to Labor Secretary Reich:\n\n       The programs do not protect U.S. workers' jobs or wages \n     from foreign labor. Moreover, we found [that the] Department \n     of Labor's role under the current program design amounts to \n     little more than a paper shuffle for the program and a rubber \n     stamping of applications. We believe program changes must be \n     made to ensure that U.S. workers' jobs are protected and that \n     their wage levels are not eroded by foreign labor.\n\n  The report of the inspector general is astounding. He found that 98.7 \npercent of workers whom employers are supposedly bringing into the \nUnited States are in fact already here. So when employers go through \nthe charade of trying to recruit Americans first, the foreign worker is \nalready here 98 percent of the time. And 74 percent of those foreign \nworkers were already on the employers' payroll at the time the employer \nwas supposedly required to recruit for American workers first. Do we \nunderstand that? So 74 percent of the foreign workers were already on \nthe employers' payroll at the time the employer was supposedly required \nto recruit for American workers first.\n  Among workers that employers sponsor as immigrants, 10 percent never \nworked for the sponsoring employer. Once they got their green card, \nthey immediately went to work for someone else. Of those who did \nactually work for the sponsoring employer, fully one-third left the job \nwithin 1 year. In effectively 60 percent of the cases, employers do not \neven bother to fill the job again once the immigrant leaves. In most \ncases in which the employer does refill the job, an American is hired \n75 percent of the time.\n  These figures prove that the jobs are offered as a sham to get a \nparticular immigrant a green card once they go through this hocus-\npocus. That is a sham. They already have the worker in\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\nplace. As I will point out later, only 5 Americans out of 28,000 that \nhave applied for these jobs, if they were basically offered them, have \never gotten the job. So they are filled with foreign workers. There is \na reasonable chance that they have fired American workers previously.\n  Then once those workers are working and have gone through this \nprocess, they leave. They leave the employment, and then the employer \ngoes out and gets somebody else. It is basically a sham. It places \nAmerican workers at an enormous disadvantage. The inspector general \nsays that over the period of his audit, the employment service referred \n28,000 U.S. workers for interviews for 10,000 jobs that employers \nwanted to give to immigrants, and only five U.S. workers got the jobs. \nThat is outrageous. These figures apply to the category of ``permanent \nimmigrant workers.''\n  But the inspector general also found rampant abuse of American \nworkers in the temporary worker program. There are two programs, Mr. \nPresident. There is the permanent program, where we have the \nauthorization of up to 140,000 of what will be called the best and the \nbrightest. I am going to come back to that. A more modest figure was \napproved here in 1990, but came out of the conference at the 140,000.\n  Some of those entering--for example, the Nobel laureate types--really \nare the best and the brightest. They can come into the United States \nwithout any requirement by the employer to recruit U.S. workers first. \nThat is defined currently into law. I support that program.\n  All other permanent employment-based immigrants have go through the \nlabor certification process--a procedure of reaching out to American \nworkers.\n  That whole process is a sham. That whole process is a sham. That is \nwhat the IG report has pointed out--that 97 percent of the workers are \nalready in their jobs and that they have been working there already for \nsome period of time. Out of 28,000 applications, only 5 Americans got \nthe job. And once the foreign workers get their permanent status, they \ncan then leave because they effectively have their work permit, their \ngreen card. They can go for some other job. It is a revolving door. It \nis a sham in terms of protecting American workers.\n  The second program is for what is called the temporary workers. Up to \n65,000 come in each year, though the number varies from year to year. \nFor those individuals to enter--all we need is an employer to say that \nthis individual has either the equivalent of a college education or 2 \nyears of work experience. They do not have to go out or even go through \nthe process to try to get American workers. Once they are in there, \nthey can be in there for 6 years. That is a temporary job. What happens \nis they come in on a temporary worker visa, they stay for the 6 years \nallowed, they want to be here permanently, so they ask their employer, \n``Look, I've been 6 years in my job. Will you go for one of the \npermanent ones for me?'' The employer says, ``OK. I know you have \nworked for us. I will make that application.'' Once they get it, they \nget the green card and go out the door.\n  That is effectively what is happening. It is a sham protection, \nsomething which is absolutely wrong and has to be redressed.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the time of the \nSenate to really get into where we are on these issues of the permanent \nwork force and the temporary work force. This chart shows the permanent \nwork force, the provision that said we need to open up the work force \nto let these best and the brightest come on into the United States of \nAmerica. I remember that debate very clearly here. I believe it was the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who offered it at that time \nas part of the Immigration Act of 1990.\n  The Department of Labor did surveys of which industry employees could \nhelp energize the American economy at that time. Those would be \nindividuals who, when placed in a particular industry, could multiply \njobs because they were the best minds, and had special training and \nability, and could add that special kind of insight, expertise, \nknowledge, and creativity to expand employment. It was perceived at \nthat time, according to the National Science Foundation, that we were \ngoing to have critical shortages of scientists during that period of \ntime. That is why Congress adopted the 140,000 number.\n  Now, looking at who has been included under the ``Best and the \nBrightest'' under this chart. As this chart reveals, very few are \nactually the best and brightest--the Nobel Laureate-type or some unique \ntype of academician or expert. These are let in without labor \nscreening.\n  The rest are let in here through the sham process of requiring \nemployers to recruit U.S. workers first.\n  We took the time to go and see who these are. It is very interesting \nwho they are: 12.9 percent are cooks; 10 percent are engineers on this \nchart; professors, 7.3 percent; also includes accountants and auditors, \nauto repair, tailors, jewelers. The area of ``computer-related'' is \n17.8 percent; 31 percent are all less than 1 percent of those coming in \nhere.\n  Mr. President, we have seen, as most recently the National Science \nFoundation has pointed out, the figures of 6 or 8 years ago, having \nshortages in various skills, they now find did not come about. Today, \nwe have 60,000 qualified unemployed American engineers. Yet about 6,000 \nforeign engineers came in as immigrants. We have 60,000 Americans who \nare qualified for that position. They are never given the opportunity \nto really try for that position.\n  What is wrong with American workers? What is wrong with those? \nNonetheless, we have heard the power of many of the business interests \nwho said, ``Do not tamper with that particular provision. Do not tamper \nwith it because it will effectively stop our economy.''\n  Mr. President, we ought to look and see that today under the more \nrecent studies that have been done all indicate that with the exception \nof that very small group of the best and brightest--that amounts to \nabout 20,000, which includes their families--we really do not need the \nsham recruitment requirement that is in current law. We certainly ought \nto establish a way to make sure that we will ask and find out if there \nare Americans ready, willing, and able to do this job before we bring \nin the foreign workers.\n  Now, Mr. President, looking at the other provision, where we talk \nabout the temporary workers--the alleged temporary worker provision; \n65,000 can come in each year under the immigration law. This chart \ngives an idea, in the black, which are the temporary workers, of the \nsalaries they make. Look at the salaries they are making. If you take \nthe two columns together, which is about 85 or 90 percent of all of the \nworkers that come on in here as the temporaries, they are making less \nthan $50,000.\n  Where are all the geniuses? Where are the Albert Einsteins that keep \ncoming in here? Where are all of these people, when close to 90 percent \nof them are making less than $50,000? It is only the small numbers that \ncome in up at this level that are the ablest and most gifted, the ones \nthat really provide the impetus in terms of the American economy. They \nought to be able to come on in to this country and provide their \nskills.\n\n  Mr. President, when we get down to it, we find that the great numbers \nare basically white-collar kinds of jobs--$50,000--that is a good \nsalary. And they are effectively displacing the Americans from these \nsolid, good, middle-class jobs.\n  Mr. President, let us look now at who is coming in under the \ntemporary worker program. These are individuals where all the employer \nhas to say is that the individual coming over has completed college or \nhad 2 years of experience, and the employers provide what are called \n``attestations'' that they will pay them a reasonable wage. These are \nthe temporaries. Half of them are physical therapists. Mr. President, \n50 percent of them are physical therapists. It was true that we had a \nshortage of physical therapists at one time. But our labor market is \nrecovering now.\n  Mr. President, 23 percent are computer-related. The rest fall into a \nwide variety of different categories.\n  Mr. President, when we have 50 percent in this program who are \nphysical therapists when so many community colleges and other fine \nschools and State universities are producing them today, individuals \nwho want and deserve to be able to have a crack at the\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\njob, and we are bringing that kind of percentage in here, it does not \nmake sense. It does not make sense, Mr. President. We are effectively \ndenying good, decent jobs to Americans that want to work, can work, \nhave the skills to be able to work, so that others--foreigners--can \ncome in.\n  What happens, Mr. President, is that those who come in under this \nprogram that I just mentioned here, the H-1 Program, are exploited. \nWhy? Because they cannot leave the job that they are on. If they leave, \nthey are illegal. So once they sign up, they are stuck with that \nemployer for the whole 6 years, with no guarantee that they will have \nto receive any level of wages. Once you bring that person in, you can \nlower their wage--absolutely lower their wage--and get away with it. \nYou can deny them any benefits at all.\n  What we will hear from the other side is that there can be an \ninvestigation of their conditions on being exploited. The only thing \nyou have to do is get a complaint from someone. Well, who in the world \nis ever going to complain when they know once they complain they can be \nthrown out of the country? Under the Republican proposal, the \nDepartment of Labor cannot interfere even if they have reason to \nbelieve there is exploitation on this, unless they receive a complaint. \nAnything else has been prohibited under the Republican proposal.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter, I believe, of importance and \nconsequence to working families. These are important jobs where \nAmericans are available. In each of these categories, except at the \nvery top level of immigration, there are more than enough Americans who \nare available for those jobs, and who want those jobs. Those are good \njobs. Still, we find that they are unable to compete. I think that is \nwrong.\n  No piece of legislation ought to go through here that has that kind \nof depressing effect on wages, because, as I mentioned before, once \nsomeone enters under the H-1B program, they can drive the wages right \ndown. They can replace American workers. Once employers get the foreign \nworker in, they can drive the wages down, which they more often do than \nnot. We have had testimony in our Subcommittee that supports that. We \nhad the testimony of a small businessman down in southern Texas that \nsupplied workers for a number of companies in Texas who came up and \nasked him to replace his American workers with foreign workers in order \nto drive his costs down. It is absolutely wrong. We will have a chance \non this legislation to work it through.\n  I see others that want to speak on the measure. Let me move toward a \nfinal item. Mr. President, with regard to the employment programs, as I \nmentioned before, both the IG from the Labor Department and the \ntestimony is really quite complete. This is an area that ought to be \naddressed because of its impact in terms of American workers and the \nfact that it really, when we look behind the curtain of these programs, \nyou find out there are good jobs that Americans are qualified for and \nthat they deserve.\n  There are two, and only two, legitimate bases for employment-based \nimmigration.\n  First, it can bring the world's best and brightest into our country \nto create jobs and improve our competitive position. We should welcome \nlegitimate scientists, legitimate business leaders, legitimate artists \nand performers without hesitation. They enhance our economy, create \njobs for U.S. workers, enrich our cultural life, and strengthen our \nsociety.\n  Second, employment-based immigration can meet skills shortages that \narise in a growing economy, particularly an economy like ours that \nrelies heavily on scientific and technological innovation for its \ngrowth and success. In certain circumstances, an employer's demand for \nskills cannot be met with sufficient speed or in adequate quantity by \nU.S. workers. In these circumstances, foreign workers can fill the \nskills gap, while the domestic labor market and the education and job \ntraining system adjust to the rising demand for workers with new or \ndifferent skills.\n  Clearly, there are legitimate purposes for employment-based \nimmigration. But we must also recognize that allowing employers to \nbring in foreign workers has an adverse effect on U.S. workers. \nRemaining globally competitive should never mean driving down the wages \nof U.S. workers and increasing their growing sense of insecurity in the \nworkplace.\n  Instead, in reforming the employment-based immigration programs, we \nmust assure that U.S. workers have a fair opportunity to get and keep \ngood jobs and raise their family incomes. Four changes in the current \nsystem are needed to give U.S. workers this assurance of fairness and \nopportunity.\n  First, we must protect U.S. workers who already have good jobs from \nbeing laid off and replaced with foreign workers. With all the talk of \njob insecurity, corporate and defense downsizing, and stagnant family \nincome, working families have a right to know that the immigration laws \nare not being abused to take away their jobs.\n  Second, we must give U.S. workers who have the skills and are \nwilling, available, and qualified for these jobs a fair opportunity to \nbe recruited for those jobs. Maintaining a strong and growing economy \nrequires that U.S. workers obtain the training they need to merit \nglobal competition, and that they have a fair opportunity to use their \nskills in high-wage, high-skill jobs. We cannot expect working families \nto improve their economic status if we post ``Road Closed'' signs on \nthe road to higher standards of living.\n  Third, when a job can be filled by a U.S. worker with a reasonable \namount of training within a reasonable period of time, we must assure \nthat the U.S. worker has a fair opportunity to obtain that training and \nget that job.\n  Fourth, and more generally, we must give U.S. workers a better chance \nat getting high-wage, high-skill jobs, without shutting off the safety \nvalve of access to foreign labor markets that some employers may need \nto meet demands that U.S. workers cannot supply in sufficient quantity \nor with sufficient speed.\n\n\n                 The Permanent Immigrant Worker Program\n\n  There are two ways for employers to obtain foreign workers for jobs \nin the United States. The workers can be admitted permanently and \nbecome lawful permanent residents through the permanent immigrant \nworker program. Or, they can be admitted temporarily through one of \nseveral temporary, or nonimmigrant, worker programs.\n  Under current law, 140,000 foreign workers can be admitted into the \nUnited States each year through the Permanent Immigrant Worker program. \nThese workers can run the gamut in skills from the most advanced Nobel \nPrize scientist to unskilled housekeepers and busboys.\n  One of the most significant changes we made in our system of legal \nimmigration in 1990--the last time we attempted to reform employment-\nbased immigration--was to increase by nearly threefold the numerical \nceiling on employment-based immigrants. The number rose from 54,000 to \n140,000 each year, and the changes also favored higher skilled \nimmigrants. We did so because of dire warnings of serious high-skill \nlabor shortages that we were all concerned would harm our economic \ngrowth, global competitiveness, and our potential to create high-skill, \nhigh-wage jobs for U.S. workers.\n  But these labor shortages never developed. In fact, actual use of the \nemployment-based immigrant program for skilled workers has never come \nclose to reaching the new ceiling level, and it has declined in the \nlast 2 years. The closest we came to the ceiling was in 1993 when \nnearly 27,000 visas were used for Chinese students under the now-\nexpired Chinese Student Protection Act. Another 10,000 visas were used \nfor unskilled workers.\n  Use of the employment-based immigrant program for skilled workers and \nunskilled workers over the last 5 years has been well below the \nceiling. In 1993, we admitted a total of 110,130. In 1994, we admitted \n92,604, a 16-percent reduction from the previous year. In 1995, we \nadmitted 73,239, a 21 percent reduction from the previous year. In sum, \nthe numbers are well below the cap, and they have also been declining \nin each of the past several years.\n\n  At a time when we are seeking moderate reductions in legal \nimmigration and reducing the visas available for reunifying families, \nwe should also be reducing the employment-based immigration--especially \nwhen the positions are not being used and the trend-line is down. It is \nnot fair that the whole\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\nweight of the reductions in the number of legal immigrants should be \nborne by families and diversity immigrants.\n  Reducing the ceiling on employment-based immigration is not the same \nas cutting employment-based immigration. In fact, the reform I intend \nto propose--adjusting the cap on employment-based immigration from \n140,000 to 100,000--would allow actual employment-based immigration to \ngrow by one-third in future years--from 75,000 in 1995 to 100,000. \nUnder current law and the pending bill, the program would nearly double \nin size.\n  It is clear that we went too far in 1990 when we increased the \nceiling on employment-based immigration to 140,000. The three-fold \nincrease was not needed and has not been approached by actual use. We \nshould pare it back to the more reasonable number of 100,000, as \nrecommended by the Jordan Commission and the Clinton administration. \nThat line still allows reasonable growth in this category, and it also \nprotects our national interest in economic growth, global \ncompetitiveness, and domestic job creation.\n  But immigration is about a great deal more than numbers. It is \nfundamentally about people. When we consider employment-based \nimmigration, we must have a clear understanding of the kind of people \nwe are admitting to our country and what skills and abilities they are \nbringing in with them.\n  Under current law, we divide permanent immigrant workers into two \ncategories: immigrants who are subject to labor certification and \nimmigrants who can be admitted without labor certification.\n  Labor certification is supposed to serve as a requirement that \nemployers first recruit U.S. workers for a job, before seeking \nimmigrant workers. Some workers are so exceptional that we should admit \nthem regardless of the state of the domestic labor market. But \nemployers should be permitted to obtain other foreign workers only if \nno U.S. workers with similar skills are willing, available, and \nqualified for the jobs into which the immigrant workers will be placed.\n  Those who are not subject to labor certification fit into the best \nand brightest category. In 1995, the category included 1,200 aliens of \nextraordinary ability, including recipients of major honors, great \ncommercial success, or leadership positions in their field; more than \n1,600 outstanding professors and researchers; almost 4,000 \nmultinational executives and managers; and almost 3,000 special \nimmigrants, who are primarily outstanding clerics.\n  The best and brightest are the job creators, men and women whose \ncontributions to our country will undoubtedly be dramatic and \nsubstantial. We should welcome them without hesitation. Current law \npermits it, and should remain unchanged.\n  The workers subject to labor certification, on the other hand, are \nrarely the best and brightest. They are skilled workers, workers with \nadvanced degrees or baccalaureate degrees. Under current law, up to \n10,000 of them can be unskilled workers.\n  There is no reason for employers in this country to bring in \nunskilled immigrant workers. There is an abundance, even an \noverabundance, of unskilled U.S. workers looking for work. The \nJudiciary Committee supported my amendment almost unanimously to delete \nthe unskilled category from the permanent immigrant worker program. \nPlainly, unskilled immigrants do not fit into either of the two \ncategories of workers who should be welcomed into our country--the best \nand brightest and workers needed to fill skills shortages.\n  Apart from unskilled workers, the immigrants subject to labor \ncertification are professionals with advanced degrees, professionals \nwith baccalaureate degrees, and skilled workers. They may be needed to \nsatisfy skill shortages. But employers may also put these workers in \ncompetition with thousands of U.S. workers for jobs that could be \nfilled from the domestic work force.\n  Employers use these permanent immigrant workers to fill many \npositions--cooks, computer programmers, engineers of all types, \nteachers, retail and wholesale managers, accountants and auditors, \nbiologists, auto repair mechanics, university professors, and tailors.\n  One useful measure of the skill level of these workers is their \nsalaries. Employers tell the Labor Department how much they plan to pay \nthe skilled immigrants they are seeking. Eighty percent of the jobs for \nforeign workers subject to labor certification pay $50,000 a year or \nless. Fewer than 3 percent of these jobs pay $80,000 or more.\n  A small number of employers use this employment-based immigration \nprogram to seek out the best and brightest, but it is clearly the \nexception, not the rule. A large number of working families in \nMassachusetts and across the United States would be gratified to have \nan opportunity to earn $50,000 a year working in computer programming. \nIt is vitally important that we make certain that employers use this \nimmigration program only to fill jobs for which qualified U.S. workers \nare not available.\n\n  We must have a labor certification process which actually results in \nemployers successfully recruiting U.S. workers for these skilled jobs. \nAt present, the Department of Labor certifies an employer's application \nfor an immigrant worker based on a complex, labor-intensive, and \nexpensive preadmission screening system. The current system does not \nand cannot assure that the conditions required for certification are \nactually achieved when the immigrant worker is employed. The Commission \non Immigration Reform estimated that labor certification costs \nemployers $10,000 per immigrant for administrative, paperwork, and \nlegal costs.\n  To bring in these skilled immigrants, an employer must demonstrate \nthat it was unsuccessful in finding a qualified U.S. worker to do the \njob, and that the job will pay at least the locally prevailing wage. \nAny employer who uses this employment-based immigration system will \ntell you that it takes a long time and an excessive amount of \ndocumentation.\n  The basic problem with this labor certification system is not that it \nis expensive and time consuming, but that it does not assure that able, \navailable, willing, and qualified U.S. workers get the jobs. In fact, \nthere is very little genuine recruitment.\n  Consider the case of Tony Rosaci and the members of his local union. \nTony is the secretary-treasurer of Iron Workers Local Union No. 455 in \nNew York City. The members of this local union helped build New York. \nThey were the backbone of the effort to rehabilitate the Statue of \nLiberty. But when well-qualified members of the local union responded \nto more than 65 help wanted ads placed in New York newspapers by \nemployers seeking permanent immigrant workers, they were rejected each \ntime in favor of foreign workers. There were 65 referrals of qualified \nU.S. workers, and 65 rejections.\n  The story of Tony Rosaci's union members is not the exception. The \nLabor Department inspector general found that in all of the cases where \nemployers complete the labor certification process, their recruitment \nefforts do not result in a U.S. worker getting the job in 99.98 percent \nof the cases--99.98 percent. That means a U.S. worker gets hired only 1 \nin 5,000 times. The system isn't working. It is badly broken.\n  U.S. workers do not have a fair opportunity to get these jobs \nbecause, in the overwhelming majority of cases, there is already a \nforeign temporary worker in the job who is trying to adjust to \npermanent status. The image that we all have of foreign workers waiting \nin their home countries until they are admitted to the United States \nunder the employment-based immigration system is a fallacy.\n  In 1994, 42 percent of labor certified workers who gained permanent \nadmission came directly from the temporary worker program. Some unknown \nadditional number are either working illegally for their employer, or \nsimply leave the country for a short period of time to expedite their \napplication for permanent admission to the United States.\n  The Labor Department estimates that as many as 90 percent or more of \nthe foreign workers admitted permanently to the United States have \nworked for the same employer who is helping the worker adjust to \npermanent status. Simply put, U.S. workers cannot get these jobs, \nbecause foreign temporary workers or illegally employed foreign workers \nare already in these jobs.\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\n  Employers use the labor certification system to make it look as \nthough they are engaging in genuine recruitment. In reality, they \nintend all along to keep the foreign workers who are already working \nfor them. Employers frequently create position descriptions for which \nonly the incumbent worker can qualify. As a result, referrals of well-\nqualified U.S. workers in response to advertisements for these jobs--\nthe humiliating experience shared by the members of Tony Rosaci's local \nunion and thousands of other U.S. workers--waste everyone's time and \nadd insult to injury for U.S. workers.\n  This system is a sham. It must be changed to give U.S. workers the \nfair opportunity they deserve to get these high-wage, high-skill jobs, \nand assure the public that the employment-based immigration system \nserves its stated purpose.\n  U.S. workers deserve a fair and genuine opportunity to get and keep \nhigh-wage, high-skill jobs before they are filled by the foreign \ntemporary workers who will later become permanent immigrant workers. \nThe best opportunity for U.S. workers to get these good jobs is at the \nfront end of employment-based immigration--before foreign temporary \nworkers fill the vacancy.\n  To achieve this goal, we must reform the temporary worker program--\nthe principal path through which foreign skilled workers are admitted \nto the United States. We must add a requirement that employers recruit \nU.S. workers, before the jobs can be filled with foreign temporary \nworkers.\n  But we must also change the permanent program. Instead of requiring \nthe Department of Labor to conduct meaningless labor certification for \nevery employer, the Department's Employment Service should instead \ntarget its enforcement to the employers most likely to present a \nproblem. In this way, employers who play by the rules or who are not in \na problem industry would not be subjected to labor certification. \nEmployers who seek to adjust a worker's status from temporary to \npermanent, and who demonstrate that they engaged in a bona fide but \nunsuccessful recruitment effort before filling the job with a foreign \ntemporary worker, would not be required to go through labor \ncertification.\n\n  These reforms, combined with effective enforcement by the Labor \nDepartment, should help give U.S. workers a fairer chance at these \njobs, and free employers from participation in a sham labor \ncertification process.\n\n\n               Understanding the Temporary Worker Program\n\n  In order to fully understand the permanent immigrant program, it is \nnecessary to understand the principal nonimmigrant employment-based \nprogram, called the H-1B Program. This program permits U.S. employers \nto bring into the United States skilled workers with college or higher \ndegrees. The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, but \nemployers can keep such workers in the United States for up to 6 years. \nThus, there can be almost 400,000 H-1B workers in the United States at \none time.\n  The program was originally conceived as a means to meet employers' \ntemporary needs for unique, highly skilled professionals. But many \nemployers use the program to bring into the United States relatively \nlarge numbers of foreign temporary workers with little or no formal \ntraining beyond a 4-year college degree. The typical foreign temporary \nworker is not a one-of-a-kind professor or a Ph.D. engineer as some \nnews stories suggest and the business lobby would have us believe.\n  For fiscal year 1994, employers' applications for health care \ntherapists--primarily physical therapists and occupational therapists--\naccounted for one-half--49.9 percent--of all H-1B jobs. Computer-\nrelated occupations accounted for almost one-quarter--23.9 percent--of \nthese jobs. As with the permanent program, wage data from H-1B \napplications indicate that almost two-thirds--65 percent--of H-1B jobs \npay $40,000 or less, and almost 3 out of 4--75 percent--jobs pay \n$50,000 or less.\n  Under current law, there is no obligation for employers to try to \nrecruit qualified U.S. workers for these jobs. The only thing the \nemployer must do is submit a one-page form. Employers must give the \ntitle of the job, the salary they intend to pay, and attest to four \nfacts: First, they will pay the higher of the actual wage paid to \nsimilarly employed workers or the prevailing wage; second, they are not \nthe subject of a strike or lockout; third, they have posted the \nrequisite notice for their U.S. workers; and fourth, the working \nconditions of similarly employed U.S. workers will not be adversely \naffected.\n  This form is the only requirement. No other documentation is required \nof the employer. Current law gives the Labor Department 7 days to \nreview these one-page forms, and prohibits the Department from \nrejecting the forms unless they are incomplete or have obvious \ninaccuracies. In simple terms, the H-1B Program is an open door for \n65,000 skilled foreign workers to enter the United States each year.\n  This is one reason why Americans are so cynical about our immigration \nlaws. This system is intended to help U.S. employers remain competitive \nin the face of technological change and competitive global markets. \nInstead, the system permits employers to bring in foreign temporary \nworkers regardless of whether qualified U.S. workers are available, or \neven if U.S. workers are currently holding the jobs into which the \nforeign temporary workers are going to be placed. We must reform the H-\n1B Program.\n\n\n           S. 1665 ``Reforms'' Take Us in the Wrong Direction\n\n  Unfortunately, the reforms currently contained in the legal \nimmigration bill are inadequate if our goal is to assure U.S. workers a \nfair opportunity to get and keep high-wage, high-skill jobs.\n  Over my objections and those of many other Democratic Members, the \nJudiciary Committee stripped out many sensible reforms to the \nemployment-based programs. The Judiciary Committee then made changes \nfor foreign temporary professional workers. The changes were touted by \ntheir sponsors as providing layoff protection to American workers, and \nas giving the Department of Labor latitude in investigating companies \nthat rely on temporary foreign workers.\n  The current bill does neither of these things. In fact, anyone who \nlooks carefully at the current bill will conclude that it does just the \nopposite.\n  S. 1665 embraces the agenda of corporate America at the expense of \nAmerican workers. The changes in the H-1B Program would have the \noverall effect of further weakening protections for U.S. workers from \nunfair competition with foreign workers, even though the protections in \nthe existing program are already demonstrably inadequate. Current law \ndoes not require U.S. employers to recruit in the domestic labor market \nfirst, nor does it prohibit employers from hiring foreign workers to \nreplace laid off U.S. workers in the same job.\n  To the contrary, S. 1665 provides no protection from employers who \nfire U.S. workers and hire foreign workers. In fact, S. 1665 is an \nendorsement of laying off U.S. workers in favor of foreign workers. We \nmust strengthen current law to stop this from happening--not weaken \ncurrent law and invite it to happen more.\n  The failure to protect U.S. workers from layoffs is not the only area \nin which this bill fails to protect U.S. workers. If S. 1665 becomes \nlaw existing worker protections would not apply to the large majority \nof employers who use the H-1B program;\n  Employers would be subject to lower wage payment requirements for \nforeign workers; and,\n  The Labor Department's enforcement ability to protect U.S. workers \nand foreign workers would be sharply curtailed.\n  In sum, the bill goes in exactly the wrong direction by making an \nalready troublesome H-1B program even worse.\n  Instead, we need genuine reform of the H-1B program to protect U.S. \nworkers and give them a fair opportunity to get and keep high-wage, \nhigh-skill jobs.\n  First, as with the program for permanent immigrants, we should make \nit illegal to lay off qualified American workers and replace them with \ntemporary foreign workers.\n  Recent case histories have gained wide public attention because they \nare shocking to all of us. Syntel, Inc., is a Michigan company with \nmore than 80 percent foreign temporary workers, primarily computer \nanalysts from India. In its business operations, Syntel contracts to \nprovide computer personnel and services to other companies. In New \nJersey, Syntel contracted\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\nwith American International Group, a large insurance company, to \nprovide computer services. Linda Kilcrease worked for AIG.\n  One day, without notice, AIG fired Linda along with 200 of her co-\nworkers and replaced them with foreign temporary workers from Syntel. \nAdding insult to injury, Linda and her coworkers were forced to train \ntheir replacements during their final weeks on the job.\n  David Hoff was a database administrator in Arizona with Allied \nSignal, a defense contractor. David was asked to train two foreign \nworkers to do his job. When he realized the company was about to \nreplace him, he left the job and refused to train his foreign \nreplacements.\n  Julie Cairns-Rubin worked for Sealand Services, a major shipping and \ntrucking company, writing and maintaining computer software systems for \nthe company's finances. She worked during the day and took night \nclasses for advanced computer skills. Her training, hard work, and \ndedication were supposed to give her greater job security. Instead, \nSealand fired Julie and replaced her with a foreign worker. Now Julie \nis unemployed.\n  Julie Cairns-Rubin, David Huff, and Linda Kilcrease should be \nrewarded for their skills and working hard for their employers. They \nare supposed to live the American dream. But the H-1B program under \ncurrent law turns the American dream into the American nightmare, and \nS. 1665 makes this nightmare even worse.\n  John Martin owns a high-technology firm in Houston. He has been under \npressure from clients to lay off his U.S. workers and bring in cheaper \nforeign workers at lower wages in order to cut costs. He refused, and \nhas lost contracts to cheaper, H-1B firms as a result. John is an \nemployer trying to play by the rules. But he can't compete with firms \nbringing in cheaper foreign labor.\n  Our law permits and encourages this behavior. Public outrage at such \nwidely publicized layoffs are tarnishing our entire immigration system \nand adding to the growing sense of insecurity felt by U.S. workers. \nThere is no legitimate justification for laying off U.S. workers and \nreplacing them with foreign workers, and our immigration laws should \nprohibit it.\n  A second needed reform is to require employers to recruit for U.S. \nworkers first, before being allowed to apply for a temporary foreign \nworker. Current law does not contain this simple, common sense \nprinciple--and it should.\n  Most employers who use the H-1B program say they are continuously \nrecruiting in the domestic labor market, and would prefer hiring U.S. \nworkers. So this change should not impose any hardship or additional \nburden on these employers.\n  This reform is simple and straight-forward. Employers applying for a \nforeign worker under the H-1B program would have to check one \nadditional box on their application form attesting that they have taken \nand are taking steps to recruit and retain U.S. workers--which \nemployers assure us they are already doing.\n  The employer would attest that it had recruited in the domestic labor \nmarket using industry-wide standard recruitment procedures. Government \nwould not mandate this standard.\n  If high-technology industries recruit quickly to win business, then \nthat's the industry-wide standard that should be recognized under the \nimmigration laws. This step will not delay firms which need workers \nquickly. But it will make sure that American workers get first crack at \nthese good jobs.\n  The employer would also confirm that its recruitment offered the \nlocally prevailing wage or the wage it actually pays similar workers, \nwhichever is higher. Employers hiring foreign workers are already \nrequired, under current law, to pay these workers the higher of the \nactual or locally prevailing wage, so this reform imposes no new wage \nobligation. The reform would merely establish that the employer \nrecruited U.S. workers by offering the same wages and other \ncompensation that it would be obligated to pay to its foreign workers. \nThat's only fair to U.S. workers.\n  This reform does not establish any new prevailing wage system. Under \ncurrent law, employers must ascertain and promise to pay at least the \nlocally prevailing wage. Employers can go to their State employment \nsecurity agency to get the prevailing wage. Or, under current law, \nemployers can rely on an ``independent authoritative source'' or \nanother ``legitimate source'' for prevailing wage data. They are not \nrequired to come to the government to get this information under \ncurrent law, and nothing I intend to propose would change that.\n  The employer would also attest that its domestic recruitment was \nunsuccessful. In other words, the employer need only state that it \ncould not find a qualified U.S. worker for the job. Employers already \ntell us they face the problem of being unable to find available U.S. \nworkers. It is this failure in the domestic labor market that the H-1B \nProgram is supposed to address.\n  There are certain circumstances in which we would all agree that an \nemployer should not be required to seek a U.S. worker. Existing law \nexempts from labor certification--and thereby from any recruitment \nrequirement--foreign workers of extraordinary ability, outstanding \nprofessors and researchers, certain multinational executives and \nmanagers, and renowned clerics. These are truly the best and the \nbrightest. They are Nobel-level scientists, the tenure-track \nprofessors, and top researchers. They should be admitted to the United \nStates because they are unique and because there is no dispute that \nthey will improve our society and increase our competitiveness. If we \ncan get them, we should admit them.\n  If H-1B workers qualify under the permanent worker program as \nindividuals with ``extraordinary ability'' or an ``outstanding \nprofessor or researcher,'' the employer could also hire them and bring \nthem into the United States as H-1B workers, without having to engage \nin domestic recruitment. This is a reasonable accommodation of the \nconcerns expressed by the business community, without jeopardizing U.S. \nworkers.\n  In every other case, however, we are short-changing U.S. workers and \nour own national interests if we don't expect employers to recruit in \nthe U.S. for jobs for which they are seeking foreign workers.\n  The third and final change I propose to the H-1B Program is to reduce \nthe term of the visa from 6 years to 3 years. This is supposed to be a \ntemporary visa, but most Americans would call it a permanent job. In \nfact, Americans from 25 to 34 years of age change jobs every 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. Those age 35 to 44 change every 6 years.\n  Importing needed skills should usually be a short-term response to \nurgent needs, while adjusting to quickly changing circumstances.\n  Reducing the terms from 6 years to 3 years will also reduce the \nmaximum number of foreign temporary workers in the country at any one \ntime from about 400,000 to about 200,000. The 3-year period will also \nassure that these temporary workers are, indeed, temporary.\n  This change is important not only for U.S. workers who already have \nthe skills for good jobs, but also for those who would like to acquire \nthe necessary skills. The labor market will correct imbalances in the \ndemand and supply of needed skills if it receives the proper signals. \nAllowing foreign temporary workers to stay in the United States for 6 \nyears sends the wrong signal. The only valid, long-term response to \nskills shortages is training U.S. workers. A 3-year stay will promote \nskills training and job opportunities for qualified U.S. workers, and \nhelp overcome the wage stagnation affecting so many working families.\n\n\n     Giving the Labor Department the Enforcement Authority it Needs\n\n  I have discussed a long list of reforms that are needed in the \npermanent worker program and the H-1B Temporary Worker Program. These \nreforms can help assure that employment-based immigration is fair to \nU.S. workers. It is vital that we enact these reforms. But they will be \nnothing more than empty words in the United States Code if the Labor \nDepartment does not have the enforcement authority to assure widespread \ncompliance.\n  We must end the current mismatch of enforcement authority. The \nDepartment of Labor has the power to respond to complaints, initiate \ninvestigations, and conduct audits under the temporary worker program, \nalthough S. 1665 would unwisely curb these powers. However, under the \npermanent program, the authority of the Department\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\nends once the immigrant arrives on our shores. After the worker is \nhere, there is little the Department can do to ensure that employers \npay the prevailing wage and meet other terms and conditions of \nemployment.\n  We must give the Department essentially the same post-admission \nenforcement powers for permanent foreign workers that it already has \nfor temporary workers. Often, the temporary workers become permanent \nworkers. The Department of Labor ought to have the same power to assure \ncompliance after the workers convert to permanent resident status as \nbefore.\n  Such enforcement powers are important as a safeguard for workers' \nrights. They also ensure that the recruitment mechanism functions \nproperly. To ensure that these requirements are met, the Labor \nDepartment must have the ability to seek out and identify employers \nthat violate the law, assure that U.S. and foreign workers are \nprotected or made whole, and impose penalties that will deter future \nviolations and promote compliance.\n  Finally, we should also require payment of additional fees to cover \nthe Labor Department's costs of administering the certification \nrequirements and enforcement activities. Taxpayers should not have to \nfoot the bill for the cost of providing employers with foreign workers.\n  Immigration has served America well for over two centuries. Its \ncurrent troubles can be cured. If we fail to act responsibly the calls \nfor Buchananism and Fortress America will only grow louder and more \nirresponsible. To protect our immigrant heritage, we must stop illegal \nimmigration. We must end the abuses of American workers under our \ncurrent immigration laws, and enact the many other reforms needed to \nstrengthen this vital aspect of our history and our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this particular time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Congressional Budget \nOffice addressed to me as chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, \ndated April 15, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on the \n         Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As requested by your staff, CBO has \n     reviewed a possible amendment to S. 1664, the Immigration \n     Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, which was \n     reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on April \n     10, 1996. The amendment would alter the effective date of \n     provisions in section 118 that would require states to make \n     certain changes in how they issue driver's licenses and \n     identification documents. The amendment would thereby allow \n     states to implement those provisions while adhering to their \n     current renewal schedules.\n       The amendment contains no intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4 and would impose no direct costs \n     on state, local, or tribal governments. In fact, by delaying \n     the effective date of the provisions in section 118, the \n     amendment would substantially reduce the costs of the \n     mandates in the bill. If the amendment were adopted, CBO \n     estimates that the total costs of all intergovernmental \n     mandates in S. 1664 would no longer exceed the $50 million \n     threshold established by Public Law 104-4.\n       In our April 12, 1996, cost estimate for S. 1664 (which we \n     identified at the time as S. 269), CBO estimated that section \n     118, as reported, would cost states between $80 million and \n     $200 million in fiscal year 1998 and less than $2 million a \n     year in subsequent years. These costs would result primarily \n     from an influx of individuals seeking early renewals of their \n     driver's licenses or identification cards. By allowing states \n     to implement the new requirements over an extended period of \n     time, the amendment would likely eliminate this influx and \n     significantly reduce costs. If the amendment were adopted, \n     CBO estimates the direct costs to states from the driver's \n     license and identification document provisions would total \n     between $10 million and $20 million and would be incurred \n     over six years. These costs would be for implementing new \n     data collection procedures and identification card formats.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office setting forth the estimated \nbudgetary effects of the pending legislation be printed at this point \nin the Record, and I further note that the reference in this letter to \nS. 269, as reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on April \n10, 1996, means that these estimates apply to the legislation pending \nbefore the Senate as S. 1664.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed federal, intergovernmental, and private \n     sector cost estimates for S. 269, the Immigration Control and \n     Financial Responsibility Act of 1996. Because enactment of \n     the bill would affect direct spending and receipts, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would apply.\n       The bill would impose both intergovernmental and private \n     sector mandates, as defined in Public Law 104-4. The cost of \n     the mandates would exceed both the $50 million threshold for \n     intergovernmental mandates and the $100 million threshold for \n     private sector mandates specified in that law.\n       CBO's estimate does not include the potential cost of \n     establishing a program to reimburse state and local \n     governments for the full cost of providing emergency medical \n     care to illegal aliens. As noted in the enclosed estimate, \n     the drafting of this provision leaves many uncertainties \n     about how the program would work and therefore precludes a \n     firm estimate. The potential costs could, however, be \n     significant.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 269.\n       2. Bill title: Immigration Control and Financial \n     Responsibility Act of 1996.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary on April 10, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 269 would make many changes and \n     additions to Federal laws relating to immigration. Provisions \n     having a potentially significant budgetary impact are \n     highlighted below.\n       Title I would:\n       Direct the Attorney General to increase the number of \n     Immigration and Naturalization (INS) border patrol agents by \n     700 in fiscal year 1996 and by 1,000 in each of the fiscal \n     years 1997 through 2000; in addition, the number of full-time \n     support positions for border patrol agents would be increased \n     by 300 in each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2000;\n       Authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary \n     to increase the number of INS investigator positions by 600 \n     in fiscal year 1996 and by 300 in each of the fiscal years \n     1997 and 1998, and provide for the necessary support \n     positions;\n       Direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to increase the number of land border inspectors in \n     fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to assure full staffing during the \n     peak border-crossing hours;\n       Authorize the Department of Labor (DOL) to increase the \n     number of investigators by 350--plus necessary support \n     staff--in fiscal years 1996 and 1997;\n       Direct the Attorney General to increase the detention \n     facilities of the INS to at least 9,000 beds by the end of \n     fiscal year 1997;\n       Authorize a one-time appropriation of $12 million for \n     improvements in barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border;\n       Authorize the Attorney General to hire for fiscal years \n     1996 and 1997 such additional Assistant U.S. Attorneys as may \n     be necessary for the prosecution of actions brought under \n     certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act;\n       Authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary \n     to expand the INS fingerprint-based identification system \n     (IDENT) nationwide;\n       Authorize a one-time appropriation of $10 million for the \n     INS to cover the costs to deport aliens under certain \n     provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act;\n       Authorize such sums as may be necessary to the Attorney \n     General to conduct pilot programs related to increasing the \n     efficiency of deportation and exclusion proceedings;\n       Establish several pilot projects and various studies \n     related to immigration issues, including improving the \n     verification system for aliens seeking employment or public \n     assistance;\n       Provide for an increase in pay for immigration judges;\n       Establish new and increased penalties and criminal \n     forfeiture provisions for a number of crimes related to \n     immigration; and\n       Permit the Attorney General to reemploy up to 100 federal \n     retirees for as long as two years to help reduce a backlog of \n     asylum applications.\n       Title II would:\n       Curtail the eligibility of non-legal aliens, including \n     those permanently residing under\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\n     color of law (PRUCOL), in the narrow instances where they are \n     now eligible for federal benefits;\n       Extend the period during which a sponsor's income is \n     presumed or deemed to be available to the alien and require \n     deeming in all federal means-tested programs, not just the \n     ones that currently practice it;\n       Deny the earned income tax credit to individuals not \n     authorized to be employed in the United States; and\n       Change federal coverage of emergency medical services for \n     illegal aliens.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming \n     appropriation of the entire amounts authorized, enacting S. \n     269 would increase discretionary spending over fiscal years \n     1996 through 2002 by a total of about $3.2 billion. Several \n     provisions of S. 269, mainly those in Title II affecting \n     benefit programs, would result in changes to mandatory \n     spending and federal revenues. CBO estimates that the changes \n     in mandatory spending would reduce outlays by about $7 \n     billion over the 1996-2002 period, and that revenues would \n     increase by about $80 million over the same period. These \n     figures do not include the potential costs of establishing a \n     program to reimburse state and local governments for the full \n     cost of providing emergency medical care to illegal aliens; \n     these costs could amount to as much as $1.5 billion to $3 \n     billion a year.\n       The estimated budgetary effects of the legislation are \n     summarized in Table 1. Table 2 shows projected outlays for \n     the affected direct spending programs under current law, the \n     changes that would stem from the bill, and the projected \n     outlays for each program if the bill were enacted. The \n     projections reflect CBO's March 1996 baseline.\n\n                                                     TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF S. 269                                                    \n                                                        [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]                                                       \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1996         1997         1998         1999         2000         2001         2002   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS ACTION                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                        \nAuthorizations:                                                                                                                                         \n    Estimated authorization level............................            0          709          472          580          596          615          633\n    Estimated outlays........................................            0          286          467          663          580          600          621\n                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                             MANDATORY SPENDING AND RECEIPTS                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                        \nDirect spending:                                                                                                                                        \n    Estimated budget authority...............................            0         -450         -927       -1,237       -1,427       -1,409       -1,549\n    Estimated outlays........................................            0         -450         -927       -1,237       -1,427       -1,409       -1,549\n    Estimated Revenues.......................................            0           14           13           12           13           13           13\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Estimates do not include potential costs of establishing a program to reimburse state and local governments for the full cost of providing       \n  emergency medical care to illegal aliens.

Basis of estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that S. 269 will be enacted by August 1, 1996.\n\n\n                   spending subject to appropriations\n\n       The following estimates assume that all specific amounts \n     authorized by the bill would be appropriated for each fiscal \n     year. For programs in the bill for which authorizations are \n     not specified, or for programs whose specific authorizations \n     do not provide sufficient funding, CBO estimated the cost \n     based on information from the agencies involved. Estimated \n     outlays, beginning in 1997, are based on historical rates for \n     these or similar activities. (We assumed that none of the \n     bill's programs would affect outlays in 1996.)\n       The provisions in this bill that affect discretionary \n     spending would increase costs to the federal government by \n     the amounts shown in Table 3, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary funds. In many cases, the bill authorizes funding \n     for programs already authorized in the Violent Crime Control \n     and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the 1994 crime bill) or \n     already funded by fiscal year 1996 appropriations action. For \n     example, the additional border patrol agents and support \n     personnel in title I already were authorized in the 1994 \n     crime bill through fiscal year 1998. For such provisions, the \n     amounts shown in Table 3 reflect only the cost above funding \n     authorized in current law.\n       In the most recent continuing resolution enacted for fiscal \n     year 1996, appropriations for the Department of Justice total \n     about $14 billion, of which about $1.7 billion is for the \n     INS.\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n\n\n           TABLE 3.--SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS ACTION          \n                [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization                                                 \n levels:                                                                \n  Additional Border Patrol                                              \n   agents.....................  .....  .....     97     97    100    103\n  Additional investigators....     97    152    159    165    171    178\n  Additional inspectors.......     24     32     34     35     37     39\n  Additional DOL employees....     27     29     30     31     33     34\n  Detention facilities........    418    187    187    194    198    204\n  Barrier improvements........     20  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....\n  Additional U.S. Attorneys...     23     46     48     49     51     52\n  IDENT expansion.............     87     22     22     22     22     22\n  Deportation costs...........     10  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....\n  Pilot programs..............      2      3      2      2      2  .....\n  Pay raise for immigration                                             \n   judges.....................      1      1      1      1      1      1\n                               -----------------------------------------\n      Total...................    709    472    580    596    615    633\nEstimated Outlays.............    286    467    663    580    600    621\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      revenues and direct spending\n\n       S. 269 would have a variety of effects on direct spending \n     and receipts. The most significant effects would stem from \n     new restrictions on payment of federal benefits to aliens, in \n     Title II of the bill. That title would curtail the \n     eligibility of non-legal aliens, including those permanently \n     residing under color of law (PRUCOL), in the narrow instances \n     where they are now eligible for federal benefits. It would \n     require that all federal means-tested programs weigh \n     sponsors' income (a practice known as deeming) for a minimum \n     of 5 years after entry when gauging an immigrant's \n     eligibility for benefits, and would require an even longer \n     deeming period--lasting 10 years or more after arrival--for \n     future entrants. It would make sponsors' affidavits of \n     support legally enforceable. These provisions would save \n     money in federal benefit programs. Partly offsetting those \n     savings, the bill proposes one major change that could add to \n     federal costs--a provision that is apparently intended to \n     require the federal government to pay the full cost of \n     emergency Medicaid services for illegal aliens. However, \n     ambiguities in the drafting of that provision prevent CBO \n     from estimating its effect. Although the provisions affecting \n     benefit programs dominate the direct spending implications of \n     S. 269, other provisions scattered throughout Titles I and \n     II would have small effects on collections of fines and \n     penalties and on the receipts of federal retirement funds.\n       Fines. The imposition of new and enhanced civil and \n     criminal fines in S. 269 could cause governmental receipts to \n     increase, but CBO estimates that any such increase would be \n     less than $500,000 annually. Civil fines would be deposited \n     into the general fund of the Treasury. Criminal fines would \n     be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund and would be spent in \n     the following year. Thus, direct spending from the fund would \n     match the increase in revenues with a one-year lag.\n       Forfeiture. New forfeiture provisions in S. 269 could lead \n     to more assets seized and forfeited to the United States, but \n     CBO estimates that any such increase would be less than \n     $500,000 annually in value. Proceeds from the sale of any \n     such assets would be deposited as revenues into the Assets \n     Forfeiture Fund of the Department of Justice and spent out of \n     that fund in the same year. Thus, direct spending from the \n     Assets Forfeiture Fund would match any increase in revenues.\n       Supplemental Security Income. The SSI program pays benefits \n     to low-income people with few assets who are aged 65 or older \n     or disabled. According to tabulations by the Congressional \n     Research Service (CRS), the SSI program for the aged is the \n     major benefit program with the sharpest contrast in \n     participation between noncitizens and citizens. CRS reported \n     that nearly one-quarter of aliens over the age of 65 receive \n     SSI, versus about 4 percent of citizens. The Social Security \n     Administration states that about 700,000 legal aliens collect \n     SSI (although some unknown fraction of those ``aliens'' are \n     really naturalized citizens, whose change in status is not \n     reflected in program records). About three-quarters of alien \n     SSI recipients are immigrants legally admitted for permanent \n     residence, who must serve out a waiting period during which \n     their sponsor's income is ``deemed'' to them before they can \n     go on the program. That waiting period was lengthened to 5 \n     years in 1994 but is slated to return to 3 years in October \n     1996. The other one-quarter of alien recipients of SSI are \n     refugees, asyelees, and PRUCOLs.\n       S. 269 would prevent the deeming period from returning to 3 \n     years in October 1996. Instead, the deeming period would \n     remain at 5 years (for aliens who entered the country before \n     enactment) and would be lengthened to 10 years or more for \n     aliens who enter after the date of enactment. Specifically, \n     for a future entrant, deeming in all federal means-tested \n     programs would last until the alien had worked for 40 \n     quarters in Social Security-covered employment--a condition \n     that elderly immigrants, in particular, would be unlikely \n     ever to meet. By requiring that all income of the sponsor \n     and spouse be deemed ``notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law,'' S. 269 would also nullify the exemption in \n     current law that waives deeming when the Social Security \n     Administration (SSA) determines that the alien applicant \n     became disabled after he or she entered the United States.\n       Data from SSA records show very clearly that many aged \n     aliens apply for SSI as soon as their deeming period is over, \n     though such a pattern is much less apparent among younger \n     aliens seeking benefits on the basis of disability. CBO \n     estimates that lengthening the deeming period from 3 years to \n     5 years (or longer), and striking the exemption from deeming \n     for aliens who became disabled after arrival, would save \n     about $0.1 billion in 1996, and $0.3 billion to $0.4 billion \n     a year in 1997 through 2002. Nearly two-thirds of the savings \n     would come from the aged, and the rest from the disabled.\n       S. 269 would also eliminate eligibility for SSI benefits of \n     aliens permanently residing under color of law (PRUCOLs). \n     That label covers such disparate groups as parolees, aliens \n     who are granted a stay of deportation, and others with \n     various legal statuses. PRUCOLs currently make up about 5 \n     percent of aliens on the SSI rolls. CBO assumes that some \n     would successfully seek to have their classification changed \n     to another category (such as refugee or asylee) that would \n     protect their SSI benefits. The remainder, though, would be \n     barred from the program, generating savings of about $0.5 \n     billion over 7 years.\n       Food Stamps. The estimated savings in the Food Stamp \n     program--$0.2 billion over 7 years--are considerably smaller \n     than those in SSI but likewise stem from the deeming \n     provisions of S. 269. The Food Stamp program imposes a 3-year \n     deeming period. Therefore, lengthening the deeming period (to \n     5 years for aliens already here and longer for future \n     entrants) would save money in food stamps. S. 269 contains a \n     narrow exemption from deeming for aliens judged to be at \n     immediate risk of homelessness or hunger. Because the Food \n     Stamp program already denies benefits to most PRUCOLs, no \n     savings are estimated from that source.\n       Family Support. The provisions that would generate savings \n     in SSI and food stamps would also lead to small savings in \n     the AFDC program. The AFDC program already deems income from \n     sponsors to aliens for 3 years after the alien's arrival. S. \n     269 would lengthen that period to at least 5 years (longer \n     for future entrants). The $0.1 billion in total savings over \n     the 1997-2002 period would stem overwhelmingly from the \n     lengthening of the deeming period. Savings from ending the \n     eligibility of PRUCOLs are estimated to be just a few \n     million dollars a year.\n       Child Nutrition. S. 269 would require that the child \n     nutrition program begin to deem sponsors' income to alien \n     schoolchildren when weighing their eligibility for free or \n     reduced-price lunches. Child nutrition does not employ \n     deeming now. It does, however, take parents' income into \n     account when determining eligibility. CBO therefore assumed \n     that savings in child nutrition would stem mainly from the \n     minority of cases in which a relative other than a parent \n     (say, a grandparent or an aunt) sponsored the child's entry \n     into the United States. CBO assumed that it would take at \n     least two years to craft regulations and implement deeming in \n     school systems nationwide, therefore precluding savings until \n     1999. Savings of about $20 million a year would result once \n     the deeming provision took full effect.\n       S. 269 explicitly preserves eligibility for the child \n     nutrition program for illegal alien schoolchildren. CBO \n     assumed, however, that the stepped-up screening that would be \n     required to enforce deeming for legally admitted children \n     would lead some illegal alien children to stop participating \n     in the program, because their parents would fear detection.\n       Medicaid. S. 269 would erect several barriers to Medicaid \n     eligibility for recent immigrants and future entrants into \n     this country. In most cases, AFDC or SSI eligibility carries \n     Medicaid eligibility along with it. By restricting aliens' \n     access to those two cash programs, S. 269 would thereby \n     generate Medicaid savings. Medicaid now has no deeming \n     requirement at all; that is, program administrators do not \n     consider a sponsor's income when they gauge the alien's \n     eligibility for benefits. Therefore, it is possible for a \n     sponsored alien to qualify for Medicaid even before he or she \n     has satisfied the SSI waiting period. S. 269 would change \n     that by requiring that every means-tested program weigh the \n     income of a sponsor for at least 5 years after entry. Under \n     current law, PRUCOLs are specifically eligible for Medicaid; \n     S. 269 would make them ineligible.\n       To estimate the savings in Medicaid, CBO first estimated \n     the number of aliens who would be barred from the SSI and \n     AFDC programs by other provisions of S. 269, CBO then added \n     another group--dubbed ``noncash beneficiaries'' in Medicaid \n     parlance because they participate in neither of the two cash \n     programs. The noncash participants who would be affected by \n     S. 269 essentially fall into two groups. One is the group of \n     elderly (and, less importantly, disabled) aliens with \n     financial sponsors who, under current law, seek Medicaid even \n     before they satisfy the 3-year wait for SSI; the second is \n     poor children and pregnant women who could, under current \n     law, qualify for Medicaid even if they do not get AFDC. \n     CBO multiplied the estimated number of aliens affected \n     times an average Medicaid cost appropriate for their \n     group. That average cost is significantly higher for an \n     aged or disabled person than for a younger mother or \n     child. In selecting an average cost, CBO took into account \n     the fact that relatively few aged or disabled aliens \n     receive expensive long-term care in Medicaid-covered \n     institutions, but that on the other hand, few are eligible \n     for Medicare. The resulting estimate of Medicaid savings \n     was then trimmed by 25 percent to reflect the fact that--\n     if the aliens in question were barred from regular \n     Medicaid--the federal government would likely end up \n     paying more in reimbursements for emergency care and for \n     uncompensated care. The resulting savings in Medicaid \n     would\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\n     climb from $0.1 billion in 1997 to about $0.6 billion a \n     year in 2000 through 2002, totaling $2.7 billion over the \n     1996--2002 period.\n       One of the few benefits for which illegal aliens now \n     qualify is emergency Medicaid, under section 1903(v) of the \n     Social Security Act. Section 212 of S. 269 is apparently \n     intended to make the federal government responsible for the \n     entire cost of emergency medical care for illegal aliens, \n     instead of splitting the cost with states as under the \n     current matching requirements of Medicaid. However, the \n     drafting of the provision leaves several legal and practical \n     issues dangling. S. 269 would not repeal the current \n     provision in section 1903(v). It would apparently establish a \n     separate program to pay for emergency medical care. Although \n     it stipulates that funding must be set in advance in \n     appropriation acts, it also provides that states and \n     localities would therefore have an open-ended right to \n     reimbursement, notwithstanding the ceiling implied in an \n     appropriation act.\n       S. 269 orders the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS), in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop \n     rules for reimbursement. Emergency patients often show up \n     with no insurance and little other identification; therefore, \n     if HHS drafted stringent rules for verification, it is \n     possible that very few providers could collect the \n     reimbursement. On the other hand, if HHS required only \n     minimal identification, providers would have an incentive to \n     classify as many patients as possible in this category \n     because that would maximize their federal reimbursement. S. \n     269 does not state whether reimbursement would be subject to \n     the usual limits on allowable charges in Medicaid, or whether \n     providers could bill the federal government for their full \n     cost. Nor is it clear whether the program would use the same \n     definition of emergency care as in Medicaid law.\n       Although the budgetary effects of Section 212 cannot be \n     estimated, some idea of its potential costs can be gained by \n     looking at analogous proposals for the Medicaid program. CBO \n     estimates that modifying Medicaid to reimburse states and \n     localities for the full cost of emergency care for illegal \n     aliens would cost approximately $1.5 billion to $3 billion \n     per year. That estimate assumes that Medicaid would continue \n     to use its current definition of emergency care and its \n     current schedule of charges. It also assumes that states \n     would seek to classify more aliens and more services in this \n     category, in order to collect the greatest reimbursement.\n       Similarly, section 201 of the bill is meant to qualify \n     certain mothers who are illegal aliens for pre- and post-\n     partum care under the Medicaid program. In general, poor \n     women who are citizens or legal immigrants can now get such \n     care through Medicaid, but illegal aliens cannot. Although \n     the bill would authorize $120 million a year for such care, \n     the new benefit would in fact be open-ended because of the \n     entitlement nature of the Medicaid program. CBO does not have \n     enough information to estimate the provision's cost, which \n     would depend critically on the type of documentation demanded \n     by the Secretary of HHS to prove that the mothers met the \n     requirement of 3 years of continuous residence.\n       Earned Income Tax Credit. S. 269 would deny eligibility for \n     the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to workers who are not \n     authorized to be employed in the United States. In practice, \n     that provision would work by requiring valid Social Security \n     numbers to be filed for the primary and secondary taxpayers \n     on returns that claim the EITC. A similar provision was \n     contained in President Clinton's 1996 budget proposal and in \n     last fall's reconciliation bill. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation estimates that the provision would reduce the \n     deficit by approximately $0.2 billion a year.\n       Other programs. Entitlement or direct spending programs \n     other than those already listed are estimated to incur \n     negligible costs or savings over the 1997-2002 period as a \n     consequence of S. 269. The foster care program does not \n     appear on any list of exemptions in S. 269; but since the \n     program does not employ deeming now, and since it is unclear \n     how deeming could be made to work in that program (for \n     example, whether it would apply to foster care children or \n     parents), CBO estimates no savings. CBO estimates that the \n     bill would not lead to any significant savings in the student \n     loan program. The Title XX social services program, and \n     entitlement program for the states, is funded at a fixed \n     dollar amount set by the Congress; the eligibility or \n     ineligibility of aliens for services would not have any \n     direct effect on those dollar amounts.\n       S. 269 would have a small effect on the net outlays of \n     Federal retirement programs. Section 196 of the bill would \n     permit certain civilian and military retirees to collect \n     their full pensions in addition to their salary if they are \n     reemployed by the Department of Justice to help tackle a \n     backlog of asylum applications. CBO estimates that about 100 \n     annuitants would be affected, and that net outlays would \n     increase by $1 million to $2 million a year in 1997 through \n     1999.\n       CBO judges that S. 269 would not lead to any savings in \n     Social Security, unemployment insurance, or other federal \n     benefits that are based on earning. S. 269 would deny \n     benefits if the alien was not legally authorized to work in \n     the United States. Since 1972, however, the law has ordered \n     the Social Security Administration to issue Social Security \n     numbers (SSNs) only to citizens and to aliens legally \n     authorized to work here. A narrow exception is ``nonwork'' \n     SSNs, granted for purposes such as enabling aliens to file \n     income taxes. Since all work performed by aliens who received \n     SSNs after 1972 is presumed to be legal, and since verifying \n     the work authorization of people who received SSNs before \n     1972 is an insuperable task, CBO estimates no savings in \n     these earnings-related benefits.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     direct spending or receipts through 1998. Because several \n     sections of this bill would affect receipts and direct \n     spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. These effects \n     are summarized in the following table.\n\n                [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1996       1997       1998  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays......................          0       -450       -927\nChange in receipts.....................          0         14        13 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Estimates do not include potential costs of establishing a       \n  program to reimburse state and local governments for the full cost of \n  providing emergency medical care to illegal aliens. These costs could \n  amount to as much as $1.5 billion to $3 billion a year.               \n\n       8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: See the enclosed intergovernmental mandates \n     statement.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: See the enclosed \n     private sector mandates statement.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On March 4, 1996, CBO provided \n     an estimate of H.R. 2202, an immigration reform bill reported \n     by the House Committee on the Judiciary. (The bill was \n     subsequently passed by the House, with amendments.) That bill \n     had many provisions in common with S. 269. However, the \n     deeming restrictions proposed in H.R. 2202 applied \n     exclusively to future entrants; aliens who entered before the \n     enactment date would not have been affected. Therefore, S. \n     269--which would apply deeming to aliens who entered in the \n     last 5 years as well as to future entrants--would result in \n     larger savings in many benefit programs. Also, projected \n     discretionary spending under S. 269 would be less than under \n     H.R. 2202.\n       In 1995, CBO prepared many estimates of welfare reform \n     proposals that would have curtailed the eligibility of legal \n     aliens for public assistance. Examples include the budget \n     reconciliation bill (H.R. 2491) and the welfare reform bill \n     (H.R. 4), both of which were vetoed.\n       11.

Bill number: S. 269.\n       2. Bill title: Immigration Control and Financial \n     Responsibility Act of 1996.\n       3. Bill status: As reported, by the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary on April 10, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 269 would make changes and additions to \n     federal laws relating to immigration.\n       5. Private sector mandates contained in the bill: Several \n     provisions of the bill would impose new requirements on the \n     private sector. In general, the private sector mandates in S. \n     269 lie in three areas: (1) provisions that affect the \n     transportation industry, (2) provisions that affect aliens \n     within the borders of the United States, and (3) provisions \n     that affect individuals who sponsor aliens and execute \n     affidavits of support. The estimated impacts of these \n     mandates do not include any costs imposed on individuals not \n     within the borders of the United States.\n       6. Estimated direct cost to the private sector: CBO \n     estimates that the direct costs of private sector mandates \n     identified in S. 269 would be less than $100 million annually \n     through 1999, but would rise to over $100 million in 2000 and \n     $300 million in 2001. In 2002 and thereafter, the direct \n     costs would exceed $600 million annually. The large majority \n     of those costs would be imposed on sponsors of aliens who \n     execute affidavits of support, such costs are now borne by \n     the federal government and state and local governments for \n     the provision of benefits under public assistance programs. \n     Assuming enactment of S. 260 this summer, CBO expects that \n     the mandates in the bill would be effective beginning in \n     fiscal year 1997.\n     Basis of estimate\n       Title I, subtitle A--Law enforcement\n       Section 151 would impose new mandates on the transportation \n     industry--in particular, those carriers arriving in the U.S. \n     from overseas. Agents that transport stowaways to the U.S., \n     even unknowingly, would be responsible for detaining them and \n     for the costs associated with their removal. This mandate is \n     not expected to impose large costs on the transportation \n     industry. Over the last two years a total of only about 2000 \n     stowaways have been detained.\n       Section 154 would require aliens who seek to become \n     permanent residents to show documented proof that they have \n     been immunized against a list of diseases classified as \n     ``vaccine-preventable'' by the Advisory Committee on \n     Immunization Practices. That requirement would impose costs \n     on aliens who were not immunized previously or were unable to \n     document that they had been immunized. Some of the costs \n     might be paid for by state and local governments through \n     public clinics. The total cost of the mandate to\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\n     aliens residing in the United States would be expected to be \n     less than $40 million a year.\n       Section 155 would impose two new requirements on aliens in \n     the U.S. who seek to adjust their status to permanent \n     resident for the purpose of working as nonphysician health \n     care workers. First, those aliens would be required to \n     present a certificate from the Commission on Graduates of \n     Foreign Nursing Schools (or an equivalent body) that verifies \n     that the alien's education, training, license, and experience \n     meet standards comparable to those required for domestically \n     trained health care workers employed in the same occupation. \n     Second, those aliens would be required to attain a certain \n     score on a standardized test of oral and written English \n     language proficiency.\n       The aggregate direct costs of complying with the new \n     requirements imposed on nonphysician health care workers \n     would depend on several factors: the number of aliens that \n     attempt to adjust their status to permanent resident for the \n     purpose of becoming a nonphysician health care worker; the \n     costs of obtaining proof of certification and of taking an \n     English language test; and the cost of conforming to the \n     higher standard for those not initially qualified who would \n     attempt to do so. At this point CBO does not have \n     quantitative information on these factors but we do not \n     believe that the aggregate direct costs of these mandates \n     would be substantial. Nevertheless, for certain individuals \n     the cost of meeting these requirements would be large.\n       Title II--Financial responsibility\n       Title II would impose new requirements on citizens and \n     permanent residents who execute affidavits of support for \n     legal immigrants. At present, immigrants who are expected \n     to become public charges must obtain a financial sponsor \n     who signs an affidavit of support. A portion of the \n     sponsor's income is then ``deemed'' to the immigrant for \n     use in the means-test for several federal welfare \n     programs. Affidavits of support, however, are not legally \n     binding documents. S. 269 would make affidavits of support \n     legally binding, expand the responsibilities of financial \n     sponsors, and place an enforceable duty on sponsors to \n     reimburse the federal government or states for benefits \n     provided in certain circumstances.\n       Supporting aliens to prevent them from becoming public \n     charges would impose considerable costs on sponsors, who are \n     included in the private sector under the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995. CBO estimates that sponsors of immigrants \n     would face over $20 million in additional costs in 1997. \n     Costs would grow quickly, however. Over the period from 1998 \n     to 2001, assuming that affidavits of support would be \n     enforced, the costs to sponsors of immigrants would exceed \n     $100 million annually and would total about $500 million \n     during the first five years that the mandate would be \n     effective.\n       Other provisions\n       Several other provisions in S. 269 would impose new \n     mandates on citizens and aliens but would result in little or \n     no monetary cost. For example, Title II contains a new \n     mandate that would require sponsors to notify the federal and \n     state governments of any change of address. CBO estimates \n     that the direct cost of these provisions would be minimal.\n       Section 116 of Title I would change the acceptable \n     employment-verification documents and authorize the Attorney \n     General to require individuals to provide their Social \n     Security number on employment forms attesting that the \n     individual is not an unauthorized alien. CBO estimates that \n     the direct costs of complying with that requirement would \n     also be minimal.\n       Section 181 of Title I would add categories of aliens who \n     would not be permitted to adjust from non-immigrant to \n     immigrant status. Any alien not in a lawful immigrant status \n     would not be allowed to become an employment-based immigrant. \n     Also, aliens who were employed while an unauthorized alien, \n     or who had otherwise violated the terms of a nonimmigrant \n     visa, would not be allowed to become an immigrant. Although \n     these provisions would have significant impacts on certain \n     members of the private sector, there would be no direct costs \n     as defined by P.L. 104-4.\n       7. Previous CBO estimate: On March 13, 1996, CBO prepared a \n     private sector mandate statement on H.R. 2202, the \n     Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995, which was \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on \n     October 24, 1995.\n       8.

Bill Number: S. 269.\n       2. Bill title: Immigration Control and Financial \n     Responsibility Act of 1996.\n       3. Bill Status: As reported by the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary on April 10, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 269 would make many changes and \n     additions to federal laws relating to immigration. The bill \n     would also require changes to the administration of state and \n     local transportation, public health, and public assistance \n     programs. Demonstration projects for verifying immigration \n     status and for determining benefit eligibility would be \n     conducted in a number of states, pursuant to agreements \n     between those states and the Attorney General. Section 118 \n     would require state and local governments to adhere to \n     certain standards in the production of birth certificates, \n     driver's licenses, and identification documents. Sections 201 \n     and 203 would limit the eligibility of many aliens for public \n     assistance and other benefits. In addition, Title II would \n     authorize state and local governments to implement measures \n     to minimize or recoup costs associated with providing certain \n     benefits to legal and non-legal aliens.\n       5. Intergovernmental mandates contained in bill:\n       State and local governments that issue birth certificates \n     would be required to use safety paper that is tamper- and \n     counterfeit-resistant, comply with new regulations \n     established by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS), and prominently note on a copy of a birth certificate \n     if the person is known to be deceased.\n       State agencies issuing driver's licenses or identification \n     documents would be required either to print Social Security \n     numbers on these items or collect and verify the number \n     before issuance. They would also be required to comply with \n     new regulations to be established by the Department of \n     Transportation (DOT).\n       State employment security agencies would be required to \n     verify employment eligibility and complete attestations to \n     that effect prior to referring an individual to prospective \n     employers.\n       State and local agencies administering public assistance \n     and regulatory programs would be required to:\n       Deny eligibility in most state and local means-tested \n     benefit programs to non-legal aliens, including those \n     ``permanently residing under color of law'' (PRUCOL). \n     (PRUCOLS are aliens whose status is usually transitional or \n     involves an indefinite stay of deportation);\n       Weigh sponsors' income (a practice known as deeming) for 5 \n     years or longer after entry when gauging a legal alien's \n     eligibility for benefits in some large federal means-tested \n     entitlement programs;\n       Request reimbursement from sponsors via certified mail and \n     in compliance with Social Security Administration regulations \n     if notified that a sponsored alien has received benefits from \n     a means-tested program;\n       Notify, either individually or publicly, all ineligible \n     aliens who are receiving benefits or assistance that their \n     eligibility is to be terminated; and\n       Deny non-legal aliens and PRUCOLs the right to receive \n     grants, enter into contracts or loan agreements, or receive \n     or renew professional or commercial licenses.\n       State and local governments would be prohibited from \n     imposing any restrictions on the exchange of information \n     between governmental entities or officials and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) regarding the \n     immigration status of individuals.\n       6. Estimated direct cost of mandates on State, local, and \n     tribal governments:\n       (a) Is the $50 Million Threshold Exceeded? Yes.\n       (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates: CBO estimates that \n     these mandates would impose direct cost on state, local, and \n     tribal governments totaling between $80 million and $200 \n     million in fiscal year 1998. In the four subsequent years, \n     mandate costs would total less than $2 million annually. \n     State, local, and tribal governments could face additional \n     costs associated with the deeming requirements in each of the \n     5 years following enactment of the bill; however, CBO cannot \n     quantify such costs at this time.\n       S. 269 also includes a number of provisions that, while not \n     mandates, would result in significant net savings to state, \n     local, and tribal governments. CBO estimates these savings \n     could total several billion dollars over the next five years.\n       (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Authority: Not applicable.\n       7. Basis of estimate: Of the mandates listed above, the \n     requirements governing birth certificates and driver's \n     licenses would impose the most significant direct costs. The \n     bill would require issuers of birth certificates to use a \n     certain quality safety paper when providing copies to \n     individuals if those copies are to be acceptable for use at \n     any federal office or state agency that issues driver \n     licenses or identification documents. While many state \n     issuers are adequate quality safety paper, many local clerk \n     and registrar offices do not. The bill also requires states \n     either to collect Social Security numbers from driver's \n     license applicants or to print the number on the driver's \n     license card. While a significant number of states currently \n     use Social Security numbers as the driver's license number, \n     the most populous states neither print the number on the card \n     nor collect if for reference purposes.\n       For the purposes of preparing this estimate, CBO contacted \n     state and local governments, public interest groups \n     representing these governments, and a number of officials \n     from professional associations. Because of the variation in \n     the way state and local governments issue birth certificates, \n     we contacted clerks and registrars in eleven states in an \n     effort to assess the impact of the birth certificate \n     provisions. To estimate the cost of the driver's license \n     requirements, we contacted over twenty state government \n     transportation officials. Most state and local governments \n     charge fees for issuing driver's licenses and copies of birth \n     certificates. Those governments may choose to use revenues \n     from these fees to pay for the expenses associated with the \n     mandates. Under Public Law\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\n     104-4, however, these revenues are considered a means of \n     financing and as such cannot be counted against the \n     mandate costs of S.269.\n     Mandates with significant costs\n       Birth Certificates. Based on information from state \n     registrars of vital statistics, CBO estimates that 60 percent \n     of the approximately 18 million certified copies of birth \n     certificates issued each year in the United States are \n     printed on plain bond paper or low quality safety paper. CBO \n     assumed that state and local issuing agencies needing to \n     upgrade the quality of the paper would spend, on average, \n     about $0.10 per certificate. In addition, CBO expects the \n     bill would induce some individuals holding copies of birth \n     certificates that do not conform to the required standards to \n     request new birth certificates when they would not have \n     otherwise done so. CBO estimated that issuing agencies across \n     the country would experience a 20 percent increase in \n     requests for copies of birth certificates for at least five \n     years. On this basis, CBO estimates that the birth \n     certificate provisions in the bill would impose direct \n     printing and personnel costs on state and local governments \n     totaling at least $2 million per year in each of the five \n     years following the effective date of the provision. In \n     addition, some state and local governments would have to \n     replace or modify equipment in order to respond to the new \n     requirements. CBO estimates these one-time costs would not \n     exceed $5 million.\n       Driver's Licenses. Less than half of the states include \n     Social Security numbers on all driver's licenses or perform \n     some type of verification with the Social Security \n     Administration. In fact, the states with the highest \n     populations tend to be the states that do not have these \n     requirements, and some state laws prohibit the collection of \n     Social Security numbers for identification and driver's \n     license purposes. CBO estimates that of the 185 million \n     driver's licenses and identification cards in circulation, \n     less than 40 percent would be in compliance with the \n     requirements of S. 269. Any driver's license or \n     identification card that does not comply with those \n     requirements would be invalid for any evidentiary purpose.\n       Given the common use of these documents as legal \n     identifiers, CBO assumed that at least half of those \n     individuals who currently have driver's licenses or \n     identification cards that do not meet the requirements of S. \n     269 would seek early renewals. CBO assumed that states would \n     face additional printing costs of between $0.75 and $1.20 per \n     document, increased administrative costs resulting from the \n     influx of renewals, and, for some states, one time system \n     conversion costs. We estimate that direct costs, assuming a \n     limited number of additional renewal requests, would total \n     $80 million in the first year. If more people sought early \n     renewals, total costs could easily approach $200 million in \n     the first year.\n       The driver's license provisions in the bill would be \n     effective immediately upon enactment. Because of the \n     significant processing and administrative changes that states \n     would face under these requirements, CBO has assumed that \n     states would establish procedures for compliance in the year \n     following enactment. Consequently, the additional \n     expenditures resulting from reissuing licenses and \n     identification cards would occur in 1998.\n       Provision of Public Assistance to Aliens. It is possible \n     that the administrative costs associated with applying \n     deeming requirements to some federal means-tested entitlement \n     programs would be considered mandate costs as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4. In entitlement programs larger than $500 \n     million per year, an increase in the stringency of federal \n     conditions is considered a mandate only if states or \n     localities lack the authority to modify their programs to \n     accommodate the new requirements and still provide required \n     services. In some programs--such as Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps--some states may \n     lack such authority and any new requirements would thus \n     constitute a mandate. Given the scope and complexity of the \n     affected programs, however, CBO has not been able to estimate \n     either the likelihood or magnitude of such costs at this \n     time. These costs could be significant, depending on how \n     strictly the deeming requirements are enforced by the federal \n     government. Any additional costs, however, would be offset at \n     least partially by reduced caseloads in some programs.\n     Mandates with no significant costs\n       Many of the mandates in S. 269 would not result in \n     measurable budgetary impacts on state, local, or tribal \n     governments. In some cases--eligibility restrictions based on \n     non-legal status and death notations on birth certificates--\n     the bill's requirements simply restate current law or \n     practice for many of the jurisdictions with large populations \n     and would thus result in little costs or savings. In others--\n     sponsor reimbursement requests and preemption of laws \n     restricting the flow of information to and from the INS--the \n     provisions would result in minor administrative costs for \n     some state and local governments, but even in aggregate, CBO \n     estimates these amounts would be insignificant.\n       The provision requiring agencies to notify certain aliens \n     that their eligibility for benefits has been terminated would \n     impose direct costs on state and local governments. CBO \n     estimates such costs would be offset by savings from caseload \n     reduction resulting from the notifications. Another \n     provision--state job service verification of employment \n     eligibility--may result in significant administrative costs; \n     however, those costs are funded through federal \n     appropriations.\n       8. Appropriation or other Federal financial assistance \n     provided in bill to cover mandate costs: None.\n       9. Other impacts on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 269 contains many additional provisions that, while not \n     mandates or changes to existing mandates, could have \n     significant impacts on the budgets of state and local \n     governments. On balance, CBO expects that the provisions \n     discussed in this section would result in an overall net \n     savings to state and local governments.\n     Means-tested Federal programs\n       S. 269 would result in significant savings to state and \n     local governments by reducing the number of legal aliens \n     receiving means-tested benefits through federal programs, \n     including Medicaid, AFDC, and Supplemental Security Income \n     (SSI). These federal programs are administered by state or \n     local governments and have matching requirements for \n     participation. Thus, reductions in caseloads would reduce \n     state and local, as well as federal, outlays in these \n     programs. CBO estimates that the savings to state and local \n     governments would exceed $2 billion over the next five years. \n     These are significant and real savings, but in general, the \n     state and local impacts of these federal programs are not \n     defined as mandates under Public Law 104-4.\n       S. 269 would reduce caseloads in means-tested federal \n     programs primarily by placing stricter eligibility \n     requirements on both recent and future legal entrants. The \n     bill would lengthen the time sponsored aliens must wait \n     before they can go on AFDC or SSI, and, most notably, apply \n     such a waiting period to the Medicaid program. S. 269 would \n     also deny many means-tested benefits to PRUCOLs. Illegal \n     aliens are currently ineligible for most federal assistance \n     programs and would remain so under the proposed law.\n     Means-tested State and local programs\n       It is likely that some aliens displaced from federal \n     assistance programs would turn to assistance programs funded \n     by state and local governments, thereby increasing the costs \n     of these programs. While several provisions in the bill could \n     mitigate these costs--strengthening affidavits of support by \n     sponsors, allowing the recovery of costs from sponsors, and \n     authorizing agencies to deem in state and local means-tested \n     programs--CBO expects that such tools would be used only in \n     limited circumstances in the near future. At some point, \n     state and, particularly, local governments become the \n     providers of last resort, and as such, we anticipate that \n     they would face added financial pressures on their public \n     assistance programs that would at least partially offset the \n     savings they realize from the federal programs. Because \n     these state and local programs are voluntary activities of \n     those governments, increases in the costs of these \n     programs are not mandate costs.\n     Medicaid\n       Emergency Medical Services. Section 212 of S. 269 is \n     apparently intended to offer state and local governments full \n     reimbursement for the costs of providing emergency medical \n     services to non-legal aliens and PRUCOLs on the condition \n     that they follow verification procedures to be established by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after \n     consultation with the Attorney General and state and local \n     officials. Existing law requires that state and local \n     governments provide these services and, under current \n     matching requirements, pay approximately half of the costs. \n     Ambiguities in the drafting of the provision prevent CBO from \n     estimating its effect.\n       While no reliable totals are available of the amounts \n     currently spent to provide the services, areas with large \n     alien populations claim that this requirement results in a \n     substantial drain on their budgets. For example, California, \n     with almost half the country's illegal alien population, \n     estimates it spends over $350 million each year on these \n     federally mandated services. Although CBO cannot estimate the \n     effects of Section 212 on state and local governments, some \n     idea of its potential effects can be gained by looking at \n     analogous proposals for the Medicaid program. CBO estimates \n     that modifying Medicaid to reimburse states and localities \n     for the full cost of emergency care for illegal aliens would \n     increase federal Medicaid payments to states by $1.5 billion \n     to $3 billion per year.\n       Pre- and Post--Partum Care. The bill would allow certain \n     mothers who are non-legal aliens to qualify for pre- and \n     post-partum care under the Medicaid program. CBO does not \n     have enough information to estimate the potential budget \n     impacts to state and local governments of this provision. \n     Such impacts would depend critically on the type of \n     documentation demanded by the Secretary of HHS to prove that \n     the mothers met the requirement of 3 years of continuous \n     residence in the United States.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On March 13, 1996, CBO prepared \n     an intergovernmental mandates statement on H.R. 2202, an \n     immigration reform bill reported by the House Committee on \n     the Judiciary. (The bill was subsequently passed by the \n     House, with amendments.) That bill had many provisions in \n     common with S. 269. H.R. 2202 did not, however, include any \n     of the requirements relating to driver's licenses, \n     identification documents, or birth certificates that appear \n     in S. 269. In addition, the deeming restrictions in H.R. 2202 \n     applied exclusively to future entrants; aliens who entered \n     before the enactment date would not have been affected. \n     Therefore, S. 269--which would apply deeming to aliens who \n     entered in the last five\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n     years as well as to future entrants--would produce larger net \n     savings in many benefit programs.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: Leo Lex and Karen McVey.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first state that I want to \ncongratulate my colleague from Wyoming, as well as my colleague from \nMassachusetts, for not just the work they have done on this bill, but, \nfrankly, for the work they have done over the years on this very tough, \nvery contentious, very difficult, but very important issue of \nimmigration.\n  I have heard my colleague from Wyoming say on several occasions, as \nwe have debated this bill in committee, that this is not really a bill \nor an issue that anyone gets a lot out of politically, and certainly \nnot someone from the State of Wyoming. I certainly concur in that and \nunderstand that. I want to congratulate him for really doing the tough \nwork of the U.S. Senate--work that began in the 1980's with the \nprevious bill and continues on today. It is work that is many times not \nrewarded politically, certainly not appreciated many times, and is many \ntimes very controversial. I congratulate him for that.\n  This has been a contentious bill. We have had contentious debate in \ncommittee. The Senator from Wyoming and I have agreed on some issues \nand disagreed on other issues. I imagine that agreement and \ndisagreement is probably going to continue on the floor today, \ntomorrow, and maybe for the rest of the week. Let me state that I do \nappreciate very much his tremendous work, as well as the work of \nSenator Kennedy and, frankly, the work of all of the members of the \nsubcommittee, some of whom have been involved in this task now for well \nover a decade.\n  Mr. President, we are here on the floor today to discuss a \nfundamental issue, a fundamental issue affecting the future of our \ncountry. Unlike most bills that come before Congress, this immigration \nbill really gets to the question of our national identity. Unlike most \nbills, this bill really speaks to who we are as a people, who we are as \na nation. Quite frankly, also unlike most bills we deal with, the \nimpact of this bill is going to be felt in 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, \n20 years, and 30 years, because when you make a determination of who \ncomes into this country and who does not come into this country, the \nconsequences are profound, they are everlasting, and we have seen that, \nfrankly, throughout the long history of our country.\n  Mr. President, in the darkest days of the cold war, back when \nBrezhnev was still ruling what was then known as the Soviet Union, \nRonald Reagan gave a historic address to the British Parliament. It was \nin that famous speech in June 1982 that President Reagan predicted, \n``The march of freedom and democracy will leave Marxism and Leninism on \nthe ash heap of history.'' Many of us remember how controversial that \nstatement was at the time. Some in this country considered it \nunnecessarily provocative, and thought that it would inflame our \nenemies for really no good purpose. Mr. President, it may have been \nprovocative, but it was absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, \nprophetic. It was true. In that speech, Ronald Reagan was trying to \nunify the West. He wanted to unify the forces of freedom for what he \nknew, as others did not, would be the climactic days of the struggle \nagainst communism.\n\n  In the last resort, what President Reagan appealed to in that speech \nwas really our sense of identity, who we were, who we are. This is what \nhe said:\n\n       Let us ask ourselves: What kind of a people do we think we \n     are? And let us answer: Free people, worthy of freedom and \n     determined not only to remain so, but to help others gain \n     their freedom, as well.\n\n  Ronald Reagan expressed, better than any political leader of my \nlifetime, a sense of what America really is--``the city on a hill, the \nland, the country of the future.'' When Ronald Reagan was a boy growing \nup in Illinois, he could still find Civil War veterans to talk to. In \nour time, over a century after the death of Abraham Lincoln, Ronald \nReagan reminded us that America was still the last best hope of Earth. \nWe must never, never forget this, Mr. President.\n  To turn our backs on this legacy--this legacy of hope, optimism, \nopenness to the future--would be more than a mistake in policy. It \nwould, I believe, Mr. President, truly be a diminution of who we are as \na people. That is what I believe this immigration debate is all about. \nIt is the same question Ronald Reagan asked to the British Parliament: \n``What kind of people do we think we are?''\n  Mr. President, America's immigration policy defines who we are. It \ndefines who gets into this country and who does not get in. In the \nprocess, it says a lot about our national values. Mr. President, we \nhave been working on this bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee for a \nnumber of weeks. I believe we made some progress in revising the bill \nto reflect what I believe are the basic American values. First, the \ncommittee split the portions of the bill dealing with illegal \nimmigration. An amendment was offered by Senator Abraham, myself, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Feingold, and others, to split the bill. The \ncommittee did, in fact, split the bill. It divided the bill into those \nsections dealing with the treatment of persons who are in the United \nStates illegally from those provisions that cover legal immigration. I \nsupport this split because I believe that the problem of illegal \nimmigration is substantially different from the issues raised by our \nlegal immigration policy. And, therefore, these two issues, in my \nopinion, should be treated separately. They are distinct. I intend \nlater on to say more about this important issue.\n\n  Mr. President, in considering the illegal immigration bill, I voted \nfor tough penalties for those who violate our immigration laws, and I \nvoted to expedite the deportation of those violators. I am also proud \nto say that I sponsored an amendment to block the imposition of \nunreasonable time limits on persons seeking asylum from repressive and \noften life-threatening foreign regimes. Our amendment sought to restore \nthe status quo.\n  Today, immigration authorities cannot enter farm property without a \nsearch warrant. The bill before the committee would have changed that \nand would have allowed them to enter property--to enter a farm--without \nthat search warrant. I sponsored an amendment to make sure they did not \nget that evasive new power.\n  Further, Mr. President, I cosponsored an amendment with Senators \nAbraham and Feingold that would have removed from the bill a provision \nthat establishes a national employment verification system and a \nnational standards for birth certificates and driver's licenses. I \nbelieve that these provisions are unduly intrusive. And, quite frankly, \nI believe they are unworkable. I further believe they would cost \ntaxpayers millions and millions and millions of dollars. Again, Mr. \nPresident, I intend to say a great deal more about this later on.\n  Let me turn to the legal immigration bill. On the legal immigration \nbill, with Senators Abraham and Kennedy, I cosponsored an amendment to \nallow legal immigrants to bring their families to join them here in the \nUnited States. The bill, as originally written, tried to change the law \nallowing U.S. citizens to bring their families to America. The bill \nwould have permitted, as written, U.S. citizens to bring in only their \nspouses, minor children, and in rare cases their parents. Under that \nprovision, as the bill was written before the amendment--I bring this \nup because I am sure this issue is going to come back again--a U.S. \ncitizen under that provision of the bill as written would have been \npermitted to bring some children in but not others. I believe that is \nbad national policy. It undermines the family structure. And, frankly, \nin the history of civilization there has never been a stronger support \nstructure than the family.\n  I also supported amendments that would continue to allow universities \nand businesses to bring in the best and the brightest to enrich our \ncountry. I intend to return to that issue as well later.\n  Mr. President, in all of our deliberations in the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have stressed one key fact about America--the fact that \nthroughout our national history, throughout our history, the effect of \nimmigration on this country has been positive. Immigration has helped \nform the basis for our prosperity and our national strength. It has\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nmade our country and the world a better place.\n\n  I tried to approach these difficult issues keeping in mind that a \nfair, controlled but open immigration policy is in our national \ninterest. I believe we have made the first significant steps in this \nbill in the committee, in the amendment process, toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, even though we managed to improve the bill in a number \nof ways, I still have some problems with the present bill. In the name \nof protecting our borders, this bill would impose serious burdens on \nlaw-abiding American citizens, and it would move America away from its \nextremely valuable centuries-old tradition of openness to new people \nand new ideas.\n  Let me now go through the bill and lay out some of the particular \nconcerns I have about the bill as it is currently before us today.\n  First, let me start with the very contentious issue of verification--\nthe verification of employment. To begin with, the bill would create a \nmassive time-consuming and error-prone bureaucracy. As originally \nwritten, the bill called for a process under which every employer would \nhave to contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Social \nSecurity Administration to verify the citizenship of every prospective \nemployee. My colleague from Ohio, Congressman Steve Chabot, called this \n1-800-BIG-BROTHER. I think he is right. We did succeed in taking that \nprovision out of the bill, or at least taking part of it out of the \nbill. But the long-term plan remains the same. In fact, the bill now \ncontains a provision calling for numerous entitlement programs to do \nthe very same thing.\n  I have had some experience in dealing with this kind of extremely \nlarge computerized database. My experience is from my time as \nLieutenant Governor in Ohio when we were dealing with the criminal \nrecord system database. I contend that what I have learned from trying \nto improve, correct, and refine the criminal database is very \napplicable and very relevant to this whole discussion about our attempt \nto create a database for employees and employers.\n  When I was Lieutenant Governor, I was responsible for improving \nOhio's criminal database so that the police could have ready access to \na suspect's full criminal record history. When I started on this \nproject, I was shocked to discover that in the State of Ohio--these \nfigures are true in most States--only about 5 percent of the files, 5 \npercent of the computer information you got in a printout when you \ntalked about a suspect, it put a suspect's name in and only about 5 \npercent of the information was accurate in regard to important facts--5 \npercent.\n  In criminal records, we are dealing with a database that we all know \nis important, that the people know is important, that we take a great \ndeal of care in maintaining, and that is limited to the relatively \nsmall number of citizens who are actually criminals. In fact, when we \ndeal with the criminal record system, we know that literally life and \ndeath decisions are being made based on the accuracy of that criminal \nrecord system, and we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to \nbring it up to date, to make it more accurate, and yet we still know \nthat it is highly error prone. We still know the accuracy level is \nvery, very low.\n  Mr. President, I shudder to think what the inaccuracy rate will be in \na database big enough to include every single citizen and noncitizen \nresiding in this country. I shudder to think of what the accuracy or \nthe inaccuracy level will be when we are dealing with a database where \nlife and death decisions are not actually being made but, rather, where \nemployment decisions are being made. The database will be unreliable. \nIt would be time consuming, and it would be expensive.\n  In fact, the only way to make a database more reliable is frankly to \nmake it more intrusive, and that clearly is what will happen. Once the \npilot projects are running and we determine how inaccurate that \ninformation is, once the complaints start coming in from prospective \nemployees and from employers who are dialing the 1-800 number, or \nputting the information in and we find out how inaccurate that is, \nthere will be pressure to change it. And the pressure will be to make \nit, frankly, more intrusive--more information, more accurate. I believe \nthat it would clearly lay the groundwork for a national system within 3 \nyears.\n  Let me turn, if I can, Mr. President, to my second concern about this \nbill. That concerns the national standards for birth certificates and \ndrivers' licenses. Yes, you have heard me correctly. In this Congress \nwhere we have talked about returning power to the States, returning \nauthority to the States, this bill calls for national, federally \nimposed and federally enforced standards for birth certificates and \ndrivers' licenses. Here is what the bill says as written, as it is on \nthe floor today.\n\n       Section 118. Improvements in Identification-Related \n     Documents.\n\n  (a) Birth certificates.\n\n       1. Limitation on Acceptance. (A) No Federal agency, \n     including but not limited to the Social Security \n     Administration and the Department of State--\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       and no State agency that issues driver's licenses or \n     identification documents, may accept for any official purpose \n     a copy of a birth certificate, as defined in subparagraph \n     (5), unless it is issued by a State or local government \n     registrar and it conforms to standards described in \n     subparagraph (B).\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       (B) The standards described in this subparagraph are those \n     set forth in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, after consultation with the \n     Association of Public Health Statistics and Information \n     Systems, and shall include but not be limited to.\n       (i) certification by the agency issuing the birth \n     certificate, and.\n       (ii) use of safety paper, the seal of the issuing agency, \n     and other features designed to limit tampering, \n     counterfeiting, and use by impostors.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to talk about this later, but I think it is \nimportant to pause for a moment and look at what this section does \nbecause it does in fact tell each State in the country, each local \njurisdiction what it has to do in regard to issuing birth certificates. \nIt in essence says for the 270 million people in this country the birth \ncertificate you have is valid; you just cannot use it for anything. It \nis valid, it is OK, but if you want to take a trip and you want to get \na passport, you have to go back to wherever you were born and have them \nissue a new birth certificate that complies with these national \nstandards.\n  Think about it. Think about what impact this is going to have on the \nlocal communities, the cost it is going to have. Think about the \ninconvenience this is going to bring up for every American who uses a \nbirth certificate to do practically anything--getting a driver's \nlicense, for example. And look at the language again. Not just no \nFederal agency may accept for any official purpose a copy of a birth \ncertificate unless it fits this requirement but then the language goes \non further and says no State agency.\n  So here we have the Federal Government saying to 50 States, no State \nagency shall be allowed to accept a birth certificate unless it fits \nthe standards as prescribed by a bureaucrat in Washington, DC. Tenth \namendment? Unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable. There are clear \nconstitutional law problems in regard to this. Senator Thompson, who is \non the committee, raised these issues in the committee and it is clear \nthat this section has some very major constitutional law problems.\n  Here is in essence what this means. The Federal Government will tell \nevery citizen that his or her birth certificate is no longer good \nenough for any of the major purposes for which it is used--not good \nenough for traveling, not good enough for getting married, not good \nenough for going to school, not good enough for getting a driver's \nlicense. How about constituent problems? We are all going to have to \nhire more caseworkers back in our home States when this goes into \neffect just to answer the phone and listen to people complain about \nthis. How many people every year turn 16 and get their driver's \nlicense? How many people every year want to travel overseas, want to \nget a passport? Try telling them that birth certificate you got stuck \nin the drawer back home you used 5 years ago for something else, ``Yes, \nit is still OK, you cannot use it, you have to go get a new one.'' \nAbsolutely unbelievable.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. This bill would require every local county to redo its \nentire\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nbirth certificate system in a new federally mandated format. The \nFederal Government will be telling Greene County, OH, everything to do \nwith the certificate right down to what kind of paper to use. And the \nbill goes even further. Not only does it deal with birth certificates, \nit also deals with driver's licenses, and here is what the bill says. \nLet me quote.\n\n       Each State's driver's license and identification document \n     shall be in a form consistent with requirements set forth in \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation.\n\n  It continues.\n\n       Neither the Social Security Administration nor the passport \n     office or any other Federal agency or any State or local \n     government agency may accept for any evidentiary purpose a \n     State driver's license or identification document in a form \n     other than the form described in paragraph (3).\n\n  That means every State will have to issue federally mandated driver's \nlicenses. It is my opinion this whole section of the bill, section 118, \nshould be deleted.\n  Now, I understand what my friend from Wyoming is trying to accomplish \nhere. And it is a laudable goal. I understand what other proponents are \ntrying to accomplish. Most States would have no problem I think with an \nattempt to improve their driver's license. In fact, in my home State of \nOhio we have come up in the last several years with a process that was \nput in place when I was Lieutenant Governor, with a brand new driver's \nlicense system, so when your license comes up for its normal renewal \nyou have what we believe at least is a tamperproof driver's license. I \nunderstand, and I think most States want to move in that direction, \nmost States are in fact moving in that direction, but to mandate this \nfrom Washington with the tremendous costs, and not just the costs but \nthe unbelievable disruption and inconvenience I think is just a serious \nmistake. There is some great irony that this Congress, which has very \nlegitimately and correctly been so concerned about turning power back \nto the States, should in this case be saying not only are we not \nturning power back to the States, we are taking power; we are taking a \nbasic ministerial function of government, issuing a birth certificate, \na basic function of State government and county government, local \ngovernment, and saying, ``We are going to tell you how to do it, and if \nyou don't do it our way, you can't use that document even for State \npurposes.'' To me that is just wrong. It is taking us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has revived this great tradition, \nAmerican tradition of State and local and individual freedom as \nenshrined in the 10th amendment.\n  To impose this huge new burden on individuals and on local \ncommunities will surely violate that principle. In fact, if we can \nthink back that far, 15, 16 months ago, one of the first bills passed \nby this Congress was legislation to try to limit unfunded mandates. If \nthis provision is not an unfunded mandate, I do not know what is. It is \ngoing to cost the States a lot of money to comply. And it is going to \ncost taxpayers, both through what it has cost the States, but also \nthrough what it is going to cost them in getting new birth \ncertificates, new drivers' licenses.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, these mandates would \nimpose direct costs on States, direct costs on States and local \ncommunities of between $80 million to $200 million. Those of us who \nused to work at State and local government know that $80 to $200 \nmillion is an awful lot of money. It is real money.\n  Finally, leaving decisions regarding what features these documents \nshould contain to Federal bureaucrats--and that is what this bill does, \nnot to Congress but to Federal bureaucrats--I believe is unwise and \npotentially dangerous. Under the current language of this bill, as we \nconsider it today, the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nDepartment of Transportation could develop standards even more \nintrusive and even more costly than those spelled out in the original \nlegislation, because, really, the way the bill is written today, they \nhave more freedom, more flexibility--the bureaucrats do.\n  I do not believe the setting of standards like these should be left \nto the Federal bureaucracy with nothing more than a requirement that \nthey consult with outside groups. The bill does not provide for any \ncongressional review of the standards, nor does it impose any limit on \nwhat HHS and DOT can mandate. The provision is ill-conceived and \ncontrary to any reasonable concern for our liberties. I will urge it be \ndeleted.\n  Let me turn now to another area of concern. That has to do with the \nissue of asylum. The bill, as written, says something to people who \nwant to apply for asylum in America, and says it, really, for the first \ntime in our history. I want to emphasize this. For the first time in \nour history, this is what we will be saying to people who apply for \nasylum: You must now apply for asylum within a set period of time.\n  That may sound reasonable. First of all, it is contrary to what we \nhave done previously in the long history of this country. And, I think, \non closer examination, as we go through this, it will become clear why \nthis seemingly innocent provision will inevitably lead to some very, \nvery great hardships for some of the most abused people in the world. \nIt says that an asylum seeker must apply within 1 year of arriving in \nthis country or else get a special exception from some bureaucrat for \n``good cause.'' You get an exception for good cause. What constitutes \ngood cause for an exception is, again, up to the Federal bureaucracy to \ndefine.\n  I think this is a terrible solution. It is a solution for a problem \nthat does not exist. I will talk about this in a moment. But, if we had \nbeen on the floor a few years ago, no one could say there was not a \nproblem with the processing of asylums, with the number of applications \nfor asylum, because there was. But, frankly, changes have been made in \nthe system, changes which have corrected the problem. There is not a \nmassive influx of asylum seekers into America and there is already a \nreasonable judicial process to determine which applicants are worthy of \nadmission. Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers get in, one of five \ngets in anyway, through this normal, regular process. The system, \nfrankly, is not broken, and trying to fix it could and would, in my \nopinion, do serious harm to people who are trying to escape oppression, \ntorture, and even death in their native lands.\n  If you talk, as I have, to people in the asylum community, people who \ndeal with these issues and who deal with these people every day, they \nwill tell you that some of the most heart-wrenching cases involve \npeople who are so emotionally scarred by torture that it takes them \nmore than a year to come forward and seek asylum. Under the original \nbill, aliens seeking asylum would have been required to file for such \nasylum within 30 days of arriving in the United States. Along with \nSenators Kennedy, Feingold, Abraham and others, I worked to defeat this \nprovision during our work in the committee. We were able to do that and \nto change it and to extend it to 1 year. This 1-year provision still \ncauses problems. Let me talk about that.\n\n  First, since the Immigration and Naturalization Service imposed new \nasylum application regulations in late 1994, the flagrant abuses of the \nasylum process have been substantially reduced already.\n  Second, it turns out that it is the people most deserving of asylum \nstatus, those under threat of retaliation, those suffering physical or \nmental disability, especially when abused resulting from torture, who \nwould most be hurt by the imposition of any filing deadline.\n  The committee did make the change. It made the change to strike the \n30-day provision by a vote of 16 to 1. But I believe we do need to go \nfurther and we need to restore the bill and the law to the status quo. \nThe committee passed an amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown]. Senator Brown's language is currently in the \nbill, and I believe, as I said, it is far better than the original 30-\nday limit. But I do remain convinced the arguments that were so simple \nand compelling against the 30-day time limit are equally compelling \nagainst the provision as it stands now. Let me talk about that.\n  First, because the asylum system works, and works pretty well--I do \nnot think there is any dispute about that--we simply do not need a time \nlimit for\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nasylum seekers. As I stated, we acknowledged several years ago the \nasylum system was in fact broken and there were serious problems. Under \nthe old system, people could get a work authorization simply by \napplying for asylum. That is what they did, and that was the hole.\n  This opportunity became a magnet, even for those who had absolutely \nno realistic claim for asylum. But the INS changed this. When the INS \nchanged its rules in late 1994, it stopped automatically awarding work \npermits for those filing for asylum, and it got rid of a great deal of \nthe problem. The INS then began to require an adjudication of the \nasylum claim before it awarded work authorizations. It also, at the \nsame time, began resolving asylum claims within 180 days.\n  The results are significant. According to the INS, in 1994, before \nthe new rules were put in place, 123,000 people claimed asylum. In \n1995, after the new rules were established, only 53,000 people even \napplied for asylum. Instantly you went from 123,000 who applied one \nyear, the next year down to 53,000; that is a 57 percent decline in \njust 1 year.\n  Also, the INS reports it is now completing 84 percent of the new \ncases within 60 days of filing and 98 percent, virtually all new cases, \nwithin 180 days of filing. Maybe that is why the administration, the \nINS, opposed any time limit on filing. The new system works. It is not \nbroken. It does not need to be fixed.\n  The new system works, and the new deadlines would--and here I quote \nthe INS Commissioner. Here is what she says. The new proposal would \n``divert resources from adjudicating the merits of asylum applications \nto adjudication of the timeliness of filing.'' So what the INS is \nsaying is that we fixed this problem, it is working, do not give us \nanother mandate. Do not shift us over here, so we have to have separate \nadjudications about the timeliness and then go over and adjudicate the \nmerits. Let us proceed the way we are doing today. It is working.\n  Point No. 2, why we really should not have this time limit. This, to \nme, is the most compelling, because the facts are the most worthy cases \nfor asylum would be excluded if we impose a deadline.\n  Among those excluded would be cases of victims of politically \nmotivated torture and rape, the very people who need more time to \napply, the very people who deadlines would hurt the most. These are the \npeople who have suffered a great trauma that prevents them from coming \nforward. These are the people who fear that coming forward for asylum \nwould threaten their families and friends in their home countries. \nThese are the two types of people, Mr. President, for whom time is \nimportant.\n  Time can cure the personal trauma and culture shock that prevents \nthem from seeking asylum. Time can allow conditions to change back \nhome. A time limit--any time limit--will place these people at risk.\n  Let us talk now about some real people.\n  One man, whose name is Gabriel, had a father who was chairman of a \nsocial democratic party in Nigeria. His father was arrested many times. \nHis half-brother was executed for opposing the military regime. Gabriel \nparticipated in a student demonstration. He was arrested and imprisoned \nback home for 8 months. He was tortured by guards who carved the \ninitials of the ruling general into his stomach and then sprayed pepper \non the wounds. They whipped him, and they forced him to drink his own \nurine.\n  Gabriel fled to the United States and, understandably, he was \nterrified that if he applied for asylum, he would be sent back to \nNigeria where he could be murdered. He only applied for asylum after he \nwas arrested by the INS, 5 years after coming to America.\n  Let me give another example--and the list goes on. Another man was a \nmember of his country's government in exile, elected in a democratic \nelection that was later annulled. When the military took over his \ncountry, many of the members of the government were tortured and \nimprisoned. This particular man fled his country and came to the United \nStates where he sought the United Nations' help in restoring democracy \nat home. He sought residence in other countries, and he was concerned \nthat application for asylum in this country would be used for \npropaganda purposes by the military at his home country.\n  Fifteen months after arriving in the United States, he did seek \nasylum. Although he was highly educated, although he was proficient in \nthe English language, it took this man over 2 months to file that \napplication. He was finally granted asylum in the United States, but to \nthis day, he has asked that his name, that his home country and the \nfact that he sought asylum be held in the strictest confidence. He is \nstill fearful.\n  A third example. Another man was a political dissident against the \nregime in Zaire. He published an article about the slaughter of \nstudents who had demonstrated against the regime, and that was one of \nthe political offenses that ultimately landed this man in jail. In \nprison, the guards beat him, the guards raped him. When he came to the \nUnited States, he was simply unable to talk about his story. His \nChristian beliefs did not permit him to use the words necessary to \ndescribe the terrible tortures he had undergone. It was only after many \nmeetings with legal representatives that he was finally able to tell \nhis story. He finally applied for asylum over a year after entering the \nUnited States.\n  Those are just three examples, Mr. President. There really is \npractically no end to these examples, practically no end to worthy \ncases that would be foreclosed should we decide to apply deadlines. I \nknow proponents of a time limit will argue that the bill does contain \nan escape clause, and it does on paper, the good-cause provision. But I \nthink it is significant to point out that under this good-cause \nprovision, the burden is on the applicant to show good cause. And the \nquestion of what constitutes good cause is really another problem with \nthe bill.\n  In the report language, it says good cause ``could include''--note \nthat, Mr. President, not ``must'' or ``should'' but ``could'' include--\n``circumstances that changed after the applicant entered the United \nStates''--I am quoting now--``or physical or mental disability, or \nthreats of retribution against the applicant's relatives or other \nextenuating circumstances.''\n  The report, as written, would allow the issuance of Federal \nregulations that might exclude the very type of applicants that the \ncommittee specifically intended to include. I believe that we should \nreject the time limit outright. We are not really talking about mere \nlegalisms here. I think what is at stake is a fundamental reassertion \nof a truly basic, bedrock value of America: the opportunity to apply \nfor asylum, the opportunity to use this country as a refuge.\n  I think it is important to note, as I did a moment ago, that there is \nnot a problem. The INS has already taken care of this problem. What \nthis bill does is create a problem--not for us, but what it will do is \ncreate a problem for people who are among the most abused, who have \nsuffered the most and who seek freedom in this country.\n  I am reminded in this context of another story that President Reagan \nused to tell. He said, ``Some years ago, two friends of mine were \ntalking with a Cuban refugee who had escaped from Castro. In the midst \nof the tale of horrible experiences, one friend turned to the other and \nsaid, `We don't know how lucky we are.' One Cuban stopped and said, \n`How lucky you are? How lucky you are? I have someplace to escape to.' \n''\n  At this point, as he told the story, President Reagan looked out at \nAmerica and drew his conclusion, and this is what he said: ``Let's keep \nit that way.''\n  Mr. President, let us keep it that way. Let us keep the light on over \nthe door of America for some people who very desperately need that \nlight, who need that hope.\n  Let me turn to another issue, and that is amendments that we may see \non the floor concerning family. I want to turn now to some other \nprovisions in the original bill that we managed to alter and change in \ncommittee but that may come up on the floor as amendments.\n  One of the most important of these issues had to do with the meaning \nof family. The original bill fundamentally changed the definition of a \nnuclear family. The original bill said to U.S. citizens that they could \ncontinue to bring their children to America but\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nonly--this is to U.S. citizens now, said to U.S. citizens--they could \ncontinue to bring their children to America but only if the children \nare under 21, and they could only bring their parents to America if the \nparents are over 65 and the majority of their children live in America.\n  The original bill even went so far as to say that if a child was a \nminor but that child was married, that child could not come to this \ncountry either. You could not bring that minor child to the country if \nhe or she decided to get married.\n  Mr. President, in a time when everyone agrees that the fundamental \nproblem in America is a family breakdown--I do not think anyone on the \nfloor disagrees with that--I think it is senseless to change the law to \nhelp break up families.\n  In the committee I kind of related this to my own life and my own \nexperience and pretended for a moment with my family situation, if I \nwas a new citizen in this country, if I had come from another country \nand was a naturalized citizen. Frankly, Mr. President, in my situation \nI have trouble saying that my 4-year-old daughter Anna--or Anna who is \ngoing to in 2 days become 4 years old--is a central part of my nuclear \nfamily, but my 28-year-old son Patrick is not; he is now part of my \nextended family; my 27-year-old daughter, Jill, she is not part of my \nnuclear family anymore, she is part of my extended family. That is what \nthe bill had originally said.\n  Finally, the bill also originally said--I cannot understand this \neither--that Mike DeWine, as an only child I could bring my parents \ninto the country if they are over 65, but my wife Frances DeWine could \nnot bring her parents into the country because she is one of six. She, \nas one of six, she could not bring her parents into the country--only \nif a majority of her siblings actually lived in the United States and \nwere citizens in the United States. Again, it does not make any sense. \nI think we are going to end up revisiting this issue. I think it is \ngoing to come back up.\n  Mr. President, at a time when Congress has acted to rein in public \nassistance programs, I do not believe we should deprive people the most \nbasic support structure there is, their immediate family. It just does \nnot make sense. Mr. President, we took these family limitation \nprovisions out of the bill in committee. I hope that we will be able to \nsustain this on the floor and we will not change this.\n  Let me turn finally to one more issue, that has to do with the \nlinkage of this bill. I believe it was a mistake in the original bill \nto combine the issues of legal and illegal immigration. For my \ncolleagues watching on TV or on the floor who are not on the committee, \nwe separated this in committee. What you have before you are two \nseparate, distinct bills. I think it should stay that way because the \nissue of illegal immigration is decidedly distinct from the issue of \nlegal immigration.\n  I think that the biggest mistake of the original bill was to combine \nthe issues of legal and illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants are \nlawbreakers. That is the fact. Frankly, Mr. President, no society can \nexist that allows disrespect for the law.\n  On the other hand, legal immigrants are people who follow the law. \nThey are an ambitious and gutsy group. They are people who have defined \nthemselves by the fact they have been willing to come here, play by the \nrules, build a future, and take chances. To lump them in, Mr. \nPresident, legal immigrants, with people who violate the law is wrong. \nWe simply should not do it. Historically Congress has treated legal \nimmigration and illegal immigration separately. Father Hesburgh in his \n1981 report indicated that Congress should control illegal immigration, \nwhile leaving the door open to legal immigration.\n  Congress has in fact done this over the years and kept the issue \nseparate. In 1986 Congress dealt with illegal immigration. In 1990 \nCongress dealt with legal immigration. In fact, Mr. President, the very \nimmigration bill that is before us today started its legislative career \nas a piece of legislation separate from the bill covering legal \nimmigration. It was only late in the subcommittee markup that the bills \nbecame joined.\n  These issues, Mr. President, have been treated separately for many \nyears. They have been treated separately for one simple reason--they \npresent different issues. They are different. To treat them together is \nto invite repetition of numerous totally false stereotypes. The \ncombining of the bills leads, I think, to the merging of the thought \nprocess into a great deal of confusion.\n  Let me give an example. Say, for example, that aliens are more likely \nthan native-born Americans to be on welfare and food stamps or \nMedicaid. But the fact is, Mr. President, this generalization is not \ntrue about legal immigrants. The statement I just made is wrong in \nregard to legal immigrants. If you separate out the legal immigrants, \nyou find when you are talking about legal immigrants that they are no \nmore likely than native-born Americans to be applicants of social \nwelfare services. In fact, legal immigrants who become naturalized \ncitizens are less likely--let me repeat--less likely to go on public \nassistance than native-born Americans. That is what the facts are.\n\n  Now, a recent study, Mr. President, points to the same fact. It found \nthat foreign-born individuals were 10 to 20 percent more likely than \nnative-born Americans to need social services. That is an alarming \nstatistic, if you just stop there. But if you go further, and if you \nexclude refugees from the total, the foreign-born individuals are \nconsiderably less likely to do so than native-born citizens. Again, the \npoint I made a moment ago.\n  Let us turn, Mr. President, to another dangerous stereotype \nfrequently asserted. That is, that one-half of our illegal immigration \nproblem stems from people who first came here legally. Let me repeat \nit. Let me repeat this. The statement is made that one-half of our \nillegal immigration problem stems from people who first came here \nlegally. Well, that is true.\n  That is a true statement. But it is only true as far as it goes. In \nfact, Mr. President, it is a very misleading statement. What the people \nwho say this are talking about is not legal immigrants who stay here \nand somehow become illegal; they are talking instead about students and \ntourists who had the right to visit America legally. They never were \nlegal immigrants in the classic sense. They had the legal right to be \nhere, but they were not legal immigrants. These are students, tourists \nwho come here legally, and then who stay and do not leave when they are \nsupposed to leave. That is a huge problem in this country. But it is \nnot a problem of legal immigrants.\n  These people who are creating this problem were never legal \nimmigrants. By definition, Mr. President, legal immigrants are people \nwho are allowed to stay. Legal immigrants by definition are here \nlegally. They are not the problem.\n  Mr. President, this is also an important source of confusion on the \nquestion of whether immigration is rising rapidly. Some people claim, \nfor example, that legal immigration is skyrocketing. They base their \ncontention on INS numbers that include as legal immigrants illegal \nimmigrants who are made legal by the 1986 Immigration Reform and \nControl Act.\n  Mr. President, if you take the total number of legal immigrants and \nsubtract those that were illegal before the 1986 act, you find that \nlegal immigration has been holding at fairly constant levels. That is \nwhat the facts are.\n  Let me just give an example, Mr. President. In the 1990's, we have \nhad about 2.8 immigrants for every 1,000 Americans. Is that a lot? \nWell, we could judge for ourselves. The first two decades of the \ncentury, to make a comparison, the rates were 10.4 per 1,000 and 5.7 \nper 1,000.\n  Mr. President, I do not think knowing what we know now, that it would \nhave been wise to say in 1910 that there were too many immigrants \ncoming into America. It was precisely that generation of immigrants at \nthe turn of the century that coincided with America's transition from \nthe periphery of world events to the status of a global superpower.\n  Mr. President, let me stop. I have almost concluded, but let me stop \nat this point to yield to my friend, Senator Simpson from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciated very much my friend, the \nSenator from Ohio, yielding. I certainly would yield additional time. \nBut\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nwe have a time constraint with the ranking member and would like to, at \nthe direction of the majority leader, present some amendments for \ndisposition tomorrow. So, with that explanation, let me proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3669\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit foreign students on F-1 visas from obtaining free \n               public elementary or secondary education)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I submit to the desk Simpson amendment \nNo. 1 and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming, [Mr. Simpson], proposes amendment \n     numbered 3669.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (1) After sec. 213 of the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 214. USE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY NONIMMIGRANT FOREIGN \n                   STUDENTS.\n\n       ``(a) Persons Eligible for Student Visas.--Section \n     101(a)(15)(F) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F)) is amended--\n       ``(1) in clause (i) by striking `academic high school, \n     elementary school, or other academic institution or in a \n     language training program' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     `public elementary or public secondary school (if the alien \n     shows to the satisfaction of the consular officer at the time \n     of application for a visa, or of the Attorney General at the \n     time of application for admission or adjustment of status, \n     that (I) the alien will in fact reimburse such public \n     elementary or public secondary school for the full, \n     unsubsidized per-capita cost of providing education at such \n     school to an individual pursuing such a course of study, or \n     (II) the school waives such reimbursement), private \n     elementary or private secondary school, or postsecondary \n     academic institution, or in a language-training program'; \n     and\n       ``(2) by inserting before the semicolon at the end of \n     clause (ii) the following: `: Provided, That nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed to prevent a child who is \n     present in the United States in a nonimmigrant status other \n     than that conferred by paragraph (B), (C), (F)(i), or (M)(i), \n     from seeking admission to a public elementary school or \n     public secondary school for which such child may otherwise be \n     qualified.';\n       ``(b) Exclusion of Student Visa Abusers.--Section 212(a) (8 \n     U.S.C. 1182(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       `(9) Student visa abusers.--Any alien described in section \n     101(a)(15)(F) who is admitted as a student for study at a \n     private elementary school or private secondary school and who \n     does not remain enrolled, throughout the duration of his or \n     her elementary or secondary school education in the United \n     States, at either (A) such a private school, or (B) a public \n     elementary or public secondary school (if (I) the alien is in \n     fact reimbursing such public elementary or public secondary \n     school for the full, unsubsidized per-capita cost of \n     providing education at such school to an individual pursuing \n     such a course of study, or (II) the school waives such \n     reimbursement), is excludable.'; and\n       ``(c) Deportation of Student Visa Abusers.--Section 241(a) \n     (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       `(6) Student visa abusers.--Any alien described in section \n     101(a)(15)(F) who is admitted as a student for study at a \n     private elementary school or private secondary school and who \n     does not remain enrolled, throughout the duration of his or \n     her elementary or secondary school education in the United \n     States, at either (A) such a private school, or (B) a public \n     elementary or public secondary school (if (I) the alien is in \n     fact reimbursing such public elementary or public secondary \n     school for the full, unsubsidized per-capita cost of \n     providing education at such school to an individual pursuing \n     such a course of study, or (II) the school waives such \n     reimbursement), is deportable.'.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The Dorgan amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me describe the amendment briefly. It \nis intended to prevent foreign students coming to the United States to \nobtain a free taxpayer-financed education at a public elementary or \nsecondary school. This is a growing problem. Children are coming to the \nUnited States and staying with friends or relatives or even strangers \nto whom they pay a fee and attending public schools as residents of the \nschool district.\n  The amendment prohibits counselor offices issuing visas for \nattendance at such public schools or the INS approving such cases \nunless the foreign student can demonstrate they will reimburse the \nschool, public elementary or secondary school, ``for the full, \nunsubsidized per capita cost'' of providing such education, or unless \nthe school waives reimbursement.\n  The amendment also provides for the exclusion and deportation of \nstudents who are admitted to attend private elementary or secondary \nschools but who do not remain enrolled at such private schools for the \nduration of their elementary or secondary study in the United States. \nThis provision is designed to prevent students from obtaining admission \nto a private school and then switching to a taxpayer-funded public \nschool soon after arrival in the United States.\n  It would not prevent those children who are validly in the United \nStates as dependents of persons lawfully residing here from applying \nfor admission to public schools, nor would it prevent public schools \nfrom hosting foreign exchange students who would continue to be \nadmitted as exchange visitors on ``J'' visas.\n  The amendment is designed, however, to deal with the problem of the \n``parachute kids'' which Senator Feinstein dealt with previously--which \nhas received rather thorough attention-- those who come here to receive \na U.S. education at taxpayer expense.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senator has pointed out, this was \nin the initially proposed legislation. It is, I think, a justified and \nwise amendment.\n  And I understand that the Senator will also be offering shortly a \npilot program for ensuring that foreign students here on student visas \nare actually enrolled and attending our schools. It is obviously an \nimportant opportunity for students to be able to come to the \nuniversities here in the United States. They should be welcomed. They \nshould have an opportunity to be in compliance with the university \nrules.\n  This is really, first, a pilot program and, second, an attempt to \nfind out what happens to these students when they are here and also \nwhat happens to them afterward. We do not have that kind of \ninformation. There are reports that individuals just get the permission \nto come here, maybe take one course, and effectively are ``gaming'' the \nsystem to circumvent other provisions of the legislation. That clearly \nwas never the intention.\n  It seems to me this is a worthwhile program. It is targeted. It is \nlimited. There is an important need to understand exactly what is \nhappening with many of these students. I support the program.\n  I just wondered if I could ask the Senator a question. In the \namendment, it says that students must be making ``normal progress'' \ntoward a degree in order to keep the visa. Do you agree with letting \nthe universities themselves make a decision about whether the student \nis in good academic standing or make a reasonable attempt to define \nthat in a reasonable way?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. In connection with that amendment, that is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I hope that we will pass this.\n  Mr. President, I understand the amendment is going to be one of the \namendments that will be offered, and now the one we have before the \nSenate prohibits kids on the student visas from attending public \nschools--our elementary and secondary schools--at the taxpayers' \nexpense unless it is part of an exchange program. That is a wise \namendment.\n  As I pointed out, if one games--a student is to attend a private \nschool and then circumstances change. They should not undermine the \nbasic reason that they were able to get here, and that was to attend \nthe private school and pay the normal tuition, and to change to a \npublic school at the public's expense. I think that is certainly \nconsistent with fairness to taxpayers in that local community. I think \nit makes sense. I intend to support that amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask that amendment be submitted \ntomorrow. I ask for the yeas and nays and that the vote be held at a \ntime convenient to the majority and minority leaders.\n  I withhold that request, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understood, it is the intention in terms of \nexpediting the consideration of the legislation on these three \namendments--there may be those who are returning to the Senate who may \nwant to have an observation about it so as to protect their interests--\nthat the Senator was going to\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nask unanimous consent that the time for the votes on these measures be \nset by agreement by the majority and minority leaders, that the \nschedule for the particular votes on all three would be set by the \nmajority and minority leaders at an appropriate time for the \nleadership. That seemed to be a reasonable request. These are \namendments that are related to the legislation and which the committee \nhad some opportunity to review before. It is just an attempt to move \nthis process along that we are trying to devise a path so we could \nbegin to consider the legislation.\n  We temporarily set aside the Dorgan amendment. That can always be \ncalled back at any time. What now is being asked is that these three \namendments would appear, one amendment after another, temporarily \nsetting it aside, and it would be the intention of the Senator from \nWyoming to ask for the yeas and nays on all three and to have the votes \nstacked in the order which the majority and minority leaders care to \nhave.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, to expedite the process, let me withhold \nfurther action on amendment No. 1 and submit amendment No. 2 and \namendment No. 3, speak on all three of them together, the purpose being \nthat the majority leader had requested our assistance in bringing \nappropriate amendments before the body tomorrow, stacking those \namendments. These are three amendments that are submitted. There may be \ncontroversy that is not expressed today. If that is so, set a time \nlimit tomorrow to do that.\n  The purpose is to submit these three amendments, move them forward \nwith the yeas and nays, let the majority leader and minority leader \ndefine in the context and the time limit as to what they wish to do \nwith them tomorrow. That is the purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3670\n\n(Purpose: To establish a pilot program to collect information relating \n                   to nonimmigrant foreign students)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3670.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.    . PILOT PROGRAM TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELATING TO \n                   NONIMMIGRANT FOREIGN STUDENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Attorney General and the Secretary \n     of State shall jointly develop and conduct a pilot program to \n     collect electronically from approved colleges and \n     universities in the United States the information described \n     in subsection (c) with respect to aliens who--\n       (A) have the status, or are applying for the status, of \n     nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(F), (J), or (M) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F), \n     (J), or (M)); and\n       (B) are nationals of the countries designated under \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) The pilot program shall commence not later than January \n     1, 1998.\n       (b) Covered Countries.--The Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of State shall jointly designate countries for \n     purposes of subsection (a)(1)(B). The Attorney General and \n     the Secretary shall initially designate not lees than five \n     countries and may designate additional countries at any time \n     while the pilot program is being conducted.\n       (c) Information To Be Collected.\n       (1) In general.--The information for collection under \n     subsection (a) consists of--\n       (A) the identity and current address in the United States \n     of the alien;\n       (B) the nonimmigrant classification of the alien and the \n     date on which a visa under the classification was issued or \n     extended or the date on which a change to such classification \n     was approved by the Attorney General; and\n       (C) the academic standing of the alien, including any \n     disciplinary action taken by the college or university \n     against the alien as a result of the alien's being convicted \n     of a crime.\n       (2) FERPA.--The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act \n     of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) shall not apply to aliens described \n     in subsection (a) to the extent that the Attorney General and \n     the Secretary of State determine necessary to carry out the \n     pilot program.\n       (d) Participation by Colleges and Universities.--(1) The \n     information specified in subsection (c) shall be provided by \n     approved colleges and universities as a condition of--\n       (A) the continued approval of the colleges and universities \n     under section 101(a)(15)(F) or (M) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, or\n       (B) the issuance of visas to aliens for purposes of \n     studying, or otherwise participating, at such colleges and \n     universities in a program under section 101(a)(15)(J) of such \n     Act.\n       (2) If an approved college or university fails to provide \n     the specified information, such approvals and such issuance \n     of visas shall be revoked or denied.\n       (e) Funding.--(1) The Attorney General and the Secretary \n     shall use funds collected under section 281(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by this subsection, \n     to pay for the costs of carrying out this section.\n       (2) Section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1351) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``SEC. 281.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b)(1) In addition to fees that are prescribed under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall impose and \n     collect a fee on all visas issued under the provisions of \n     section 101(a)(15)(F), (J), or (M) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act. With respect to visas issued under the \n     provisions of section 101(a)(15)(J), this subsection shall \n     not apply to those ``J'' visa holders whose presence in the \n     United States is sponsored by the United States government.''\n       ``(2) The Attorney General shall impose and collect a fee \n     on all changes of nonimmigrant status under section 248 to \n     such classifications. This subsection shall not apply to \n     those ``J'' visa holders whose presence in the United States \n     is sponsored by the United States government.''\n       ``(3) Except as provided in section 205(g)(2) of the \n     Immigration Reform Act of 1996, the amount of the fees \n     imposed and collected under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall \n     be the amount which the Attorney General and the Secretary \n     jointly determine is necessary to recover the costs of \n     conducting the information-collection program described in \n     subsection (a), but may not exceed $100.\n       ``(4) Funds collected under paragraph (1) shall be \n     available to the Attorney General and the Secretary, without \n     regard to appropriation Acts and without fiscal year \n     limitation, to supplement funds otherwise available to the \n     Department of Justice and the department of State, \n     respectively.''\n       (3) The amendments made by paragraphs (1) and (2) shall \n     become effective April 1, 1997.\n       (f) Joint Report.--Not later than five years after the \n     commencement of the pilot program established under \n     subsection (a), the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     State shall jointly submit to the Committees on the Judiciary \n     of the United States Senate and House of Representatives on \n     the operations of the pilot program and the feasibility of \n     expanding the program to cover the nationals of all \n     countries.\n       (g) Worldwide Applicability of the Program.--(1)(A) Not \n     later than six months after the submission of the report \n     required by subsection (f), the Secretary of State and the \n     Attorney General shall jointly commence expansion of the \n     pilot program to cover the nationals of all countries.\n       (B) Such expansion shall be completed not later than one \n     year after the date of the submission of the report referred \n     to in subsection (f).\n       (2) After the program has been expanded, as provided in \n     paragraph (1), the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     State may, on a periodic basis, jointly revise the amount of \n     the fee imposed and collected under section 281(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in order to take into account \n     changes in the cost of carrying out the program.\n       (h) Definition.--As used in this section, the phrase \n     ``approved colleges and universities'' means colleges and \n     universities approved by the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Education, under \n     subparagraph (F), (J), or (M) of section 101(a)(15) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)).\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this is the amendment, amendment No. 1 \nand No. 2, that Senator Kennedy addressed, to enable the INS to keep \ntrack of foreign students studying in the country. The amendment \nprovides a source of funding for INS to establish a very basic system \nfor keeping track of foreign students. It is a measure supported by the \nFBI Director, who expressed concerns at our ability to track such \nstudents in a 1994 memorandum regarding possible tariffs. It is not an \nintrusive provision. I answered a question of Senator Kennedy to \nindicate that.\n  Colleges and universities are already required to provide this sort \nof information to the INS. The problem in the past has been that the \nINS has not devoted such resources to this activity to create a body of \nreliable information. The amendment's aim is to provide the funding so \nthe INS can implement a system to keep track of foreign students \nstudying here, and it seems reasonable such funding should come from \nthe students themselves and not from the taxpayers.\n  A student who is willing to pay $10,000 or $20,000 in this country, \nor $80,000 to $100,000 through the entire\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\ncurriculum, is not likely to be seriously concerned about paying the \nadditional fee of $50 or $100 for the issuance of the student visa in \naccordance with this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3671\n\n  (Purpose: To create new ground of exclusion and of deportation for \n                   falsely claiming U.S. citizenship)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3671.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       After section 115 of the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 115A. FALSE CLAIMS OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP.\n\n       ``(a) Exclusion of Aliens Who Have Falsely Claimed U.S. \n     Citizenship.--Section 212(a)(9) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       `(D) Falsely claiming citizenship.--Any alien who falsely \n     represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a \n     citizen of the United States is excludable.'; and\n       ``(b) Deportation of Aliens Who Have Falsely Claimed U.S. \n     Citizenship.--Section 241(a) (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       `(6) Falsely claiming citizenship.--Any alien who falsely \n     represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a \n     citizen of the United States is deportable.'.''.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment would add a new section to \nthe bill. The section would create a new ground of exclusion of \ndeportation for falsely representing oneself as a U.S. citizen.\n  This amendment is a complement to another that I will be proposing. \nThe other amendment would modify the bill section which applies and \nprovides for pilot project systems to verify work authorization and \neligibility to apply for public assistance. One of the requirements of \nthat other amendment is that the Attorney General conduct certain \nspecific pilot projects, including one under which employers would be \nrequired to verify the immigration status of aliens, but not persons \nclaiming to be citizens. Such citizens would be required only to attest \nas being citizens. That was discussed in committee. If you are a U.S. \ncitizen, why should you have to go through these procedures? Well, \nobviously, I concur with that.\n  The major weakness in such a system is the potential for false claims \nof citizenship. That is why I offered the present amendment which will \ncreate a new major disincentive for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship. \nLawful permanent aliens, or residents who falsely claim citizenship, \nrisk deportation and being permanently barred from entering the United \nStates. Since they are work-authorized, they would have little reason \nto make a false claim of citizenship.\n  Illegal aliens, on the other hand, would know that they could not be \nverified if they admitted to being aliens and the verification process \nwere conducted. Yet, they would also know, if they falsely claim to be \ncitizens and were caught and apprehended, they would be deported and \npermanently barred. Thus, the risk involved in making the false claims \nwould be high for them indeed. If the present amendment were enacted \ninto law, that would be the case. If the amendment were enacted and the \nproject involving citizen attestation were conducted, a significant \nnumber even of illegal aliens may well be deterred from seeking jobs in \nthe United States. That is the basis of the third and final amendment, \nwhich I submit this evening.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. It is \ninstructive to put it in at this time because I think this might be \nable to add a dimension in being more effective in terms of protecting \nAmericans in job situations. I think, first, as the Senator pointed \nout, if the person represents that they are a citizen and they are not \nand they get the job, they are undermining the ability of the American \nto have the job.\n  Second, if they do it in terms of the welfare provisions, they are \nbasically undermining the American taxpayers and doing it for \nfraudulent reasons. The penalty would be deportation or exclusion, as I \nunderstand the amendment. So it seems to me to make a good deal of \nsense from any point of view. I hope tomorrow we will accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments \nnumbered 3669, 3670, and 3671 be temporarily laid aside in the order in \nwhich they were offered and that they be made the pending business at \nthe request of the majority leader after notification of the Democratic \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I further ask that it be in order for me to ask for the \nyeas and nays on the three amendments, with one showing of seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3667\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nDorgan amendment recur as the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3672 to Amendment No. 3667\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3672 to Amendment No. 3667.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'' and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) social security is supported by taxes deducted from \n     workers' earnings and matching deductions from their \n     employers that are deposited into independent trust funds;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) 138,000,000 American workers pay taxes into the social \n     security system;\n       (6) social security is currently a self-financed program \n     that is not contributing to the Federal budget deficit; in \n     fact, the social security trust funds now have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (7) these current reserves will be necessary to pay monthly \n     benefits for current and future beneficiaries when the annual \n     surpluses turn to deficits after 2018;\n       (8) recognizing that social security is currently a self-\n     financed program, Congress in 1990 established a ``firewall'' \n     to prevent a raid on the social security trust funds;\n       (9) raiding the social security trust funds would further \n     undermine confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (10) the American people overwhelmingly reject arbitrary \n     cuts in social security benefits; and\n       (11) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     deserve to be reassured that their benefits will not be \n     subject to cuts and their social security payroll taxes will \n     not be increased as a result of legislation to implement a \n     balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any legislation required to implement a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution shall \n     specifically prevent social security benefits from being \n     reduced or social security taxes from being increased to meet \n     the balanced budget requirement.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was reading that it be made the pending \nbusiness at the request of the majority leader after notification of \nthe Democratic leader. I am sure that will all be done in good faith. \nBut I understand that notification of the Democratic leader includes \nthat if a Member of our party would like to speak and address those \namendments, I assume that would be respected. I make that assumption.\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I certainly make that assumption. I \nunderstand it to be notification and agreement by the Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. As far as the discussion then on that \nmeasure, I know there are other Members that want to address the Senate \non other matters. I see the Senator from South Carolina, who wanted to \nspeak, as well, on the issue of Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If I may, I believe Senator DeWine had not concluded his \nremarks when I requested the floor. I appreciate very much his \nwillingness to do that so we could get those amendments before the \nbody. How much more time does Senator DeWine need?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I probably have 6, 7, or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate that. Then we will yield to Senator \nHollings for a discussion on the Dorgan amendment and temporarily go \noff of this measure. I thank the Senator from Ohio very much for his \ncourtesies in enabling us to go forward with an agenda for tomorrow.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me conclude my general comments about \nthis bill today. I think America's greatness has been created, \ngeneration after generation, by driven self-selected individuals who \ncame here as legal immigrants. We can think of names such as Albert \nEinstein, from Ohio, someone like George Olah who came here from \nBudapest in 1957 and taught at Case-Western Reserve, and won the Nobel \nPrize for chemistry in 1994. The original bills as introduced actually \nsaid to people like Einstein and Olah, ``Get lost, you can come to the \nU.S., but only if you jump through a whole bunch of bureaucratic hoops \nfrom the State Department and the Labor Department.''\n  A lot of these provisions were, in fact, changed in committee. Mr. \nPresident, I think we really do not need to be making it any harder for \nthese talented, energetic people to come and help us build our great \ncountry. In fact, Mr. President, we became the richest, most powerful \nnation in the history of the world by doing exactly the opposite--by \nencouraging them to come.\n  No, Mr. President, America's immigration problem is not the high-\nquality researchers and professors wading the Rio Grande in the dead of \nnight or scrambling over a fence to avoid the Border Patrol.\n  We should and can crack down on illegal immigration. That is a law \nenforcement issue. We should not allow that effort to serve as a Trojan \nhorse for other measures--measures that would hurt America's future by \nrejecting the very finest and most noble traditions of America's past.\n  To reverse course on immigration, as some might recommend, is to say \nthat America from now on will define itself as a country that is \nfearful of change, afraid of competition, and convinced that her best \ndays are past. That is not the attitude that made America the greatest \ncountry the world has ever seen. An America that thinks itself as weak \nand threatened is not the America that I see. It is not the America \nthat we Americans believe in. It is not the America that a dirt poor \nIrishman named Dennis DeWine saw--saw in his dream as he left County \nGalway 150 years ago to escape the potato famine in Ireland. We do not \nknow a lot about my great-great-grandfather. All we know for sure is \nthat he came over to America from Galway. It is pretty clear, though, \nthat Dennis DeWine came here with guts and with ambition, but probably \nwith very little else. He took a chance on America, and America took a \nchance on him because America back then thought big thoughts about \nitself and what great riches lay in the ambition--in the ambition of \npeople who are willing to take risks. That is the kind of America we \nneed to be, not a closed America that views itself as a finished \nproduct but an America that is open to new people, new ideas, and open \nto the future.\n  Mr. President, I began this speech by talking about how Ronald Reagan \nexpressed better than any other political figure of our era the truest \nsense of what America stands for. I think it would be appropriate for \nme to conclude these remarks about America's immigration policy and \nabout America's identity with another great story, one that President \nReagan recounted more than once in his Presidency. In fact, he found it \nso moving that he even included it in his farewell address 9 days \nbefore he left the White House. Here is the way Ronald Reagan told the \nstory.\n\n       I have been reflecting on what the past 8 years have meant, \n     and mean, and the image that comes to mind, like a refrain, \n     is a nautical one--a small story about a big ship and a \n     refugee and a sailor. It was back in the early 1980's at the \n     height of the boat people, and a sailor was hard at work on \n     the Carrier Midway which was then patrolling the South China \n     Sea. The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, \n     smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon \n     a leaky little boat, and crammed inside were refugees from \n     Indochina hoping--hoping to get to America. The Midway sent a \n     small launch out to bring them to the ship and to safety. And \n     as the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one \n     of them spied the sailor on deck. He stood up and called out \n     to him. He yelled, ``Hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom \n     man''--a small moment with a big meaning, a moment a sailor \n     could not get out of his mind. Neither could I, because that \n     is what it is to be an American.\n\n  Mr. President, as we debate this bill, I think we will need to remind \nourselves that that still is what it means to be an American. It always \nwas, and let us pray that it always will be. Even at the very beginning \nof our history, back when we were a very small country, we were always \na country with a very big meaning, a country whose future was \nunlimited, a country that believed in people and believed in their \ncapacity to make the world a better place. What a legacy, what an \nawesome responsibility, a responsibility for our generation and for \nevery generation.\n  I, along with some of my other colleagues, will be working to make \nsure that our immigration reform bill remains true to this legacy and \ntrue to the values that made America a beacon for all humanity.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude these remarks at this point, and again \nthank my colleague from Wyoming for his courtesy and for his work not \nonly on this bill, but on this issue now for well over a decade.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. He has \nbeen very involved, very articulate, and I appreciate the participation \nvery much.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished chairman \nof our committee, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I say a word about immigration in that we opened up a school this \nmorning for some 525 additional Immigration and Naturalization agents--\nthe plan and plot as we work in the appropriations side of this \nparticular problem. And I serve on the what we call the State, Justice, \nCommerce Subcommittee of Appropriations. For the past 25 years we have \nbeen trying to keep up with the problem as we have seen it. We work \nwith the leadership of the Senator from Wyoming, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy. And this morning, as I say, we opened \nup that school for some 525 agents at the old Navy yard facility in \nCharleston that we closed a couple of years ago.\n  A word should be said about our distinguished Commissioner of \nImmigration and Naturalization, Doris Meissner. She could not be with \nus, of course, because of the loss of her husband in that fatal crash \ngoing into Dubrovnik last week. Chuck Meissner, the Assistant Secretary \nof Commerce in charge of International Trade, was on that plane, that \ntragic loss. I talked to Commissioner Meissner and said that I know we \nhave the scheduled opening of the school, but we ought to call that \noff. She said, ``No, it is really an emergency situation. While I \ncannot be there, I will be represented by Ms. Sale, Chris Sale, the \nDeputy Commissioner, and the other authorities, and we are ready to go, \nand we want to make sure that we have at least these agents trained and \nready to go to work by August.'' Chris Sale was there, and we opened \nthe school in the most adequate fashion.\n  The American public and the U.S. Senate should understand that this \nproblem is much like trying to drink water out of a fire hydrant. Go \ndown to San Ysidro, CA, down there by San Diego where 46 million \nautomobiles and 9 million pedestrians were stuck\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nand inspected by the Immigration and Naturalization Service last year. \nWe are totally understaffed for the problems of the illegal immigrants \ncoming into the Nation and making their demands upon State and Federal \nspending.\n  So it is not a casual commendation that I give to the leadership of \nthe Senator from Wyoming because I worked with him on the Simpson-\nMazzoli bill years back. He has been in the trenches working for years \ntrying to bring the National Government ahead and on to the problem, so \nthat it would not increase into this emergency, more or less, at this \nparticular time.\n\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me say a word about an \nunderlying amendment of Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, myself, and \nothers relative to spending Social Security trust funds. I can go into \ndetail which I will to make the record here, but let me bring it right \nup to the spending habits of the National Government with respect to \ntrust fund amounts. When we passed in 1983 the increase in Social \nSecurity taxes, we could not have possibly voted that tax increase save \nand excepting to maintain the integrity of the Social Security trust \nfund. In fact, the intent was not only to maintain its integrity but to \nmaintain a surplus. We talked openly, and you refer back to the record, \nof the Greenspan commission report, that if these increases in taxes \nwere carried out, we would have a surplus that would easily take care \nof the baby boom generation into the year 2050.\n  But otherwise has occurred. What we have been doing, in a shameless \nfashion, is spending the Social Security trust moneys on the deficit. \nWe have been obscuring the size of the deficit by the use of those \ntrust funds. It was $63 billion last year, if I remember correctly. \nLast year the CBO report was a $481 billion surplus. So if you add the \n$63 billion I guess it would be in the terms of a $544 billion surplus, \nover one-half trillion surplus funds in the Social Security trust. But, \nah, now we have today's, or last week I should say but it is dated \nApril 15, Time magazine, and I wish to quote because here is what \nreally happens to the so-called trust funds. It is on page 27 of April \n15, 1996, Time magazine, entitled ``Odyssey of a Mad Genius.'' I refer \nto the article on page 27, ``Beltway Robbery.'' This has to do with \nhighway trust funds, not Social Security, but the similarity is so \nstark in its reality that it must be brought to the attention of my \nfellow Senators here this afternoon. I quote:\n\n       In a Washington out to cut Federal spending, 12-term \n     Congressman Bud Shuster is an unrepentant pork barrel \n     spender. Now it appears the Chairman of the House \n     Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has converts. \n     More than half his colleagues including a heavy majority of \n     those reform-minded GOP freshmen, are backing a bill that \n     would lift constraints on highway and airport projects. If \n     the trust and budgeting act is passed by the House next week, \n     it would give Shuster's committee great latitude to tap some \n     $33 billion in transportation trust funds. The measure has \n     mobilized a formidable lobbying coalition, uniting organized \n     labor and big and small business, State and local \n     governments, and such an esoteric trade association as the \n     Precast-Prestressed Concrete Institute. Their goal is not \n     only to pass it but also a vetoproof 289 votes. Supporters \n     argue rightly that the money would go where it was intended--\n     building roads and upgrading the airports. But the supposedly \n     untapped funds are actually an accounting figment. Using them \n     would increase the deficit or force greater cuts in other \n     programs. Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich and \n     Appropriations Chairman Bob Livingston are vehemently \n     opposed. Attempts by Newt Gingrich to reconcile them and \n     Shuster have come to naught. Meanwhile, Federal Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan broke with his custom of staying neutral to advise \n     against passage.\n\n  Now, is that not a remarkable report? One line in there, and I quote \nit again:\n\n       But the supposedly untapped funds are actually an \n     accounting figment.\n\n  This is exactly what Senator Heinz and I were fighting against when \nwe had enacted section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act on November \n5, 1990, signed into law by President George Bush, voted by a vote of \n98 to 2 in this Senate. We did not want Social Security trust funds to \nbecome an ``accounting figment.'' That is what they do when they \ncontinue to use funds.\n  When we try to debate it in the Chamber, it does not matter; we have \nthe money there, but it has to be used by the Government somewhere so \nwe will just borrow the moneys there and everything else of that kind \nand tell the youth of America do not worry--well, do worry, it is going \nbroke--when it is not going broke and when we got the moneys there and \nrun around about going broke because in their mind it has become an \naccounting figment.\n  Now, let me mention a book by James Fowler. It is called ``Breaking \nThe News.''\n  This is the problem in Government today. Years back, none other than \nThomas Jefferson as between a free Government and a free press, he \nwould choose the latter, and why? Because he said and reasoned that you \ncould have a free Government but would not remain free long unless you \nhad a free press to keep us politicians honest.\n  What has happened is that the free press no longer keeps the \npoliticians honest. They in turn have joined into the dishonesty. Here \nit is. I read again. One sentence:\n\n       But the supposedly untapped funds are actually an \n     accounting figment.\n\n  Thirty-three billion in the highway trust funds. The article quotes \nit. It is not an accounting figment. And instead of keeping the trust \nfor highways, who comes out against spending highway moneys for \nhighways? The chairman of the Budget Committee, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and of all people, the head of the Federal \nReserve because he is part and parcel of the conspiracy for a so-called \nunified budget.\n  Now, let's go to unified. Wall Street and Alan Greenspan love unified \nbudgets so long as the Government is not coming in to the bond market \nwith its sharp elbows borrowing. Then they can make more money on stock \nsales. Bond sales, their interest rates stay down so borrow from \nyourself.\n  Well, that is pretty good for the irresponsible business leadership \nbut for the public servant down here in Washington that has to do his \njob, he is going to meet himself coming around the corner and today we \nhave met ourselves coming around the corner.\n\n       But the supposedly untapped funds are actually an \n     accounting figment.\n\n  That is the charade and fraud that has been going on. I more or less \ndedicated myself to paying the bill. Earlier today when we were opening \nup this school, I said when we handled this Justice Department budget \nback in 1987, 1988, it was only about $4.2 billion. Now, this year, it \nis $16.7 billion. It has gone up, up and away, and we do not pay for \nit.\n\n  I cited an editorial in my own hometown newspaper about April 15, \nhere we were, the day to pay taxes, and up, up and away was the \nnational debt to $5 trillion. And they said: You know the reason for \nthis was entitlement funds. They said that it was the military \nretirement, the Social Security, the Medicare.\n  Wait a minute, Mr. President. Let us go to these so-called \nentitlement funds. As I mentioned a moment ago, Social Security is over \none-half trillion dollars in the black. Medicare, everybody agrees, is \nin the black. They are talking about going broke in 7 years, but many \nadjustments can be made and should be made and will be made. We will \nkeep Medicare solvent. We do not have to cut it to get a tax cut to buy \nthe vote for November. I have opposed that.\n  Similarly, with the military and civil service retirement fund, it is \nin the black. It is not these entitlements, it is paying for the \nimmigration border patrol, the immigration inspectors, all the other \nthings; the Justice Department, FBI, for the defense, for all these \nthings for 15 years. We have not been paying for general government. \nOh, this cry over entitlements started in the Appropriations Committee \nwhen my friend Dick Darman came in there, talking about ``entitlements, \nentitlements, entitlements.'' And you have that same Concord Coalition, \n``entitlements, entitlements, entitlements,'' and my friend Pete \nPeterson up there in New York, ``entitlements, entitlements, \nentitlements.''\n  Let us talk about general government. I was a member of the Grace \nCommission against waste, fraud, and abuse. And we have constituted the \nbiggest waste, the biggest fraud, the biggest abuse in the last 15 \nyears by spending $250 billion more each and every year, on an average, \nwithout paying for it. That is why the debt has\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\ngone to $5 trillion. That is why the interest cost has gone to over \n$350 billion. We will get a CBO estimate here on Wednesday. Today is \nMonday. But let me tell you what the estimate was earlier in the year. \nI will ask unanimous consent later that this be printed in the Record. \nThe estimated 1996 interest cost on the national debt, gross interest \npaid is $350 billion.\n  Interest has gone up since then, so it is going to be over $1 billion \na day. When President Reagan took over, the gross interest cost was \nexactly $74.8 billion. Get into a little arithmetic. Subtract 75, in \nround figures, $75 billion from $350 billion and you get $275 billion. \nMr. President, 275 billion extra dollars spending for nothing, for \nnothing.\n  I remember President Reagan. I will show the talks, if you want me to \nput it in the Record. He was going to balance the budget in 1 year. \nThen he came to town and said, ``Oops, 3 years.'' Then we had the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, 5 years. Now they have proposed 7 years. If \nthey get past the November election, the next crowd will say 10 years. \nAs long as they can continue the charade, as long as the press fails to \nkeep us honest and fails to engage the public in the truth, it \ncontinues the charade, calling it truth in budgeting.\n  Mr. President, the actual cost of domestic discretionary spending at \nthis minute is $267 billion. But the increase in spending for interest \non the debt has been $275 since President Reagan took office. Point: We \nhave doubled domestic discretionary spending without getting a double \nGovernment. We could have two Presidents, two Senates, two Houses of \nRepresentatives, two Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, \nInterior. Domestic discretionary--we could have two for the money we \nare spending. But we are not getting it.\n  Talk about increased spending? ``I am against increased spending.'' \nThey are all running around in this Congress saying, ``I am against \nincreased spending.'' Well they have increased spending $1 billion \ntoday, on account of this fraud, this charade. Or, like taxes, for \nApril 15 they have sent their minions all around the land, talking \nabout tax day, ``Let us have a special bill over in the House.'' It is \nall theater. And we will have that, ``You have to have a two-thirds \nvote in order to increase taxes.'' Increase taxes? You cannot avoid \ndeath. You cannot avoid taxes. And you cannot avoid interest costs on \nthe national debt. Interest is like taxes. You have already increased \ntaxes today of $1 billion and you will increase taxes tomorrow, and on \nSaturday, and on Sunday and on Christmas Day, every day this year--not \non increased program spending, but on interest on the debt. The crowd \nthat says they are against increasing taxes is increasing taxes and not \nwanting to do a thing about this central problem.\n\n  I tried and I am going to continue. They are not going to get rid of \nme. I came here with a AAA credit rating for my State. I increased \ntaxes to get it. I knew as a young Governor I could not go to those \nindustry leaders in New York and ask them to come down and invest in \nPodunk. I had to have a solvent operation. So we did balance the budget \nand we put in a little device, which later, in the Federal Government, \nwas called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It was cuts across the board.\n  I went to the distinguished Senator from Texas. I said, ``This device \nthat you have that cuts Social Security, it will not get to first \nbase.'' I said, ``Speaker O'Neill and Congressman Claude Pepper will \nrun us off the Capitol steps. We have not got a chance. Forget it. Let \nus talk sense.'' I helped write Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sensibly, and we \nenacted automatic cuts across the board.\n  Then, when, as they say, the rubber hit the road in 1990, we \nabolished the cuts across the board. On October 19, at 12:41 a.m., I \nraised the point of order, and my distinguished colleague from Texas \nvoted to abolish the cuts across the board of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n  Do you know what they did? They went for spending caps. Well, this \nplace has a ceiling, but the spending caps have not. Spending has gone \nup, up and away and that is why poor President Bush lost his \nreelection. There is no kidding around.\n  I mean, we were up to $400 billion deficits at that particular time. \nThe exact figure, according to the schedule here of the real deficit \nwas $403.6 billion. So they said we will try this little Governor from \nArkansas. He has balanced the budget for 10 years. Give him a try.\n  I voted for a balanced budget under Lyndon Johnson. Under Lyndon \nBaines Johnson, the interest costs on the national debt in his last \nyear, when we voted that balanced budget, was $16.6 billion. Now it is \nover $350 billion, over $1 billion a day. That is the biggest waste \nconsciously caused by us.\n  I have been a party to it. Yes, I tried to enact a freeze. Then I \ntried Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Then, even in the Budget Committee I had a \nvalue-added tax. It was bipartisan. I had the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri join me. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota joined. \nWe had eight votes for a value-added tax of 5 percent allocated to \nridding us of the deficit and debt so we would not have this increased \nspending on automatic pilot.\n  But, somehow, somewhere along the line, we have gotten into a \ncontract of nothing but procedural nonsense. We have gotten into term \nlimits, when the Constitution already says I have to run for every 6 \nyears. Incidentally, I have been elected to the U.S. Senate six times.\n  We have procedural talk about unfunded mandates, line-item vetoes, \nanything except enacting a balanced budget. We are not providing; the \nsize of the Federal work force is smaller now than it was 10 years ago. \nWe are spending more and getting less. No wonder the body politic is \ndisillusioned with their Government in Washington. Somehow, both \nRepublican and Democrat, keep on spending more and more while we get \nless and less. And they all give us this same pollster pap of, ``I am \nagainst taxes and for the family. I am against crime and for jobs.'' \nYou know, get the hot button items and try to fool the people. And that \nis why the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has offered this \namendment, which states:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that because section 13301 of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act prohibits the use of the Social \n     Security trust fund surplus to offset the budget deficit, any \n     proposal for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \n     should contain a provision creating a firewall between the \n     receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds and \n     the rest of the federal budget, and that the constitutional \n     amendment should explicitly forbid using Social Security \n     trust funds to balance the federal budget.\n\n  Mr. President, if acted on that idea, we would have passed the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution by at least 5 votes in \nMarch of last year--March of last year.\n  Again, about 6 weeks ago, I tried to bring it up, and they raised a \ntechnicality that it was not relevant. Five Senators wrote a letter to \nMajority Leader Dole. We went on record in favor of the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution as long as it did not repeal section \n13301. But they want that unified budget. Keep spending the billions \nand billions and billions from the Social Security trust fund and then \ncome around at the end of the day when my children and the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer's children and grandchildren come for \ntheir particular retirement, and they are going to say the untapped \nfunds are actually an accounting figment.\n  Who in the year 2002 is going to raise a trillion dollars in taxes to \nmake good on the IOU's in the Social Security draw? Nobody, nobody, and \nthey do not have any idea of doing it. But ``I'm against taxes,'' they \nsay. Oh, it is a wonderful luxury to run around and fool the American \npeople, and who allows it? The American free press. Read ``Breaking the \nNews'' by James Fallows, an authoritative writer. He has been up here. \nHe has watched the operation. I can tell you, time and time again, it \nhas been a very, very difficult fight.\n  Let me give credit to the late Senator from Pennsylvania, John Heinz. \nJohn Heinz and I worked on taking the Social Security trust fund off \nbudget. It was bipartisan. It was called the Heinz-Hollings amendment--\nwe wanted him to lead it at the time because the Republicans were in \ncontrol--and we called it the Heinz-Hollings-Moynihan amendment.\n  Our distinguished Senator Moynihan had been the ranking member on the \nFinance Committee and, admittedly, is still the authority on Social \nSecurity in this body.\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\n  But on October 18, 1990, Senator John Heinz said:\n\n       Mr. President, in all the great jambalaya of frauds \n     surrounding the budget, surely the most reprehensible is the \n     systematic and total ransacking of the Social Security trust \n     fund in order to mask the true size of the deficit.\n\n  Another quote on October 18, 1990 by Senator John Heinz:\n\n       Since 1983, when we may have saved the Social Security \n     goose, we have systematically proceeded to melt down and pawn \n     the golden egg. It does not take a financial wizard to tell \n     us that spending these reserves on today's bills does not \n     bode well for tomorrow's retirees.\n\n  I make these quotes to the body this afternoon for the simple reason \nthat it is bipartisan, and I am appealing to the Senators on the other \nside of the aisle, the Republican colleagues, because I know the \nchairman of our Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, does not believe in busting the budget. He got caught off base \nlast November when he held up the good housekeeping award and said, \n``Here's a balanced budget certified by the Director of the CBO.''\n  Then 2 days later, ``CBO said, as you were, ``we have a deficit of \n$105 billion.'' It was not balanced at all. Let us not go through that \ncharade again. We can pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Senator Dole is put under tremendous pressures with the goofy right \nthat he has to respond to in order to get the nomination. But now that \nhe has it, he should revert to the old Dole, as he was as chairman of \nthe Finance Committee when he joined in the sentiment of George Bush \nwho called Reaganomics voodoo, and former Republican majority leader, \nSenator Baker, who said it was a riverboat gamble.\n\n  I know Senator Dole. I have tremendous respect for him, and I know he \nis solid on paying bills. But he has a crowd that runs rampant saying, \n``We don't want to pay the bill.''\n  Remember what happened to Fritz Mondale? He was honest enough to come \nout and say we are going to have to have an increase in taxes in order \nto pay the bills, but he did not add ``in order to pay the bills.'' He \nsaid, ``Yes, it looks like we are going to have to increase taxes.'' He \nhad ahead of time said, ``By the way, I'm a Democrat in the image of \nHubert Humphrey.'' When he said he was a Democrat in the image of my \nfriend Senator Humphrey from Minnesota, everybody took it to mean we \nreally were going to start some spending.\n  I understand the call that has been put out to call the Democrats \ntax-and-spend, tax-and-spend.\n  Let me enter something in the Record now for President Clinton. In \nall of these 15 years, the only time the deficit has been decreased is \nunder President Clinton. He came to town and cut spending $500 billion. \nHe came to town and with a $500 billion deficit reduction plan--equally \nsplit between spending cuts and taxes. I voted for it in order to try \nand get on top of these interest costs, this waste.\n  He came to town and cut $57 billion out of Medicare and had proposed \nanother $124 billion. But there was no $250 billion for a tax cut. So \nhe was acting responsibly until the Post and you folks just pulled him \noff base, and then he came for a tax cut, too, which nobody can afford.\n  That is one grand fraud on the American people. We do not have any \ntaxes to cut. We have been cutting the spending. Eliminate the domestic \ndiscretionary spending. Eliminate welfare, eliminate foreign aid and \nthe entire domestic discretionary spending and not cut it, and you \nstill have a deficit. That is the serious problem.\n  The ox is in the ditch, and we have to sober up in this Government of \nours and quit talking pollster politics games which the press joins in: \nwho is up and who is down and who is silly enough.\n  I recommended a value-added tax in the Finance Committee. I want to \npay for new immigration inspectors. I want to pay for 5,000 new border \npatrol. I want to pay for the extra FBI, the crime bill. I want to pay \nfor the commitment in Bosnia. But this crowd comes up here and gets \naway with the worst I have ever seen.\n  I hope that we can salve the conscience, if there is one left amongst \nus, where we adopt the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, the sense of the Senate that we not use Social Security \ntrust funds to balance the Federal budget.\n  That was not the intent when we adopted those taxes, but you can see \nfrom the way they are treating highway trust funds--I would like to do \nit for the highway trust funds. I would like to do it for airport and \nairway trust funds. Out there in Colorado, we need some new airports, \nbut we have not been spending the money on airports, we have been \nspending them instead on masking the size of the deficit, sacrificing \nfuture investment for present consumption.\n  I would like to spend these moneys for their intended purpose. I \nwould like to pay the bill so that we will not saddle the next \ngeneration with our excesses. Where all they can do in Washington and \nis to pay for a little bit of defense, a little bit of domestic \ndiscretionary, cannot promote technology, cannot promote any \ncompetitiveness, cannot have any research and health care, and \neverything else that Government is supposed to do.\n  I believe in Government. I do not think Government is the problem. I \nthink this charade is a problem. I think they know it is a problem. But \nthey go along with this silly contract and its procedural nonsense, \nguaranteed every day to put on a show here. ``Here is April 15. Here is \ntax day. Let's remind them about a tax cut that they could have \ngotten.'' So they automatically call it a President Clinton tax cut \nthat you did not get, and all those kinds of things, when they could \nnot give it to save their souls.\n  They do not have taxes to cut. In fact, their solution is Reaganomics \nand growth--please do not come back here with that growth. Senator \nMathias on the Republican side and I were 2 of 11 votes against \nReaganomics and that mantra of growth, growth, growth. The only thing \nthat has grown is the deficit and spending, spending on automatic pilot \nof $1 billion a day--$1 billion a day. And nobody wants to talk about \nit. They want to talk about tax cuts. It's like saying, ``I want to buy \nyour vote.''\n  Campaign financing. The biggest fraudulent campaign financing occurs \non the floor of the U.S. Congress, because we mislead the American \npeople that their Government is being paid for. We act like all we need \nto do is cut back a little on welfare and on foreign aid eliminate the \nCommerce Department.\n  Yes. Since I have the time--I talked the week before last with former \nSecretary Ron Brown. He and I were trying to work votes, in all candor, \nover on the Republican side. We were having a difficult time. We did \nnot know whether or not the administration was going to veto the bill, \nshould it pass. I take it now that the distinguished President would \nnot hesitate in vetoing it because the Commerce Department is not a \ngrab bag.\n  I have been through over a dozen Secretaries of Commerce, and I am \nlaying it on the line. Ron Brown was the one Secretary of Commerce that \ndid the work. Maurice Stans up to Mosbacher, all they did was collect \nmoney.\n  But here was a fellow out hustling business rather than funds for the \ncampaign, actually doing an outstanding job. When I heard of the recent \ntragedy, I had just with the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nCohen. We were in Beijing at the time of the plane crash. They did not \nask about the President because he has never been to the largest and \nperhaps one of the most important countries in the entire world. In \nfact, the Secretary of State, he has been 34 times to the Mideast but \nonly one visit to Beijing. They did not ask about the Secretary of \nState.\n  They asked about Ron Brown. He made a wonderful, favorable \nimpression. I really believe, Mr. President, that we can really bring \nabout more human rights through capitalism and market forces than we \ncan through sanctions.\n  I have learned the hard way, as we did back in the old days at the \nbeginning of the war and the artillery. There was a saying then that no \nmatter how well the gun was aimed, if the recoil was going to kill the \ngun crew, you did not fire the gun. The recoil of sanctions has killed \nthe gun crew. It is killing off our business.\n  Just recently, France picked up a $1.2 billion Airbus contract rather \nthan the\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nUnited States of America. Well, we all believe that the Government \nshould take a stand. But the way we have taken it is in a general loud-\nmouth fashion without any result. We should have targeted sanctions, \nclearly understood in the first instance. Let our businesspeople go and \nprosper and bring about more capitalism over communism. That is how we \nreally defeated it in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, with \ncapitalism itself.\n  What we are doing is taking the largest, most important nation in the \nPacific--I can see that front cover of another magazine, ``Friend or \nEnemy?'' We are making them an enemy. There is not any question about \nit. They like America. They like our technology. They have 100,000 \nChinese students. They know we stand for freedom and everything else.\n\n  I was on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1966, the Kitty \nHawk. We could not control 20 million North Vietnamese. I do not know \nhow an aircraft carrier running around the Straits of Taiwan is going \nto control 1.2 billion Chinese. We need to sober up.\n  Government--the art of the possible, not responding to these pollster \npap things. ``Are you against Red China?'' or ``Are you against \ncommunism?'' and all those things. You have to live in the real world. \nYou have to get the best results you can. I am absolutely persuaded you \nare going to do it through capitalism and not through running around \nconfronting on every turn and letting that other crowd pick up the \nmarbles.\n  If you could do it unilaterally, fine business. But you cannot. So \nthe French go in and the Germans go in or the Japanese, and they pick \nup our marbles and we are left behind.\n  If I put myself in control--if I had to control 1.2 billion, the one \nconcern I guess I would have to have would be Taiwan. They are moving \ntoward democracy. They have, after 48 years, a free election for a \nPresident for the first time. But having had it, the more they talk \nabout democracy and independence, coming to Cornell and asking for \ndiplomatic recognition. But we need to be honest, Mr. President, about \nwhat that means in China. Any strong movement toward democracy right is \na sensitive subject because if the Taiwan get democracy, then some \ncrowd down in Guangzhou, will want democracy and everything else. Give \nme one man one vote today in Beijing and I have chaos.\n  But the politician here in the National Government does not stop \nlooking, listening, or thinking about it. I do not believe that the \nrulers in Beijing have any idea of continuing so-called Communistic \ngovernment.\n  Some call it Market-Leninism rather than Marxist-Leninism. I do not \nknow what it is, but I do know, having been there in 1976 and 1986 and \nnow in 1996, that they have brought about 180 million into the middle \nclass.\n  I would daresay, if I were Nick the Greek and had to bet, that I \nwould bet that 10 to 20 years from now you are going to find more \nhungry fed in China than you are going to find in democratic India. I \nthink that is a mistake in Russia, and that is why the President is \ngoing to be there the day after tomorrow.\n  Why? Because they gave political rights before they gave economic \nrights.\n  We in the U.S. Senate ought to stop looking and listening to those \npollsters who have never served a day in government. They are \nwonderful. I have the best. I trust their polls and predictions, and \nthey have been on target, but they still really do not know government. \nThey never have thought about doing things in the long term. They are \nonly thinking bam, bam towards the next election. I could fault us all. \nWe are all looking to November. Nothing will happen in this body this \nyear. Why? On account of November. Each day we are trying to find out \nwho is on top in the 7 o'clock news.\n  Irrespective of who is on top, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record these tables, since President

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \nproject. In the next couple of weeks, the Senate will vote for the very \nfirst time in history on a proposed constitutional amendment to limit \nthe terms of individuals in the U.S. Congress. This is, indeed, \nhistoric. While people are familiar with term limits, because they have \napplied to the President since the 1950's, and while 40-some States \nhave term limits as it relates to other public officials, the U.S. \nCongress has never been term limited.\n  It is an exciting opportunity to know that the Judiciary Committee of \nthis Senate for the first time in history has sent to the floor of the \nSenate, with bipartisan support, a proposed amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States that would provide the States with \nthe chance to add to the Constitution, limits on Members' terms in the \nU.S. House and Senate.\n  People might say, why is that important? I think it is important from \na number of points of view. I think that the biggest perk of all in \nGovernment is the perk of incumbency. The No. 1 campaign reform ought \nto be to level the playing field every couple of terms for Members of \nthe Senate and every several terms for Members of the House and let new \npeople have an opportunity to bring their fresh approach and their \nrecent experience into Government from the private sector.\n  Steven Moore of the CATO Institute eloquently phrased the results of \nhis study. He indicated clearly that if we were to have had term limits \nwe already would have passed a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. It would have passed the House and \nSenate in the years 1990, 1992, and in the year 1994. We would have had \nat a much earlier date the therapeutic value of the line-item veto, \nmajor reforms that encounter the resistance of career congressional \nindividuals who have been passed long ago.\n  It is interesting to note that this study also indicated that there \nare several things that did pass which would not have passed, had there \nbeen term limits. Moore, of the CATO Institute, indicates that the last \ntwo pay increases for Congress would not have passed had we had term \nlimits, and the last two tax increases on the people of this great \ncountry would not have passed, had we had term limits.\n  It is time for this body, along with the House of Representatives, to \nvote to allow the American people, through their States, to embrace \nterm limits for the Congress if they choose to. The U.S. Senate and the \nU.S. House cannot enact term limits. But we can offer the opportunity \nto the States through a proposed constitutional amendment. We should do \nthat and do it now. It is a way of inviting the people into the process \nof Government. For too long the Congress has slammed shut the door of \nself-government in the face of the American people. It is time to \nwelcome them back.\n  In conjunction with the vote later this month on term limits, I am \npleased to announce an exciting experiment in online democracy. It is \nthe first ever congressional online petition. This is a way for the \npeople of the United States of America to register their views on term \nlimits with the U.S. Senate, and to do so at a place through electronic \nmail. I refer Members to the chart entitled ``Term limits'' at \n``jashcroft.senate.gov.'' which is the address for term limits on e-\nmail.\n  In addition to the e-mail address, you can also register your \nfeelings on term limits by going to any number of home pages which will \nrefer you to the term limits home page here in the Senate. For \ninstance, the CNN home page, the C-SPAN home page, the America online \nhome page, the netscape home page, the politics USA home page will all \nallow individuals to click to the term limits petition, where \nindividuals can express themselves to the U.S. Congress.\n  This is an unusual petition made possible by the technology. I quote \none of our first signers of the petition, Matthew Lovelace, who says, \n``Your project puts power in the hands of the people, power that \nbureaucracy and big Government have taken away.'' He is one of about \nthousands upon thousands of individuals that have already signed the \nterm limits petition that is online and available to people all across \nthe United States of America. It is not a petition for registration. It \nwill not cause any specific election to happen. It is a petition of \ncommunication to send a message from the American people to the Members \nof this Congress. It began last Wednesday and it is fully underway now.\n  The new technology has the potential to help us redefine the way \ncitizens and communities participate in our democracy. Normally, a \npetition is an event that you sign and say, ``So long.'' You never see \nit again. You are not part of it in any sense, other than your name. \nThe term limits petition, however, is one electronically that can allow \nyou to see on a regular basis how many people have signed up, where \nMembers of the Senate are in terms of the petition, and get views of \npublic officials and others who have stated their views and written \nabout term limits as a concept. Further, there can be updates through \ne-mail to individuals who request updates on the term limit petition.\n  The U.S. News reports that there are close to 300,000 Worldwide Web \nsites, and to have a term limits Worldwide Web site is just a way of \nproviding the access to American people and people around the world to \na concept whose time has come.\n  I do not think there is any better issue that could demonstrate the \nnew technology than term limits. The new technology is designed to give \npeople greater access and term limits will give people greater access \nto Government. If interactive technology at its core is about the \nincreased deliberation, so, too, is term limitation.\n  Term limits also help to ensure accountability, and that new people \nand new ideas find their way into Government, and that we have \ncompetitive elections.\n  In 1994, 91 percent of all Congressmen who stood for reelection were \nreturned to Washington. Term limits would eliminate the single biggest \nperk in the electoral system--the perk of incumbency. It is time that \nwe simply say to individuals, yes, you are valuable, yes, you have \nserved well, but there are thousands of people across America\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\nwith the capacity to serve well and to have an opportunity to bring \ntheir creativity to Washington, DC.\n  Dennis Holland of Connecticut suggested, when he contacted my office \nthis weekend, that the Internet and Worldwide Web are the natural place \nfor the free flow of individuals' ideas. I believe they are. That is \nwhy we have opened this link of communication for the American people. \nI will be a part of this free flow of ideas when I appear on America \nOnline chat tonight from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. We will continue to update \nthe Senate on this exciting experiment. I encourage other Members of \nthe Senate to sign the petition to express themselves for or against \nterm limits. That will be made available to individuals across America \nwho participate in this new process of communicating about an \nopportunity for America, an opportunity for communication and for \nreform.\n  I was Governor of the State of Missouri for two terms. The \nconstitution of Missouri providently provides and wisely includes a \nprovision that we would limit Governors to two terms. Members of the \nhouse and senate in Missouri are limited, as are other members of the \nState executive. The President is limited in the terms that he can \nserve. It is a way or an avenue of opening up Government to the people, \nwhich we should explore.\n  The House and Senate of the United States, in a couple of weeks, will \nhave an opportunity to send to the people in their States a proposed \namendment to the Constitution of the United States to allow them to \nembrace term limits as a national concept for the Congress. It is one \nwhich I hope they will embrace, and I hope we will give them the \nopportunity to do so.\n  I look forward to making further appearances as we approach the time \nfor this body to act on term limits. I look forward to seeing the \npeople of America tonight when we are on the America Online program \nregarding term limits between 9 and 10 p.m. eastern daylight time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3309-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, I would like to express my thanks and \ncongratulations to a member of my staff, Ms. Jane Bergen. As we all \nknow, here on Capitol Hill, we have a lot of very bright people who \njoin our staffs and work tirelessly for our constituents. However, it \nis truly rare to have someone as gifted, dedicated, and loyal as Jane. \nYesterday was Jane's 25th anniversary with my office, and I am honored \nto have had her with me for all this time.\n  One of the many benefits of being a seasoned Senator is the \nopportunity to form strong relationships with one's staff. My office \nis, in many ways, a family, and Jane has done a great deal toward \nmaking it that way. In addition to being intelligent and capable, she \nis one of the most good-natured people I've ever met. Jane gets along \nwith everyone, and I know that every member of my staff would do \nanything for her.\n  Over the course of 25 years, Jane has come to know just about all \nthere is to know about the workings of the Senate. She has trained more \nlegislative assistants in my office than I can count, and she has \nbecome an invaluable resource in the process. These days, the word \n``dependable'' has become a somewhat banal adjective. Well, I would \nlike to redefine that word and apply it to Jane Bergen. She is uniquely \ntrustworthy, and my staff and I have come to rely on her knowledge, \njudgement, and goodwill on a daily basis.\n  As much as Jane participates in the family life of the office, she \nhas just as full and successful life outside of it. She and her \nhusband, Les, are the parents of two great children, Leah and Joel, who \nare the priority in their lives. Jane and Les are community leaders who \nhave been active in local politics, the PTA and their synagogue.\n  Although Jane has attended college, married, raised children, and \npursued a career here in Washington, she is a native of my hometown, \nCharleston, the daughter of dear friends, Rita and Dr. Leon Banov. And \nshe still retains the best of the traits of southerners: a strong sense \nof family and community, a perpetually friendly disposition, and \nloyalty. On behalf of Peatsy and all the staff through the years, I \nthank Jane for her many and excellent contributions to our office. I \nlook forward to working with her for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3310-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3310-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 2, 1996, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore [Mr. Emerson] has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 956.

A bill to authorize the Federal District Court for the \nCentral Division of Utah to hold court in Provo and St. George; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n THE CENTRAL DIVISION OF UTAH FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AUTHORIZATION ACT \n                                OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would permit \nthe Federal District Court of the Central Division of Utah to hold \ncourt in Provo and St. George. Under the relevant statutory provision, \ntitle 28, United States Code, section 125, District Court for the \nNorthern Division of Utah may be held only in Ogden, and District Court \nfor the Central Division of Utah may be held only in Salt Lake City.\n  The central division of Utah, however, is quite expansive: it \nencompasses 23 counties and spreads from the Salt Lake region down to \nUtah's southern\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nborder. Due to the division's size, those involved in district court \nproceedings, whether as litigants, jurors, or lawyers, must travel to \nSalt Lake City for district court. The district judges and others in \nUtah have become concerned about inconveniences that have arisen due to \nthe statutory constraints on the places of holding court in Utah.\n  On January 9, 1996, the district judges for the District of Utah \nvoted to approve an amendment to title 28, United States Code, section \n125 that would permit district court for the central division of Utah \nto be held not only in Salt Lake City, but also in Provo and St. \nGeorge. The bill I introduce today embodies those changes. The Utah \nState Bar supports the bill.\n  This bill will help Utahns by facilitating the administration of \njustice in Utah, and by permitting easier access to the district courts \nto citizens and litigants throughout Utah, who have often had to travel \nto Salt Lake City to have their cases and concerns heard.\n  Provo itself is a significant city with a population of 86,835. The \nneighboring city of Orem, UT, adds a population of 67,561 to Provo's \nimmediate region. St. George, while a smaller city, is located in the \nsouthwest corner of Utah, and would provide a convenient location for \ncitizens of southern Utah.\n  The minor modifications embodied in the bill will place Utah in a \nsimilar position to many other States in which district court may be \nheld at numerous statutorily designated locations. The vast majority of \nStates enjoy far more than two places in which district court can be \nheld. Just to cite a few examples, 13 cities in Alabama are designated \nas cities in which district court may sit, 11 cities in Arkansas are so \ndesignated, 17 cities in Georgia are named, 12 cities in Iowa are \nincluded, and 23 cities in Oklahoma are listed.\n  Under current law, only Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, and \nRhode Island stand with Utah in having two or fewer locations in which \ndistrict court may be held. Utah is the largest of those States. Even \nwith the change, a mere four cities in Utah will be designated as \nplaces for holding district court.\n  I note for my colleagues that the bill does not require any \nadditional appropriations or any courthouse construction. It simply \npermits court to be held in two additional locations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HOLDING OF DISTRICT COURT IN PROVO AND ST. GEORGE, \n                   UTAH.\n\n       Section 125(2) of title 28, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting ``, Provo, and St. George'' after ``Salt Lake \n     City''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1668. A bill to improve the job and income security and retirement \nsecurity of the American worker, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE AMERICAN WORKERS ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, throughout the decades of the cold war, \nthe paramount national concern was national security. Now with the end \nof the cold war, concern is growing rapidly over another type of \nsecurity. This type of security has four aspects: job security, \nfinancial security, health security, and retirement security. For \nmillions of individuals and families, the proper word in each of these \naspects of their lives is ``insecurity,'' not ``security.'' No \npolitical party deserves to prevail if it fails to address these \nconcerns and propose a plausible strategy to end them.\n  The heart of the current crisis of economic insecurity is the growing \nrealization that growth and prosperity no longer benefit all families \nfairly. The quarter century after World War II was a golden era. Hard \nwork paid off as the economy grew and income rose for all. But no more.\n  Superficial signs of prosperity abound. The stock market has soared. \nInflation is consistently low and unemployment is down. But the \nprosperity is less than it seems. Americans are working harder and \nearning less. Their standard of living is stagnant or sinking. They are \nworried about losing their jobs, losing their health insurance, \naffording their children's education, caring for their elderly parents, \nand somehow still saving for their own retirement.\n  The rich are still getting richer but more and more families are left \nout and left behind. The rising tide that once lifted all the boats is \nnow lifting only the yachts.\n  Mr. President, these two charts reflect, I think, in a dramatic way \nwhat has effectively been happening in the U.S. economy over the period \nof the recent years. From 1947 to 1979, virtually 30 years, we found \nthat in each of the groups, the bottom 20 percent, second bottom 20 \npercent, the middle 20 percent, the top 20 percent, the second top 20 \npercent, and even the top 5 percent of Americans for almost 30 years--\n30 years--effectively grew together, the real family income group. All \nAmericans moved along and moved along together during periods of time \nwhen we had both recessions and inflation. Cumulatively over this \nperiod of time all Americans went along together.\n  But from 1979 to 1993, in the most recent period of time, taken \ncollectively, we will find out that those again at the bottom level, \nthe next to the bottom level, and even in the middle have been \nvirtually losing ground; that is, the bottom 60 percent, while the top \n40 percent have been moving well, and the top 5 percent has seen great \ngrowth, and the top 1 percent the largest growth. That reflects almost \ntwo-thirds of the American families over this period of time from 1979 \nto 1993 have been, in most instances, working harder, struggling longer \nhours, and have been gradually falling behind in terms of the real \nfamily income growth during this period, while those at the top end \nhave seen this extraordinary growth.\n  Mr. President, once now profitable companies are even laying off good \nworkers at unseemly rates for even fatter profits, even higher stock \nprices, and even more astronomical salaries and benefits for CEO's. And \nto add insult to injury, the fears on Main Street are met by cheers on \nWall Street.\n  We saw that in recent times when we saw the dramatic increase in the \ntotal number of jobs just a short while ago, 600,000 or 700,000 new \njobs, and the stock market going down over 100 points. And we saw it \nconversely when we saw bank mergers that were taking place just several \nweeks ago, a couple months ago, that saw the announcement of the loss \nof some 20,000 jobs, and the stocks as a result of the mergers going \nright up through the roof.\n  Mr. President, the Republican Contract With America is now largely \ndefunct because it would have made these problems worse. Its massive \ncuts in Medicare, education, and other priorities would have \nexacerbated the security of most families, and the lavish tax breaks \nfor the wealthy would have worsened the income gap. Clearly, the \nRepublican strategy is to comfort the comfortable and afflict the \nafflicted.\n  The Republican strategy is designed to exploit the income gap--but do \nnothing to solve it. In fact, half of all the spending cuts in the \nvetoed Republican budget came from programs benefiting the neediest 20 \npercent of families. Less than a tenth came from the top 20 percent, \nwhile two-thirds of the Republicans' proposed tax breaks would flow to \nthe top 20 percent, while the bottom 20 percent actually faced a tax \nincrease.\n  So we found even in the last proposal more was being demanded from \nthe working families, less from the wealthiest individuals, and yet \nthose families were going to be the ones who were going to benefit the \ngreatest amount from those proposed cuts and benefits from the Tax \nCode. Practical steps, not demagoguery, are needed to deal with each of \nthe four economic insecurities facing individuals and families.\n  In other times, Congresses have enacted restraints on runaway free \nenterprise to end abuses and bolster the public interest. The most \nobvious precedents are the antitrust laws, civil rights laws, the child \nlabor laws, minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nFederal aid to education.\n  Today is April 15--tax day. Ordinary Americans across the country are \nfiling their income taxes and wondering about their job security, their \nstagnant wages, their health care, their retirement, their ability to \neducate their\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nchildren, while our Republican colleagues are proposing tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest individuals and corporations in America.\n  Let us work together to increase economic security for all families. \nWe can find ways to align the interest of individuals and industries \nand allow them to grow together so that corporations and shareholders \ncan still reap profits, but not at the expense of the wages and \nstandards of living of their employees.\n  We should provide incentives to make it more profitable for employers \nto create jobs than eliminate them, share gains with employees rather \nthan channel them solely to the CEO's and shareholders, and provide \nreasonable job training, health, and retirement benefits. We can pay \nfor all those incentives by closing perverse incentives in the Tax Code \nthat encourage firms to move jobs overseas and treat workers as \ndisposable.\n  Action on several fronts is already underway. The Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill to guarantee health insurance for workers has bipartisan support \nand will be taken up this week in the Senate. It will deal with two \nflagrant problems in health insurance today--the excessive use of \nexclusions, the preexisting conditions, and the loss of insurance \ncoverage when employees lose their job or change their job.\n  The lesson of the health reform debate of 1994 is that a sharply \ndivided Congress cannot make far-reaching changes in election years. \nInstead of repeating that mistake, we should enact the reforms that \nhave broad bipartisan support and that are achievable this year, if \nboth sides in the ongoing health reform debate refrain from piling on \ncontroversial additional provisions.\n  Second, it is time to raise the minimum wage, which will soon reach \nits lowest level in 40 years. April 1 marked the fifth anniversary of \nthe last increase in the minimum wage. Raising it from $4.25 an hour to \n$5.15 an hour, in two steps this year and next year, as President \nClinton has proposed, will increase the wages of 13 million \nAmericans. It will be interesting to see whether Senator Dole and other \nRepublicans are prepared to join us as the debate goes on.\n\n  Third, Congress should reform the immigration laws to end antiworker \nabuses. Republicans and Democrats speak with one voice in urging the \nstrongest possible crackdown on illegal immigration. But reforms and \nlegal immigration are needed, too, in order to give American workers \nthe protection they need and deserve.\n  We should make it illegal for U.S. firms to lay off American workers \nand replace them with cheap imported foreign labor. Before U.S. firms \nhire foreign workers they should make a good-faith effort to hire \nqualified American workers. If we refuse to enact reasonable \nrestrictions to protect U.S. jobs, we will fuel the drive for extreme \nrestrictions that will slam the door unfairly against all immigrants.\n  Other steps are also needed to assist the American workers. Today, I \nam introducing a bill to create a two-tier tax rate for companies and \nencourage firms to act more responsibly toward their employees. If a \ncompany invests in education and training for its workers, provides \nadequate health care and retirement benefits, shares its profits with \nits workers, increases the wages of its work force at or above the \nConsumer Price Index, and makes child care available for all workers, \nit will receive a 25-percent reduction in the income tax rate it pays \non profits distributed as dividends to shareholders on this portion of \nits income.\n  The corporate tax rate will be reduced to 26 percent for corporations \nnow taxed at 35 percent, and corporate reductions will be available to \ncorporations now taxed at other rates. Under this plan, CEO's who \nresist measures to treat workers fairly will feel the wrath of \nshareholders, whose dividends will be lower because the corporations \nfail to act responsibly.\n  This is a two-tier tax rate for most-favored companies. I will show \nthe difference between company A and a most-favored company, using this \nchart. What we find out is that if they have the profits, they retain \nthe profits--in this case, they distribute them. They pay the $35. It \nwill amount to $70 in this illustration if it is a most-favored \ncompany. If they retained $100, but distributed to shareholders the \n$100 distribution, this would be a $25 tax reduction on the shares \ndistributed to the shareholders, which would mean there would be $26 on \nthis segment, meaning there would be $61 rather than the $70.\n  So, the drive for this kind of reduction will be the shareholders \nthat will be involved in this decision. This will rely on their \ninterest, their involvement, their pressure, rather than a governmental \ninstitution or a State institution to be able to move this process \nforward. They will see, with the distribution, that their taxes on that \ndistribution will be reduced.\n  We reward other countries with tariff benefits if they qualify as \nmost favored nations. We should create a category of most-favored \ncompanies and reward them when they treat their employees as assets.\n  In addition, the bill I am introducing today provides that the \nFederal Government, with its billions of dollars in Government \nprocurement and contracting, will give preference to these companies \nthat treat their employees well and qualify for the tax benefits--about \n$85 billion, $85 to $100 billion in various contracts. Those most-\nfavored companies would have the preference when competing with a \nnonfavorite for a particular contract. That would be true, as well as \nextended loan provisions that come through the various loaning agencies \nof the Federal Government. That is a smaller figure, about $20 billion, \nbut it is still very, very important, particularly for smaller \ncompanies, and smaller companies would be very much encouraged to \nparticipate.\n  The bill also places new restraints on corporate mergers and \nacquisitions, which are causing enormous job insecurity for workers and \nsubstantial layoffs and serious dislocations for entire communities. \nThis provision strengthens the antitrust laws by requiring a review of \nthe impact of these mergers on workers.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, the Labor \nDepartment, and the Securities and Exchange Commission will give \ngreater scrutiny to the corporate transactions likely to result in the \nclosing or downsizing of company, facilities, or plants that are part \nof the lifeblood of local communities.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, what we are talking about are the mergers and \nacquisitions, the amendments to the antitrust law. These two companies \nwant to merge, so they go through a review. Then there is a judgment \nthat is made that they will be able to go through and the merger will \ntake place. As part of the remedy process, the commissions will \nconsider not just competition considered at the present time but also \nconsider the impact on workers and communities. They will consider both \nof those.\n  We are not assigning percentages to each of them but we are taking \nnote that we believe that if we have established the antitrust laws to \nconsider competition between the various companies, that we also ought \nto encourage them to take a look at what the impact is going to be on \nworking families. Not to say that has to override, but just that it has \nto be considered as they are making the remedies, to go forward with \nany of the new mergers or with any of the divestitures. That is the \nplace this will go on through. We see the total number of mergers--\n2,800 last year. They have been escalating dramatically. About 20 \npercent of those are reviewed carefully by the Federal Trade Commission \nand DOJ. Only a small amount of them ever get into this kind of a \nprocess, but that is an extremely important item and can make a very, \nvery important difference.\n  Mr. President, in addition, the bill eliminates the tax deductions \nthat encourage mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that cost \nAmerican jobs and line the pockets of the financiers of the deals. \nAnother major section protects retirement security by encouraging \ncompanies to provide greater pension coverage for employees.\n  Last Thursday, President Clinton proposed a series of needed reforms \nin the current laws applicable to workers who now participate in \npension plans. These reforms will encourage new pension plans for small \nbusinesses, expands IRA eligibility, increases pension portability and \nprevents pension raiding.\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n  In addition, I am proposing several other reforms to facilitate \ncoverage for employees who do not have access to pension plans through \ntheir current employment plan. The bill establishes an individual \npension plan mechanism for all individuals without access to employer-\nbased plans. Workers will no longer be dependent upon their employer \nfor retirement planning and savings. The bill will provide portability \nto all these workers who could never before gain access to a pension \nplan. They will be able to take these plans with them from job to job. \nThe employer's sole responsibility is the payroll deduction of the \nemployees' savings.\n  Less than 50 percent of the private work force is now covered by \nprivate pension plans. More than 68 million Americans have no pension \ncoverage. Ironically, most of them work in smaller businesses, which \nare the driving force of the future economy. Yet their retirement needs \nare neglected. These are the workers who are the backbone of the \neconomy during their working lives. They constitute more than half of \nthe work force. We cannot ignore their retirement needs. Like health \ncare, good pension coverage should be accessible, affordable, and \nportable.\n  This chart demonstrates the alternative pension plan which is \nemployer based. Here we have the IRA's. The proposal that I am \nintroducing today, the individual pension plan which is the more \nacceptable, what this does, it says the employer will permit the \ncontribution by the employee into a pension system, that that pension \nsystem is going to have to live up to fiduciary and ERISA standards, \nwhich will give greater protections for the individual pension plans \nand the advantage of portability over the IRA's. Individuals will be \nable to take, though, their portable pension plans with them.\n  As we all know, most of the new jobs in the country are produced by \nthe small businesses. Pension plans will serve the retirement needs of \nmillions of existing and future small business workers with no pension \noptions.\n  Finally, the bill I am introducing expands educational opportunities \nfor workers by offering them the tax benefits for employers and \nfamilies. This is an issue that is familiar to most Members of this \nbody. What we find out once again, to learn what is the level of income \nfrom those that both do not finish high school compared to those that \ncomplete various segments of their education. This chart is the average \nannual earnings by level of education. We see that those that do not \nfinish high school and are employed earn $12,800; those that have \nprofessional degrees, earn $74,000. We know the stories of World War \nII. Every dollar invested was returned eight times to the Federal \nTreasury. The more incentives that we can provide to increase \nopportunities for education, the better off our economy and our ability \nto compete. We have incentives for both the training programs as well \nas tuition of programs spelled out.\n  The bill pays for these provisions with revenues generated from the \nrepeal of the incentives in the current tax law that encourage \ncompanies to close U.S. plants, uproot jobs in the United States, and \ntransfer them to foreign countries abroad.\n  We can save $40 billion or more over the next 7 years by repealing \ntax breaks for profits earned in foreign countries, tax exemptions for \ncompanies that transfer title to goods on the high seas to avoid U.S. \ntaxes; price rigging by multinational corporations that minimize U.S. \nincome and maximize income in foreign tax havens; sham corporations \nthat generate huge tax deductions for moving plants and jobs overseas, \nand loopholes that allow billionaires to thumb their noses at Uncle Sam \nand renounce their American citizenship and move to a foreign tax haven \nto evade taxes on the massive wealth they have accumulated in America.\n  The Members are familiar with this list because many of these have \nbeen offered by other Members of the Chamber at different times. We \nhave already voted on the billionaires' tax loophole, which benefits a \nhandful of Americans who have made substantial amounts of money--in \nsome instances, billionaires. By renouncing their citizenship and \nmoving overseas, they effectively escape all of the taxes on that money \nthat was earned in the United States, and they avoid paying any of \ntheir tax obligations by just escaping and renouncing American \ncitizenship. This is called the ``Benedict Arnold tax loophole.'' It is \nan appropriate name for it. The others are matters which raise some $40 \nbillion, and this is not even a complete list.\n  We are, obviously, open to other recommendations, suggestions, or \nadd-ons for this. But it does indicate that we do have an opportunity \nto reduce these kinds of incentives that, today, are impacting working \nfamilies. We will hear that we should not use the Tax Code to achieve \nsocial outcomes. The fact of the matter is that these tax provisions, \nwhich exist in the Internal Revenue Code today, are all impacting and \naffecting adversely working families. We are saying, let us stop that. \nWe cover the revenues here and provide the incentives for the American \nworkers.\n  The ``quiet depression'' facing American workers is the central \neconomic, social, and political issue of 1996. When the economy is \nwrong, nothing else is right. Progress and opportunity for all is a \nfundamental American value. We know the problem. We know its urgency. \nThe only thing that is unacceptable is to do nothing.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1670. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for postsecondary education expenses, to make permanent the \nexclusion for employer-provided education, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE COMMONSENSE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Commonsense Middle-\nClass Tax Relief Act.\n  Today, middle-class Americans are working longer hours for smaller \npaychecks. American families deserve a raise. And that's just what my \nlegislation provides--a raise in incomes, a raise in education and \nskills, and a raise in living standards.\n  The Commonsense Middle-Class Tax Relief Act is based on a fundamental \npremise: a higher education means higher income.\n  The bill would provide a $10,000 tax deduction for a person or their \nparents for the costs of tuition and fees at a college or for a \nvocational education. The full deduction would be available for \nfamilies with an adjusted gross income of $80,000 and would be reduced \nas the income exceeded that level, being completely phased out when the \ntaxpayer's income exceeded $100,000 for joint filing taxpayers.\n  For individuals the full credit would be available for those with \nadjusted incomes of up to $60,000 phasing out completely at $80,000. \nFor the current year, half of the $10,000 deduction would be available. \nThe full $10,000 deduction would be available starting in 1997 and \nthereafter. This provision is similar to one proposed by President \nClinton.\n  Under existing law, post-secondary expenses can only be deducted \nunder very narrow circumstances: if it is for the improvement of one's \nskills in a job a person holds above the skills needed to acquire that \nposition, but to acquire additional skills required by the government \nor the employer to stay in the position.\n  My measure also would restore the exclusion of employer-paid payments \nof post-secondary college and vocational education costs for \nimprovement of an employee's job related skills that were allowed prior \nto January 1, 1995. It would make the exclusion permanent.\n  The Commonsense Middle-Class Tax Relief Act will cut taxes on hard-\nworking families trying to get ahead, raise incomes, and prepare \nAmericans for the 21st century. It will mean higher incomes, higher \neducation, and higher quality jobs for hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. President, education is key to both the raising of incomes of \naverage Americans and to increasing the competitiveness of America in \nan increasingly global economy. I ask unanimous consent that a recent \narticle in the Washington Post by Lester Thurow on this topic be \nincluded in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \ncommonsense proposal. We should be able to agree on a bipartisan basis \nthat this type of important middle-class tax relief is needed and will \nmean better opportunities and better incomes for millions of Americans.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 7, 1996]\n\n               Preparing Students for the Coming Century\n\n                         (By Lester C. Thurow)\n\n       Consider an alphabetical list of the 12 largest companies \n     in America at the turn of the 20th century; the American \n     Cotton Oil Company, American Steel, American Sugar Refining \n     Company, Continental Tobacco, Federal Steel, General \n     Electric, National Lead, Pacific Mail, People's Gas, \n     Tennessee Coal and Iron, U.S. Leather and U.S. Rubber. Ten of \n     the 12 were natural resource companies. The economy then was \n     a natural resource economy, and wherever the most highly \n     needed resources were to be found, employment opportunities \n     would follow.\n       In contrast consider the list made 90 years later by the \n     Japanese Ministry of international Trade and Industry, \n     enumerating what it projected to be the most rapidly growing \n     industries of the 1990s: microelectronics, biotech, the new \n     material-science industries, telecommunications, civilian \n     aircraft manufacturing, machine tools and robots, and \n     computers (hardware and software). All are brainpower \n     industries that could be located anywhere on the face of the \n     earth. Where they will take root and flourish depends upon \n     who organizes the brainpower to capture them. And who \n     organizes the power most efficiently will depend on who \n     educates toward that objective best.\n       But back to the industries for the moment: Think of the \n     video camera and recorder (invented by Americans), the fax \n     (invented by Americans), and the CD player (invented by the \n     Dutch). When it comes to sales, employment and profits, all \n     have become Japanese products despite the fact that the \n     Japanese did not invent any of them. Product invention, if \n     one is also not the world's low-cost producer, gives a \n     country very little economic advantage. Being the low-cost \n     producer is partly a matter of wages, but to a much greater \n     extent it is a matter of having the skills necessary to put \n     new things together.\n       Wages don't depend on an individuals's skill and \n     productivity alone. To a great extent they reflect team \n     skills and team productivies. The value of any single \n     person's knowledge depends upon the smartness with which that \n     knowledge is used in the overall economic system--the \n     abilities of buyers and suppliers to absorb that individual's \n     skills.\n       In an era of brainpower industries, however, the picture is \n     even more complicated: The economy is a dynamic economy \n     always in transition--the companies that do best are those \n     able to move from product to product within technological \n     families so quickly that they can always keep one generation \n     ahead. Keeping one jump ahead in software, for instance, Bill \n     Gates's Microsoft had a net income running at 24 percent of \n     sales in 1995.\n       If a country wants to stay at the leading edge of \n     technology and continue to generate high wages and profits, \n     it must be a participant in the evolutionary progress of \n     brainpower industries so that it is in a position to take \n     advantage of the technical and economic revolutions that \n     occasionally arise. Knowledge has become the only source of \n     long-run sustainable competitive advantage. Recent studies \n     show that rates of return for industries that invest in \n     knowledge and skill are more than twice those of industries \n     that concentrate on plant and equipment. In the past, First \n     World citizens with Third World skills could earn premium \n     wages simply because they lived in the First World. They had \n     more equipment, better technology and more skilled co-workers \n     than those who lived in the Third World. But that premium is \n     gone Today's transportation and communications technologies \n     have become so sophisticated that high-wage skilled workers \n     in the First World can work together effectively with low-\n     wage unskilled workers in the Third World. America's \n     unskilled now get paid based on their own abilities and \n     not on those of their better-trained co-workers.\n       Industrial components that require highly skilled \n     manufacturers can be made in the First World and then shipped \n     to the Third World to be assembled with ``low skill'' \n     components. Research and design skills can be electronically \n     brought in from the First World. Sales results can be quickly \n     communicated to the Third World factory, and retailers know \n     that the speed of delivery won't be significantly affected by \n     where production occurs. Instant communications and rapid \n     transportation allow markets to be served effectively from \n     production points on the other side of the globe.\n       Multinational companies are central in this process: Where \n     they develop and keep technological leadership will determine \n     where most of the high-level jobs will be located. If these \n     firms decide to locate their top-wage leadership skills in \n     the United States, it will not be because they happen to be \n     American firms but because America offers them the lowest \n     cost of developing these skills. The decisions will be purely \n     economic. If America is not competitive in this regard, the \n     market will move on. The countries that offer companies the \n     lowest costs of developing technological leadership will be \n     the countries that invest the most in research and \n     development, education and infrastructure (telecommunications \n     systems, etc.).\n       If the person on a loading dock runs a computerized \n     inventory-control system in which he logs delivered materials \n     right into his hand-held computer and the computer instantly \n     prints out a check that is given to the truck driver to be \n     taken back to his firm (eliminating the need for large white-\n     collar accounting offices that process purchases), the person \n     on the loading dock ceases to be someone who just moves \n     boxes. He or she has to have a very different skill set.\n       Factory operatives and laborers used to be high school \n     graduates or even high school dropouts. Today 16 percent of \n     them have some college education and 5 percent have graduated \n     from college. Among precision production and craft workers, \n     32 percent have been to or graduated from college. Among new \n     hires those percentages are much higher. In the last two \n     decades, the linkage between math abilities and wages has \n     tripled for men and doubled for women.\n       The skill sets required in the economy of the future will \n     be radically different from those required in the past. And \n     the people who acquire those skill sets may not be the \n     unskilled workers who currently live in the first world. With \n     the ability to make anything anywhere in the world and sell \n     it anywhere else in the world, business firms can ``cherry \n     pick'' the skilled or those easy (i.e., cheap) to teach \n     wherever they live. American firms don't have to hire an \n     American high school graduate if that graduate is not world-\n     class. His or her educational defects are not their problem. \n     Investing to give the necessary market skills to a well-\n     educated Chinese high school graduate may well end up being a \n     much more attractive (i.e., less costly) investment than \n     having to retrain an American high school dropout or a poorly \n     trained high school graduate.\n       Take Korea for example. In a global economy, what \n     economists know as ``the theory of factor price \n     equalization'' holds that an American worker will have to \n     work for wages commensurate with a Korean's wages unless he \n     works with more natural resources than a Korean (and no \n     American can, since there is now a world market for raw \n     material to which everyone has equal access); unless he has \n     access to more capital than a Korean (and no American can \n     since there is a global capital market where everyone borrows \n     in New York, London and Tokyo); unless he has more skilled \n     co-workers than a Korean (and no American can claim to \n     since multinational companies can send needed knowledge \n     and skills anywhere in the world); and unless he has \n     access to better technology than a Korean (and few \n     Americans have, since reverse engineering--tearing a \n     product apart to learn how it is made--has become an \n     international art form; highly refined in Korea). Adjusted \n     for skills, Korean wages will rise and American wages will \n     fall until they equal each other. At that point, factor \n     price equalization will have occurred.\n       The implications for the future are simple. If America \n     wants to generate a high standard of living for all of its \n     citizens, skill and knowledge development are central. New \n     brainpower industries have to be invented and captured. \n     Organizing brainpower means not just building a research and \n     development system that will put us on the leading edge of \n     technology, but organizing a top-to-bottom work force that \n     has the brainpower necessary to make us masters of the new \n     production and distribution technologies that will allow us \n     to be the world's low-cost producers.\n       To do this will require a very different American \n     educational system. And building such a system is the new \n     American challenge.\n       Progress has to start by ratcheting up the intensity of the \n     American high school. The performance of the average American \n     high school graduate simply lags far behind that found in the \n     rest of the industrial world. Those Americans who complete a \n     college course of study end up catching up (the rest of the \n     industrial world doesn't work very hard in the first couple \n     of years of university education), but three-quarters of the \n     American work force doesn't ever catch up.\n       The skill gap doesn't end there. Non-college-bound high \n     school graduates elsewhere in the industrial world go on to \n     some form of post-secondary skill training. Germany has its \n     famous apprenticeship system; in France every business firm \n     by law has to spend one percent of its sales revenue on \n     training its work force; and with lifetime employment as a \n     fact of life, Japanese companies invest heavily in the work \n     force's skills since they know that it is impossible to hire \n     skilled workers from the outside. In America, government-\n     funded programs are very limited in nature, and, with high \n     labor-force turnover rates, American companies quite \n     rationally don't want to make skill investments in people who \n     will leave and take their skills elsewhere. The net result is \n     a compounded skill gap for those Americans who do not \n     graduate from college. Closing this gap and giving the \n     country a competitive edge should be America's number one \n     educational priority.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1671. A bill to provide for cockpit voice recorders and flight \ndata recorders on noncombat aircraft of the Armed Forces; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n          department of defense noncombat aircraft legislation\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that \nrequires all Department of Defense noncombat aircraft to have both \ncockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders. I was shocked to \nlearn that the airplane that crashed in Bosnia with tragic loss of 35\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nlives including Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce was not equipped \nwith those important devices.\n  We need to thoroughly understand why any plane crash occurs. With \nthat knowledge, was can better protect other planes of a similar type. \nIn this case, the Department of Defense plane used was very similar to \ncivilian aircraft. In other cases that may not be true. But, in all \ncases, we need to fully understand crashes and near crashes to better \nimprove our safety record.\n  The bill provides that the Department of Defense should establish \nrules to require that noncombat aircraft contain those devices within \n120 days of enactment and that the devices be in place within 1 year. \nThe legislation provides that the requirements for the Department be as \nsimilar as possible to those used by the FAA.\n  On April 9, I wrote to Secretary Perry about this issue and asked how \nmany DOD noncombat planes do not have these devices and what would be \nthe cost of placing those devices into those aircraft. It is possible \nthat there may be some narrow category of non-combat aircraft where \nthese devices would not be appropriate because of the specialized \nnature of the aircraft or extreme cost. If that is the case, I look \nforward to learning about the specific situations involved. There may \nbe a need for some exceptions. But, I believe that the Congress should \nmove forward to require that these devices be on DOD aircraft as \nquickly as possible. I hope that we will act to pass this legislation, \nperhaps with some modification, very quickly.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 358\n\n  At

The \ncenter will be hosting its first annual gala ``Unity of Friendship'' in \nHouston on May 4, 1996, and it is worthy of recognition.\n  Mr. President, I commend those members for their efforts in building \nthis center, which in effect advances and demonstrates the continuing \npositive contributions of Arab-Americans. This center will primarily \nserve the cultural, educational, and social needs of the Arab-American \ncommunity. The center proclaims their vision as ``a place where Arab-\nAmerican culture, art, and language can be preserved and carried on for \ngenerations to come. A place where Arab-Americans can gather to \ncelebrate holidays and festive occasions among relatives and friends. A \nplace where children can play, study, and learn about their ancestors \nimpressive history and heritage.''\n  Many in the Arab-American community have given generously of their \ntime and money for the construction of this center. They are to be \ncommended for their very worthwhile efforts and foresight, and I am \npleased to recognize these efforts in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3320-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HOCKEY TEAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the University \nof Michigan hockey team, because Saturday, March 30, 1996, the \nWolverines captured the NCAA hockey championship, defeating Colorado \nCollege by a score of 3 to 2 in overtime. The game was held at \nRiverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati in front of a sell out crowd of \n13,330, mostly Michigan fans who traveled south to support their team.\n  Coach Red Berenson has described his formula for success as ``hard \nwork . . . patience and perseverance,'' and that was what the members \nof the U. of M. hockey team embraced this 1995-96 season as they \ntriumphed in their final victory with a tie-breaking goal by junior \nBrendan Morrison, 2 minutes and 35 seconds into overtime. This victory \nfor the Wolverine hockey team ended the doubts that this team could \nreturn home as NCAA champions. Colorado College coach Don Lucia said, \n``Look at the teams Michigan has beaten the last three weeks: Lake \nSuperior, Minnesota, Boston University and now us. Those are the best \nteams in the country. That's why they're national champions.''\n  This journey by the U. of M. hockey team was a remarkable achievement \nfor the players, and for Coach Red Berenson as well. The victory over \nColorado marked the 300th victory of his career. A former U. of M. \nplayer himself 1960-62, this commemorated a special homecoming for \nCoach Berenson.\n  This is the eighth national champsionship in the Wolverines' hockey \nhistory, more than any other collegiate program. Thirty-two years after \ntheir last title, the Wolverines proved to be the best in the west by \nreturning the trophy to Ann Arbor. A sign on the desk of Red Berenson, \nreads, ``Our Day Will Come,'' and it certainly has.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the \nUniversity of Michigan hockey team on winning the NCAA hockey \nchampionship.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough March 29, 1996. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget. House \nConcurrent Resolution 67, show that current level spending is above the \nbudget resolution by $16.0 billion in budget authority and by $16.9 \nbillion in outlays. Current level is $81 million below the revenue \nfloor in 1996 and $5.5 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years \n1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of \ncalculating the maximum deficit amount is $262.6 billion, $17.0 billion \nabove the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated March 25, 1996, Congress has cleared and \nthe President has signed the Contract With America Advancement Act. \nPublic Law 104-121, the Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act, Public \nLaw 104-127, and the 12th continuing resolution for 1996, Public Law \n104-122. The continuing resolution also included the Federal payment to \nthe District of Columbia and emergency funding for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina for economic revitalization. These actions changed the \ncurrent level of budget authority and outlays.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1996.\n     Hon.

The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of the 1996 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con.

Mr. President, I am concerned that we are waffling \non the China issue when we should be very clear.\n  Clarity in this case will lead to a diminished likelihood of military \naction and a diminished likelihood of a spurt to the arms race in Asia.\n  The Charles Krauthammer column which appeared in the Washington Post \nrecently, and which I ask to be printed in the Record after my remarks, \nis unfortunately accurate. It eloquently outlines what has been taking \nplace. He also mentions the matter of ``quiet diplomacy.'' Whenever I \ntalk to people in the State Department they assure me that ``quiet \ndiplomacy'' is being used.\n  My experience over the years is that ``quiet diplomacy'' frequently \nmeans no diplomacy or it means ``anemic diplomacy.''\n  The column follows.\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n       China's Four Slaps--and the United States' Craven Response\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       The semi-communist rulers of China like to assign numbers \n     of things. They particularly like the number 4. There was the \n     Gang of Four. There were the Four Modernizations \n     (agriculture, industry, technology and national defense). and \n     now, I dare say, we have the Four Slaps: four dramatic \n     demonstrations of Chinese contempt for expressed American \n     interests and for the Clinton administration's ability to do \n     anything to defend them.\n       (1) Proliferation. The Clinton administration makes clear \n     to China that it strongly objects to the export of nuclear \n     and other mass destruction military technology. What does \n     China do? Last month, reports the CIA, China secretly sent \n     5,000 ring magnets to Pakistan for nuclear bomb-making and \n     sent ready-made poison gas factories to Iran.\n       (2) Human rights. Clinton comes into office chiding Bush \n     for ``coddling dictators.'' In March 1994, Secretary of State \n     Warren Christropher goes to China wagging his finger about \n     human rights. The Chinese respond by placing more than a \n     dozen dissidents under house arrest while Christopher is \n     there, then declare that human rights in China are none of \n     his business. Christopher slinks away.\n       (3) Trade. The administration signs agreements with China \n     under which it pledges to halt its massive pirating of \n     American software and other intellectual property. China \n     doesn't just break the agreements, it flouts them. Two years \n     later the piracy thrives.\n       (4) And now Taiwan. For a quarter-century, the United \n     States has insisted that the unification of Taiwan with China \n     must occur only peacefully. Yet for the last two weeks, China \n     has been conducting the most threatening military \n     demonstration against Taiwan in 40 years: firing M-9 surface-\n     to-surface missiles within miles of the island, holding huge \n     live-fire war games with practice invasions, closing shipping \n     in the Taiwan Strait.\n       Slap four is the logical outcome of the first three, each \n     of which was met with a supine American response, some \n     sputtering expression of concern backed by nothing. On \n     nuclear proliferation, for example, Clinton suspended \n     granting new loan guarantees for U.S. businesses in \n     China--itself a risible sanction--for all of one month!\n       ``Our policy is one of engagement, not containment,'' says \n     Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and \n     Pacific affairs. This is neither. This is encouragement.\n       Two issues are at stake here. The first is the fate of \n     Taiwan and its democracy. Taiwan is important not just \n     because it is our eighth-largest trading partner. With its \n     presidential elections tomorrow, Taiwan becomes the first \n     Chinese state in history to become a full-fledged democracy. \n     It thus constitutes the definitive rebuff to the claim of \n     Asian dictators from Beijing to Singapore that democracy is \n     alien to Confucian societies. Hence Beijing's furious \n     bullying response.\n       The second issue has nothing to do with Taiwan. It is \n     freedom of the seas. As the world's major naval power, we \n     are, like 19th century Britain, its guarantor--and not from \n     altruism, Living on an island continent, America is a \n     maritime trading nation with allies and interests and \n     commerce across the seas. If the United States has any vital \n     interests at all--forget for the moment Taiwan or even \n     democracy--it is freedom of navigation.\n       Chinese Premier Li Peng warns Washington not to make a show \n     of force--i.e., send our Navy--through the Taiwan Strait. \n     Secretary of Defense William Perry responds with a boast that \n     while the Chinese ``are a great military power, the premier--\n     the strongest--military power in the Western Pacific is the \n     United States.''\n       Fine words. But Perry has been keeping his Navy away from \n     the strait. This is to talk loudly and carry a twig. If we \n     have, in Perry's words, ``the best damned Navy in the \n     world,'' why are its movements being dictated by Li Peng? The \n     Taiwan Strait is not a Chinese lake. It is indisputably \n     international water and a vital shipping lane. Send the fleet \n     through it.\n       And tell China that its continued flouting of the rules of \n     civil international conduct--everything from commercial \n     piracy to nuclear proliferation, culminating with its \n     intimidation of Taiwan--means the cancellation of most-\n     favored-nation trading status with the United States.\n       Yes, revoking MFN would hurt the United States somewhat. \n     But U.S.-China trade amounts to a mere two-thirds of one \n     percent of U.S. GDP. It amounts to fully 9 percent of\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n     Chinese GDP. Revocation would be a major blow to China.\n       Yet astonishingly, with live Chinese fire lighting up the \n     Taiwan Strait, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Tuesday \n     that the Clinton administration supports continued MFN for \n     China. He did aver that Congress, angered by recent events, \n     would probably not go along.\n       This is timorousness compounded. Revoking MFN is the least \n     we should do in response to China's provocations. Pointing to \n     Congress is a classic Clinton cop-out. The issue is not \n     Congress's zeal. It is Beijing's thuggery.\n       Quiet diplomacy is one thing. But this is craven diplomacy. \n     What does it take to get this administration to act? The \n     actual invasion of Taiwan? You wait for war, you invite \n     war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3321-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RABBI MORRIS S. FRIEDMAN PLANS JUNE RETIREMENT AFTER 46 YEARS IN THE \n                               RABBINATE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to honor Rabbi Morris S. \nFriedman of Temple Hillel in North Woodmere, NY, on his retirement \nafter so many years of dedicated service.\n  In October 1984, Rabbi Friedman welcomed then-President Ronald Reagan \nto his synagogue, Temple Hillel in North Woodmere, where the President \nspoke to a packed congregation. Afterwards, Rabbi Friedman hosted the \nPresident at his home for lunch. Together they sat, with the rabbi's \nwife and children, as well as Secretary of State James Baker and \nmyself.\n  The visit by President Reagan to Rabbi Friedman's temple and home was \ntestimony to the influence and cachet of Rabbi Friedman himself, and to \nthe enormous prestige that Temple Hillel amassed over the 33 years of \nRabbi Friedman's leadership. It may have been the first time that a \nsitting President lunched at the home of a rabbi; but it was not the \nfirst time that Rabbi Friedman held conversations with world leaders. \nFrom his corner of the world in North Woodmere, Rabbi Friedman has \ninfluenced many thousands of lives, those on the world stage and those \npresiding over the births and deaths and joys and sorrows of a \ncongregation that each year tops 1,000 people.\n  In June of this year, Rabbi Friedman will retire from the pulpit at \nTemple Hillel.\n  ``One of my favorite books in the Bible,'' said Rabbi Friedman when \nhe announced his retirement, ``is the Book of Ecclesiastes. The third \nchapter begins with a statement, `A season is set for everything, a \ntime for every experience under Heaven.' ''\n  His congregation will honor and pay tribute to him, and to his wife, \nMrs. Adelaide Friedman, at a dinner on April 21. ``My years at Hillel \nare truly a love affair between me and the congregation. The \nfriendship, affection and devotion showered upon me and Addi by the \ncongregation, made my service to the community a privilege, a joy and \nan exciting spiritual adventure,'' said Rabbi Friedman, looking back at \na 33-year relationship.\n  It will be one of a long line of testimonial dinners made in his \nhonor, because Rabbi Friedman's dedication to Jewish causes reached far \nand wide beyond his own temple. He has been honored by Boy's Town in \nJerusalem; by Bet El, a 13-year-old-settlement in Judea Samaria in \nIsrael; by Touro College's School of Health Sciences, among others.\n  He has received numerous awards and much recognition, such as the \nZedakah Award from the UJA Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in New \nYork, and the degree of honorary fellow conferred upon him by Bar Ilan \nUniversity in Israel. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America \nconferred upon him an honorary doctor of divinity degree in 1975.\n  His stature in the Jewish community led him to his former, very \nprestigious, role as the president of the New York Board of Rabbis, the \nlargest rabbinic organization in the world. He was also chairman of the \nUnited Jewish Appeal-Federation Rabbinic Advisory Council. He served \nfor 2 years, as well, as chairman of the Rabbinical Assembly Campaign \nfor the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. For the past 5 years, \nhe has cochaired the Annual Nassau County Dinner for the Shaare-Zedek \nHospital in Jerusalem.\n  Rabbi Friedman has further enriched the spiritual lives of this \ncongregants by guiding them through Israel on dozens of visits over the \nyears. His own personal travels have taken him to Israel and Europe \nmany times over. But he would be the first to say the true richness of \nhis life comes from the joy and love of his family, his wife Adelaide, \nhis daughter, Naomi, his 2 sons, Mark and David, and his 12 \ngrandchildren.\n  Mrs. Adelaide Friedman has also greatly enriched the lives of those \naround her. With degrees in English literature, a bachelor's from Long \nIsland University and a master's from Hofstra, Mrs. Friedman taught \nEnglish literature at the high school level in girls' yeshivas. She \nherself has been writing all her life, poetry and short stories, as \nwell as articles and book reviews. Mrs. Friedman wrote a regular, \nmonthly column for the Jewish World several years ago and her book \nreviews have also appeared in Lifestyles magazine and the quarterly \npublication for the New York Board of Rabbis. She has had articles \npublished on Jewish subjects in several magazines and periodicals, such \nas the Algemeiner Journal, a Yiddish newspaper.\n  Mrs. Friedman taught adult education courses at Temple Hillel on \nJewish literature and has given lectures on Jewish women in literature \nat the Hewlett-Woodmere Library. Her creative talents encompass art as \nwell as writing. She loves to work with oils and pastels and the \nportraits and still-lifes she has painted hang on the wall of her home \nand her children's homes.\n  But it is her role as a rebbitzen for 46 years that has presented \ntruly great rewards. ``I loved being involved in something bigger than \nmyself,'' said Mrs. Friedman. ``I loved the idea of connecting with \nJewish events as they unrolled and being inspired by lectures and great \npersonalities. It was a very exciting period in my life because I \nwasn't only a wife and a mother and eventually a grandmother, much as I \nenjoyed those roles--and still enjoy those roles, I was also part of \nwhat was transpiring among the Jewish people.''\n  Before Rabbi and Mrs. Friedman came to North Woodmere, he served in \nCongregation Beth David in Lynbrook for 13 years as their rabbi. He had \nbeen ordained by the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York and had \nreceived a master of Hebrew literature degree and a BA degree from Long \nIsland University.\n  Temple Hillel will say goodbye to Rabbi Friedman this June with much \nreluctance. But the congregation knows he will continue to be nearby to \noffer his guidance and wisdom for years to come, as the rabbi emeritus \nof Temple Hillel. It is a guidance that has taken Temple Hillel to \ngreat heights. Said Rabbi Friedman, ``I feel, without any hesitation, \nthat we have achieved stardom in the galaxy of Conservative \nCongregations in the New York Area, and even worldwide!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3322-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3322-S3323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DR.

Her many hours of service are \nappreciated by all.\n  Dan Pearl has served the people of Sunrise in various capacities and \nis currently deputy mayor. Over a decade ago, Mr. Pearl implemented a \nfree flu shot program, a service which was not covered by Medicare at \nthe time. He has shown his dedication to seniors and the American \nCancer Society, and can occasionally be found bagging groceries at Winn \nDixie in order to raise money for the organization.\n  Joe Rosen's dedication to the city of Sunrise and Broward County is \nfar reaching. Not only has he held numerous positions in volunteer \norganizations, he has been integral in raising over $45,000 for a host \nof senior organizations throughout Broward. His concern for the safety \nof his city's streets is exemplified by his role as commander of \nCitizens on Patrol-Night Crime Patrol.\n\n  Jean Ross, of Margate, a dynamic member of Broward County's senior \ncommunity, currently serves as president of the Broward County Council \nof Senior Citizens. This organization serves seniors by providing them \nwith much needed information and assistance. Jean has also assured that \nthe council's blood drives are successful by working closely with \nBroward County's High Schools on an incentive program.\n  An exemplary senior advocate and resident of Tamarac, Marc Sultanof \nserves numerous organizations, particularly in the Kings Point \nneighborhood. He recently was elected to the Area Agency's Advisory \nCouncil, where he serves with distinction, and was appointed as a 1995 \ndelegate to the White House Conference on Aging by Gov. Lawton Chiles.\n  Katherine Thibault is currently serving a second term as a Pembroke \nPines city commissioner. As a result of her efforts in the 1994 Area \nAgency Seniors for Seniors Dollar Drive, Commissioner Thibault helped \nraised thousands of dollars for senior programs in Broward County.

Mr. President, the Reader's Digest recently \ncondensed an article from the Minneapolis Star Tribune written by Chris \nIson and Dennis McGrath that talks about the pull of legalized gambling \nin the State of Minnesota, which I ask to be printed in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n  For those who are unaware of the problems that we face, please read \nthis article.\n  It illustrates why we need a national commission to take a look at \nwhere we are going in this Nation on legalized gambling. The article \nfollows:\n\n                  [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune]\n\n                      Gambling's Toll in Minnesota\n\n                 (By Chris Ison and Dennis J. McGrath)\n\n       [America is becoming a nation of gamblers. Once confined to \n     Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Reno, gambling is now legal in \n     48 states--all but Hawaii and Utah--and casinos run full tilt \n     in 24. Almost 100 million Americans bet $400 billion last \n     year and lost $39 billion to the house.\n       To win legal status, the industry promised some tax-poor \n     states a river of money for public programs. But along with \n     the wealth came an alarming rise in suicides, bankruptcies \n     and crime. Here is the experience of one state, where the \n     first full-service casino was welcomed in 1988].\n       Hour after hour, the blackjack cards flipped past, and \n     still she played. Friday afternoon blurred into Saturday. \n     Through the ringing of slot machines and chattering of coins \n     dropping into tin trays, Catherine Avina heard her name \n     paged.\n       ``Are you coming home tonight?'' It was her 21-year-old \n     son, Joaquin, on the phone. ``Probably not,'' she answered.\n       Avina didn't go to Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake, Minn., \n     as much as she escaped to it. That weekend in May 1994, the \n     depressed 49-year-old mother of three was escaping the worst \n     news yet--she was in danger of being fired after almost 11 \n     years as an assistant state attorney general. On Monday--her \n     fourth straight day at the casino--she dragged herself back \n     to her St. Paul home, broke and more depressed than ever.\n       Two days later, Joaquin confronted his mother about her \n     gambling, and they argued. The next morning, when she didn't \n     come out of her bedroom, he peeked in. Two empty bottles of \n     anti-depressants and a suicide note were near her body. Later \n     the family found debts of more than $7,000, and Avina was \n     still making payments for gambling-addiction therapy received \n     a year earlier.\n       In less than a decade legalized gambling in Minnesota--$4.1 \n     billion is legally wagered in the state each year--has \n     created a new class of addicts, victims and criminals whose \n     activities are devastating families. Even conservative \n     estimates of the social toll suggest that problem gambling \n     costs Minnesotans more than $200 million per year in taxes, \n     lost income, bad debts and crime.\n       Ten years ago only one Gamblers Anonymous group was meeting \n     in the state; today there are 53 groups. According to \n     research by the Center for Addiction Studies at the \n     University of Minnesota in Duluth, nearly 38,000 Minnesota \n     adults are probably pathological gamblers. A 1994 Star \n     Tribune/WCCO-TV poll found that 128,000 adults in Minnesota--\n     four percent--showed signs associated with problem gambling \n     and gambling addiction.\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\n       Many experts agree that the potential for gambling \n     addiction among the young--the most vulnerable group--is \n     worse. Teens are twice as likely as adults to become \n     addicted.\n       Jeff Copeland, a 21-year-old from suburban Minneapolis, \n     can't go to college because he's accumulated a $20,000 \n     gambling debt. ``It ruins your life,'' he says. ``And people \n     don't really understand. I thought about suicide. It's the \n     easiest way to get out of it.''\n       Pawnshop Boom: Thousands of Minnesotans are burying \n     themselves in debt because of gambling, borrowing millions \n     they'll never be able to pay back. Bankruptcy experts \n     estimate that more than 1,000 people a year are filing for \n     bankruptcy protection (average owed: $40,000), at an \n     estimated cost to creditors of more than $2.5 million. \n     ``Compared with ten years ago, there are 20 times as many \n     people who have gambling debts,'' says bankruptcy attorney \n     Jack Prescott of Minneapolis.\n       One of these is Hennepin County Commissioner Sandra Hilary \n     of Minneapolis. She filed for bankruptcy two days after \n     admitting she was addicted to slot machines. She estimated \n     she'd lost nearly $100,000 gambling. After counseling, Hilary \n     is now trying to reimburse her creditors.\n       Throughout the state, at least 17 new pawnshops have sprung \n     up near casinos, with gamblers hocking possessions for far \n     less than real value to support their gambling habits. In \n     or near Cass Lake (pop. 923), four miles from Palace Bingo \n     & Casino, there are four pawnshops. That's a pawnshop for \n     every 231 people.\n       Police near casinos note an increase in bogus reports of \n     thefts. These come from people who lie about the \n     disappearance of a ring, video camera or other expensive item \n     that they actually pawned to pay for their gambling.\n       Easy Credit: Minnesotans are also burning up welfare \n     payments at casinos. Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer \n     dollars that are meant to provide food, clothes and housing \n     for the poor are being wagered on blackjack and in slot \n     machines, and for residents of two Minnesota counties, the \n     money is being made available from automated teller machines \n     inside almost every casino in the state. During a typical \n     month last year, welfare recipients from Hennepin and Ramsey \n     counties withdrew $39,000 in benefits from casino ATMs.\n       There are few incentives for casinos to regulate the \n     availability of credit to gamblers. The casinos can't lose: \n     they don't give the credit; they simply make the money.\n       Credit-card companies--there are now more than 7000--have \n     made strong profits in recent years despite increasing \n     bankruptcy and delinquent payments nationwide. Interest rates \n     are so high--averaging 18 percent--they still make up for \n     losses from bankruptcy. And the issuers pass much of the loss \n     onto consumers through higher rates, fees and penalties, says \n     Ruth Susswein, executive director of Bankcard Holders of \n     America, a nonprofit consumer-education group.\n       ``They're making so much money it's been worth it to them \n     to keep offering credit,'' Susswein adds. Some casinos also \n     rent space to companies that cash checks and provide credit-\n     card advances for fees.\n       Police Burden: It seemed to take only minutes for Carol \n     Foley to get hooked on video gambling machines. ``Within two \n     or three days,'' she says, ``I was playing every day.'' To \n     cover her losses, Foley, 43, forged $175,000 in checks at her \n     job at the E. M. Lohmann Co., a church-goods dealer in St. \n     Paul. Last September she was released from a correction \n     center in Roseville, Minn., after serving eight months for \n     forgery. She underwent counseling for her gambling addiction \n     and is on a monthly payment plan with her former employer.\n       The high crime rate among problem gamblers has been well \n     established. The National Council on Problem Gambling found \n     that 75 percent of gamblers treated at in-patient centers had \n     committed a crime.\n       Between 1988--when the first of Minnesota's 17 casinos \n     began operating--and 1994, counties with casinos saw the \n     crime rate rise twice as fast as those without casinos. The \n     increase was the greatest for crimes linked to gambling, such \n     as fraud, theft and forgery/counterfeiting.\n       Casinos are burdening local police. When Grand Casino Mille \n     Lacs opened on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in April \n     1991, county police responded to almost twice as many \n     incidents of crime or people seeking help on the reservation.\n       Jean Mott, a 38-year-old mother of three, worked nights at \n     a Kmart distribution center to help pay the family bills. But \n     the bills began backing up when Mott headed to Mystic Lake \n     Casino, rather than her Shakopee home, at the end of her \n     shift.\n       Just before dawn one day in January 1995, having lost \n     another paycheck to the casino, Mott drove to the Brooks' \n     Food Market in Shakopee. Wearing a ski mask and with her hand \n     in her pocket to simulate a gun, she stole $233. Police \n     easily traced the holdup to Mott because a patrol officer had \n     run a registration check after he saw her car parked with its \n     lights on just south of the store that morning. Mott was \n     convicted of simple robbery, and served 30 days in jail and \n     30 days on electronic home monitoring.\n       Taxpayer Tab: The list of violent gambling-related crimes \n     is also growing. Redwood Falls police officer Derek Woodford \n     was shot by a gambler from Gary, Ind., who had broken into a \n     local bank after a day of gambling at Jackpot Junction in \n     Morton. Woodford spent 13 days in the hospital recovering \n     from three bullet wounds.\n       Gambling has long been recognized, as well, as a root cause \n     of embezzlement. In most gambling-related embezzlement cases, \n     authorities say, the court file shows the same thing: no \n     previous criminal record.\n       ``Prior to 1990, we had zero cases of gambling-related \n     embezzlements,'' says William Urban, president of Loss \n     Prevention Specialists, Inc., a Minneapolis company that \n     helps employers deal with internal thefts. Since then the \n     company has investigated gambling-related losses of ``well \n     over $500,000.''\n       Reva Wilkinson, of Cedar, is now in federal prison for \n     embezzling more than $400,000 from the Guthrie Theater to \n     support her gambling habit. Besides the money she stole from \n     her Minneapolis employer, her case cost taxpayers over \n     $100,000 to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate.\n       In June 1993 Theresa Erdmann was charged with stealing \n     nearly $120,000 from the checking account and weekly \n     offerings at St. Michael's Catholic Church in Madison. She \n     said the money was blown on gambling, and now she's serving a \n     three-year sentence in a state prison.\n       Hidden Suicides: More and more, some problem gamblers pay \n     the ultimate price. The Star Tribune confirmed six gambling-\n     related suicides in Minnesota--five in the past three years. \n     Almost certainly, this is only a fraction of the total.\n       The victims are people like 19-year-old John Lee, a St. \n     Paul college student who, in a three-month period, won about \n     $30,000 at blackjack. Then he started losing. Down to his \n     last $10,000, he lost it all one night. He returned home, put \n     a shotgun to his head and killed himself. In addition, at \n     least 122 Minnesota gamblers have attempted suicide, \n     according to directors of the six state-funded gambling-\n     treatment centers.\n       Other deaths that may be related to depression over \n     gambling losses are not listed as suicides at all. ``So \n     often, when people talk about suicide, they say, `I'd just \n     drive off the road. I'd drive into a tree,' '' says Sandi \n     Brustuen of the Vanguard Compulsive Gambling Treatment \n     Program in Granite Falls, Minn. ``They don't want anyone to \n     know they committed suicide, and they want their families to \n     collect the insurance.''\n       The suicide rate among pathological gamblers nationally is \n     believed to rival that of drug addicts. Ten to 20 percent of \n     pathological gamblers have attempted suicide, and almost 90 \n     percent have contemplated it.\n       Treatment experts, researchers and gamblers themselves say \n     states can do more to reduce the negative consequences for \n     gamblers. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned \n     ideas:\n       Underwrite better research: Many research efforts across \n     the country have been criticized for failing to prove that \n     treatment works, for failing to measure the social costs of \n     gambling and for failing to implement a long-range plan to \n     address problem-gambling issues. ``We really don't know \n     exactly how much problem gamblers cost society,'' says Henry \n     Lesieur, editor of the Journal of Gambling Studies and a \n     criminal-justice professor at Illinois State University in \n     Normal.\n       On the federal level, the issue of gambling addiction only \n     recently started to generate action. Last fall committees in \n     the House and Senate held hearings on bills that would \n     authorize a national commission to study the economic and \n     social effects of legalized gambling.\n       Emphasize public awareness and education--especially among \n     young people--about the risks of gambling: Some suggest \n     funding more in-school efforts, perhaps in conjunction with \n     math and science classes or anti-drug programs. ``Let people \n     know what the odds are. The longer you gamble, the more \n     you're going to lose,'' says Alan Gilbert, solicitor general \n     of Minnesota.\n       Train casino employees to spot--and discourage--problem \n     gamblers from betting irresponsibly: Some casinos already do \n     this. But they offer only anecdotal evidence that such \n     efforts are used, and some say they've never barred a person \n     for problem gambling unless the person asked to be barred.\n       Gambling has significant social and economic impact. It \n     results in ruined lives, families and businesses; in \n     bankruptcies and bad loans; in suicides, embezzlements and \n     other crimes committed to feed or cover up gambling habits--\n     and increases in costs to taxpayers for investigating, \n     prosecuting and punishing those crimes.\n       Few of these problems have been documented as communities \n     and states across the nation instead focus on gambling as a \n     way to boost their economies and increase tax revenues. But \n     for Minnesota the social costs of gambling are emerging in \n     vivid and tragic detail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3323-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3324-S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DAY OF RECKONING\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today is April 15, the day of \nreckoning for millions of Americans. After a year on the job, and hours \nand hours of paperwork, today American moms and dads must file their \nincome tax return, and send a check to Uncle Sam.\n  The IRS's favorite day of the year is everyone else's least favorite. \nWorking families in America are getting squeezed between ever-rising \nexpenses for necessities and higher taxes.\n  Last year the Republican Congress tried to do something unusual for \ntaxpayers--we tried to let them keep their own money.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  We cut taxes for families with children by providing a $500 tax \ncredit for each child, to help parents raise children and to offset the \nerosion of the personal exemption from inflation. With this tax cut, \n3.5 million families wouldn't have to pay taxes any more. In Texas, it \nwould save 285,000 families over $167 million.\n  Some big-city liberals don't think $500 is real money--they say \n``it's only pennies a day.'' But with the children's tax credit, a \nparent with two children would be much better off today. Instead of \nwriting a $500 check to the IRS, she could be getting a $500 check \nback--that's real money for families with kids.\n  We also encouraged families to save for retirement--with my homemaker \nIRA proposal, and with expanded individual retirement accounts.\n  The homemaker IRA would allow women who work at home to get the same \nopportunity to save for retirement that all other workers do. The \ncurrent tax code prevents married couples that rely on one income from \nequitably providing for their retirement security by limiting the \nhomemaker's deductible IRA contribution to $250.\n  To end this unequal treatment of women and men that work inside the \nhome, and to promote retirement savings, we would have permitted \ndeductible IRA contributions of up to $2,000 by spouses that work \ninside the home.\n  What would this mean for homemakers? Under current law, a single-\nincome married couple saving $2,250 each year for 30 years would have \n$188,000 for retirement. With the bill's $4,000 annual contribution \nlimit, after 30 years they would have $335,000--an increase in savings \nof almost $150,000.\n  We also helped families by permitting tax-deferred savings in IRA's \nfor education costs, medical expenses, and first-time home purchases, \nand allowing penalty free withdrawals during times of unemployment.\n  We stopped penalizing young couples for getting married. We increased \nthe standard deduction for married couples filing jointly. By 2005, the \nmarriage penalty would have been eliminated for couples that don't \nitemize their deductions.\n  We cut capital gains taxes to encourage and reward investment, and to \ncreate new businesses and new jobs.\n  And we cut estate taxes, so that years of hard work and success won't \nbe wiped out in a generation.\n  Our tax cuts reduce the tax burden on the people who actually pay \ntaxes. More than three-quarters of the cuts in the first year go to the \nmiddle class, those making $75,000 a year or less. Who are those \npeople?\n  They are mothers and fathers, who will get help raising their \nchildren with a $500 tax credit.\n  They are homemakers who will have the opportunity to contribute the \nmaximum amount to an IRA for retirement security for the first time.\n  They are married couples, who will have the Tax Code's marriage \npenalty reduced.\n  They are savers, who are trying to buy a first home, pay for college \nfor their kids, or retirement for themselves.\n  They are small business owners who have spent their lives building a \nbusiness, and want to pass it on to their children.\n  They are investors who have provided the capital to start new \nbusinesses and create jobs.\n  Our tax cut helped all Americans--it would put more money in people's \npockets, and would increase jobs. Together with a balanced budget, it \nwould lower interest rates and increase the standard of living for \nmillions of Americans.\n  So why do I keep saying here is what our proposals would have done? \nBecause President Clinton vetoed it. He vetoed tax relief for all of us \npaying taxes today to the IRS. Instead of getting a refund, many are \nwriting a check to the Treasury.\n  After running for President in 1992 on a middle class tax cut, in \n1993 President Clinton raised taxes on middle class Americans while \nclaiming he was only hitting the rich. He overlooked his tax increase \non seniors, which raised taxes on Social Security benefits from 50 to \n85 percent for seniors earning more than $34,000--for marrieds, it's \n$44,000, and his gas tax on everyone. His taxes took what could have \nbeen a robust period of economic growth and made it a weak, lackluster \nrecovery.\n  I cannot remember any time in America when our economy was growing, \nbut people have had more reason to worry about their jobs. Big \ngovernment is one of the big reasons. Big government regulation costs \njobs, too. A report from the Rochester Institute of Technology \nestimates the direct cost of complying with Federal regulations to be \nabout $668 billion in 1995. That's about $6,000 for every American \nfamily in higher prices, diminished wages, and increased taxes.\n\n  Another way to look at it: The cost of regulation is about the same \nas the entire amount of individual income taxes! So when you're writing \nyour check today, double the check you write to get the real cost of \nbig government.\n  Last year, when the Republican Congress was preparing our tax cut \nbill, President Clinton admitted that he and the Democratic Congress \nhad made a mistake in 1993 by raising taxes. Nice talk--but then he \nvetoed the bill that would have cut taxes for Americans today.\n  If he hadn't vetoed the bill, instead of turning your money over to \nUncle Sam today, you would be keeping your money in your own pocket. \nWith the tax cuts and balanced budget, we would get 1.2 million new \njobs, $75 billion in new investment, and lower interest rates, lower \nmortgage rates, and higher disposal income. Everyone in America would \nhave been better off.\n  I don't think most Americans object to taxes in principle; we all \nknow some taxes must be paid to provide for a national defense, for \nhealth regulations, for police and schools, and for other services. But \nits how much we pay and what we get in return that bothers us.\n  President Clinton's new budget will spend $1.572 trillion--with a \n$146 billion deficit. The problem with the deficit isn't that we aren't \npaying taxes--its that we're spending too much. The problem has always \nbeen spending. If Congress in the 1980's had just limited the growth of \ndomestic spending to the rate of inflation--if Congress had just \nrestrained spending the way that every American household does--we \nwould have ended the last decade with a budget surplus.\n  What happened? Where is that surplus? It is buried in the huge \nbuildings all over Washington. Instead of limiting spending increases \nto the rate of inflation, Congress went on an unprecedented spending \nbinge. And when the decade of the 1980's ended, there was no surplus, \nthere was not even a balanced budget--there was more debt to pay \ninterest on.\n  This administration refuses to abandon the irresponsible policies of \npast Congresses. This administration has dealt itself out of the fight \nto save American's future.\n  The majority in Congress will not change our principles for a few \ninside-the-beltway bureaucrats and editorial writers who don't want the \nera of big government to end. We will not offer a Band-Aid to past the \nnext election. We promised to offer real, long-term solutions for the \nnext generation and we did.\n  The people know they don't get the money's worth from Washington; we \nwaste money foolishly all the time--on small things like the Tea \nTasting Board, and on big ones like the Davis-Bacon law, which adds \nmillions of dollars to every government construction project, while \nleaving entry-level workers unemployed.\n  We must go through the budget, line by line, agency by agency, and \nask, ``Is this worth it? Do we need it? Should the Federal Government \ndo it? ``Last year we cut outdated or duplicate programs, like the \nInterstate Commerce Commission, the Office of Technology Assessment, \nand the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and cut our own \nbudget, too.\n  Finally, we will make fundamental changes to prevent us from the old \ntax and spend ways. Today, in the other body, they will consider for \nthe first time an amendment to the Constitution that will change the \nbalance of power between taxes and spending. Right now, when Congress \ncuts spending, it only lasts for a year. We have annual appropriations, \nso its easy to replace old spending with new spending. But when we \nincrease taxes, they are permanent changes to the Tax Code. Taxes are \npaid year after year, until we repeal them.\n  Not only that, it takes only half the body plus one vote to increase \ntaxes. In\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n1993, President Clinton's tax increases were passed by one vote in the \nHouse, and a tie was broken in the Senate by Vice President Gore. \nDespite the fact that half the Senate opposed the taxes, they were \nimposed on the public.\n  I believe that this was wrong. We shouldn't be able to make such a \nfundamental change in how Americans are governed by their \nrepresentatives in Congress without the support in Congress that a \nsuper majority vote for a tax increase requires. It should be hard to \nincrease taxes. It should be harder to increase taxes--to take the \npeople's money from them--than it is to cut taxes.\n  Mr. President, what the public is asking for is leadership.\n  It is not leadership to increase taxes on the elderly and everyone \nwho drives a car, and claim you only hit the rich--which the Democrats \ndid in 1993 without one Republican vote.\n  It is not leadership to veto tax cuts for American families, and then \npropose tax cuts again in the next election year.\n  It is not leadership to propose a budget with a $200 billion deficit, \nand then veto a balanced budget.\n  And it is not leadership to propose a budget in the following year \nthat balances only with huge spending cuts after the year 2000, when \nthe President is sure to have moved back to Arkansas.\n  It is leadership to confront our fiscal problems head on, to show the \npeople what we must do to preserve Medicare, to help families, to \ncreate jobs, to reform welfare, and to balance the budget. That is what \nthe Republican Congress did.\n  America has led the world through the most tumultuous century of all \ntime--from the age of horse power to the age of atomic power. Now that \nthe threat to our liberty from communism is gone, and freedom is \nspreading throughout the world, it's time to return the government's \npower to the people. We can start by giving them their money \nback.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IMMIGRATION--JUST THE FACTS\n\n Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, as American taxpayers are well \naware, today is Tax Day, and it is a most appropriate time to express \nmy strong support of Senate Joint Resolution 49, the tax limitation \namendment. This resolution proposes to amend the Constitution to \nrequire a two-thirds super-majority vote to increase tax rates or to \nimpose new taxes.\n  It offers the American taxpayers a source of protection from a \nFederal Government that often sees their checkbooks as an unlimited \nline of credit. For too long, the Federal Government has lacked the \nrestraint that the Founding Fathers surely envisioned, and it has \nconsistently grabbed an increasing share of the taxpayers' money.\n  The American people have sent some $14 trillion to Washington since \n1980. This is an enormous amount of money.\n  I think that it is sufficient to run the Federal Government. I \nbelieve that most taxpayers think that it is sufficient to run the \nFederal Government.\n  However, it is apparently not enough for the big spenders in \nWashington. There are bills on the calendar to boost taxes ever higher. \nThere are those still eager to grab yet more money from the taxpayers.\n  This amendment will stop the big spenders.\n  It is far too easy to raise taxes. The largest tax increase in \nAmerican history--the Clinton tax bill of 1993--is a case in point. The \nDemocrats controlled both the White House and the Congress, and, yet \nthe Clinton budget passed the other Chamber by a mere six votes. In \nthis Chamber, the Vice President was forced to bring out the motorcade, \nand he rode to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaker vote. The President, \njust months after his election, could not even muster a majority of the \nelected Senators.\n  The tax limitation amendment, however, would have stopped that tax \nbill, and, if it is adopted, it will prevent other ill-considered \ncongressional raids on constituents' checkbooks.\n  Its opponents decry the supermajority requirement as ``anti-\ndemocratic.'' However, the Constitution includes 11 supermajority \nprovisions, and these hurdles were engineered to further safeguard \nimportant processes. Indeed, the procedures used to govern this Chamber \ninclude super-majority requirements, and I see little restraint in \ntheir use on the other side of the aisle. These supermajority \nrequirements compel the development of a broad consensus for action. \nThese procedures often serve this Chamber well. However, I find it \nimpossible to believe that the taxpayers do not deserve similar \nprotection.\n  It is no surprise that the tax limitation amendment is seen as a \nrevolutionary measure in Washington. However, it is a time-tested \nprocedure in 12 States, and one-third of all Americans live in States \nwith supermajority tax requirements.\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\n  Maybe this amendment scares people in Washington because it is so \neffective. Just look at the numbers. Between 1980 and 1993, the \ntaxpayers in States without supermajority tax limitations faced a 2 \npercent rise in taxes as a share of personal income. However, taxpayers \nin States with super-majority tax limitations enjoyed a 7 percent drop \nin taxes as a share of personal income.\n  President Clinton bragged in the 1992 campaign that he held the line \non taxes in Arkansas as governor. Well, he tried to raise taxes, but \nArkansas adopted a three-fourths supermajority requirement to raise \nmost taxes in 1934, long before President Clinton was born.\n  The tax limitation amendment will impose some real and necessary \nrestraint on the Congress. For too long, Washington lawmakers, \nunwilling to pare the scope of the Federal Government, simply embarked \non pirate-style raids on their constituents' checkbooks. Consequently, \nthe Federal tax burden on the average family has grown from 3 percent \nin 1948 to some 25 percent today.\n  Chief Justice Marshall long ago wrote that the power to tax involves \nthe power to destroy. The power to tax is indeed an awesome power. The \nhistory of the United States includes chapters of revolution and \nrebellion rooted in issues of taxation.\n  The tax limitation amendment is a moderate response to the escalating \nbite of the Federal Government. It merely requires a little additional \ndeliberation in the exercise of the power of taxation. In a democracy, \nI believe that we owe the people at least that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3326-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEATH OF ROBERT MARLOWE\n\n Mr. COVERDELL.

A native of Barrow County, GA, Bob graduated from the \nUniversity of Georgia before teaching in his local school system for a \nnumber of years. After leaving teaching, Bob returned to production \nagriculture, working for the Cotton Producers Association as a poultry \nadviser and managing co-op stores. Bob worked for the Georgia Farm \nBureau in Macon for 23 years and was an active member of his church and \ncommunity organizations such as the Lions Club. He was also active in \nagriculture advocacy through his appointment on the Government's \nAdvisory Council for Tri-State Water Issues and through his work with \nthe State's various commodity commissions. I can attest that he was \nvery helpful in my office's efforts in the formulation of the 1996 farm \nbill.\n  I know that Bob will be missed greatly by his family and colleagues \nat Georgia Farm Bureau.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to make an opening \nstatement with regard to the bill, S. 1664, on illegal immigration.\n  Let me begin by stating my support for this legislation. It is the \nproduct of much work in our Judiciary Committee and before that in the \nImmigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. And, in my \njudgment, although there are parts of the bill that I still hope to see \nus modify during the deliberations this week, it is an extraordinary \npiece of legislation which moves in the right direction, and it is in \nno small measure thanks to the Senator from Wyoming that we have this \nfine piece of legislation before us. His work both in the context of \nthis legislation and over the past 17 years on immigration-related \nmatters has been exceptional. It is a reflection of a Senator who is \ndeeply committed to accomplishing a job that is difficult, and I \ncommend him for it.\n  Mr. President, those who refuse to play by the rules who come here \nillegally become, as a result, a burden on our society, and it should \nnot be tolerated. The illegal immigration is a betrayal of our long \ntradition of welcoming those who play by the rules. If the Federal \nGovernment did its job of keeping out, tracking down, and expelling \nillegal aliens, we would not have an immigration problem that confronts \nAmerica today.\n  By definition, illegal immigrants are lawbreakers, and based on \nstatistics, illegal immigrants are coming here at a very high rate. It \nis estimated at about 300,000 per year. Our bill to address illegal \nimmigration, S. 1664, deals effectively and aggressively with the real \nproblem of illegal immigration--reforms to our border patrols, our visa \npolicies, criminal alien policies and rules concerning immigrant use of \nwelfare.\n  First, with respect to border patrols, this bill begins in the \nobvious place, by fighting the problem of illegal immigration at the \nborder. Our illegal immigration reform bill provides for the addition \nof 4,700 Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years, a 90 percent \nincrease over the current level. It adds 300 new INS investigators for \nthe next 3 years to investigate the smuggling and employment of illegal \naliens, an increase of nearly 100 percent over current levels. These \nincreases will help us address the fundamental, the basic problem of \nillegal immigration by providing the manpower necessary to address the \nproblem of those who come to this country without proper documentation. \nThat is only a start of how this bill attempts to reform the \nimmigration laws as they pertain to illegal immigrants.\n  Another category of illegal aliens is those who overstay their visas, \naliens who come here legally but then overstay. This bill addresses \nthat problem and forcefully.\n  First, it establishes the first substantial penalties for visa \noverstays.\n  Second, it bars visa overstayers for even applying for a new visa for \n5 years if they fail to appear for a deportation hearing. It also \ncharges 300 INS investigators to seek out these aliens and to enforce \nthe bill's rules.\n  It is important to keep in mind that contrary to some charges made \nover recent weeks, visa overstayers commonly are not individuals who \ncome here on permanent family visas. Rather, the bulk of visa \noverstayers come to this country as tourists or students, then stay \nbeyond the expiration of their visas.\n  Thus, it is wise and fitting that we should address those who break \nthe law, those who overstay the visa, with sharp, stiff penalties \nrather than attempting to address this problem by changing in some ways \nthe penalties for those who are playing by the rules either by reducing \nthe number of immigrants who may come to this country or dealing with \nthose who are in fact not creating the problem.\n  A third area which this bill addresses and which I have been very \nactive in working on pertains to criminal aliens. By conservative \nestimates, almost half a million felons are living in this country \nillegally. These aliens have been convicted of murder, rape, drug \ntrafficking, potentially such crimes as espionage, sabotage, treason \nand/or a number of other serious crimes and are therefore, under the \ncurrent laws of our country, deportable.\n  Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, our officials cannot \ndeport these criminals because of a breakdown in the deportation \nprocess. Principally, the problem relates to the interminable amount of \nappeals which deportable aliens who are criminals have at their \ndisposal. As a consequence, many of these noncitizen lawbreakers end up \nback on our streets to prey on law-abiding American citizens.\n  In the original bill of the Senator from Wyoming, a number of needed \nprovisions were contained. That bill originally directed the Attorney \nGeneral to provide regulations permitting special inquiry officers to \nenter final orders of deportation stipulated to by the alien. It \nauthorized Federal judges to order deportation as a condition of \nprobation. And it made other similar efforts to address the criminal \nalien problem.\n  I am glad, however, that the Judiciary Committee saw fit to go even \nfurther and to add to and strengthen these provisions by adopting four \namendments on which I worked with a number of other Senators on the \ncommittee to see adopted. These amendments would create expedited \nprocedures for deporting criminal aliens. The provisions would first \nprohibit the Attorney General from releasing such criminal aliens from \ncustody; second, end judicial review for orders of deportation entered \nagainst these criminal aliens while maintaining the right to \nadministrative review.\n\n  In short, once the criminal alien had exhausted all appeals available \nunder the criminal laws, the criminal alien\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nwould still have the full deportation administrative provisions to \nprotect him, that is, a deportation hearing and the ability to appeal \nany order of deportation to the Board of Immigration Appeals, but that \nwould end the process as opposed to triggering a return to the court \nsystem. That will be positive because it will mean the actual \ndeportation of more criminal aliens and the freeing up of the court \nsystem from many of these frivolous lawsuits.\n  In addition, the criminal alien deportation procedures require the \nAttorney General to deport criminal aliens within 30 days of the \nconclusion of the alien's prison sentence.\n  What I believe this will lead to is the initiation of the deportation \nproceedings well in advance of the end of the sentence so that upon \nrelease the criminal aliens will be leaving the country.\n  Finally, our legislation permits State criminal courts to enter \nconclusive findings of fact during sentencing that an alien has been \nconvicted of a deportable offense. In addition, the State courts, upon \nmaking those findings of fact, will be required to report them to the \nAttorney General so that criminal aliens who are convicted of \ndeportable offenses in State courts would be known by the authorities, \nthat is, the Department of Justice and the Attorney General, in such a \nfashion as to allow for the deportation proceedings to begin.\n  These reforms would not affect any of the aliens' due process \nprotections on the underlying criminal offense. Aliens would still be \nentitled to the lengthy appellate and habeas corpus review, just like \nU.S. citizens. But abuses of the appeals process would stop there and \nnot continue on through the deportation provisions themselves.\n  Mr. President, this makes sense. The fact is, if there are, as is \ncurrently estimated, a minimum of one-half million noncitizens who are \npeople who have committed serious crimes in this country, to me it \nmakes sense that the laws which allow those people to be deported ought \nto be enforced so those slots can be taken by law-abiding citizens who \nwant to come to this country and make a positive contribution rather \nthan come to the country and commit serious criminal violations. These \nprovisions collectively will allow us to dramatically increase the \nnumber of criminal aliens who are deported. Most recent estimates \nsuggest that current amount is nowhere higher than 4 to 6 percent of \nthe criminal aliens who are deportable in this country. That means that \nsomewhere over 90 percent of the criminal aliens who could be deported \nare not, primarily because of a lack of a process to make expeditious \ndeportation feasible.\n  Our bill would change that. It would mean that criminal aliens would \nbe leaving the country and, therefore, there would be more slots in \nthis country for immigrants who want to make a contribution.\n  Another area which this bill addresses effectively, I think, are \nrestrictions on welfare benefits available to noncitizens. The problem \nof immigrant welfare use is often overstated. According to the Urban \nInstitute, nonrefugee, working-age immigrants are no more likely to use \nwelfare than are native-born Americans. But I continue to believe we \nshould concentrate on requiring that all immigrants be responsible for \nthemselves, rather than become dependent on Government programs. To \nencourage responsibility, we first should concentrate on preventing \nillegal aliens, who undermine our laws by even being here, from \nreceiving welfare benefits. In addition, we should prevent immigrants \nfrom collecting welfare payments until they have worked here and \ncontributed taxes to our welfare system or until they become citizens.\n  Third, we should hold sponsors of legal immigrants financially liable \nfor up to 10 years for welfare payments those they sponsor improperly \nreceive. As you know, the sponsorship agreements that people sign in \norder to bring someone to this country are very, very infrequently \nupheld; very infrequently enforced. I think the legislation we have now \nwill provide us with the tools to enforce such sponsorship agreements. \nIt will attribute the sponsor's income to the immigrant sponsor for 5 \nyears should the immigrant seek welfare payments. That will, on the one \nhand, dramatically reduce those eligible and, in addition, allow us to \ncollect from the person who makes the original commitment of \nsponsorship.\n  Collectively, these provisions address, and address effectively, the \nillegal immigration problems which we currently confront. They do so \nwithout punishing law-abiding people and companies. However, there are \ncertain parts of the legislation before us which I think go too far and \nplace the focus, not on those who are breaking the rules, but rather \ntoo much on those who are playing by the rules.\n  First, in this respect, and most important, are the provisions in the \nlegislation that pertain to what I believe will ultimately become a \nnational ID system. The original bill included a national employee \nverification system. This mandatory system would have required all \nemployers to verify with the Federal Government the work eligibility of \nevery prospective employee. Because this system would be expensive and \nintrusive, riddled with mistakes and dangerous to our workers' ability \nto find work, the committee saw fit to strike that permanent system, \nwhich would have to have been in place within 8 years.\n  I brought a provision before the committee to simply strike all of \nthis verification process. It failed on a 9-to-9 vote. What we are left \nwith now is a provision for a pilot program. While it is a smaller \nprogram than that originally envisioned in the legislation, I continue \nto see problems with this provision because, although the bill does not \novertly establish a national verification system that is mandatory, it \nheads us in that direction. And there are no brakes provided in the \nbill to keep it from that destination.\n\n  In this provision, the INS would be permitted to initiate large local \nor regional demonstration projects anywhere in the Nation. The language \nof the bill is vague here, but it leaves discretion to bureaucrats to \ndecide whether the system will be mandatory or voluntary for employers. \nAlso unclear is the size of the regional project that might be \ninitiated, or regional projects that might be initiated. For example, \nsuch regions could encompass multiple States at one time.\n  It is also unclear what happens during a demonstration project when \nU.S. citizens cannot prove that they are eligible to work. It is \nlikewise unclear about whether or not individual Americans will have to \nconsult the Government when they seek to hire someone even to do such \nthings as mow their own lawn. One thing is clear. The bill sets in \nplace the infrastructure necessary for a mandatory national system and \nestablishes the principle that companies should gain Government \napproval before hiring any employee.\n  I think this is headed in the wrong direction. People who want to \nbreak the rules will find ways to break the rules or get around the \nrules. That is happening today. But, if we move in the direction of a \nnational employee verification system, whether it is the original \nmandatory nationwide program the legislation included or a pilot \nprogram which starts in place the infrastructure that leads to a \nnational program, I think we are headed in the wrong direction. We will \nbe penalizing those who play by the rules, both employers and employees \nof employers. Especially for those in small business, it will be a \nsubstantial increase in business overhead. For employees, native-born \nU.S. citizens, it could mean huge hardship if the database of such a \nsystem is in any way inaccurate.\n  Just to put that in perspective, a mere 1 percent error margin in the \ndatabase could, on an annual basis, affect 600,000 employment decisions \nin this country. To put that in perspective, that means twice the \nnumber of total illegal aliens that come into this country each year. I \ndo not believe that is the way we should proceed, and, therefore, \nduring consideration of this bill, I will be offering an amendment with \nSenators Feingold and DeWine to strike provisions for this overly \nintrusive infringement that is signified by the pilot program.\n  This amendment, striking the verification provision, is supported by \na significant number of groups concerned with the rights of workers and \nemployers from the National Federation of Independent Businesses and \nthe National Retail Association to the U.S. Catholic Conference to the \nSmall Business Survival Committee. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nspecifics, but the debate we should be having here is, How do we reduce \nillegal immigration?\n  I believe the proper place to start is by focusing on those who are \nlawbreakers, whether they are employees or employers, whether they are \nthose who come over the border without documents or those who overstay \ntheir visas or if they are a criminal alien. I think it is important \nfor us to take a very simple philosophical approach to deal with these \nproblems.\n  For those who are yearning to be free, who are willing to play by the \nrules and wait their turn, for them we should throw open the door to \nthe land of liberty, which has been available as long as this country \nhas existed. On the other hand, for those who flout our laws, they \nshould find that Lady Liberty has turned her back on them, that she \nwill not rise up to aid those who trample on the law on which liberty \nis built.\n  Though Lady Liberty yearns to aid the righteous, those willing to \nwork hard and to build a better life for themselves and their families, \nshe does not allow people to come to this country simply to take \nadvantage of the laws and of the citizens here.\n  Those who prize both law and liberty, those who would be Americans \nare those we should protect with any legislation that we should address \nin this context.\n  Mr. President, as virtually every Member of the Senate, I have a \nheritage that began in another part of the world. In my case, it was my \ngrandparents who came here approximately a century ago. They did not \ncome to this country in search of welfare payments. They did not come \nto this country for any ulterior motives. They came here because they \nwanted to live in a country that was free. They wanted their children \nand their grandchildren to know what it was like to be born in a nation \nthat was free, and they made a positive contribution, both in what they \ndid and in bringing up strong families who have made their own \ncontributions.\n  Last fall, I had the opportunity for the first time to go to Ellis \nIsland in New York where my grandparents made their first visit to \nthese shores. I was struck as I went there and as I looked through the \nhistory of Ellis Island of what it meant and what it still means. I \nbelieve as we address immigration issues, we should never lose sight of \nwhat Ellis Island and the various other points of disembarkation have \nmeant to those who truly wanted to come to this country to enjoy all \nthat America offers--the American dream.\n  Legal immigration is the American way. It strengthens us \neconomically, culturally, and spiritually, because by letting in those \nwho come here playing by the rules and seeking to build a better life \nfor their families, we welcome true Americans and live up to our own \nideals. Indeed, an overwhelming percentage of people in our country \nhave made it clear that they think we should address illegal \nimmigration problems long before we consider changes in the legal \nimmigration laws of this country, and indeed, Mr. President, as I will \nsay at a later point in these debates, it is clear to me that these are \nvery separate issues and, as a threshold matter, we have done the right \nthing in the Judiciary Committee, as the House did the right thing, in \nseparating legal and illegal immigration.\n  Cutting legal immigration precipitously could backfire and cause more \npeople to come here illegally. So for those reasons, I strongly support \nthe illegal immigration bill that is before us and believe it should be \nconsidered on its own merits as a freestanding piece of legislation. \nIndeed, that is the position that two-thirds of the members of the \nJudiciary Committee took when we began this debate a few weeks ago.\n  I am convinced that we must concentrate on the real problem facing \nour country from immigration--lawbreakers--and we should not allow any \nfear of immigrants to distract us from the task of keeping the illegal \nimmigrants out of the country.\n  Mr. President, after we conclude that and once S. 1664 has been \ndisposed of, then it would be appropriate to consider changes that we \nmight wish to make in the laws pertaining to legal immigration. But it \nis my sincere hope and certainly will be my effort here on the floor to \nmaintain the separation that we achieved in the Judiciary Committee and \nthat was achieved in the House of Representatives.\n  I think that we will make a major step forward if we pass S. 1664, \nhopefully with certain modifications. I think we would make a big \nmistake if we backtrack and begin to try and confuse and merge issues \nthat I do not believe are appropriately linked together.\n  I look forward in the days ahead to working hard on the floor, as we \ndid in the Judiciary Committee, to make sure our country moves \naggressively and forcefully to address the problems of illegal \nimmigration.\n  I strongly commend Senator Simpson and all the members of the \nsubcommittee who worked hard to bring us to this point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/15/senate-section/article/S3328-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
