Mr. President, this coming Tuesday, the American people \nwill celebrate the Fourth of July. It is a day for parties and parades, \nfireworks, and family picnics.\n  It is a day for remembering the bedrock of freedom on which this \ncountry was built, and how freedom still binds us together.\n  So it is ironic that 1 day later, July 5, we will take action right \nhere on Capitol Hill to clamp down on the very freedoms we embrace on \nIndependence Day.\n  It began on April 19, in Oklahoma City.\n  The reverberations of the bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding were felt across America, but echoed loudly in Washington, DC, \nhome to more Federal buildings--and Federal employees--than any other \ncity in the Nation.\n  And almost immediately, a siege mentality took hold.\n  Here at the Capitol, police took extraordinary steps to protect \nagainst the possibility of a terrorist attack.\n  They beefed up patrols around the building, stopped cars and checked \ntrunks, eliminated parking in some areas, increased the sensitivity on \nthe entryway metal detectors, and kept the public away from ground \nfloor windows with yards of yellow tape labeled ``Police Line--Do Not \nCross.''\n  Soon after, the U.S. Treasury Department ordered Pennsylvania Avenue \nclosed to cars and trucks in front of the White House.\n  For the first time in the 195-year history of the Executive Mansion, \nthe people were no longer allowed to drive past the people's house.\n  And now, 1 month after Pennsylvania Avenue was shut down to traffic, \npolice say more drastic measures are needed. A plan will go into effect \nhere on Wednesday, July 5, that will even further limit the people's \naccess to Capitol Hill and those of us who work here on the people's \nbehalf.\n  The Senate Sergeant-at-Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police say that \ntraffic will be restricted or eliminated altogether around the three \nSenate office buildings.\n  Some parking will be eliminated, too.\n  Streets will be closed with the concrete barriers that have become \nall-too-common in this city. It will be more tire shredders, not \n``welcome'' signs, that will greet visitors.\n  The Capitol Police say they are trying to strike a balance between \nfree access, and the security of the Congress and its visitors.\n  They say the changes I have outlined mean only ``minor traffic \ndisruptions'' and will have ``little impact on the community.''\n  Mr. President, I have great admiration and respect for the officers \nand police administrators who work every day--sometimes putting their \nown lives on the line--to make this a safe and secure place to work and \nvisit.\n  They have and deserve our thanks. But with all due respect to them, \nthere is much more at stake in this decision \n\n[[Page S9480]]\nthan simply its physical impact on the community.\n  Whenever we make such bold moves to further separate ourselves from \nthe very people who sent us here and pay our weekly salaries, it has a \ntremendous impact on the national psyche as well.\n  What it comes down to, Mr. President, is the question of freedom \nversus security. Is ours a government that can operate openly, in the \nname of freedom, and still shut itself off from the people, in the name \nof security?\n  Are we willing to swap one for the other?\n  If we are, then perhaps we should not stop with a few tire shredders \nand a couple of closed streets.\n  Why do not we just build a fence around the Capitol? That is what the \nCapitol Hill Police proposed in 1985 in an internal report, at a cost \nthen of $2.8 million.\n  Or better yet, if we really want to make a loud, public statement \nthat ``you cannot mess with the Federal Government,'' we will dig a \nmassive trench around the Capitol.\n  We will fill the moat with water and maybe a pack of alligators, and \nbuild a single, drawbridge entrance, where we will station guards armed \nwith spears.\n  And then we will dare the public to visit.\n  We will be secure in our bunker, Mr. President, but for that \nsecurity, we will be trading away freedom, and we cannot make horse \ntrades with the very principles upon which this Nation was founded.\n  Mr. President, we should also consider the impact of our actions on \nthe taxpayers.\n  The recent security precautions taken at the White House will cost \nthe taxpayers $200,000 for new traffic signals, signs, and pavement \nmarkings.\n  The new security arrangements here at the Capitol will come with a \nprice tag to the taxpayers as well, although the costs will not be \nmeasured solely by dollars.\n  Where do we stop?\n  There are 8,100 Federal buildings in the United States--do we turn \neach and every one of them into a fortress?\n  The sad truth is that we can not protect Federal workers by sealing \nthem off from the world.\n  If we tell terrorists that we are not going to let them park car \nbombs made of fertilizer and fuel oil next to our Federal buildings \nanymore, they will find another way.\n  And we may just be goading on a desperate kook who wants to prove \nthey can not be stopped by another layer of security.\n  The public does not understand what we are doing.\n  They have vital business in Federal buildings, or they come here as \ntourists, expecting to be welcomed.\n  But when they see the police, and all they yellow tape, and the signs \nthat say ``Do Not Enter,'' they wonder what kind of message we are \ntrying to get across.\n  I have heard their comments when they look down an empty stretch of \nPennsylvania Avenue that used to be open to cars. I know what they \nwhisper when they visit and walk through the metal detectors.\n  ``It is a shame,'' they are saying.\n  And they do not like it. We have gone too far.\n  Washington should be a place where visitors feel secure, but by \nturning it into a fortress, we are sacrificing freedom for security, \nand making a city of such beauty and such history something dirty.\n  We can put in more concrete barriers and try to camouflage them with \nflowers, but in the words of one newspaper columnist, it is like \nputting lipstick on a goat. It is ugly, and fear is ugly.\n  Democracy should be about building bridges, not building walls. In \nWashington, we have become too adept at building walls. And every time \na wall goes up, we knock freedom down another notch.\n  Let us seriously consider what we're doing, and what security we're \nwilling to give up in order to live in a democracy.\n  If in the end it comes down to a question of security or freedom, \nthis Senator will always choose freedom, Mr. President. And I believe \nthe American people will, too.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at 10 o'clock, I understand, the Senate \nwill take up a second rescissions bill, that bill having passed the \nHouse of Representatives last night. This is good news for the people \nof the United States, following on the even better news of the passage \nof the budget resolution yesterday, a budget resolution which will lead \nto a balanced budget in the year 2002. That path will be made markedly \neasier by the passage and hoped-for signing of a rescissions bill \ndesigned to save somewhere between $12 and $15 billion of spending \nalready authorized and appropriated. In fact, next year's \nappropriations would be extremely difficult without the passage of this \nrescissions bill.\n  Regrettably, it will allow somewhat more spending, at the insistence \nof the President, than was the case with the earlier proposal. But even \nso, it will represent a major step forward, a significant commitment on \nthe part of this Congress to a leaner, tougher, more efficient and more \neffective Federal Government with a reduction in spending which, in \nsome cases, would simply be wasteful--in other cases, which might have \nbeen significant, but not of a high enough priority to borrow in order \nto do it and then to send the bill to our children and to our \ngrandchildren.\n  One of the last matters, perhaps the last matter settled in \nconnection with this rescissions bill, was a proposal of mine and the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] with respect to \nsalvage timber and to certain other rules related to timber harvesting \nin the Pacific Northwest--the salvage provisions applying all across \nthe United States.\n  Negotiations with the administration on this subject were intensive \nand were lengthy. The net result, from the perspective of this Senator, \nis that the changes in the earlier bill are only slightly more than \nsuperficial. Both the provisions in the earlier bill and those in this \nbill, I wish to emphasize, were aimed solely at permitting the \nPresident and the administration to do what they claim they want to do \nanyway, to keep their own commitments. Neither in the field of salvage \ntimber nor in connection with so-called option 9 in the Pacific \nNorthwest, do I believe this administration proposes a balance between \nits environmental concerns and the very real, human needs of the people \nwho live in timber communities and supply a vitally important commodity \nfor the people of the United States.\n  I wish to emphasize this. I do not believe the administration's plans \nare appropriately balanced or that they give due weight to human \nconcerns. But they are something. They are more than people in timber \ncountry across the United States have today. This amendment is simply \ndesigned to remove the frivolous and endless litigation which seeks to \nobstruct even the \n\n[[Page S9481]]\nmodest relief which the administration proposes.\n  So the President is not required to do anything that he does not want \nto do. He is enabled to do what he does wish to do, or says that he \nwishes to do. He is enabled to keep his own commitments, and the people \nof the United States, and especially those in timber country, can then \ndetermine whether or not those commitments are indeed adequate; are, \nindeed, balanced.\n  I trust that later on this year we will be dealing with legislation \nthat will create that balance. But in the meantime, this significant \nthough modest relief will be available. For that I am most grateful.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SANDER\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a long time \nfriend, Nils M. Sander, of Kingston, NH.\n  Nils was a deeply religious man, a devoted husband and father and a \ntrue American patriot. Although he would not immediately be recognized \nby millions of Americans, he embodied the essence of the American \npeople and their spirit.\n  Nils Sander died on March 17, 1995, but it is his life that I want to \nshare with my colleagues today.\n  Nils was born in 1917 in Stockholm, Sweden, the second son of John \nand Maria Sander. It was soon after Nils' birth that the Sander family \nbegan immigrating to America. Initially it was several aunts and uncles \nand then as word spread among the family that in America the jobs were \nplentiful and opportunity was boundless, Nils' parents, John and Maria, \nbrought their whole family.\n  Nils, his brother, Arnie, a pregnant mother and a hopeful father \ndisembarked from the boat at Ellis Island. Nils' sister, Nana, was \nlater born in America and it was her birth as a U.S. citizen that \nenabled her to sponsor the rest of the family into citizenship. Nils' \nfather, John, the industrious and hard-working Swede, found work as a \nmachinist and was soon able to buy his family a home.\n  Nils grew up in a generation that knew the value of a strong work \nethic. He saw the Depression. He saw it devastate the lives of his \nneighbors, family and friends. Nils' brother left home so there would \nbe one less mouth to feed. His mother pawned her wedding ring to feed \nher family. Nils learned the value of saving and he learned the \nmachinist trade from his father. He learned to love America.\n  In 1942, Nils married his high school sweetheart, Ruth Seaburg. While \nhis wife was expecting their first child, World War II was raging. Nils \njoined the Navy because he knew that freedom was not free. Nils put his \nlife on the line to preserve that freedom not only for his generation \nbut for his children and grandchildren for generations to come.\n  He served as a machinist mate on board the U.S.S. Doyle C. Barnes in \nthe Philippines and New Guinea. It was in 1944 that Nils returned from \nthe war. He came home to a son who was ready a year old. Nils found \nwork at the Watertown Arsenal and then later at MIT as a tool and die \nmaker.\n  In 1947, Nils moved his family to Kingston, NH, and a second son was \nborn. He rode his bike 2 miles to the train station in the next town in \norder to make his way to and from Haverhill, MA, where he taught at a \ntrade school. The family was soon able to buy a car and life became \neasier.\n  The agreement at Yalta removed forever any lingering Socialist ideas \nthat had been brought from Sweden with his parents. No man or nation \nhad the right to determine the sovereignty of another nation. \nIndividual freedom with responsibility began to root itself deep into \nNils' beliefs. Those beliefs formed the basis for his conservative \nphilosophy.\n  Nils' family remembers very clearly the lengthy conversations around \nthe dinner table had about communism, his compassion for people \nimprisoned within the Communist state, and his determination that \nfreedom must prevail against those tyrannies.\n  For Nils, there was never a problem with defining right or wrong. His \nfaith in God and knowledge of biblical lessons were all he needed to \ndirect his life and to teach his family, his students, and all who came \nto know him.\n  Nils was a founder of the Kingston Community House, a volunteer \norganization formed to help those in need in the community. They \nprovided food and clothes to those who were without. They provided \nChristmas gifts for needy children, and they ran a weekly meal program. \nThe success of the Kingston Community House brought Nancy Reagan to \nKingston because of her interest in voluntarism.\n  Nils became active in the New Hampshire Republican Party and \ncampaigned tirelessly for those conservative candidates who shared his \nideals. Those he worked for included Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, \nRonald Reagan, Gordon Humphrey, Mel Thomson, and Bob Smith. Nils was \nnot only our supporter--he was our friend.\n  Nils was there for me in the beginning when it was tough going. He \ndid not have to help me but he did, and he never asked for anything in \nreturn. Not one thing did he ever ask in return.\n  Nils helped to craft the conservative platform which now guides the \nparty. He was one of the quiet people who never asked for anything but \ngood government--and the less the better. He believed with all his \nheart that government should do only what people cannot do for \nthemselves.\n  Nils never ran for public office. So you would not know him. Instead \nhe preferred to serve from the sidelines. He was always there when a \nvoid needed to be filled which could further his conservative beliefs \nin the preciousness of freedom, the sanctity of human life, and the \nimportance of family.\n  Nils and his wife, Ruth and his daughter, Asta, and the rest of the \nfamily, were quiet but active Americans who deserve a great deal of \ncredit for the revolution which took place in last November's election. \nThey never sat back and let the liberal agenda destroy the fragile \nfreedom we enjoy. They went to work every day. They taught their \nfamilies right from wrong and they taught them to love God and to love \nAmerica and to take their responsibilities seriously, to save for the \nfuture, and not to be a burden to society.\n  As I indicated, Nils passed away a short time ago. He suffered from \nAlzheimers, a cruel disease that has also stricken one of his beloved \npolitical leaders, Ronald Reagan. Because he was in the final stages of \nAlzheimers, Nils was unable to witness the November elections and enjoy \nthe fruits of his labors.\n  Nils--I know that you are watching now and smiling as you see your \nold friend in the majority in the U.S. Senate.\n  I am a U.S. Senator today because of Nils Sander. Nils believed in me \nat a time when it was tough. And I believed in him. I will miss my \nfriend, and I intend to honor his memory by continuing to fight for the \nconservative principles he espoused.\n  Yes, Nils Sander, one man can make a difference * * * and you did.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RISK-BASED PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) encourage Federal agencies engaged in regulating risks \n     to human health, safety, and the environment to achieve the \n     greatest risk reduction at the least cost practical;\n       (2) promote the coordination of policies and programs to \n     reduce risks to human health, safety, and the environment; \n     and\n       (3) promote open communication among Federal agencies, the \n     public, the President, and Congress regarding environmental, \n     health, and safety risks, and the prevention and management \n     of those risks.\n       (b) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Comparative risk analysis.--The term ``comparative risk \n     analysis'' means a process to systematically estimate, \n     compare, and rank the size and severity of risks to provide a \n     common basis for evaluating strategies for reducing or \n     preventing those risks.\n       (2) Covered agency.--The term ``covered agency'' means each \n     of the following:\n       (A) The Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (B) The Department of Labor.\n       (C) The Department of Transportation.\n       (D) The Food and Drug Administration.\n       (E) The Department of Energy.\n       (F) The Department of the Interior.\n       (G) The Department of Agriculture.\n       (H) The Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n       (I) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n       (J) The United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n       (K) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n       (3) Effect.--The term ``effect'' means a deleterious change \n     in the condition of--\n       (A) a human or other living thing (including death, cancer, \n     or other chronic illness, decreased reproductive capacity, or \n     disfigurement); or\n       (B) an inanimate thing important to human welfare \n     (including destruction, degeneration, the loss of intended \n     function, and increased costs for maintenance).\n       (4) Irreversibility.--The term ``irreversibility'' means \n     the extent to which a return to conditions before the \n     occurrence of an effect are either very slow or will never \n     occur.\n       (5) Likelihood.--The term ``likelihood'' means the \n     estimated probability that an effect will occur.\n       (6) Magnitude.--The term ``magnitude'' means the number of \n     individuals or the quantity of ecological resources or other \n     resources that contribute to human welfare that are affected \n     by exposure to a stressor.\n       (7) Seriousness.--The term ``seriousness'' means the \n     intensity of effect, the likelihood, the irreversibility, and \n     the magnitude.\n       (c) Department and Agency Program Goals.--\n       (1) Setting priorities.--In exercising authority under \n     applicable laws protecting human health, safety, or the \n     environment, \n\n[[Page S9489]]\n     the head of each covered agency should set priorities and use the \n     resources available under those laws to address those risks \n     to human health, safety, and the environment that--\n       (A) the covered agency determines to be the most serious; \n     and\n       (B) can be addressed in a cost-effective manner, with the \n     goal of achieving the greatest overall net reduction in risks \n     with the public and private sector resources expended.\n       (2) Determining the most serious risks.--In identifying the \n     greatest risks under paragraph (1) of this subsection, each \n     covered agency shall consider, at a minimum--\n       (A) the likelihood, irreversibility, and severity of the \n     effect; and\n       (B) the number and classes of individuals potentially \n     affected, and shall explicitly take into account the results \n     of the comparative risk analysis conducted under subsection \n     (d) of this section.\n       (3) OMB review.--The covered agency's determinations of the \n     most serious risks for purposes of setting priorities shall \n     be reviewed and approved by the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget before submission of the covered \n     agency's annual budget requests to Congress.\n       (4) Incorporating risk-based priorities into budget and \n     planning.--The head of each covered agency shall incorporate \n     the priorities identified under paragraph (1) into the agency \n     budget, strategic planning, regulatory agenda, enforcement, \n     and research activities. When submitting its budget request \n     to Congress and when announcing its regulatory agenda in the \n     Federal Register, each covered agency shall identify the \n     risks that the covered agency head has determined are the \n     most serious and can be addressed in a cost-effective manner \n     under paragraph (1), the basis for that determination, and \n     explicitly identify how the covered agency's requested budget \n     and regulatory agenda reflect those priorities.\n       (5) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect 12 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Comparative Risk Analysis.--\n       (1) Requirement.--(A)(i) No later than 6 months after the \n     effective date of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall enter into appropriate \n     arrangements with an accredited scientific body--\n       (I) to conduct a study of the methodologies for using \n     comparative risk to rank dissimilar human health, safety, and \n     environmental risks; and\n       (II) to conduct a comparative risk analysis.\n       (ii) The comparative risk analysis shall compare and rank, \n     to the extent feasible, human health, safety, and \n     environmental risks potentially regulated across the spectrum \n     of programs administered by all covered agencies.\n       (B) The Director shall consult with the Office of Science \n     and Technology Policy regarding the scope of the study and \n     the conduct of the comparative risk analysis.\n       (2) Criteria.--In arranging for the comparative risk \n     analysis referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the \n     Director shall ensure that--\n       (A) the scope and specificity of the analysis are \n     sufficient to provide the President and agency heads guidance \n     in allocating resources across agencies and among programs in \n     agencies to achieve the greatest degree of risk prevention \n     and reduction for the public and private resources expended;\n       (B) the analysis is conducted through an open process, by \n     individuals with relevant expertise, including toxicologists, \n     biologists, engineers and experts in medicine, industrial \n     hygiene and environmental effects;\n       (C) the analysis is conducted, to the extent feasible, \n     consistent with the risk assessment and risk characterization \n     principles in sections 635 and 636 of this title;\n       (D) the methodologies and principal scientific \n     determinations made in the analysis are subjected to \n     independent and external peer review consistent with section \n     635, and the conclusions of the peer review are made publicly \n     available as part of the final report required under \n     subsection (e);\n       (E) there is an opportunity for public comment on the \n     results before making them final; and\n       (F) the results are presented in a manner that \n     distinguishes between the scientific conclusions and any \n     policy or value judgments embodied in the comparisons.\n       (3) Completion and review.--No later than 3 years after the \n     effective date of this Act, the comparative risk analysis \n     required under paragraph (1) shall be completed. The \n     comparative risk analysis shall be reviewed and revised at \n     least every 5 years thereafter for a minimum of 15 years \n     following the release of the first analysis. The Director \n     shall arrange for such review and revision with an accredited \n     scientific body in the same manner as provided under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (4) Study.--The study of methodologies provided under \n     paragraph (1) shall be conducted as part of the first \n     comparative risk analysis and shall be completed no later \n     than 180 days after the completion of that analysis. The goal \n     of the study shall be to develop and rigorously test methods \n     of comparative risk analysis. The study shall have sufficient \n     scope and breadth to test approaches for improving \n     comparative risk analysis and its use in setting priorities \n     for human health, safety, and environmental risk prevention \n     and reduction.\n       (5) Technical guidance.--No later than 180 days after the \n     effective date of this Act, the Director, in collaboration \n     with other heads of covered agencies shall enter into a \n     contract with the National Research Council to provide \n     technical guidance to agencies on approaches to using \n     comparative risk analysis in setting human health, safety, \n     and environmental priorities to assist agencies in complying \n     with subsection (c) of this section.\n       (e) Reports and Recommendations to Congress and the \n     President.--No later than 24 months after the effective date \n     of this Act, each covered agency shall submit a report to \n     Congress and the President--\n       (1) detailing how the agency has complied with subsection \n     (c) and describing the reasons for any departure from the \n     requirement to establish priorities to achieve the greatest \n     overall net reduction in risk;\n       (2) recommending--\n       (A) modification, repeal, or enactment of laws to reform, \n     eliminate, or enhance programs or mandates relating to human \n     health, safety, or the environment; and\n       (B) modification or elimination of statutorily or \n     judicially mandated deadlines,\n\n     that would assist the covered agency to set priorities in \n     activities to address the risks to human health, safety, or \n     the environment in a manner consistent with the requirements \n     of subsection (c)(1);\n       (3) evaluating the categories of policy and value judgments \n     used in risk assessment, risk characterization, or cost-\n     benefit analysis; and\n       (4) discussing risk assessment research and training needs, \n     and the agency's strategy and schedule for meeting those \n     needs.\n       (f) Savings Provision and Judicial Review.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this section shall be construed \n     to modify any statutory standard or requirement designed to \n     protect human health, safety, or the environment.\n       (2) Judicial review.--Compliance or noncompliance by an \n     agency with the provisions of this section shall not be \n     subject to judicial review.\n       (3) Agency analysis.--Any analysis prepared under this \n     section shall not be subject to judicial consideration \n     separate or apart from the requirement, rule, program, or law \n     to which it relates. When an action for judicial review of a \n     covered agency action is instituted, any analysis for, or \n     relating to, the action shall constitute part of the whole \n     record of agency action for the purpose of judicial review of \n     the action and shall, to the extent relevant, be considered \n     by a court in determining the legality of the covered agency \n     action.\n\n     SEC. 7. REGULATORY ACCOUNTING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the \n     following definitions apply:\n       (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any executive \n     department, military department, Government corporation, \n     Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in \n     the executive branch of the Government (including the \n     Executive Office of the President), or any independent \n     regulatory agency, but shall not include--\n       (A) the General Accounting Office;\n       (B) the Federal Election Commission;\n       (C) the governments of the District of Columbia and of the \n     territories and possessions of the United States, and their \n     various subdivisions; or\n       (D) government-owned contractor-operated facilities, \n     including laboratories engaged in national defense research \n     and production activities.\n       (2) Regulation.--The term ``regulation'' means an agency \n     statement of general applicability and future effect designed \n     to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or \n     describing the procedures or practice requirements of an \n     agency. The term shall not include--\n       (A) administrative actions governed by sections 556 and 557 \n     of title 5, United States Code;\n       (B) regulations issued with respect to a military or \n     foreign affairs function of the United States; or\n       (C) regulations related to agency organization, management, \n     or personnel.\n       (b) Accounting Statement.--\n       (1) In general.--(A) The President shall be responsible for \n     implementing and administering the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (B) Every 2 years, no later than June of the second year, \n     the President shall prepare and submit to Congress an \n     accounting statement that estimates the annual costs of \n     Federal regulatory programs and corresponding benefits in \n     accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Years covered by accounting statement.--Each accounting \n     statement shall cover, at a minimum, the 5 fiscal years \n     beginning on October 1 of the year in which the report is \n     submitted and may cover any fiscal year preceding such fiscal \n     years for purpose of revising previous estimates.\n       (3) Timing and procedures.--(A) The President shall provide \n     notice and opportunity for comment for each accounting \n     statement. The President may delegate to an agency the \n     requirement to provide notice and opportunity to comment for \n     the portion of the accounting statement relating to that \n     agency.\n       (B) The President shall propose the first accounting \n     statement under this subsection no later than 2 years after \n     the effective date of this Act and shall issue the first \n     accounting statement in final form no later than 3 years \n     after such effective date. Such statement shall cover, at a \n     minimum, each of the fiscal years beginning after the \n     effective date of this Act.\n       (4) Content of accounting statement.--(A) Each accounting \n     statement shall contain \n\n[[Page S9490]]\n     estimates of costs and benefits with respect to each fiscal year \n     covered by the statement in accordance with this paragraph. \n     For each such fiscal year for which estimates were made in a \n     previous accounting statement, the statement shall revise \n     those estimates and state the reasons for the revisions.\n       (B)(i) An accounting statement shall estimate the costs of \n     Federal regulatory programs by setting forth, for each year \n     covered by the statement--\n       (I) the annual expenditure of national economic resources \n     for each regulatory program; and\n       (II) such other quantitative and qualitative measures of \n     costs as the President considers appropriate.\n       (ii) For purposes of the estimate of costs in the \n     accounting statement, national economic resources shall \n     include, and shall be listed under, at least the following \n     categories:\n       (I) Private sector costs.\n       (II) Federal sector costs.\n       (III) State and local government costs.\n       (C) An accounting statement shall estimate the benefits of \n     Federal regulatory programs by setting forth, for each year \n     covered by the statement, such quantitative and qualitative \n     measures of benefits as the President considers appropriate. \n     Any estimates of benefits concerning reduction in human \n     health, safety, or environmental risks shall present the most \n     plausible level of risk practical, along with a statement of \n     the reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n       (c) Associated Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--At the same time as the President submits \n     an accounting statement under subsection (b), the President, \n     acting through the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, shall submit to Congress a report associated with the \n     accounting statement (hereinafter referred to as an \n     ``associated report''). The associated report shall contain, \n     in accordance with this subsection--\n       (A) analyses of impacts; and\n       (B) recommendations for reform.\n       (2) Analyses of impacts.--The President shall include in \n     the associated report the following:\n       (A) The cumulative impact on the economy of Federal \n     regulatory programs covered in the accounting statement. \n     Factors to be considered in such report shall include impacts \n     on the following:\n       (i) The ability of State and local governments to provide \n     essential services, including police, fire protection, and \n     education.\n       (ii) Small business.\n       (iii) Productivity.\n       (iv) Wages.\n       (v) Economic growth.\n       (vi) Technological innovation.\n       (vii) Consumer prices for goods and services.\n       (viii) Such other factors considered appropriate by the \n     President.\n       (B) A summary of any independent analyses of impacts \n     prepared by persons commenting during the comment period on \n     the accounting statement.\n       (3) Recommendations for reform.--The President shall \n     include in the associated report the following:\n       (A) A summary of recommendations of the President for \n     reform or elimination of any Federal regulatory program or \n     program element that does not represent sound use of national \n     economic resources or otherwise is inefficient.\n       (B) A summary of any recommendations for such reform or \n     elimination of Federal regulatory programs or program \n     elements prepared by persons commenting during the comment \n     period on the accounting statement.\n       (d) Guidance From Office of Management and Budget.--The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, in \n     consultation with the Council of Economic Advisers and the \n     agencies, develop guidance for the agencies--\n       (1) to standardize measures of costs and benefits in \n     accounting statements prepared pursuant to this section and \n     section 3 of this Act, including--\n       (A) detailed guidance on estimating the costs and benefits \n     of major rules; and\n       (B) general guidance on estimating the costs and benefits \n     of all other rules that do not meet the thresholds for major \n     rules; and\n       (2) to standardize the format of the accounting statements.\n       (e) Recommendations From Congressional Budget Office.--\n     After each accounting statement and associated report \n     submitted to Congress, the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office shall make recommendations to the President--\n       (1) for improving accounting statements prepared pursuant \n     to this section, including recommendations on level of detail \n     and accuracy; and\n       (2) for improving associated reports prepared pursuant to \n     this section, including recommendations on the quality of \n     analysis.\n       (f) Judicial Review.--No requirements under this section \n     shall be subject to judicial review in any manner.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, this Act shall \n     take effect 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Regulatory Reform Alternative and Comparisons With Dole/Johnston\n\n       Our principles for regulatory reform are the following:\n       (1) Cost-benefit and risk assessment requirements should \n     apply to only major rules, which has been set at $100 million \n     for executive branch review since President Reagan's time.\n       Our bill applies to rules that have an impact on the \n     economy of $100 million or more.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft applies to rules that have an \n     impact on the economy of $50 million or more.\n       (2) Regulatory reform should not become a lawyer's dream, \n     opening up a multitude of new avenues for judicial review.\n       Our bill limits judicial review to determinations of: (1) \n     whether a rule is major; and (2) whether a final rule is \n     arbitrary or capricious, taking into consideration the whole \n     rulemaking file. Specific procedural requirements for cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment are not subject to \n     judicial review except as part of the whole rulemaking file.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft will lead to a litigation explosion \n     that will swamp the courts and bog down agencies. It would \n     allow review of steps in risk assessment and cost-benefit \n     analysis, in addition to the determination of a major rule \n     and of agency decisions to grant or deny petitions. It alters \n     APA standards in ways that undermine legal precedent and \n     invite lawsuits. And it seeks to limit agency discretion in \n     ways that will lead inevitably to challenges in court.\n       (3) Regulatory reform should not be a ``fix'' for special \n     interests.\n       Our bill focuses on the fundamentals of regulatory reform \n     and contains no special interest provisions.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft provides relief to specific \n     business interests, e.g., by restricting the Toxics Release \n     Inventory, limiting the Delaney Clause, and delaying and \n     increasing costs of Superfund cleanups.\n       (4) Regulatory reform should make Federal agencies more \n     efficient and effective, not tie up agency resources with \n     additional bureaucratic processes.\n       Our bill requires cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \n     for major rules, and requires agencies to review all their \n     major rules by a time certain.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft covers a much broader scope of \n     rules and has several convoluted petition processes for \n     ``interested parties'' (e.g., to amend or rescind a major \n     rule, and to review policies or guidance). These petitions \n     are judicially reviewable and must be granted or denied by an \n     agency within a specified time frame. The petitions will eat \n     up agency resources and allow the petitioners, not the \n     agencies, to set agency priorities.\n       (5) Regulatory reform legislation should improve analysis, \n     but not override health, safety or environmental protections.\n       Our bill requires agencies to explain whether benefits \n     justify costs and whether the rule will be more cost-\n     effective than alternatives. It does not allow cost-benefit \n     determinations to control agency decisions or to override \n     existing protections of health, safety or environmental laws.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft has three separate decisional \n     criteria that control agency decisions, regardless of the \n     underlying statutes. These overriding provisions are created \n     for major rule cost-benefit determinations, for environmental \n     cleanups, and for regulatory flexibility analyses. The reg \n     flex override actually conflicts with the cost-benefit \n     decisional criteria. And the cost-benefit test limits \n     agencies to the cheapest rule, not the most cost-effective \n     one.\n       (6) There should be ``sunshine'' in the regulatory review \n     process.\n       Our bill ensures that agencies and OMB publicly disclose \n     the status of regulatory review, related decisions and \n     documents, and communications from persons outside of the \n     government.\n       The Dole/Johnston draft has no ``sunshine'' provisions to \n     protect against regulatory review delay, unsubstantiated \n     review decisions or undisclosed special interest lobbying and \n     political deals.\n       The text of this bill is almost identical to S. 291, the \n     ``Regulatory Reform Act of 1995,'' which was reported \n     unanimously from the Senate Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs. Like S. 291, this bill:\n       (1) Covers all ``major'' rules with a cost impact of $100 \n     million.\n       (2) Requires cost-benefit analysis for all major rules.\n       (3) Requires risk assessment for all major rules related to \n     environment, health, or safety.\n       (4) Requires peer review of cost-benefit analyses and risk \n     assessments.\n       (5) Limits judicial review to the determination of \n     ``major'' rules and to the final rulemaking file.\n       (6) Requires agencies to review existing rules every ten \n     years, with a presidential extension of up to five years.\n       (7) Provides judicial review of Regulatory Flexibility Act \n     decisions, allowing one year for small entities to petition \n     for review of agency compliance with the Reg Flex Act.\n       (8) Requires public disclosure of regulatory analysis and \n     review documents to ensure ``sunshine'' in the regulatory \n     review process.\n       (9) Provides legislative ``veto'' of major rules to provide \n     an expedited procedure for Congress to review rules.\n       (10) Requires risk-based priority setting for the most \n     serious risks to health, safety, and the environment.\n       (11) Requires regulatory accounting every two years on the \n     cumulative costs and benefits of agency regulations.\n       This bill only differs from S. 291 on three points:\n       (1) It does not have an arbitrary sunset for existing rules \n     that agency fail to be reviewed. Rather, it has an action-\n     forcing \n\n[[Page S9491]]\n     mechanism that uses the rulemaking process.\n       (2) It does not include any narrative definitions for \n     ``major'' rule (e.g., ``adverse effects on wages'').\n       (3) It incorporates technical changes to risk assessment to \n     track more closely recommendations of the National Academy of \n     Sciences and to cover specific programs and agencies, not \n     just agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9481-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9491-S9492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LIFTING THE YACHTS, SWAMPING THE ROWBOATS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if you look past the headlines and the \nhype connected to the conference agreement on the budget resolution, I \nthink the American people can get a pretty good sense of who's looking \nout for whom in the Republican budget.\n  Republican budget writers talked about putting tax money back into \nthe hands of wage earners. Republican budget writers talked about their \nbig tax cuts to fuel the Nation's economic engine.\n  But the only engine this budget primes is the full-throttle expansion \nof incomes for the wealthiest Americans. The Republican budget does \nnothing to address the fact that middle-income families have been stuck \nin neutral for the past 20 years, while many low-income Americans are \nsliding into reverse.\n  Republican budget priorities will only serve to drive deeper and \nwider the wedge between Americans at either end of the earnings scale.\n  This country always had, and always will have, the rich, the poor, \nand the middle class. Like never before, however, these economic groups \nare pulling away from each other, and it's tearing at the social fabric \nof our Nation.\n  Every year, families in the top 5 percent in terms of income now \nmake, on average, the rough equivalent of what 16 low-wage families \ncombined struggle to earn in a year. In the past two decades, America's \ntop earners enjoyed an average 25-percent increase in cash income. Down \nat the bottom, the lowest wage workers actually felt a 7-percent drop \nin pay over the same period.\n  According to a survey published last Sunday in the Washington Post, \nno other industrialized nation on Earth has a greater income gap \nbetween top and bottom than the United States. And in between, the \nmiddle class grows larger in number, but their paychecks are stuck in a \nrut. Hourly wages of workers with average skills are sliding. The \nabsolute incomes of low- and middle-income Americans are actually below \nthose of people in other industrialized countries that are poorer than \nthe United States.\n  That, Mr. President, is unacceptable. This country was built on the \npromise of hope that people can, indeed, come up from nothing. That you \ncan work hard from the bottom and eventually reach the top. That you \ncan build a better future for your family through your own honest \nefforts.\n  That promise is becoming a lie to an ever-increasing number of \nAmericans. The road to prosperity now crosses a bridge that spans \nfurther than many Americans can see.\n  Mr. President, Democrats believe in prosperity. We believe in \neconomic progress. We want to help American workers earn more. We\n want more Americans to be wealthy. We would like more low-wage workers \nto join the ranks of the middle-class. We would like more middle class \nworkers to join the ranks of the rich.\n\n  But it seems to me that the Republican budget aspires to no such \nprogress.\n  It seems to me that the Republican budget will punish those Americans \nnow mired in this stagnant status quo, and provide a kind of winner's \nbonus to those traveling on the fast track.\n  While we don't know yet exactly who will get their hands on this $245 \nbillion tax cut, we do know that the House bill gave over half the tax \ncuts to the 2.8 percent of families making more than $100,000. It is \nsafe bet to assume that the wealthiest 1 percent will get at least a \n$20,000 tax cut. That little bonus alone is more than twice the annual \nincome earned by families at the bottom of the scale.\n  And what do we offer to those families who are struggling to move up? \nEducation cuts that hit 65 million children. Student loans that cost \n$3,000 more per student; $100 billion in so-called welfare reforms, and \ncuts in the earned income tax credit. And I will not even begin to talk \nabout the harm that will be felt by their plan for Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  It is painfully clear where the priorities lie in the Republican \nbudget. And its not just Democrats who have figured it out. According \nto Stanford economist Paul Krugman: ``Quite obviously these programs \nwould make unequal incomes even more unequal, particularly at the \nextremes--the very rich and the very poor.'' Frank Levy, an economist \nat MIT says:\n\n       We're going through a period in which trade and technology \n     are like an economic natural disaster for the half of the \n     working population that does not have a college degree . . . \n     the last thing you would want to do right now is to have \n     Government make a bad situation worse by extending tax breaks \n     to the rich.\n\n  Democrats and Republicans agree on producing a budget that comes into \nbalance within a decade. But Democrats refuse to forget the working \nAmericans who must struggle to live their lives, pay their mortgages, \neducate their children, and provide for their families over that same \ndecade. These are the families Democrats will neither abandon nor \nbetray in the face of this $245 billion gold rush within the just-\npassed Republican budget.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues' attention an op-\ned printed in last Sunday's Washington Post, ``America's Tide: Lifting \nthe Yachts, Swapping the Rowboats,'' by Gary Burtless and Timothy \nSmeeding. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1995]\n\n       America's Tide: Lifting the Yachts, Swamping the Rowboats\n\n                (By Gary Burtless and Timothy Smeeding)\n\n       During the early postwar era, most American families could \n     expect to see their incomes grow from one year to the next. \n     During both the 1950s and 1960s, median family income \n     adjusted for inflation rose about a third. With incomes \n     growing this fast, few people (and even fewer politicians) \n     bothered to inquire very closely into the distribution of \n     income. A rising tide lifted all boats, the rowboats as well \n     as the yachts.\n       But since the early 1970s, the nation's experience has been \n     much more discouraging. In the past 20 years, incomes have \n     not grown at all, and for families near the bottom of the \n     distribution, incomes have done even worse--they have shrunk.\n       Instead of routinely hearing news about growing incomes, \n     Americans now read dismal reports of swelling poverty rolls, \n     rising inequality and shrinking wages. It would be wrong to \n     conclude from these reports that the United States has not \n     enjoyed prosperity since 1973. On the contrary, the nation \n     added more than 40 million jobs and enjoyed three of its \n     longest postwar expansions.\n       But American prosperity is extremely uneven. Families and \n     workers at the top of the economic ladder have enjoyed rising \n     incomes. Families in the middle have seen their incomes \n     stagnate or slip. Young families and workers at the bottom \n     have suffered the equivalent of a Great Depression. Though \n     the nation is in the midst of a robust expansion, recent \n     census statistics offer no hint that the trend toward wider \n     inequality has slowed. Poverty rates continue to rise, \n     especially among children and young adults. Hourly wages of \n     workers with average or below-average skills continue to \n     slide. At the same time, the percentage of U.S. income \n     received by the top 5 percent of households continues to \n     climb, reaching new postwar highs almost every year.\n       Although the United States continues to have a large middle \n     class, the disparity between those at the top of the income \n     scale and those at the bottom has widened significantly. \n     Measured in constant 1990 dollars, a family in the bottom \n     one-fifth of the U.S. income distribution received about \n     $10,400 in gross cash income in 1973. In the same year, a \n     family in the top one-fifth received about $77,500, or \n     roughly 7\\1/2\\ times the average gross income of those at the \n     bottom.\n       By 1992, average gross income in the bottom fifth of the \n     distribution had\n      shrunk almost 7 percent, falling to just $9,700. Average \n     gross income in the top fifth of the distribution had \n     climbed to $98,800, a gain of more than 25 percent. The \n     average income of a family in the top fifth of the \n     distribution now amounts to more than 10 times that of \n     those at the bottom of the distribution.\n       Gains among the very wealthy have been even more \n     impressive. Those in the top 5 percent of the distribution \n     saw their incomes climb nearly a third in the past two \n     decades so that the average family in the top bracket takes \n     in the equivalent of what 16 families in the bottom bracket \n     earn. The rising tide is now lifting the yachts, but swamping \n     the rowboats.\n       Not only have U.S. income disparities soared since the \n     early 1970s, the gap between rich and poor has grown much \n     faster than it has elsewhere in the industrialized world. \n     When the recent inequality trend began, the United States \n     already experienced wider income disparities than other \n     countries with similar standards of living.\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\n       Income disparities can be measured in a variety of ways. \n     The accompanying table contains information about the \n     distribution of income in 13 rich industrialized countries. \n     The statistics were compiled by the Luxembourg Income Study \n     and are based on household surveys conducted in the mid-\n     1980s. They reflect personal incomes adjusted for differences \n     in family size. Each country on the list is ranked according \n     to its median after-tax income, measured in U.S. dollars \n     using purchasing-power-parity, a calculation used by \n     economists to compare one nation's real income to another's \n     in a way that adjusts for differences in the capacity to \n     consume goods and services in each country.\n       Not surprisingly, the United States ranks near the top of \n     industrialized countries in median income. With the exception \n     of a few tax havens, we are still the richest nation on \n     earth. But this method of analyzing income does not attempt \n     to define or talk about the size of the middle class; rather \n     it is a means of evaluating the disparity between rich and \n     poor. And by that measure, we are the most unequal rich \n     nation on earth.\n       Many people become uneasy when the gap between rich and \n     poor grows too wide. No social scientist or philosopher can \n     tell us when this threshold has been passed. But most of us \n     sense that when the gulf separating rich, middle class and \n     poor grows too large, the social fabric is at risk. Low-\n     income citizens, and those whose incomes used to be closer to \n     the middle but have fallen, may begin to feel a weaker bond \n     with the rest of society and see less reason to respect its \n     rules and institutions.\n       In recent years, opinion leaders have been increasingly \n     willing to lift their voices in defense of inequality and \n     even to suggest that widening income gaps play a useful \n     social function. The New York Times, in a recent front-page \n     story, described the United States as ``the most economically \n     stratified of industrial nations.'' Shortly after the story \n     appeared, it was attacked in three separate Washington Post \n     columns--by George Will, James K. Glassman and Robert J. \n     Samuelson. Each critic mentioned different shortcomings of \n     the story, but all agreed that the United States is doing a \n     lot better than its lowly rank in the inequality sweepstakes \n     might suggest.\n       Glassman argued, for example, that U.S. incomes are \n     extremely mobile.\n      Americans who are comfortably well off for one or two years \n     often find themselves in tough circumstances a few years \n     later. The starting pitcher who earned $2 million three \n     years ago can find himself throwing in the minor leagues. \n     Similarly, Americans currently stuck on the bottom can \n     climb their way up the income scale through pluck and hard \n     work. The office messenger can hope for promotion to CEO.\n       Though valid, the argument of higher social mobility does \n     not go far toward explaining the widening gap between rich \n     and poor or why the U.S. disparity is so much higher than in \n     other wealthy countries. Growing inequality might not \n     represent a social problem if the increase in inequality in a \n     single year were matched by a similar increase in income \n     mobility from one year to the next. The problem is, there has \n     been no increase in income mobility to offset the sharp rise \n     of inequality.\n       The chance of receiving a large one-year increase in income \n     has never been very high. More to the point, the chance of \n     enjoying a big increase has not grown noticeably in the past \n     few decades. Americans with annual incomes that place them in \n     the bottom quarter of the income distribution have an 80 \n     percent chance of remaining there for at least two years in a \n     row. Although studies over a longer period of time are less \n     conclusive, some research indicates that the probability of \n     moving out of the poorest class has hardly budged since the \n     1970s.\n       It might also be the case that Americans enjoy greater \n     class and income mobility than Europeans. U.S. incomes may be \n     more unequal at a given point in time, but, according to this \n     theory, Americans enjoy better opportunities for advancement \n     than residents of other countries. This is an inspiring \n     story, and one that is cherished by many Americans, \n     especially by conservatives. The problem with the theory is \n     that there is no evidence to suggest it is true.\n       Studies of income mobility suggest that the United States \n     ranks about in the middle of industrialized countries. To \n     analyze mobility, a team of economic researchers tracked the \n     same set of individuals over long periods of time in both the \n     United States and Germany. Their findings showed that the \n     level of inequality within each country actually declined, \n     but that the gap between the two countries grew, with the \n     United States showing wider disparities.\n       A more fundamental criticism of the Times story, suggested \n     by both Will and Samuelson, goes as follows: Although income \n     disparities are larger in the United States than elsewhere, \n     other societies pay too heavy a price to achieve equality. \n     Will concludes that ``. . . increasingly unequal social \n     rewards can conduce to a more truly egalitarian society, one \n     that offers upward mobility to all who accept its rewarding \n     disciplines.'' Samuelson argues, ``What determines the well-\n     being of most people is the increase of national income and \n     wealth, not their distribution.'' Other countries' attempts \n     to equalize incomes have led to higher joblessness and less \n     entrepreneurial activity than we see in the United States, \n     and hence to slower growth abroad. The United States accepts \n     greater inequality, but is rewarded by higher income and \n     faster growth.\n       Affluent readers may draw comfort from this reasoning. \n     Americans further down the economic scale might find the \n     logic less appealing. The size and growth of national income \n     undoubtedly helps to determine whether individual citizens \n     can enjoy a comfortable standard of living. Each citizen's \n     living standard also\n      depends, however, on the percentage of national income that \n     he or she is permitted to share. If a pie is to be divided \n     among 10 people, the person receiving the smallest slice \n     may prefer to share a small pie that is divided in roughly \n     equal slices rather than a larger pie that is divided very \n     evenly. A little arithmetic will show that it is better to \n     receive 10 percent of a small pie than 2 percent of a pie \n     that is twice as large.\n       Stacked against other industrial countries, the after-tax \n     incomes of those people at the lowest 10th percentile of \n     Americans tumbles toward the bottom (see chart). Low-income \n     Finns, for example, receive after-tax incomes that exceed \n     those of low-income Americans by 27 percent. Poor Americans \n     are poor not only by the standards of middle-class Americans, \n     but also in relation to low-income people in most other \n     industrialized countries.\n       Samuelson and Will may be right that wide income \n     disparities in the United States offer a powerful inducement \n     for Americans to work, save and invest (though it is \n     difficult to find evidence for this in U.S. saving or \n     investment rates, which tend to languish near the bottom of \n     the industrialized world). They may also be correct in \n     believing large and rising disparities contribute to U.S. \n     economic growth, though evidence for this is also weak. \n     Recent studies on the relationship between inequality and \n     growth in fact suggest that advanced countries with more \n     equal distributions grow faster than countries that are less \n     equal. Whatever the advantages of faster growth, they are \n     purely theoretical for many low-income Americans, These \n     Americans have not shared the general prosperity. Their \n     after-tax incomes have slipped even though national output \n     has increased.\n       Even more depressing is the fact that the absolute incomes \n     of low- and even middle-income Americans are below those of \n     residents in industrialized countries that are poorer than \n     the United States. A comparison of Canada and the United \n     States, based on 1991 income statistics, is particularly \n     striking. In 1991, gross domestic product per person was 13 \n     percent lower in Canada than in the United States. Because \n     the Canadian income distribution is more equal than our own, \n     however, Canadians in the bottom 55 percent of the \n     distribution enjoyed higher after-tax incomes than they would \n     have received in the United States at a comparable position \n     in our income distribution. Of course, Americans in the top \n     45 percent of the U.S. income distribution received higher \n     incomes than their Canadian counterparts. But for a majority \n     of poorer and middle-class Canadians, the higher average \n     income of the United States has little practical \n     significance. These Canadians enjoy more comfortable incomes \n     in Canada than they would be likely to receive in the United \n     States.\n       The United States enjoys a high rank in one international \n     contest, however. Americans near the top of our income \n     distribution tend to receive much larger incomes than people \n     with a similar position in other industrialized countries.\n       It is probably safe to assume that Will, Glassman and \n     Samuelson are closer to the upper tier than the bottom tier \n     of the income distribution. From their perch, U.S. economic \n     performance undoubtedly looks quite satisfying. People \n     further down the economic scale can be forgiven. however, if \n     they doubt their economic good fortune as Americans. If wide \n     income disparities have big advantages for the U.S. economy, \n     low-income Americans are right to think the advantages should \n     eventually show up in a tangible way--in larger paychecks and \n     higher incomes. Whatever the virtues of our economic system, \n     one conclusion is certain: Our fatter paychecks have not gone \n     to the poor.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9491-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9492-S9493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  A TRIBUTE TO SHERMAN J.

Many students, now numbered among the \nupstanding adult members of our communities, looked to Sherm Lindhardt \nas a role model of successful living. The father of seven children, Mr. \nLindhardt participated as a member of the Smithfield city planning and \nzoning commission, and continues to serve his local congregation as an \necclesiastical leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \n\n[[Page S9493]]\nSaints.

Mr. President, as we all know, welfare reform has been \none of the most hotly debated issues of this Congress. Two and a half \nyears ago President Clinton promised to end welfare as we know it, and \nthe public has reinforced that message by telling us unequivocally that \nthey want to see this done.\n  The ball lies in Congress' court, and we have a clear task in front \nof us. The House has set the stage by passing the Personal \nResponsibility Act almost 3 months ago. In fact, the House felt this \nissue was so pressing that they included welfare reform as one of their \n10 highest priorities in the Contract With America.\n  While many of us may disagree with the substantive course the House \nchose to take, they were clearly responding to a mandate from the \npublic to address this issue in some way.\n  It is now the Senate's turn. The Finance Committee has completed \naction on a bill that has been reported to the full Senate, and I think \nI speak for all Senators on my side of the aisle when I say that we are \nready for floor consideration of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, we had been led to believe that welfare reform might \nbe on the floor as early as the 12th of June. And then we were told by \nthe majority leader that welfare reform would be considered immediately \nupon completion of action on the telecommunications bill.\n  That bill was wrapped up last Thursday. It is now the 22d of June, \nand we are hearing rumors that welfare reform may not be considered in \nJune at all, and may not be considered this summer at all. It may be \nconsidered in July--but, then again, we're told by some in the \nRepublican leadership that we may not get to welfare until September.\n  Mr. President, the notion that the Senate may put off consideration \nof welfare reform until September is unacceptable.\n  We are ready. We are ready now.\n  President Clinton challenged us to have a bill on his desk by July 4, \nnot because of politics, but because it is important for the Nation \nthat we fix a welfare system that is not working--not working for those \non it, and not working for those who are footing the bill.\n  The public has told us that they view the welfare crisis as one of \nthe most pressing problems facing our Nation today. The public is \nclearly ready for us to address this issue. And Democrats are ready to \naddress it.\n  The question is, Are Republicans ready?\n  More to the point: Are Republicans serious about addressing this \nissue? Are they serious about reform, or just serious about rhetoric?\n  The Finance Committee reported a welfare bill on June 9. It is now \nJune 22, and I understand my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare divided on how to proceed. They are divided on a number of \nprovisions, either included in, or excluded from, that bill.\n  Mr. President, I understand division. And I, too, have concerns about \nthe Finance Committee bill. But the proper forum to address these \nconcerns is on the Senate floor.\n  Bring the bill to the floor and let those who want to offer \namendments to modify current provisions do so. Let those who want to \nadd provisions through the amendment process do so.\n  That is the legislative process.\n  What concerns me and many on my side of the aisle is that the welfare \nbill will be delayed until July as Republican Senators meet behind \nclosed doors to try and work out problems.\n  Then, in July, those doors will still be closed as secret discussions \ncontinue. Before we know it, it will be September.\n  Yes, there are problems with the Finance Committee bill. But let us \nair those problems on the floor and address them through the open \nlegislative process.\n  As for the Finance Committee bill, I too, am troubled by many aspects \nof that legislation.\n  First, the Finance Committee bill does not solve the problems with \nour welfare system. It merely boxes up that system and ships it to the \nStates. That is not reform.\n  Second, the Republicans have said that they want to put welfare \nrecipients to work. But, although the Finance Committee bill requires \nincreased numbers of people to be participating in programs intended to \nmove them toward work, it provides no resources to meet these \nparticipation requirements.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that 44 States will be \nunable to meet the participation requirements in the Finance Committee \nbill. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has said that this is the mother of \nall unfunded mandates.\n  What is clear is that Finance Committee bill is not reform. And it is \nnot about work. In fact, if it is about anything, it is about shipping \nthe welfare problem to the States and--ironically enough--passing the \nlargest unfunded mandate in history.\n  In essence, the Finance Committee bill represents the kind of typical \ntwo-step about which the public is most cynical: It says one thing and \nmeans another. It sounds, but is actually disastrous. The Finance \nCommittee bill is about rhetoric, not reform.\n  It will reap exactly the kind of results the unfunded mandates bill \nwas meant to prevent, and having it come so quickly upon the heels of \nhe unfunded mandates legislation represents hypocrisy at its worst.\n  It is ironic that most Members put their serious face on when they \nsay that they do not want to hurt children. Mr. President, I want to \nbelieve them. But again, it is the difference between rhetoric and \nreality.\n  The reality of the Finance Committee bill is that some 4 million \nchildren will be cut off from assistance. Some 4 million children could \nbe put out on the street.\n  Children should not pay for the mistakes or misfortune of their \nparents.\n  That is not fair. That is draconian. That is mean.\n  And that is plain old un-American.\n  It is one thing to require that able-bodied people go to work. That \nwas the original intent of welfare: To provide out-of-luck families \nwith a helping hand to get back on their feet. I believe most Americans \nsupport that kind of a safety net today.\n  But the Finance Committee plan cuts kids off welfare while doing \nnothing to help their parents find work. That is wrong; it is unfair; \nit is shortsighted.\n  This leads to yet another problem I see with the Finance Committee \nbill. Anyone who has kids knows that one of the real linchpins between \nwelfare and work is child care. It is impossible to work unless you \nhave some means of caring for your children--it as simple as that.\n  Nevertheless, the Finance Committee bill fails to address the child \ncare issue in any serious way. It mandates child care for welfare \nrecipients who are working only until the child is 6 years old.\n  What happens to a 7-year-old? Or an 8-year-old? Or any child that \nshould not be left alone?\n  Beyond that, the bill does not increase funds for child care, so that \nas the participation requirements increase--requiring a greater \npopulation of welfare mothers to participate in the JOBS Program--there \nis no corresponding increase in funds for child care.\n  If we are to increase the mandate for adults to work, but not provide \nfor a corresponding increase in child care funds to enable parents to \nwork, then we are not really expecting parents to work.\n  Or we are expecting the States to pick up the tab--a sort of \nunwritten unfunded mandate.\n  Or we are suggesting that young children can be left alone.\n  None of these alternatives are acceptable.\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\n  So the Finance Committee needs a lot of work. But Democrats are ready \nto do the work, and the Finance Committee bill does provide us with a \nmechanism for bringing welfare to the floor of the Senate for debate.\n  If Republicans have problems with their own bill, they should offer \namendments to improve it. That is what Democrats intend to do.\n  In fact, we will offer an alternative plan that is truly about work.\n  And so today I urge the majority leader to bring the welfare bill to \nthe floor.\n  It is time the Senate fulfills its obligation to give the American \npeople what they want and deserve: True welfare reform that will move \npeople off welfare and into work, not by punishing children, but by \nproviding people access to the real means to become self-sufficient.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9493-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, during consideration of S. 343, the \nRegulatory Reform Act, I intended to offer an amendment to waive \nadministrative and civil penalties for local governments when Federal \nwater pollution control compliance plans are in effect.\n  I believe this amendment is a simple issue of fairness to local \ngovernments and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my amendment and \nthe text of my ``Dear Colleague'' letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                            Amendment No. --\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WAIVER OF PENALTIES WHEN FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION \n                   CONTROL ACT COMPLIANCE PLANS ARE IN EFFECT.\n\n       Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1319) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Waiver of Penalties When Compliance Plans Are in \n     Effect.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no civil or \n     administrative penalty may be imposed under this Act against \n     a unit of local government for a violation of a provision of \n     this Act (including a violation of a condition of a permit \n     issued under this Act)--\n       ``(A) if the unit of local government has entered into an \n     agreement with the Administrator (or the Secretary of the \n     Army, in the case of a violation of section 404) to carry out \n     a compliance plan with respect to a prior violation of the \n     provision by the unit of local government; and\n       ``(B) during the period--\n       ``(i) beginning on the date on which the unit of local \n     government and the Administrator (or the Secretary of the \n     Army, in the case of a violation of section 404) enter into \n     the agreement; and\n       ``(ii) ending on the date on which the unit of local \n     government is required to be in compliance with the provision \n     under the plan.\n       ``(2) Requirement of good faith.--Paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply during any period in which the Administrator (or the \n     Secretary of the Army, in the case of a violation of section \n     404) determines that the unit of local government is not \n     carrying out the compliance plan in good faith.\n       ``(3) Other enforcement.--A waiver of penalties provided \n     under paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a \n     violation of any provision of this Act other than the \n     provision that is the subject of the agreement described in \n     paragraph (1)(A).''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate begins consideration of S. \n     343, the Regulatory Reform Bill, I intend to offer an \n     amendment to lift the unfair burden of excessive civil \n     penalties from the backs of local governments that are \n     working in good faith with the Clean Water Act.\n       Under current law, civil penalties begin to accumulate the \n     moment a local government violates the Clean Water Act. Once \n     this happens, the law requires that the local government \n     present a Municipal Compliance plan for approval by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \n     or the Secretary of the Army in cases of Section 404 \n     violations. However, even after a compliance plan has been \n     approved, penalties continue to accumulate. In effect, \n     existing law actually punishes local governments while they \n     are trying to comply with the law.\n       Under my amendment, local governments would stop \n     accumulating civil and administrative penalties once a \n     Municipal Compliance Plan has been negotiated and the \n     locality is acting in good faith to carry out the plan. \n     Further, my amendment would act as an incentive to encourage \n     governments to move quickly to achieve compliance with the \n     Clean Water Act.\n       This amendment is a simple issue of fairness. Local \n     governments must operate with a limited pool of resources. \n     Localities should not have to devote their tax revenue to \n     penalties, while having to comply with the law. Rather, by \n     discontinuing burdensome penalties, local governments can \n     better concentrate their resources to met the intent of the \n     law in protecting our water resources from pollution.\n       I hope you will join me in supporting this commonsense \n     amendment for our towns and cities. If you have any questions \n     or wish to cosponsor this amendment, please feel free to have \n     a member of your staff contact Quinn Mast of my staff at 4-\n     5842.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I understand we have morning business until \n10:30, at which time I will ask consent that we turn to H.R. 1944, the \nrescissions bill, and that no amendments be in order; there be 10 \nminutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form; and that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the bill be advanced \nto third reading and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  I will make that request at 10:30. I hope we can have the cooperation \nof our colleagues. This is something the White House wants. We have a \nstatement from the administration. This contains the money for the \nOklahoma City disaster. It contains money for the earthquakes in \nCalifornia. And if my colleagues on the other side do not want to pass \nit, that is up to them.\n  We have had a lot of negotiation on the rescissions package. The \nPresident vetoed it, and we went back and tried to accommodate some of \nthe President's concerns. Now I am advised at this last moment there \nmay be some other political efforts made to delay the bill or frustrate \nthe will of the majority.\n  I hope that at 10:30 sharp we can take up the bill under the previous \nconsiderations.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know we are waiting until the hour of \n10:30, but just for the public record, I now have a copy of this bill. \nThis is the first time I have seen this bill.\n  I voted for the $16 billion in cuts when it was on the Senate side, \nbut I want to make it crystal clear that there have now been additional \ncuts, for example, in low-income energy assistance. I am from a cold \nweather State. I want to talk about that program. I represent people in \nmy State. Just because people are low income does not mean they do not \nhave representation.\n  Just now I received a copy of this bill. There was a program that we \nhad that was an important program--the majority leader actually helped \nme on this before--which provided counseling to elderly people so they \ndo not get ripped off on some of the supplemental health care coverage \nto Medicare. That came out in the conference committee.\n  So, Mr. President, there is also a range of important programs here \nfor dislocated people, workers with summer youth employment. I just \nreceived this bill--just received it. I have not even had a chance to \nlook at it. I certainly would oppose any kind of a unanimous-consent \nagreement that said we would have a vote at a time certain. \n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n  I want to have an opportunity to offer amendments. I want to have an \nopportunity to talk about this. We are talking about people's lives, \nand there are some serious cuts in here that affect some of the most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  I would start, coming from a cold weather State, talking about the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, many of whom are elderly, \nmany of whom are disabled--we are a cold weather State --many of whom \ndepend upon this grant. This was eliminated on the House side. We \nrestored the funding on the Senate side, and now there have been \nadditional cuts of over $300 million in this program--$330 million in \ncuts in energy assistance for some of the most vulnerable citizens.\n  So I think we need to have an opportunity to offer amendments, an \nopportunity to debate and certainly an opportunity to even go through \nthis bill. I was not elected from Minnesota to come here and just have \nthings rammed through. This is the first time I have had a copy of this \nbill--the first time. Significant changes have been made. I am a \nlegislator. We should have an opportunity to evaluate this, and we \nshould have a debate on what is in this.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program is the same as in the vetoed bill. There has not \nbeen any change in that. I do not know where the $400 million figure \ncame from.\n  I want to include in the Record at this point a statement of \nadministration policy, this is the Clinton administration policy, that \nsupports H.R. 1944 as it passed the House:\n\n       H.R. 1944 provides an important balance between deficit \n     reduction and providing funds to meet emergency needs. This \n     legislation provides essential funding for FEMA Disaster \n     Relief, for the Federal response to the bombing in Oklahoma \n     City, for increased anti-terrorism efforts, and for providing \n     debt relief to Jordan in order to contribute to further \n     progress toward a Middle East peace settlement. H.R. 1944 \n     reduces Federal spending by $9 billion.\n\n  I think the administration statement is in accord with the thinking \nof most individuals.\n  This matter did pass the House last night.\n   As I understand it, there has been change in the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program since the bill passed the Senate.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Actually it is true. The bill the President vetoed is \nthe same. Many of us voted against that. What we passed out of the \nSenate restored the $1.3 billion for low-income energy assistance. Now \nwe have gone back to over $300 million of cuts. That is a very serious \nissue for people in my State. I just received a copy of this. Let us \ntake some time and evaluate what is in this rescissions bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been discussing H.R. 1944 with the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle. I understand now I have consent to \nturn to the consideration of H.R. 1944.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9494-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we turn to \nconsideration of H.R. 1944.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1944, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1944) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for additional disaster assistance, for \n     antiterrorism initiatives, for assistance in the recovery of \n     the tragedy that occurred in Oklahoma City, and making \n     rescissions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also understand we will not be able to get \nunanimous consent that there be no amendments to the bill, so I will \nnot make that request.\n  I am advised that the managers are here. We would like to proceed as \nquickly as possible. If there are amendments we hope the amendments \nwill be offered with very little debate. Certainly people have a right \nto offer amendments. We discourage amendments.\n  I hope that those who want this bill passed--which will save $9.2 \nbillion and is supported by President Clinton--will join together in \ndefeating any amendments or tabling any amendments that may be offered.\n  I know there are a number of absent Senators on each side of the \naisle. I must say they were never told there would be no votes today, \nso they left at their own risk.\n  In any event, I think we are prepared to proceed on the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are prepared to proceed. While I know \nthere are absent Senators on both sides, I think it is important we try \nto finish the business on this particular legislation.\n  The ranking member has done an outstanding job of bringing the Senate \nto this point, and they deserve our support for the work they have \ndone. We hope in the not-too-distant future today we can accomplish our \ntask and pass this legislation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like the attention of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, before I engage in an opening statement, I would like \nto make one observation and describe a very unique situation we are in.\n  In this rescissions package, we have, in effect, made cuts at current \n1995 appropriations counts that represents about $3 billion in outlays \nin the outyears.\n  I want to make very clear to the Senator from Minnesota and others \nwho may be interested in this--knowing of his concern for nonmilitary \ndiscretionary programs that involve people, children, poor people, \nneedy low-income energy assistance, other such programs--if we cannot \nput this bill through before we adjourn at this time, let me indicate \nthe time program and consequences.\n  Anything that stalls this at this time to move on this and act upon \nthis, puts the Senate into July 10 returning. On that date, and the day \nfollowing, the Appropriations Committee will be, then, in a process of \nmaking allocations under the 602(b) of the Budget Act for 1996 \naccounts.\n  If we cannot make that $3 billion outlay action now, that means we \nare going to have to add that to the 1996 allocations in order to stay \nwithin the budget resolution.\n  What any Senator would be doing would be taking the responsibility of \ncutting further, deeper, into those programs he or she may be \ninterested in, by holding up this action today, because we are not \ngoing to be able to delay the 1996 action any longer.\n  The House has already passed four of six out of their committee. If \nwe cannot absorb in the 1995 period that $3 billion outlay, we will be \nabsorbing it in the 1996. Any Senator would be compounding the very \nthing they are trying to defend. The Senator is creating a higher cut \nin 1996. We cannot escape that.\n  Let me say, we also lost the battle of cutting out the Seawolf or the \nB-2 bomber or something and taking that money and putting it into \nprograms of nonmilitary. We lost that battle. We are precluded in the \nappropriations in our 602(b) allocations of transferring money from \ndefense discretionary to nondefense discretionary.\n  Do not be misled with the idea that somehow we will face the battle \non the Seawolf or the B-2, and we will reduce those commitments in the \ndefense appropriation discretionary programs and be able to use them \nfor low-income energy assistance or other welfare or people's need \nprograms. That battle we have lost, much to my chagrin.\n  I want to just add a word of caution. The very things that the \nSenator may feel he would defend in the 1995 rescission, the Senator \nwill compound it in \n\n[[Page S9496]]\n1996 by the very action of this Senate in the budget resolution and \nother decisions we have made. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I fully support the statement made by the \nchairman of the committee. If I had my way about it, I would change \nthis conference report in a few particulars, at least. I am only one. \nWe have been down this road, now, twice. We spent many hours, several \ndays, on the first conference report.\n  Mr. President, on May 25 of this year, the Senate adopted the \nconference report to H.R. 1158, the FEMA supplemental appropriation and \nrescission bill by a vote of 61 to 38. At that time, I spoke in support \nof the conference agreement even though it did not contain all of the \nprovisions that were included in the Senate bill. In particular, a \nnumber of Members on this side of the aisle felt that the conference \nagreement did not include a sufficient number of the programs that were \nfunded under the Daschle-Dole joint leadership amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I urged the President to sign the conference report on \nH.R. 1158 because it was a result of long and difficult negotiations \nwith the other body and because it contained many important items, \nincluding an appropriation of $6.7 billion for Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA] disaster relief effort. These funds were to be \nused to finance the relief costs associated with the Northridge \nearthquake, as well as to address declared disasters resulting from \nfloods and storms throughout some 40 States, including the most recent, \nextraordinary rains and hail which occurred in Louisiana and some other \nStates.\n  With regard to the administration's request for emergency \nsupplemental appropriations in the wake of the tragedy in Oklahoma \nCity, H.R. 1158 provided approximately $250 million for antiterrorism \ninitiatives and Oklahoma City recovery efforts. This included \nsubstantial increases above the President's request for the FBI, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Secret Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms, and the Judiciary. Included in this amount is $67 \nmillion to meet the special needs of the General Services \nAdministration created by the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing attack \nat the Murrah Federal Building.\n  The conference report on H.R. 1158 also provided $275 million for \ndebt relief for Jordan--to which I object; I did not support that debt \nrelief--as proposed by the administration. These funds would allow the \nPresident to fulfill a promise to help Jordan in its historic peace \nagreement with Israel.\n  The President chose to veto H.R. 1158 against my wishes. I do not \nthink he should have vetoed it. But he did so for a number of reasons, \nwhich he set forth in correspondence to the Congress accompanying his \nveto message. Since that veto, negotiations have been ongoing between \nthe House and Senate leadership and the Appropriations Committees. And, \nas a result of those negotiations, last night the House passed H.R. \n1944, the bill which is presently before the Senate. In addition to all \nof the provisions contained in the conference reports to H.R. 1158 that \nI previously mentioned, H.R. 1944 also contains reductions in a number \nof rescissions as requested by the administration, as well as an \nincreased appropriation for replacement of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City. The total of these add-backs above the amounts contained \nin H.R. 1158 is $772 million. In order to offset this additional \nspending, new or increased rescissions are contained in H.R. 1944 \ntotaling $794 million, resulting in additional deficit reduction of $22 \nmillion more than was contained in the conference agreement \naccompanying H.R. 1158.\n  I support the passage of H.R. 1944 because it contains $6.55 billion \nin emergency disaster assistance for funds for victims of various \ndisasters, including the California earthquake and flooding throughout \nthe Nation, and, under the Byrd amendment, the bill, if enacted, would \nreduce the deficit by approximately $9 billion. I do not think we ought \nto lose sight of that. And, moreover, the 1995 rescissions which are \ncontained in the bill, if enacted, will result in a decrease in outlays \nfor fiscal year 1996 of approximately $3.1 billion, just as the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] stated a few minutes \nago.\n  This is so because the outlays which would have occurred in 1996 from \nthe appropriations for which funds were rescinded will no longer be \nrequired. And this will free up approximately $6 billion in budget \nauthority and $3.1 billion in outlays for use in fiscal year 1996--this \nis very important, for nondefense discretionary purposes--for \nnondefense discretionary programs.\n  As Senator Hatfield has said, the walls are going back up. When the \nwalls of Jericho came down, they were not rebuilt so soon, and the \nappropriations walls are now up again. I am very opposed to these \nwalls, walling off defense moneys from nondefense discretionary \nfunding, because nondefense discretionary funding will continue to take \nthe brunt of the cuts, as it has for, now, these several recent years.\n  I hope we will be able to pass this bill, and pass it quickly. The \ndistinguished chairman has pointed out, when we get back we are going \nto be on the appropriations bills. The House is already passing them. \nThese rescissions will then enable the Appropriations Committee to have \nmore moneys to allocate in budget authority and in outlays for 1996. So \nI hope we will not cut off our nose to spite our face.\n  I certainly can sympathize, however, with Senators who may be \ndispleased with the product that we have before the Senate. But we can \nmake it worse in the long run. I think we have to accept a reality.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator \nHatfield, for the tireless efforts that he has put forth that resulted \nin the successful resolution of the differences between the President, \nthe House, and the Senate on these difficult matters.\n  As I say, I know that all Senators are not satisfied with the bill. I \nam not satisfied with it. But it is better than we could expect \notherwise if it were to be delayed or, indeed, rejected, which I do not \nbelieve it will be.\n  On balance, I believe it is an important appropriation and \nrescissions bill that deserves the support of the Senate for the \nreasons that I have set forth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I know the \nSenator from Oregon also wishes to speak. I will be speaking from the \nfloor with some difficulty because of an asthma condition, or allergy \ncondition, and I apologize for the coughing.\n  Mr. President, I find myself in a position of being out on the floor \nwith several Senators whom I deeply admire but with whom, at least for \nthis moment, I am in profound disagreement.\n  I am extremely sympathetic to my colleagues, who are as good Senators \nas you could ever find, as accomplished legislators as you could ever \nfind. But in all due respect, I did not vote for this budget \nresolution. I understand the pressures all too well. That is why I did \nnot vote for the budget resolution. And I certainly am not someone who \nis in favor of putting walls back up between the domestic and the \nPentagon spending.\n  There are two issues I want to raise at the beginning of this \ndiscussion. First of all, I did not object to the motion to proceed. I \njust simply said that, as a Senator, I now know, as I look at the \nreport that has come back, that there have been some changes. I voted \ninitially for this rescissions package. I am all for--and I understand \nthe position of the President vis-a-vis assistance to California and \nOklahoma--I am all for it.\n  But I am a legislator and this report came less than 1 hour ago. I \ncannot quite read--is it almost 11 now? This report came here at 9:55. \nThis is the first time I had a chance to look at this rescissions \npackage, at 9:55. I do not know about other Senators, but I do not even \nknow what is in here. I know some of what is in here. I have not had a \nchance to examine this. This package, H.R. 1944, is some 120 pages long \nand we are just going to rush this through? Initially there was a \nproposal--some Senators were talking about voice voting it.\n  I said, from the time I came here, that on all appropriations \nmatters, all expenditures of money, we should \n\n[[Page S9497]]\nnever have voice votes. We should be accountable.\n  I feel the same way also about these cuts, about this rescissions \npackage. This has a very real impact on the lives of people we \nrepresent. I want to talk about that impact. But above and beyond that, \nI say to my colleagues, 9:55 is when this came here. I have not even \nhad a chance to examine this piece of legislation, this rescissions \npackage.\n  I know enough to know what has been changed for the worse and I want \nto talk about that. But I just refuse to have this thing just sail \nthrough here, essentially jammed through the Senate. I do not think \nthat is a responsible way to legislate. I feel strongly about that.\n  What is the hurry? We ought to examine what is in H.R. 1944. For \nexample, I have here--this is one of the reasons that I have such \nfondness for the Senator from Oregon. I would say the same thing about \nthe Senator from West Virginia. This was a letter dated May 8.\n\n       Dear Paul: Thank you for your most recent letter regarding \n     the House of Representatives rescission of $1.319 billion for \n     the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\n  Which I voted for. Which you know I voted for.\n\n       As you know, the Senate bill did not include this \n     rescission. Please be assured that the Commmittee intends to \n     maintain this position during the on-going House-Senate \n     conference.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Oregon for his assistance----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator will yield, just to make certain the \nRecord is correct, this bill does not change this program, so it is not \nfor the worse.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What has happened----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is not for the worse. It is the same level as the \nvetoed bill. I can give you a list of the better parts of this bill, of \nthe vetoed bill, if the Senator would be interested in that, too?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. So I just want to correct the Record. It is not for the \nworse.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the vetoed bill is the bill I voted \nagainst. I voted for a bill that we reported out of the Senate because \nwe had restored the $1.3 billion funding. But now we have cuts of about \n$330 million in funding for the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance \nProgram. That is now what is in this bill which just came to us at \n9:55. We have $20 million of cuts. That is different from what I voted \nfor out of the Senate. I did not vote for the bill that the President \nvetoed.\n  Mr. President, just to be clear about what is at issue here, I think \nit is a matter of priorities. I look at their rescissions package and I \nsee a disproportionate number of cuts, in all due respect, that affect \nlow- and moderate-income citizens in this Nation. I do not think it was \nmy colleagues' choosing. But I just want to talk about some of these \npriorities. I am talking about restoring $330 million of assistance for \nlow-income people.\n  I say to the Chair, we come from the third coldest State. One B-2 \nbomber costs over $1 billion. This is not even a third of a B-2 bomber. \nMr. President, we have one of the finest fighting fleets of F-15's. \nEverybody will tell you that. We now have a proposal to replace the F-\n15 with the F-27 to the tune of $162 million, and an overall costs of \n$70 billion additional dollars. In the post-cold-war period, the Soviet \nUnion Empire no longer existing, and the Pentagon saying we do not need \nsome of these weapons. There are no rescissions there at all.\n  Later on today, Mr. President, I am going to talk about all the \nsubsidies that go to the oil companies since we are talking about low-\nincome energy assistance.\n  But President, I met at the home of Olita Larson in Richfield. She is \na disabled senior citizen and a LIHEAP recipient. In addition to her, I \nmet with several veterans, and several mothers with children. And what \nI learned from them is that, at least in my State of Minnesota, the \nLow-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program is not an income \nsupplement. It is a survival supplement: 111,000 households receive \nLIHEAP assistance; 313,000 individuals; 28,000 seniors; 53 percent of \nthose that receive this assistance which is about $300 a month or so. \nThis is just to enable people to get by so that it is not ``heat or \neat.'' Fifty-three percent were working at low-wage jobs; 32 percent \nwere senior citizens; 41 percent were households with small children; \nabout 50 percent earn less than $6,500 a year.\n  Excuse me, Mr. President, for not understanding some kind of \ndefinition of reality here in the Nation's Capital. But for the life of \nme, I do not understand how in the world we can be cutting low-income \nenergy assistance to people, people who really need the assistance, \npeople who are the most vulnerable citizens in our country, but we go \nforward spending $1 billion on B-2 bombers that the Pentagon tells us \nwe do not need. We have billions of dollars of subsidies to oil \ncompanies. We do not choose to close those loopholes.\n  Mr. President, these are distorted priorities. Just because Olita \nLarson does not make big contributions, just because she is not well-\nconnected, just because she is not a player does not mean she should \nnot be represented.\n  Mr. President, I met at the home. I am not going to cave in right \nnow. You meet with people. You talk with people. You make a commitment \nthat you are going to do everything you can to support people. And that \nis where I thought we were. That is why I originally voted for this \nrescissions package. Now what we get H.R. 1944 from the House, which \ncomes at 9:55, I find out that we have over $300 million of cuts.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Is the Senator aware that the B-2 bomber was killed last night by the \nArmed Services Committee? According to this morning's paper, the \ncommittee voted not to fund any additional B-2 bombers, which I hail as \na great achievement. But I would also like to add there is no way we \ncan take the savings of that B-2 bomber and transfer it into \nnonmilitary discretionary programs. We, on the Appropriations \nCommittee, have our hands tied on that. I could not agree with the \nSenator more. I will not take a back seat to the Senator nor to any \nother Senator in fighting for the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance \nProgram, and all these other programs that represent people's needs.\n  But what I am saying to the Senator is that this speech is a little \nlate. It should be repeated and repeated. But I am saying it is a \nlittle late as it relates to the current issue we have before us. The \ndie is cast. What are we going to salvage out of this circumstance? I \nsay to the Senator in all respect, that, if this is not acted upon \ntoday, the Senator will have led the appropriators and forced the \nappropriators into cutting $1.3 billion out of the subcommittee on \nLabor-HHS for 1996, over and above what we would otherwise have to do. \nIf the Senator wants to take on that responsibility, keep that in mind. \nYou are hurting the very people you are trying to help. That is not \nyour making. It is not my making. It is the decision of the total body \nof this Senate, and we lost. We lost. But do not compound that \nterrible, terrible thing onto those very people by saying to the \nappropriators you have to cut another $1.3 billion. I say to the \nSenator with all due respect, that is reality. That is the reality we \nface.\n  I find it a very, very unpleasant experience to have to cut any out \nof the Labor-HHS subcommittee of appropriations. The House cut $10 \nbillion from, $70 billion and $60 billion. We are going to be forced \ninto allocations to cut further, if we do not get this passed today. \nThat is the reality. Like it or not, that is the reality. That is the \nposition the Senator from Minnesota is pushing the Appropriations \nCommittee into. I do not want any part of it. I am wanting to ease the \npain that we have already created. I do not want to increase them, and \nthe Senator from Minnesota will be escalating that burden on the very \npoor of this Nation by $1.3 billion more out of the Labor-HHS that we \ndo not get out of 1995.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I still have the floor. Let me just say \nthat, first of all, one more time, I did not vote for the budget \nresolution. I did not vote--later on today when we get into the \ndiscussion--I did not vote for the tax cut. The Byrd rule I think \nprotected us over the first year. I am not at all sure ultimately, as I \nstretch \n\n[[Page S9498]]\nthis out and project where this heads. This is the first time we have \nactually seen the rubber meet the road and some real decisions made \nthat ultimately this money in the outyears is not eventually being used \nto finance tax cuts for fat cats in this country, frankly. But let me \nsay to the Senator from Oregon, and I would like to proceed here, that \nin terms of the choices, about 60 percent of the administrative travel \nfunds are in the Pentagon. We can make some further cuts there. We can \nalso do the same thing with FEMA. We can make some cuts there. So I do \nnot think it is quite true that there are no choices.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I just simply want to go back to what I \nhave been saying. I thought, though it was a close call for me, that my \ncolleagues did an admirable job, a very admirable job given the \nconstraints they were working under, so we passed this rescissions \npackage. I had some questions about it, but I voted for it.\n  Then the House goes to work and the President vetoes the conference \nreport, and I support the President's veto. Then we get H.R. 1944 that \ncomes here at 9:55. I have not even had a chance to examine this. I \njust refuse to be put in the position that somehow what I am doing \nright now is going to hurt low-income people.\n  If I could just finish this, I will be pleased to yield. I have over \nand over again been talking about this. Now, I do not know where other \nDemocrats are. I know that 150 Members of the House voted against this \npackage yesterday, last night. I could just simply tell you that I \nthink these are distorted priorities. I think there are other areas \nthat could be cut that are not being cut. I think we are asking some of \nthe most vulnerable citizens in this country to pay a price by \ntightening their belt when they cannot tighten their belt.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator. I say to the Senator from \nMinnesota and the distinguished Senators from Oregon and West Virginia, \nI cannot think of three people for whom I have more respect in this \nbody, but I have to say I concur in and associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I want to say that in listening to the debate and the argument about \nthe harm that we are doing, or might be doing, by taking the floor in \nopposition to this conference report, this resolution, I could not help \nbut think about the old poem--and I think the Senator from West \nVirginia may remember this one--a poem from many years ago about: \nLizzie Borden took an ax and gave her mother 40 whacks, and when she \nsaw what she done, she gave her father 41.\n  It seems to me that if you boil down the argument that the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon has made about what we are doing \nright now in this procedural setting, it is suggesting that the 40 \nwhacks the children and poor people have taken in this bill, in this \ncompromise, might be increased to 41 if we do not sit back, accede to \nthe decision of the conference committee, be quiet, say nothing and let \nthis roll out of here on a moment's notice without examination or \ndiscussion.\n  I just do not think that is an appropriate response for conscientious \nlegislators who have real concerns about this bill.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has talked about the low-income heating \nissue. I particularly am concerned about education and what has \nhappened with the education funding for needy people, needy children, \nin this bill.\n  I am not going to debate it, and I do appreciate the efforts that \nwere made to restore education funding in this compromise, but I have \nto submit to you that the rescissions were not called for in education \nin the first place. Why would we, at this critical time in our Nation's \nhistory, do anything but begin to weigh in 100 percent to help support \neducation, to give our youngsters the ability to compete in this world \neconomy, to guarantee for this next generation that they will be able \nto compete in this world market?\n  I want to point out specifically that in this compromise, the title \nII-C JPTA funding for poor children who are in disadvantaged \ncircumstances was cut $272 million, cut down to now--out of $398 \nmillion, which it was in the previous budget, to $126 million. That is \na cut of $272 million for job training for disadvantaged young people.\n  Well, you go out on the streets, at least in the State that I come \nfrom and young people are wondering what we are doing to help them. \nThey want to be productive. They want to get the job skills and the \nliteracy skills and the educational skills to be able to participate in \nour society, and this bill would just cut them off altogether. And to \nshut down activities that are working to stop school dropouts in order \nto give young people a hand up, to cut them by $272 million is just, in \nmy opinion, unconscionable.\n  I do not know how we can justify that on the grounds that, well, if \nwe do not do it now, we will not have a chance again until after July. \nAnd if we do it in July, the money will not be freed up for \nappropriations and spending and then they will have to give them 41 \nwhacks in September.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator from Minnesota permit the Senator from \nIllinois to yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with the understanding I have the \nfloor, I will be pleased to have the Senator yield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Always, so long as it is yielding for a question.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to the Senator, I was giving those speeches 25 \nyears ago on this floor, and it was valid then, and it has been proven \nto be more valid today, as the Senator gives the same remarks about our \npriorities--our lack of priorities--our failure to put the focus where \nthe needs are by our overwhelming lust and willingness to vote for \ngreater capacity to destroy life than to sustain and improve life, \nnamely the military versus the nonmilitary spending.\n  But in all due kindness and respect, I ask the Senator, what is the \noption? I ask the Senator to put herself in my shoes and tell me what \nshe would do as of this moment in this timeframe with 1996 upon us and \nhaving to make that decision, and every day we lose the money, the \nbaseline in the rescissions--right or wrong rescissions--every day we \nlose that money. We come back here July 11, and it is all over. We will \nhave not had this action.\n  Now, in that timeframe, what is the Senator's option or alternative \nthat she would take?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say to the Senator from Oregon, again for whom I \nhave a tremendous amount of respect, and I know he has been on the \nright side of history for these 25 years trying to make this case, but \nit is a case that we have to make, it seems to me. And in response \nspecifically to the Senator's question, I do not have an answer. We \njust got the bill 1\\1/2\\ hours ago. We have not had a chance really to \neven go through to see where the shifts and the changes might be. We \nare not on the committee.\n  And please understand, I say to the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from West Virginia, no one is unmindful of the hard work that \nthe Senators have done and the dedication and the long hours trying to \nhammer out a compromise. But compromise by definition means that some \npriorities get lost in the shuffle.\n  I just submit--and the Senator from Minnesota submits--that the days \nin which we can continue to allow the children of this Nation and poor \npeople who need heating assistance to get lost in the shuffle are over. \nWe cannot afford to continue down this path.\n  Our Nation's greatness depends on our capacity to allow individuals \nto contribute to this society and to function within it. No economy on \nthis planet in this time is going to be healthier or be able to succeed \nmore than the social fabric of what that nation will allow. To the \nextent that we allow Senator Wellstone's constituent to have to choose \nbetween turning on a gas burner in her house and eating dinner, we \nweaken our entire national fabric. To the extent we allow these \nteenagers to drop out of school and to stand on street corners, not \nonly do we increase the crime rate, not only do we diminish the quality \nof life in our communities, but we have done serious injury to our \nnational fabric as well.\n  And so the only response I would have for the Senator, since we have \nonly had 2 hours, maybe 1\\1/2\\ hours, to \n\n[[Page S9499]]\nlook at this, is to say to the Senator from Oregon we do not have all \nthe answers.\n  I was going to talk about another set of cuts--the majority leader \njust entered, and I know he knows of my interest in this particular \nissue--education infrastructure. We have schools crumbling around this \ncountry. There have been articles in every magazine, every newspaper, \nabout the state and quality of our schools that our youngsters----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Did I hear the answer to my question is the Senator \ndoes not have an answer?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say, in answer to the Senator's question, I have \nnot had time to give the Senator an answer because we just got the bill \n1\\1/2\\ hours ago. I will be delighted, and I take the challenge----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to the Senator, that is not the question. I got \nthe bill, too, the same time the Senator did. That is not the question \nI asked. I asked, what in this timeframe would the Senator instruct me \nto do? I am happy to hear any new idea that gives me an option, and I \nam just asking the Senator, other than protesting this particular time \nand this particular action, which I agree with the Senator, but tell \nme, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, what the Senator would \ndo today.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could just----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Let her have a chance to answer.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. What I would do today is I would put together \nlegislation that does not take those 40 whacks out of children and poor \npeople.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Well, I say to the Senator, that is a fine statement, \nif I could----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Let me give specific dollar numbers. We want to \nrestore $272 million.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That is not an option today. This body already passed \nthe budget resolution. You may not have voted, I say to the Senator, \nfor the budget resolution, but the body did. I have to function under \nthe body, not under how I voted, but under the body's decision. So what \nis the option----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I can----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. This must be a protest statement, which is perfectly \nlegitimate, and I join in addressing the protests both Senators are \nmaking toward the priorities in this budget, but that is not our option \ntoday.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. May I respond?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Then I would like to get the floor back.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I had not \nintended for this to become a colloquy with the Senator from Oregon. I \ncan tell he is upset because time is upon us. He put in a lot of work. \nI certainly appreciate that and understand that and understand his \nfrustration with having the Senator from Minnesota and myself standing \nhere and saying, ``Well, this is not quite good enough.''\n  But let me tell you, in response to the Senator from Oregon, we start \noff with a situation in which we are now being told, because of the \nprocedure, that this is a fait accompli; that there is nothing we can \ndo about this; that it has been served up to us a couple of hours ago \nbased on a decision that happened 2 weeks ago, based on some decisions \nthat were made a month ago; and that this train has gone too far down \nline for us to do anything about it.\n  I say to the Senator from Oregon that at a minimum, if I am going to \nbe Polly Pure Heart run over by a train, I do not have to do it \nquietly. I can at least stand on this floor and make the point that it \nis wrong to cut job training for disadvantaged young people by $272 \nmillion, and it is inappropriate at this point in time, given the \nstatus of our Nation's schools, to cut $35 million out of education \ninfrastructure. And it is wrong, in any event, to cut heating \nassistance for poor people in cold climates in communities all over \nthis Nation.\n  If I am going to be run over by this train, I say to the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from West Virginia and to anybody else who is \nlistening, at least I can yell out about what is about to happen to me. \nI go back to my 40 whacks. It may be that I am asking, I am begging to \nget 41 whacks next month by making this point. But it seems to me that \nthe worst thing we can do in this situation is to stand by and say \nnothing. And if we stand by and say nothing as these cuts occur, if we \nstand by and say nothing to cuts in low-income heating and cuts in \ndisadvantaged youth job training--disadvantaged youth job training \nprograms, how can anybody, red pencil notwithstanding, sit back and \nsay, ``No, we want fewer job training opportunities for already \ndisadvantaged teenagers''? This is just not logical to me.\n  The Senator may be absolutely right. If we have a vote on the motion \nby the Senator from Minnesota or myself, whatever, we may lose, but it \nseems to me----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I cannot yield. I yield back the time to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield, if I can have 1 minute, \nand then I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will be happy----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague from Oregon to yield for a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, just to kind of sort \nthis out for a moment, I am in complete agreement with not only what my \ncolleague from Illinois had to say but with the eloquence with which \nshe said it. Absolutely, we did not know what was going to be in this \nbill, I say to my colleagues, until late last night--10 o'clock. We \njust received this at 9:55 this morning.\n  Second of all, I do not view this as a protest. My distinguished \ncolleague from Oregon talks about it is a protest. I am prepared to \ndebate. I will have amendments, and I am prepared to debate those \namendments, and I am prepared to have a vote on those amendments.\n  This is not something like all of a sudden I have become interested \nin. My colleagues all know of my strong commitment to LIHEAP. They all \nknow that I think it is unconscionable that we are making these cuts. I \nfeel very strongly about the Summer Jobs Training Program.\n  Mr. President, when we first finished up on the Senate rescissions \nbill late at night, with some assistance from the majority leader, we \nrestored funding for a counseling program for senior citizens to make \nsure that they do not get ripped off in some of the supplemental \ncoverage that they get to their Medicare. Now we are going to have all \nthese cuts in Medicare and Medicaid--and this is great, I suppose, for \nsome of the insurance companies for there not to be this consumer \nprotection--but we are now going to go back to cutting, I think it was, \n$5 million--only $5 million.\n  What is the purpose of cutting a counseling program for senior \ncitizens to provide them with basic consumer protection? That is in, as \nit turns out, H.R. 1944, passed late at night, just sent over here \ntoday.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to be crystal clear, this is not like \nsomething we just started saying.\n  I read the other day in the paper about a general having a plane sent \nacross the country to pick him and his cat up, at a cost of over \n$100,000 a year. Is that the kind of travel we are funding? I say to \nyou, we have it within this budget, we have it within our power, within \nthis bill to actually take more out of that administrative and travel \nbudget from the Pentagon. We can do that. I have talked about FEMA. \nThere are plenty of alternatives.\n  But, Mr. President, first, let us just get back to the process. It is \npretty hard for us to sort of lay out all the alternatives until we, \nfirst of all, know what is in this bill; and second, do not tell me \nthat upon some time for deliberation and some time for discussion and \nsome time for debate on amendments, we cannot come up with \nalternatives. Of course, we can come up with alternatives. This is not \nin concrete. Who said this is the day, that this is it, there cannot be \nany changes, we cannot make any changes at all, especially if we feel \nvery strongly that there are some real distorted priorities?\n  I can only speak for myself, but I really do not understand the \npriorities \n\n[[Page S9500]]\nwhich say we go headlong with increases in the Pentagon budget, we have \nmassive tax cuts, $245 billion, most of them going to wealthy people, \nand we are going to cut low-income energy assistance in the State of \nMinnesota.\n  I say to my colleague, I may lose on this amendment, but I will not \nbe silent about this, and if I lose, I will go down fighting, not on \nthe basis of just some principle or some protest, but because I am a \nlegislator and I know there are alternatives and I know as we have a \ndiscussion of this, we will get to those alternatives.\n  But I just, again, have to say--I so appreciate what my colleague \nfrom Illinois said--here we are talking about children. We all love \nchildren. We all want to have photo opportunities with children, and we \ncut job training programs for young people, and we cut low-income--\nLIHEAP is not coming anywhere close to meeting the needs of those \npeople that are eligible. And now we are going to have additional cuts \nin the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program?\n  I come from a cold weather State. Sometimes it is 20 below zero, \nsometimes it is 40 below zero, sometimes, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, it can be 70 below zero wind chill. But for many of the most \nvulnerable citizens in Minnesota, this can be terrifying--this can be \nterrifying.\n  Mr. President, I think that I went over these figures today, and I \ncan give some figures for other States as well, but in Minnesota, 37 \npercent of the households are working poor; 15 percent have a disabled \nhousehold member; 26 percent of the households have an elderly \nhousehold member; 33 percent of the households have a child of 5 or \nyounger, and I can go on and on.\n  When I met with Olita Larson in Richfield, and others, I made a \ncommitment to them to fight hard for this program. I have been doing \nthat all along. I do not come to this just now.\n  So what we have here is a rescissions package that just came over. \nSome of the initial good work that we did in the Senate has been undone \nwith cuts where there were not supposed to be cuts.\n  Mr. President, I have to raise questions about the whole priority of \nthis. I would be pleased, eventually, to get to amendments and to have \ndiscussion. I have the average fiscal net allotment and average heating \nand cooling benefits for households assisted by State and region for \nfiscal 1993. I am prepared to go through these figures and talk about \nwhat this means in human terms.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, nobody in the Senate believes \nmore than I believe in the freedom of speech in the Senate, and in the \nright to debate, and the right to stand on one's feet and speak as long \nas one has breath. I have fought that battle many times. I respect the \nfact that the distinguished Senator from Minnesota is protesting at \nthis point and is speaking with great feeling. He speaks from the \nheart. He is doing his very best to represent his constituents. He is \ndispleased with what he sees happening in connection with \nappropriations. I respect the right of the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois to do the same. And I am perfectly willing to sit here and \nlisten to the Senators.\n  But if the Senator will allow me, let me point out that I, too, voted \nagainst the conference agreement yesterday in the budget bill. I have \nspoken out against the tax cuts. I oppose the tax cut that our own \nPresident is advocating. I oppose the tax cut that the Republicans are \nadvocating. I am against any tax cut at this particular time. We are \njust digging the hole deeper when we have a tax cut and we say we want \nto get out of that hole that represents the budget deficit. So I am \nagainst the tax cut. I voted against the conference report yesterday. \nSeveral Democrats voted against it because of the tax cuts that are \nlikely to result from that agreement.\n  But, Mr. President, I say to the two Senators that this agreement \nbefore us is better than the one that the President vetoed. I do not \nagree with everything that is in this package--not by any means. But \nthe President himself says he will sign this bill. He vetoed the first \none. He says the changes that have been made will bring about his \nsignature. So if he is not satisfied with it, he is at least going to \nsign it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I merely urge the distinguished Senators, if they \nfeel compelled to offer an amendment, that they offer it, and let the \nSenate vote on it today. I hope they will not offer an amendment, but I \nrecognize their right to do so, and I will protect their rights to do \nso as far as I can. I just suggest that they offer the amendments and \nhave their go at it. But it takes a majority to carry an amendment. I \ndo not believe they are going to get that majority. Nevertheless, they \nhave the right to offer amendments. I have been in the position several \ntimes in my long service here of offering amendments and seeing them \ndefeated--amendments about which I felt as strongly as any Senator \ncould feel. But when I felt I had done my best, I got up off the \ncarpet, dusted myself off, and went on to the next battle.\n  I recognize the Senator's right to speak and his right to offer an \namendment. I urge the Senators not to force us into a delay that puts \nus over the holiday, because I can assure the Senator that if that \nhappens, we are going to be much the worse off. We will have less money \nand budget authority. We will have less outlays, and we are going to \nregret that if we do it.\n  So I hope we will offer any amendment that we feel compelled to \noffer, speak on it, and let us vote on it. Let us not delay this matter \nso that it is still before the Senate when we return, because we will \nhave lost and lost badly. Let me say this with the greatest of respect. \nThe Senator has not seen anything yet. This is just a drop in the \nbucket to the cuts that are coming. I am on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not have the floor.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee, and I got rolled a couple of \ntimes in the committee yesterday. The Republican side in that committee \nis voting in lockstep. They are unanimous, and there is no way that 10 \nmembers on our side of the Armed Services Committee can outvote 11 \nmembers on the other side. So we might as well get used to it. We will \nnot get used to it without protesting, and I will be protesting some, \ntoo. But I merely make my plea on the basis of at least getting on with \nthis matter today, disposing of it, and getting up off the carpet and \ndusting ourselves off and getting ready for the next battle, which we \nwill probably lose again. There may be some we will win. I appreciate \nthe Senator's allowing me to make these remarks and for his yielding. I \nrespect his right to speak, and I respect his right to offer an \namendment, and I respect the way he feels. I hope he will finish his \nspeech, but if he has an amendment, offer it and let us vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, I yield.\n  Excuse me, I yield for a question or comment, but I will retain the \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator was aware of the \nspecifics that have been extrapolated, that increased in this \nparticular new rescissions package: Adult job training, by $40 million; \nschool to work, another $20 million; Goals 2000, by another $60 \nmillion; safe and drug free schools, $220 million; drug courts, $5 \nmillion; community schools, $10 million; TRIO, $11 million; child care \nblock grant, $8 million; housing for people with AIDS, $15 million; \nnational and community service, $105 million; safe drinking water, $225 \nmillion; community development financial institutions, $14 million; \ncommunity development grants $39 million, for a total of an add-back of \n$772 million over the first rescissions package.\n  That is after weeks of working with the White House, after working \nwith our colleagues in the House of Representatives. Sure, the glass is \nhalf full or half empty, depending on what you look at.\n  Again, there has not been a word said about the Senator from \nMinnesota or the Senator from Illinois that I would not endorse 100 \npercent. My views precisely. But let me also say to the Senator that he \nhas talked about low-income energy assistance. No one has gone cold for \na lack of money in that account. We do not predict the weather ahead. \nWhat we do in the appropriations is we set forth $1.3 billion in 1995 \n\n[[Page S9501]]\nappropriations for low-income energy assistance for this coming winter. \nWe cannot predict that winter. Anytime in the past on the record where \nwe have had less money than required to keep people warm, we have \nappropriated a supplemental.\n  So the fear that the Senator is expressing on the basis of the figure \nhere is not a justified fear. We appropriate supplementals.\n  Now, let me say also to the Senator that in dealing with the White \nHouse, they had a higher figure for low-income energy assistance \nrescission than we had that they were willing to have rescinded. Was it \nbecause they were interested in people of low income? Not at all. They \nunderstood the funding mechanism. They knew that we would always put \nthat appropriation out there in a supplemental form to keep those \npeople warm.\n  Therefore, that money was not yet obtained because we had no \nknowledge of the requirement of the amount of that money.\n  I can say to the Senator, I participated in that time after time, \nleading the battle, in some instances, of putting that money in the \nsupplemental to keep people warm. We cannot predict what that winter \nweather is.\n  The Senator said a while ago he might lose on this. No, the Senator \nwill not lose. The people of Minnesota will lose, the people of \nIllinois will lose, and anybody else who blocks this action at this \ntime.\n  Again, the fundamental bottom line that the Senator cannot escape--I \ncannot, the Senator cannot--is requiring the Appropriations Committee \nto gut $1.3 billion more in the 602(b)'s for 1996 if we do not pass \nthis and get this acted upon today.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Actually, there are a couple of comments, and when \nwe get into a colloquy like this, it is sometimes difficult to know \nwhat to respond to first.\n  I have to point out to the Senator from Oregon, and even the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, it is very difficult to debate someone who has been \non the right side of these issues for so long and who cares about them, \nas I know that the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from West \nVirginia do.\n  However, I will point out that back home, we have an expression, ``If \nyou are being chopped to death with an ax, you don't let them do it to \nyou in the closet, you go out on the street corner.''\n  Quite frankly, with regard to these cuts, I think it is not only \nappropriate, but I think it is essential that Senator Wellstone, the \nSenator from Minnesota, myself, and any other Senator who cares about \nthese issues, come out and talk about what we are doing here.\n  The Senator read off the numbers in terms of what we put back. I \nthink it is important, also, to remember--and I wish I could remember \nthe numbers but I do not have my glasses with me right now--to talk \nabout what was cut to begin with.\n  The fact is, these are meat ax cuts. They start off as meat ax cuts, \nand they are a little less--no question--they are a little less bad \nthan they were previously.\n  But that still does not mean that we should not take to this floor \nand talk about why it is important to restore the $272 million that was \ncut out of the JTPA Program, or the dollars that were cut out of \nheating, or the dollars that were cut out of the education \ninfrastructure program to help start trying to fix some of the falling \ndown, broken down schools across this country. We have to be able to \ntalk about these issues. It is not symbolic.\n  Frankly, I say to the Senator from Oregon, I find it more \ndistressing--no one is trying to be uncooperative--I find it more than \na little distressing that the Senator from Minnesota and I will be \ntold, ``If you go out here and talk about issues you care about, then \nyou are in danger we will do it even worse.''\n  I started off talking about Lizzie Borden. The more this debate goes \non, that is exactly where we are, Senator Wellstone. The threat is, if \nwe do not go quietly down this primrose path, we will get 41 whacks \nafter July.\n  I just do not think that is what the people of Illinois sent me here \nto do--the people of Illinois or the people from Minnesota, or \nanywhere, if they knew what we were doing to people concerns, human \nconcerns.\n  Is there a way to predict and to make the offsets, the question was \nasked of me earlier? I could not respond, because we just got this bill \na couple of hours ago.\n  The fact is that we have given FEMA, our emergency management \norganization--and they do a great job, by the way--we have given them \nmore money than they say they need. We could fix schools and we could \nprovide for job training for disadvantaged youth, education \ninfrastructure, and heating assistance out of the FEMA money alone.\n  What are we looking at here--they say they need $1.3 billion and they \ngot $3.2 billion. There you go. If you want to start, talk to FEMA and \nsee how much more they can give up. There is a place to offset.\n  Certainly, to take any cuts from disadvantaged young people when we \nare dealing with teen criminal activity, teen sexual activity, the \nexplosion of illegitimacy, right down the list, things we talk about on \nthe floor, and then turn around and cut job training for teenagers, I \ndo not understand.\n  Education infrastructure--kids going to schools with broken sewer \npipes. How are they supposed to learn? Is that not critical to the \nfuture of this country? Why are we taking anything from there--not to \nmention heating.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has been more than gracious and indulgent. \nI say to my colleagues and the Senator from Oregon--and I understand \nthe Senator has a job to do, and this is saying we just have to go on \ndown this track because everybody wants to go on vacation. That really \nis what this debate kind of is about. Senator Byrd, I worked every \nsingle day of last week, and I look forward to it.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator does not have a thing on this Senator when it \ncomes to work.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I know that is true. I understand everybody here \nwants to go home, and it is hard to be the one person standing up \nsaying, ``Well, let's not quite go home yet; we should talk about what \nwe are doing.''\n  Mr. BYRD. I am in no hurry to go home, but I want to make this point, \nif the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senator be permitted to yield to me \nwithout losing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, this is the bottom \nline: If we pass this bill and it becomes law, the Appropriations \nCommittee will have $6 billion more in budget authority and $3 billion \nmore in outlay for the 1996 appropriations bill, which will help the \nvery programs, I am sure, that the Senators and I feel so strongly \nabout.\n  If we do not pass this, the Appropriations Committee is going to have \n$6 billion less in budget authority when we start marking up those \nbills after we come back--$6 billion less in budget authority and $3 \nbillion less in outlay. I hope the Senators will please keep that in \nmind. That is the bottom line.\n  We may not be happy with this. The President has said that he will \nsign it. He feels that he has gained over what was the bill that was \nvetoed some time ago. And he has. The Senator from Oregon just read the \nlist of decreased rescissions.\n  I plead with Senators that it means heavier losses in your programs \nand my programs, when we mark up the 1996 appropriations bill, if this \nbill dies.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. This bill would terminate the education \ninfrastructure program. Zero dollars in this rescission bill--zero \ndollars.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, wait until the Senator sees the bills that \nare going to come to this floor if this bill dies. Wait until the \nSenator sees the cuts that are going to be made if this bill dies.\n  The cuts that are going to be made in the 1996--the Senators will \ncome back and read what I said in the Record, if the Senators insist on \nkilling this. The Senators will read it. The Senators will see that \nthis is just a drop in the bucket.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reminder that the Senator can yield for \n\n[[Page S9502]]\n  questions only during the course of this debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just one more time, to summarize. We \nreceived this bill at 9:55. That is not even 2 hours ago. I did not \nknow everything in here.\n  I am perfectly willing, as I said before, I did not object to the \nmotion to proceed. There have been a lot of questions that have been \nput to me. I am more than willing to go forward with amendments and \ndebate. I need a little time to look through this bill.\n  But, Mr. President, when my colleagues talk to me about this being \njust the beginning, I am well aware of that. I did not vote for these \nbudget cuts. I did not vote for these ceilings. I did not vote to \nincrease money for military contracts.\n  Again, the other day in the paper, the story in the paper about a \ngeneral having a plane sent across the country to pick up him and his \ncat at a cost of $100,000--that is out of the travel and administrative \naccount.\n  I did not vote for that, Mr. President. These are distorted \npriorities. And my colleague from Illinois kept saying--and I \nunderstand the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from West Virginia \nhave done their best within these boundaries that have been set by the \nvotes that are here right now. I know that.\n  But, in all due respect, we do not, in that budget resolution, decide \nwe are going to take on any of the loopholes, deductions, subsidies--\nfor example for oil companies. But we are going to cut the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program for seniors, people with disabilities, \nand children. And, in addition, summer jobs training programs. And, in \naddition, infrastructure--some small investment in infrastructure in \nschools. What kind of message do we send to children about whether we \nhave any hope for them or what kind of value do we attach to them when \nthe ceilings--the buildings are decrepit and the plumbing does not work \nand all the rest. We cannot even begin to make any kind--we are going \nto cut expenditures in that area?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, I worked hard. I had support from colleagues for a \ncounseling program for elderly people, to make sure they do not get \nripped off on supplemental coverage from Medicare. That, now, gets cut \nagain. My colleague from Oregon talked about the good things that have \nbeen done. Fine, I agree and I am glad.\n  But he did not talk about some of the areas that have now been cut as \nopposed to the original rescissions bill. I only found out about what \nhas been cut because I have had a little bit of time, just a little bit \nof time to go through this. What is the hurry? What is the hurry? I am \npleased to go through this and I am pleased, today, to introduce \namendments. I am pleased to have debate on those amendments and up or \ndown votes. But I will tell you, I will have an amendment to restore \nthat funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will.\n  Mr. DOLE. When are you going to have the amendment? That is what I \nwould like to find out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I will be ready to go with that \namendment--A, I have been responding to questions and comments from \nother Senators. I would like a little bit of time to look through this \nto get all my amendments together. But I will have amendments and we \nwill have debate.\n  Mr. President, I say to the majority leader in all due respect, this \nbill came here at 9:50. It was passed last night at 10 o'clock, in the \nHouse.\n  I am not going to let this be jammed down my throat and I am not \ngoing to let it be jammed down the throats of a lot of very vulnerable \npeople in my State. I will examine this. I am more than willing to have \namendments--I said this to the majority leader--and we will have debate \non those amendments and I am pleased to vote up or down. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the call for the regular order return \nthe regulatory reform bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just say to the Senator from Minnesota, I am not going to \nbe here all day while he is doing whatever he is doing. He has every \nright to do that, but I have listened very carefully to the two \nmanagers of the appropriations bill and I think they are trying to be \nhelpful here, saying they are going to have less money if this is \ndelayed.\n  The President wants this bill, so I ought to be happy if he does not \nget it, I assume. That would be the conventional wisdom around this \ntown. He says he wants it. He has written a letter. He sent up a \nstatement. He has added $700 and some million he said he wanted to add \nfor the very programs that have been addressed by the two Senators.\n  But it is a little late in the day for game playing. If the Senator \nis going to offer amendments, offer amendments. If not, as soon as I \nget the floor, this bill is finished. It is finished. And it will not \nbe brought up again until there is consent to bring it up without \namendment and you explain to the people in Oklahoma City and you \nexplain to the people in California and you explain to the people in \nMinnesota how you lost money on low-income home energy assistance \nbecause you would not let this bill pass.\n  You have every right to object. You are doing a good job of it. That \nis your right.\n  But I do not intend to tie up the entire Senate here the rest of the \nafternoon while somebody out here is making whatever argument they want \nto make.\n  We will bring the bill back as soon as the administration convinces \nthe Senators from Illinois and Minnesota that this is a good bill.\n  If the Democratic President cannot convince the Democrats, certainly \nwe cannot convince the Democrats.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader in \nresponse to his characterization of the Senator from Minnesota doing \nwhatever he is doing, what I am doing is being a responsible \nlegislator. This bill came to this Chamber less than 2 hours ago. I \nwould like to have the opportunity to examine this bill. I have already \nspoken about areas where I am prepared to introduce amendments and to \nhave debate.\n  There are no games here. I do not think it is a game to speak in \nbehalf of low-income people in my State who are really worried that \nthere will not be low-income energy assistance available for them. I do \nnot think it is a game to raise questions about what happened to the \ncounseling program for senior citizens to make sure they are not ripped \noff on supplemental coverage to Medicare.\n  I just realized, going through this, that now has been cut again.\n  I do not think it is a game--Mr. President, I do not think it is a \ngame to talk about what is going to happen to displaced workers. What \nis the significance of those cuts?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield in a moment.\n  Mr. President, we have now zeroed out a program for homeless vets. It \nwas not much of an appropriation, but it was important. I do not think \nit is a game to go through this piece of legislation and to highlight \nthat and raise questions about it.\n  I do not think any of this is a game. But what I find so interesting \nabout this rescissions package is that so many of the cuts seem to be \nbased upon the path of least political resistance. We did not go after \nany of the wasteful military contracts. In our budget resolution we did \nnot go after any of the subsidies for oil companies. And, in addition, \nwe have $245 billion of tax cuts mainly going to the wealthy people. \nAnd I have no assurance, by the way, over the years, as I project this, \nthat most of this money will not be used to finance tax cuts for fat \ncats in our country, taken away from the people who are the most \nvulnerable. This is no game. \n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\n  I would say to the majority leader and to my colleagues--and I will \nbe pleased to yield for a question--that I think it is a matter of \npriorities and it is a matter of what we stand for. It is a matter of \nwhat we stand for.\n  Before we just get a little bit too generous with the suffering of \nother people, do we not have an opportunity to look at what is in this? \nDo we not have a opportunity to talk about some alternatives?\n  Just speaking for myself, just let me make it crystal clear--crystal \nclear--I can take a short period of time and I can look through this \nand I will have amendments and I am ready for debate on amendments.\n  I say to the majority leader, if I had wanted to stop this I would \nhave objected to the motion to proceed. We have had a discussion about \nwhat is in here, about where the cuts have been, about other \npriorities. I am just speaking as a Democratic Senator from Minnesota. \nI know what low-income home energy assistance means to people in my \nState and I know these cuts are cruel. I did not vote for this budget \nresolution. I am going to be an advocate for those people. And I do not \ncare if they do not have any money to contribute to campaigns. I do not \ncare if they do not have any lobbyists here. I do not care if they are \nnot the heavy hitters, or are not the players, or are not well \nconnected.\n I do not care if they are without a voice. They deserve \nrepresentation. This Senator thinks the cut we had in the Senate bill \nbefore is cruel. I will have an amendment to restore that cut, and we \nwill have a debate on it. There were many Senators who supported it the \nlast time. And I hope to have support from Senators again.\n\n  I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator from Minnesota was talking about the \nsuggestion was made that somehow this was---\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor to the Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I say to the majority leader that no one is trying to be \nobstreperous.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call to the Senator's attention that under \nthe rules a Senator cannot yield the floor to another Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. In the opinion of the \nChair the Senator from Minnesota yielded the floor, and the Chair \nrecognized the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, to the Senator from West Virginia, the suggestion was \nmade that somehow or another we were just kind of fooling around here, \nand it seems to me that it really flies in the face of what is \ninvolved, and why this is so deadly serious. And to the Senator from \nKansas, I consider the cuts in the JTPA title II program for \ndisadvantaged youth very serious business. We are talking about $272 \nmillion less for a program that serves economically disadvantaged 16- \nto 21-year-olds. These are the kids that we have a chance to save. We \nhave a chance to get them educated, to give them a way out, to give \nthem jobs.\n  Specifically, you are talking about kids who are--well, I will just \nread it. Who is involved with this program? They are youngsters who are \nbasic skills deficient, school dropouts, pregnant or parenting kids, \ndisabled kids, homeless and runaway youth. I mean if we are going to \ntake $272 million out of their hide and not look for other ways, \nassuming that we have to deal with the issue of deficit reduction, the \nSenator from Kansas knows I support it. I supported a balanced budget \namendment against the wishes at the time at least of my President in \nlarge part because I know we have to get on a glidepath to fiscal \nstability.\n  So deficit reduction is very important to me. But one of the reasons \nwe are out here this morning is that, if we get off on the wrong foot \nin deficit reduction, we will be crippled thereafter in trying to \nachieve it in a way that does not destroy the fabric of this Nation. \nThat is why these issues are so vitally important. If we start off \nassuming that it is OK to let the Federal Government pay for generals \nand their cats to fly around, but we do not support funding for job \ntraining opportunities for 16- to 21-year-old disadvantaged young \npeople, what kind of way is that to balance the budget?\n  Here we are cutting, zeroing out efforts to provide money to help \nbuild up some of our nation's deteriorating schools. You cannot do much \nworse than zero. You cannot do much worse than termination. We start \ntalking about a balanced budget. I sit on the Finance Committee. How in \nthe world can you talk about tax cuts when you have bills to pay off? \nThe American people know this is just fiscal foolishness. Yet, we can \nprovide for tax cuts and then turn around and say, ``Yes. But we still \nhave to take a little whack out of the hide of poor people who get low-\nincome energy assistance.'' This is not logical.\n  I have not been around to talk about 25 years worth of battles for \nsocial justice like the Senator from Oregon can. I know I do not have \nthe parliamentary legislative skills of the Senator from West Virginia. \nBut I do know this. That as a legislator elected from the State of \nIllinois the people in my State would not want to see me just lay down \non this railroad track and get run over without saying anything.\n  While we recognize that all of our colleagues want to go home, \neverybody wants this vacation, and we do not want to be obstreperous, \nwe are not trying to be mean to anybody. At the same time what do you \ntell these teenagers when you go home, these runaways? We cannot \nprovide them with job training.\n  When we go home, what do we tell our senior citizens? ``It is \nsummertime now. Don't worry about it. It is going to be OK. Guess what? \nIf you freeze to death, we will appropriate some more money.'' I do not \nthink so. I do not think that is an appropriate response.\n  I think we have an obligation to stand on this floor and do exactly \nwhat we are doing to try to make sure that at least the American people \nknow what is happening to them. So at least this does not just kind of \nhide and slip through and end up being an ax job in the closet. So at \nleast we make the point out here that this is no way to start off \nbalancing a budget.\n  Yes. We have to balance the budget. Absolutely we have to do deficit \nreduction. I served on the President's Commission on Entitlements and \nTax Reform. We did not come away with any recommendations. But it was a \nterrific experience. It told us what kind of trouble we would be in if \nwe did not achieve a balance and a deficit reduction. So I am as \ncommitted on that issue as anybody here.\n  But I say to my colleagues that we should not start off by taking \naway money that was appropriated last year. And, by the way, I do not \nknow if that has come out in the debate, I say to Senator Wellstone. We \nare talking about rescinding money that was already appropriated last \nyear. This is not even go-forward money. This is not even what we are \ngoing to do now, that we have kind of a consensus around here on the \nbalanced budget. This is what happened last year. The bill before us \nsays, ``You have appropriated this money but we are going to take it \nback.'' In some of these areas, the numbers were below what they had \nbeen previously anyway.\n  So we are going to take it out of the hide of the young people who \nneed job training, pregnant teenagers, disabled teenagers, homeless \nteenagers, and runaway youth. We are going to take it from them.\n  We are not enforcing a sensible set of priorities with this. And I do \nnot think it is inappropriate for us to stay a little while to talk \nabout what we can do. Maybe this document can be made better. Maybe it \ncan be made better. Maybe there is some room. I do not know. I mean we \nare not on that committee. I am on the Finance Committee. I know \nSenator Wellstone is not on committees that wrote this legislation. I \nunderstand that. You cannot consult with everybody. But certainly \nSenator Wellstone, the Senator from Minnesota, used the expression, the \n``path of political expediency.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield? Actually, I said, the ``path \nof least political resistance.''\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct. ``Path of least political \nresistance.'' That is better than the ``path of political expediency.'' \nThat is correct.\n  I appreciate that correction from the Senator from Minnesota. That \nwas the expression that he used, and I think it is very well taken--\nleast political resistance. I just think that even in situations like \nthis, in which the people who sat around in the wee hours and hammered \nthis out--and again, we appreciate the effort and we know there is an \nattempt here at compromise, but at the same time I think it would be \ninappropriate for us not to discuss these issues.\n  Do we have amendments? Well, one nice thing about the Senate is that \nit is a traditional legislative body. I listen very closely to Robert \nByrd when he starts talking about this institution. I love it, too, \nbecause it allows you to be a legislator; it allows you to be a \nlawmaker; so much so that you can write an amendment down on a piece of \npaper. I would like to get it typed up. I know we do not have a whole \nlot of time. I know we are in a hurry. I have an amendment here. It is \nhandwritten. I just would like to have it typed. It would restore the \nmoney for job training of disadvantaged young people, restore the money \nfor school construction; $35 million is a drop in the bucket. It was \ncut from $100 million.\n  The original appropriation was $100 million, reduced to $35 million, \nin this bill reduced to nothing, taking back money that was \nappropriated.\n  This is not logical, it seems to me, nor is it fair, nor is it \nsensible, nor is it forward-looking, nor is it appropriate, nor does it \ncomport with our obligations to the American people. Job training \nstarted out at $398 million, reduced by $272 million. In this bill, it \nis $126 million. So that is a pretty good whack on job training for \ndisadvantaged young people.\n  I do not have the numbers. The Senator from Minnesota may have the \nnumbers on what the whack was on last year's appropriation for heating \nassistance, but the point is this is not something that I think we \nshould just roll over and not say anything about and say, well, you \nknow, it is the time, it is just open season on disadvantaged youth and \nschools and school kids and poor people who need heating assistance and \njust roll over and let this happen. I just think it is inappropriate.\n  I say to my colleagues again, this legislative body permits for this \nkind of dialog, and it would be inappropriate for us as legislators not \nto raise the issue, not to raise the question whether or not we can fix \nthis a little bit.\n  Maybe the amendments will go down. I do not know how many --I just do \nnot know. Maybe my colleagues will go lockstep on that side of the \naisle. I say to the Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, maybe his \nguys will go in lockstep because of a political agenda. Maybe the \nletter from the President means the folks on this side of the aisle \nwill go in lockstep, and we will lose. But I want everybody to know \nthat I am prepared to talk about job training for disadvantaged youth \ntoday, tomorrow, the next day, the day after that, the day after that, \nto talk about why we need to try to make certain that these kinds of \nefforts do not get the ax.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Only for a question, and I retain the right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator retains her right to the floor. She can just \nyield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes. I thank the Senator. For a question. I will \nyield for a question, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who is the Senator from Illinois yielding to?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The first question I think was asked by the \nSenator from Oregon and then the Senator from West Virginia. I will \nyield for a question from both of them.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  I was wanting to ask the question, did the Senator support the \nDaschle-Dole compromise in the rescissions package that originally \npassed the Senate?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator from Oregon has some very good staff \nmembers. Yes, I did, I supported it, but the education infrastructure \nwas not restored in that compromise.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The cut for youth job training centers was $272 \nmillion.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator supported it, and in this package it is \n$272 million, the precise same figure that the Senator supported in the \nDaschle-Dole compromise.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is true. That is correct. And I make the \npoint that procedurally that was an interim step to where we are today. \nIt was my hope always that we would be able to work toward closure and \nresolution in a way that made sense.\n  That vote was not the ultimate vote. This vote is the ultimate vote \nwith regard to fiscal year 1995 rescissions. And so I make the point to \nmy colleague----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator is correct. The Senator from West \nVirginia had a question, also.\n  Mr. BYRD. My question was based on the statement that I understood \nthe Senator to say earlier that her amendment was not typed up; it was \njust in handwriting. My question was, is she aware that an amendment \ndoes not have to be typed, that it can be sent to the desk in one's own \nhandwriting?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, yes, \nI am.\n  Mr. BYRD. And she may----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again, I think that is a wonderful thing about \nthis institution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is she also aware that she may orally state the amendment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I was not aware of that. I say to the historian of \nthe Senate, I was not aware that an oral amendment was appropriate.\n  Mr. BYRD. And if she sends it to the desk or orally states it, she \nloses the floor?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator. I was not aware of that \neither. I appreciate the counsel from the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For a question by the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I make an inquiry. Does the Senator intend to offer it or \nnot? I wish to find out--if we are just going to have a filibuster here \nwith two Senators, that is fine--so we can make other plans. If we are \ngoing to offer amendments, we hope Senators offer the amendments so we \ncan have a vote.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator. I say to the Senator from \nKansas, the majority leader, I have an amendment to offer. I have not \nyet offered it. I am looking at offering it. I would like to get it \ntyped up. I would like to have a chance to talk about the offsets and \nthe numbers and where the money is going to come from. I understand the \nSenator from Minnesota has an amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield, I have several amendments \nin exactly the areas that I was speaking about that I intend to offer \nand have debate upon, absolutely, and hope to win on them. I said that \nfrom the very beginning.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, why not offer the amendment? We \nhave been here almost 2 hours on this measure and nothing has happened \nexcept for a lot of discussion. And if the Senators are going to offer \namendments, let us offer amendments. If Senators do not mind \ndisaccommodating colleagues on that side, I am not going anywhere this \nweekend, so I will be here all weekend. It is up to Senators. If the \nPresident does not have any influence with either one of his colleagues \non that side, that is his problem. But we would like to complete the \nbill because the President would like to have it done. And I wish to \nmake the best effort I can on behalf of the President, but if I am \nthwarted by members of his own party, I am not going to spend a lot of \ntime trying to help the President. Maybe he ought to pick up the phone \nand make a couple of phone calls.\n  But in any event, if we offer the amendments, as the Senator from \nWest Virginia said, we can have a vote. It will be an amendment vote. \nAnd then we will see where we are. I do not know how many Members are \nleft. Many Members had to leave early to make plane reservations. We \nare still enough \n\n[[Page S9505]]\nhere to do business. We are prepared to do business. Let us do \nbusiness.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could respond----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For a question, yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The question is in response to the majority leader.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For a question.\n  Mr. DOLE. For a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me be clear one more time. I am \ndrafting amendments and am pleased to have the debate. But I would say \nto the majority leader, it is not a question----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois may yield for a \nquestion.\n  Does the Senator from Illinois yield, for a question, to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. To the Senator from Minnesota. I just did.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me restate it. Will the Senator from Illinois \nagree with me that when you get a bill at 9:50 in the morning and you \nhave not had any opportunity to even examine what is in that bill, that \nthe way to represent the people back in your State and the way to be a \nconscientious legislator is to, first of all, have a chance to look at \nit and then to be drafting amendments? I have several amendments, I \nwould say to the Senator, already that I am working on. But I want also \nto look at this bill to see what is in it, and I may have some others.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that that is a conscientious \napproach; it is a mistake having something come over here and go \nthrough without having a chance to look at it and have discussion and \nhave amendments?\n  Would not the Senator also agree with me that during a large part of \nthe discussion this morning we have been responding to questions from \nother colleagues? It is not as if we have just been speaking by \nourselves, only to ourselves. And we have been trying to highlight the \npriorities in this legislation. Would the Senator agree with me? Or \nsome of the distorted priorities and talking about why not some \nalternatives? Would the Senator agree that that has been what is going \non here?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would not only agree, but I would underscore the \nremarks of the Senator from Minnesota. And I do not have in front of \nme, since we just came to the floor--again we just got this bill. I did \nnot have a chance to put together the normal amounts of information. \nBut the fact is I do not understand--we are now in the position of \nbeing accused of trying to stall something. There is this hurry, hurry, \nwe have just got to pass this and it has to be today.\n We have to have this rush of what we are going to rescind from last \nyear's legislation. This process has taken a long time. It has gone \nstep by step by step. We had the vote that the Senator from Oregon \nreferred to, which I consider to be an interim step in the process, and \nwe just got this bill this morning, quite frankly.\n\n  Were it not for just some pretty fast action to even find out that \nthe JTPA youth training program was being cut by $272 million and \neducation infrastructure was being terminated and low-income heating \nassistance was being slashed--there may even be more provisions in \nthere of which we are not aware. We have not had a chance--I have been \non my feet since 10:30, almost 2 hours. I have been standing right \nhere. And I understand that it is part of the process that you have to \nstand right here, you cannot move, you cannot go to the telephone, you \ncannot stop and read things, and you cannot go through and do the kind \nof research that is required.\n  But just to ask us to rush to judgment on something as significant as \na rollback of money that was appropriated last year, and particularly \nwhen that rollback rolls over disadvantaged youth and it rolls over \npeople who want to see our schools repaired and it rolls over poor \npeople who may freeze to death next winter, we are going to roll back \nand roll over simultaneously, and we have to sit here and say, ``Oh, \nwell, we have to go along with the program. It is not appropriate for \nus to get up and yell and argue; well, on the one hand, we have been \ntold we may make it worse for those people next year. You have seen \nthese cuts. Well, it is just going to get worse.''\n  Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave her father 40 whacks. Next year it \nwill be 41, maybe even 42. Well, I am sorry. My attitude about this \nis--I am not trying to be obstreperous. I think the Senator from Kansas \nand everybody in this body knows I come out of a legislative tradition. \nI understand compromise. I understand working with people. I try to \nwork with everybody. But I will tell you, there is a point at which you \nhave to say you stand for something, and among the things we stand for \nis seeing to the disadvantaged youth, teenagers, 16-to 21-year-olds who \nare disabled, homeless, school dropouts, runaways, that they do not \ntake a $272 million whack.\n  I mean, come on. Education infrastructure. I may have to bring out \nthe pictures, I do not know. I was not looking to have to be on my feet \nthis long time, but I have the pictures sitting in the back. You have \nseen them. Most of the Members of this body, I hope, have seen them if \nthey were listening at all. We have schools falling apart. Kids are \nhaving to study next to broken sewer pipes, not to mention broken \nwindows, floorboards cracking through. I can go through--and bring out \nthe pictures --the safety and health hazards, not decoration, not \ncosmetic, but basic kinds of stuff, and it gets terminated, all $35 \nmillion.\n  It started off at $100 million and went down to $35 million. The \nSenator from Oregon asked why I voted for the previous compromise. \nWell, being a legislator, I am compromising. ``We're going to go, yes, \nit's OK, we'll cut from $100 million to $35 million because, boy, we \nhave to have shared sacrifice in this time of deficit reduction. So, \nyeah, I'll give up some of the millions of dollars, given the fact we \nhaven't invested in our schools, given the fact they are falling apart. \nBut I am prepared to make some investment in the process, to go along \nwith the program.''\n  So we went from $100 million to $35 million, and then I look up and \nit is zero in this bill. I do not think that is sensible. I do not \nthink the spirit of compromise goes to the point where you just \nstrangle yourself, or the spirit of compromise says you necessarily \nhave to just go quietly into the closet and let somebody cut you to \ndeath with a meat ax. I just do not think that is what the spirit of \ncompromise means.\n  I think there are offsets. We were talking about where is the money \ngoing to come from? Well, we looked at it just very briefly. Here is \nmoney--we give FEMA more money than they think they need. OK, it is \nimportant to have some money for emergencies sitting there, but could \nyou not do that by supplemental appropriations? We could not find a few \ndollars to put back some of the money for disadvantaged youth, for \neducation infrastructure?\n  So I ask the Senator from Minnesota--I want to applaud his \nleadership, because last night we had a conversation here on the floor \nbecause we did not know what was going to be in this bill, and the \nSenator from Minnesota said, ``Well, I am waiting to see what is going \nto be in it, because I hear some pretty bad things about it, and if it \nturns out it is as bad as I hear, I am just going to have to take to \nthe floor and object.'' I applaud him for that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield, yes, for a question.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senator may yield for a question but not \nfor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Last night, is it not the case I said to the Senator \nthat I did not know what was going to be in the bill, but what I wanted \nto have was at least an opportunity to look at it? Is it not true I \nsaid I did not want this to be steamrolled, and I also wanted to have \nan opportunity to have discussion and offer amendments to restore some \nof the cuts which I think are cruel to some of the most vulnerable \ncitizens? Is that not the gist of our discussion, which is what I \nintend to do?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is the gist of the Senator's statement to me. \n\n\n[[Page S9506]]\nI applaud him for his leadership and foresight.\n  I guess I am a little optimistic. I had hoped that the compromise \nwould mean we would not take any whacks out of kids and poor people and \nthe vulnerable population. I had hoped we had moved in the direction of \nsaying, ``Well, we pushed it this far, we are going to leave education \nfunding like it is, we are going to leave job training like it is, we \nare not going to fool around and take any more out of the people who \nneed heating assistance, money to help heat their homes in communities \nlike the Senator's and like mine.''\n  The Senator from Minnesota was talking with the Chair earlier about \nhow the wind chill gets to be 70 below in Minnesota. I do not know the \nlast time the Senator from Minnesota visited Chicago and Lake Michigan \nin the dead of winter, January. It gets so cold people say its the hawk \ncoming off the lake, and what looks on the thermometer to be 10 below \nfeels more like 50 below. There are a lot of senior citizens, a lot of \nsenior citizens who live on fixed incomes who do not have the ability \nto heat their homes in the winter, to withstand that. Will the Senator \nfrom Minnesota advise the Senator from Illinois, what is the cut on \nhome heating assistance?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator from Illinois \nthat she can only yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is the Senator's understanding based upon the \nanswer that I am about to give to the Senator that it is about $320 \nmillion, or so, of cuts. And does the Senator understand that what \nhappened was that on the Senate side, when we voted for this \nrescissions package, I voted for it? We had restored the full funding, \nthough the House had eliminated the whole program. I have strong \nsupport, letters that I have here when we get to the debate on the \namendment from the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee \nthat we would hold firm in our position. But now we have over $300 \nmillion of additional cuts that just came to us late last night.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that in terms of priorities, what is \nthe hurry? Would the Senator agree with me in terms of the focus we \nkeep getting this pressure about hurry, hurry, hurry? Why are we in \nsuch a hurry to cut low-income energy assistance for elderly people, \npeople with disabilities, people with children?\n What is the hurry to do that? Would the Senator be able to answer that \nquestion for me?\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, there is an answer, I say to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. There is an answer, and the answer is: Vacation, I \nthink.\n  I think the answer is that folks want to go home. The answer is, the \ndeal is cut, the deck is stacked, this game has moved on down, talk \nabout games. This train is on the track and, unfortunately, people who \nare concerned about $272 million cuts in job training for disadvantaged \nyoung people and who are concerned about $319 million cuts in heating \nassistance for poor people, and are concerned about termination of the \nprogram altogether to fix the schools--well, our bodies are just here \non the track. Guess what? Our bodies being on the track is considered \nto be an annoyance. That is the phenomenal thing about it.\n  We are talking about substantive issues, and the response is that we \nare getting in the way, we are an annoyance. It is annoying to talk \nabout homeless teenagers who will not get job assistance. It is \nannoying to talk about senior citizens found frozen to death. You know \nand I know, as well, that you get these stories every winter. It is \nannoying to talk about young people sitting up in classrooms, expected \nto learn. Goals 2000 calls on all Americans to reach certain \neducational levels by the year 2000. How can you expect a child to \nlearn when he is sitting there trying to study English next to a broken \nsewer pipe? How can you expect him to get on the information \nsuperhighway when there is only one plug in the classroom and it does \nnot work? But that is an annoyance to talk about that, and it is an \nannoyance to get in the way of the program. Heaven forbid that we stand \non the train track while this train is coming down and raise these \nissues.\n  I tell you, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, I do not know \nwhat the hurry is. I do not know why we could not have time to--I \nunderstand the procedures. If you want to talk about these issues and \nthe train is on the track, you have to actually stand on your feet in \nthe Senate Chamber and talk about it and, no, you do not get a chance \nto sit down and read the bill. It is called a done deal. Do not pay \nattention to the details. But, you know, I would like very much to pay \nattention to the details. I would love to read that bill.\n  You know the old expression, ``The devil is in the details.'' Quite \nfrankly, I am glad I found them on two of them. I caught them trying to \ntake $272 million out of job training for young people. I caught them \ntrying to take money out of LIHEAP. There are probably more, I do not \nknow. I look forward to a chance to do it.\n  But, as the Senator from West Virginia advises, our amendments--I say \n``ours'' because I know the Senator from Minnesota, who actually has \nprecedence in that regard since he was here before I was, has some \namendments. And I have two--at least two. That is based on what I have \nseen so far.\n  I have not had a chance to read the whole thing. I am sorry, I say to \nthe majority leader; we are not trying to be obstreperous. We are not. \nI do not mean to annoy. I do not. I really care passionately about \nthese issues and what happens to these kids, and what happens to these \nold people. I do not know what else to do, unless the negotiators are \nwilling to take the amendments or fix the compromise. There is money in \nthere to do it with.\n  Like I said, this bill would give FEMA almost $1.9 billion more than \nthey say they need. I hope they will not need it. If anything, the \nmoney that FEMA needs is for disasters. We had a terrible thing happen \nin Illinois. We had flash floods down in southern Illinois, following \nthe floods of 1992. FEMA is doing a great job and nobody wants to \nimpair them. But to give them more money than they say they need does \nnot make a lot of sense to me, either. We can pay for these programs \nout of that.\n  Again, not being on the committee, I do not mean to be a Monday \nmorning quarterback. I know the committee members worked hard and they \nmeant well. But you cannot start off this balanced budget march by \nstepping on the feet of disadvantaged kids and senior citizens who need \nheating, and school systems that need windows repaired. You cannot \nstart off down this road.\n  If we start taking back money from last year in this regard and then \nwe go to reconciliation and the appropriations process this year and \nmake it worse, by the time we achieve a balanced budget, we will have \nblown our country's fabric out of the water. I do not know about you--\nagain, I guess because I am still on my feet and I have to stay on my \nfeet--I do not know about you, but sometimes I watch--I have a teenage \nson. My son, Matthew, is 17 now. His generation watches a lot of these \nfuturistic movies. So I get a chance to see some of this stuff.\n  I am appalled by the vision of the future that they have. Societies \nwith people living in rusted-out cars and alleys, and the very rich \nwith the corporations running the countries, with the very rich up here \nand the very poor, everybody else, digging in garbage cans. That is the \nvision they have. And then here we are today saying that teenagers and \nrunaways and dropouts and homeless youth 16 to 21, take that $272 \nmillion--the only thing that gives them any job training hope.\n  Are we buying into that vision? I hope not. We talk about making it \nan opportunity society. How are you going to make it an opportunity \nsociety if you do not say our kids are our priority, jobs are our \npriority? We want to give people the ability to be productive. How do \nyou do that? I guess there are some here. I think one of the secrets in \nall this budget stuff --some of my colleagues use the term ``defense \nspending.'' It is not really defense spending; it is military spending. \nLord knows that everybody wants to be patriotic, and we all want to \nstand by a strong military, because it is still a dangerous world out \nthere. We want to give them what they need to work with. \n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\n  So one side of the budget goes to those activities--whether there is \na firewall, real or not, there. One side of the budget goes to those \nactivities, and the other side has to feed on itself. So we are pitting \nsenior citizens against kids. That is no approach. That is no approach.\n  Our social fabric depends on our ability to provide jobs. We should \nbe able to provide job training for our young people. The Senator from \nOregon said, ``You voted for the first compromise.'' Well, yes, \neverybody will probably have to give up a little something this time, \nbecause we have these huge deficits and we have to get past them. We \nhave to get on a sound fiscal footing. Yes, we are all going to have to \ntighten our belts a little.\n  But that means shared sacrifice. It does not mean tax cuts--tax \ncuts--tax cuts on the one hand and cuts in investment in people on the \nother. This is not logical. This is not logical.\n  You say we have to do this to comport with the budget resolution. \nWell, okay, but the budget resolution is what has the tax cuts in it; \nand, parenthetically, tax hikes on people who make less than $28,000.\n  How can we maintain the fabric of this Nation if we are going to \nexacerbate income disparities like that, if we are going to eat away at \npeople's hope like that, if we are going to buy into the future of the \nmovies that Matt's friends look at? How can we do that?\n  Again, that is why I am on the floor, and I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota for a question at this time. But that is why we are on \nthe floor here. No, it is not fun to be seen as a ``sticky wicket'' \nperson in the way, standing on the train track, about to get run over. \nIt is not fun. But I do not have a problem doing it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Two questions: First of all----\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Illinois has lost the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I have done that. I yielded for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator must stay on her feet.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. During the question, while he is responding to my \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. If the Senator does sit again, the Chair \nwill assume that she has relinquished the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair for that courtesy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have two questions.\n  First of all, I assume the Senator realizes how pleased I am that the \nSenator is out here speaking with me. These are very important issues, \nas the Senator realizes, and it is very important to be out here \nspeaking on these concerns.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. To the Senator from Minnesota, I not only realize \nhow important it is, but I have just been told I cannot even sit down, \nso it is going to get tougher by the minute. I understand that.\n  I think that the sacrifice of standing on my feet, however many hours \nthis is going to take, pales in comparison to the sacrifice of that \nconstituent the Senator read about and talked about this morning who \nmay not be able to pay for heating in the winter in Minnesota, which is \nalmost a fate too horrible to contemplate. Being on my feet pales in \ncomparison to those teenage runaways, disabled teenagers, school \ndropouts, homeless teenagers, 16- to 21-year-olds.\n  Standing on my feet helps to save and give them some hope, and to \npreserve some portion of rationality in this debate about whether they \nare a priority or not. I am prepared to do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield for another question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator was talking about tax cuts. Is the Senator \naware that this rescissions package, beyond the first round of about $5 \nbillion in cuts, the real issue is what happens in the years to follow \nin the outlays?\n  Does the Senator understand that if we extend this to the future, \nthat actually some of this money that is cut could very well be used--\nin other words, some of the money that is cut--for nutrition, for fuel \nassistance programs, for elderly people, or for that meat for children, \nfor the job training program, for education, for counseling assistance \nto older people to make sure they do not get ripped off by supplemental \ninsurance policies to Medicare? Does the Senator realize that actually \nsome of that money, as we look down the pike, some of these cuts, this \nmoney could be used to actually finance the tax cuts which go \ndisproportionally to people on the top?\n  In other words, what could be going on here if this is the first \nround, where the rubber meets the road, we have priority programs \nextremely important to the most vulnerable citizens. Does the Senator \nrealize this money could be used to finance tax cuts for fat cats in \nthe country, the most affluent people?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, not only am I aware of it, I say to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, I serve on the Senate Finance Committee, \nand I am very much concerned about, again, the direction. I think that \nis probably the most significant thing about where we are with this \nbill.\n  This bill relates to last year's money, really--the appropriations \nhappened last year. I am just afraid if we go forward and say that it \nis okay to cut JTPA, education infrastructure, and LIHEAP, assistance \nfor seniors, if we start off that way, it is just going to get worse.\n  Mr. DOLE. Does the Senator intend to offer an amendment or talk the \nrest of the afternoon?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. We have amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. When does the Senator intend to offer the amendments?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Talking about a timeframe?\n  Mr. DOLE. We have been on this 2\\1/2\\ hours. The Senator could have \nread the dictionary in 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I have not been able to sit down.\n  Mr. DOLE. Please do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Perhaps the Senator from Illinois could respond to my \nconcerns. I have amendments. I have said that all along.\n  The question is whether there could be an agreement. Maybe we could \nwork this out where we could have some assurance that I do not \nintroduce the amendment, and right away the majority leader tables it. \nI would want there to be time for debate.\n  Will the Senator from Illinois agree that we are interested in that \nassurance? Otherwise, what could happen, we could introduce amendments \nand immediately they could be tabled. I wonder whether the Senator from \nIllinois would agree to move on to amendments; that it is critically \nimportant that there is agreement we have time to debate the \namendments. Otherwise, we will introduce the amendments and the \nmajority leader will rise to the floor and move to table, and we will \nnot have any discussion at all.\n  Does the Senator agree that is critical?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think so. That would be very important. The \nwhole idea is to get a vote on these amendments and to get some \ndiscussion on these amendments. I am prepared to put the amendments \ndown if we can get that kind of an understanding with the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I cannot yield to the majority leader, but I could \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. DOLE. You could yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No, I cannot.\n  I say to the majority leader, I would love to yield the floor. I \nwould love to introduce my amendments. I would love to move this \nprocess forward. I am not looking forward to just standing here and \ntalking--I would.\n  But I think the problem is, because I am kind of stuck in this spot, \nI have not been able to have a discussion about any time arrangement or \nwhether or not we will be able to have discussion and a vote on the \namendments, including Senator Wellstone's.\n  So I am searching for a way, within the context of the Senate rules, \nthat I can reach some kind of understanding regarding the procedure \nwithout losing my rights to the floor. \n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\n  Senator Wellstone, and I think appropriately--is right. I think at \nthis point, the majority leader, as always, has an interest in moving \nforward on this. I cannot imagine he would keep us from having a real \nvote and debate on this amendment. So I will yield to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would say, the Senator from Illinois \ncannot yield to the Senator from Kansas. She can yield for a question \nor she can yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thought we had been debating the \namendments the last 2 hours. I have listened to debate on the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program and counseling program and the \njob training program now for 2 hours. I do not know how much debate we \nneed. I think everybody understands precisely what the issues are.\n  I am prepared to offer the amendment myself. I will offer the \namendment. I will offer it all in one amendment, move to table the \namendment, and there will be a vote on the amendment, if that satisfies \nthe Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Illinois. We want to \nbring this to a conclusion.\n  Again, let me repeat, I have a couple of options. I understand the \nPresident may be trying to reach you on the telephone. That is an \noption I had not thought of--because I can reach you right on the \nfloor.\n  This has become the President's bill. He is concerned about the \npeople who suffered in Oklahoma City. He is concerned about the people \nwho suffered in earthquakes in California--as he should be. I think \nthere are 39 States affected by disasters that are going to be affected \nby this bill, and we are still going to save $9.2 billion. It is a $16 \nbillion bill; we spend about $6.8--but we still save about $9.2 \nbillion.\n  I have one option, just to call for the regular order, which brings \nback the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. The other option \nis just go out of here, adjourn, recess. I will not bring this bill up \nagain until there is an agreement it will be brought up without any \namendments and we will have a vote on it.\n  But if the two Senators want to frustrate their own President, I do \nnot know why I should complain. Maybe I ought to be happy about it.\n  But I am concerned. This whole thing should have been settled about \n30 days ago. We have been waiting 30 days, the White House has been \nnegotiating with the House and the Senate--it has not been in secret. \nEverybody has known it. It has been brought up in our caucus. I am \ncertain the Democrats discussed it in their caucus.\n  It is no surprise when something comes to the floor and it is \nsomething Senators had not read. If people voted on only things they \nread around here it might be a lot better because we would not have so \nmany votes. But I suggest we have reached a point where we are either \ngoing to pass this bill or we are going to pull it down. That is going \nto be up to the Senators from Illinois and Minnesota. They have every \nright to do what they are doing. I do not quarrel--I do quarrel with \nthe course they are following, because I think it is going to mean we \nare probably not going to pass this bill. It is not going to go to the \nPresident.\n  I do not want there to be any illusion we are going to jump on this \nbill as soon as we come back and give them all the time they want for \ndebate. It is not going to happen. We are going to be on regulatory \nreform and we are going to stay on regulatory reform, and after that we \nwill be on something else. And the longer we wait, the less money we \nsave in this bill. Maybe that is the strategy of the two Senators. If \nyou can wait until the end of the fiscal year, we do not save any \nmoney. But neither do you help the victims in Oklahoma City or the \nvictims in California or the victims in some 37 or 38 other States who \nhave been hit by disasters. Nor do you, as pointed out by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from Oregon, the two experts here on \nappropriations--in effect, you are going to be hurting the people in \nyour own States, in Illinois, Minnesota, Kansas, Montana, Washington, \nNew Hampshire, wherever, by frustrating and by delaying this bill.\n  I do not know how many Senators are left in town. I think that is \nprobably another strategy the two Senators have used. I hope there are \n51. But if the two Senators will permit me to, I can offer an \namendment, one amendment that would cover everything they have raised; \nhave one vote. We would have low-income home energy assistance, the \ncounseling program, and job training--have one vote on that. I would \noffer the amendment, then I would move to table my own amendment. But \nyou would have a vote. You would have made your case. You would have \nfought for principle. And you may succeed. I am not certain.\n  But my view is--I think the Democratic leader shares this view--we \nneed to move very quickly. We have had 2\\1/2\\ hours. We have had a lot \nof debate. There has been a lot of debate. I think all these amendments \nhave been debated. I do not know why we need additional debate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. BURNS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have got to take a trip to examine----\n  Mr. BURNS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Flood damage in Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call is in progress.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, a number of us, including the two leaders, \nhave been trying to figure out some way to accommodate those who have \nconcerns about this bill. But I do not think it is going to happen.\n  So I am going to propound a unanimous-consent request, the two \nSenators can object to that, and then I will ask for the regular order \nand put us back on another bill.\n  Let me just say, I am not going to bring up the rescissions bill \nagain until there is an agreement we will pass it without any votes. We \nare trying to accommodate the President of the United States. We are \ntrying to accommodate the House, which passed this bill late last \nnight. More important, we are trying to accommodate people in Oklahoma \nCity who suffered a tremendous tragedy, and a lot of this money would \ngo to help in that area. We are trying to accommodate the people in \nCalifornia who suffered earthquakes. We are trying to accommodate \npeople in 39 other States who have had disaster problems.\n  Here we are on the floor talking about adding $5.5 billion, or x \ndollars, which can be done in later appropriations bills or \nsupplementals. This debate does not make any sense to me, and I have \nbeen around here a long time.\n  Obviously, two Senators on a Friday before a recess can frustrate \nanything, and they have discovered that, and I commend them for it, \nbecause now they know every time there is a recess, on a Friday, they \ncan say ``Oh, I can't let this pass, I feel strongly about this.''\n  We all feel strongly about this, but ask somebody in Oklahoma City \nand ask somebody in California or ask the President of the United \nStates if we should pass this bill, and he would say yes.\n  We have dawdled around here for 3 hours. All these things have been \ndebated. It is obvious that the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota do not want anything to happen. They can object. But do \nnot come around and say you want to bring the bill up after the recess. \nIt is not going to happen. \n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \noffer an amendment to the pending bill for Senators Wellstone and \nMoseley-Braun, the text of which restores the LIHEAP funding, adds back \n$5.5 billion for insurance counseling, $35 billion for education, and \nrestores $272 million for Job Training Partnership, and that there be \n10 minutes for debate divided between Senators Wellstone and Moseley-\nBraun, at the conclusion of which time the Senate will proceed to vote; \nthat the bill then be advanced to third reading, and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, all without intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object. First of all, let me, \none more time, make it crystal clear, Mr. President, that I have an \nobjection to the characterization of discovering on Friday that you can \nstall. I have been working on the Low-income Housing Energy Assistance \nProgram for a long, long time, as each of my colleagues knows. This is \na critically important issue to some of the most vulnerable citizens in \nmy State of Minnesota, a cold weather State.\n  Second of all, Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want \nto make it very clear that when it comes to assistance for California \nand Oklahoma City, in no way, shape, or form do I intend to be held \nhostage to that, Mr. President. We are all for that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I call for the regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President----\n  Mr. DOLE. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me again state this, so there will not be any \nmisunderstanding by the Senators from Illinois and Minnesota.\n  The next time we bring up the rescissions bill it will be by a \nunanimous-consent agreement, without any amendments, and with very \nlittle debate. They can continue to frustrate this Senate on a Friday \nafternoon all year long. That is fine with me, because I have to be \nhere anyway.\n  I think they are doing a disservice to hundreds of thousands of \npeople across America to make a political point. They have that right. \nEverybody makes political points on the Senate floor. And to say they \nare not making a political point, I think, would be a stretch.\n  Where was all the debate when the conference report was passed? Where \nhas been all the concern in the last few days? These Senators know, as \nwell, that this has been undergoing intense scrutiny with the White \nHouse, the Democratic and Republican leadership, and they finally got \ntogether. The President says pass it. I read his statements a couple of \ntimes, the statement of the administration.\n  Two Senators can frustrate anything. It is too late to file cloture; \nit is Friday afternoon, which they knew. But that is their right. I do \nnot want to take any rights away from anybody. The day may come when \nthey are trying to pass something on a Friday and somebody will jump up \nand say they cannot do this. That is the way it goes from time to time.\n  So I am disappointed. I apologize that we could not pass this bill. I \napologize to the many people who will be suffering in the interim \nbecause of the efforts by our colleagues. But I cannot change that. \nThey have every right to do what they have done. They objected to the \nimmediate consideration.\n  Apparently, they did not really want to vote on the amendments in the \nfirst place. They had a chance to have a vote on all the amendments. We \ncould have had a vote, but after 3 hours of wasted time, they did not \nwant to vote and they objected.

Mr. President, I shall be very brief and will be \nfollowed by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, let me try to give the morning and part of this \nafternoon some context. We had a bill, which was about 120 pages long, \ncome over from the House at about 9 o'clock today. This was the \nrescissions package voted on about 10 o'clock last night in the House \nof Representatives. It is my really strong view as a Senator that it is \nimportant to be able to review legislation, especially when we are \ntalking about the cuts that directly affect people's lives. Sometimes, \nMr. President, we get into the statistics and numbers and we forget the \nfaces.\n  I had voted for the rescissions package passed out of the Senate \nearlier. I voted against the conference report because of changes that \nhad been made. It is no secret to any Senator in here that I feel \nespecially strongly, as do many other Senators feel very strongly, \nabout several programs--but it is not programs. It is really about \npeople.\n  I spoke about the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and I \nhad an amendment and wanted to introduce an amendment that would have \nrestored about a 20-percent cut in the LIHEAP. In my State of Minnesota \nthere are 110,000 households and 300,000 people who are depending on \nthis. I come from a cold weather State. It is a small grant, but for \nmany people it is the difference between heating and eating.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Idaho, because I \nknow what kind of Senator he is and I think we respect each other \nwhether we agree or disagree, I met with people in their living rooms. \nI saw the fear in their eyes. I know how strongly these people depend \non this assistance, especially in such a cold weather State. And I said \nI would fight for these people, and that is what I have done. Because \nwhat happened last night in this final package is that we did not have \nthe original Senate version, but we cut it 20 percent, some $315 \nmillion.\n  In addition, I fought for a counseling program for elderly people, to \nmake sure they could not be ripped off. It was consumer protection. \nThis was coverage that people asked for in addition to Medicare, to \nfill in the gap.\n  Then I discovered there were some additional cuts in dislocated \nworker programs. The Senator from Illinois spoke eloquently, of course, \nabout a program she had worked on, just a small amount of money for \nschool infrastructure, for kids.\n  So what I said today was I wanted the opportunity to go through this \nbill. I wanted an opportunity to talk about it. I wanted an opportunity \nto introduce amendments. The first amendment would have been offset, \nand I gave examples of some of the waste in the travel administrative \nbudget in defense. That money would have been transferred so we would \nnot have the same cut in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  I must say, Mr. President, looking at this in a slightly larger \ncontext, I find it unconscionable. Really, what we might be talking \nabout, as we extend this rescissions bill into the future--this is a \ngrim precedent of where we are going, since this is where the rubber \nmeets the road. We could be seeing the cuts in the outyears for low-\nincome energy assistance, for children, for education, for counseling \nfor seniors to make sure they do not get ripped off with health \ninsurance--all used to finance tax cuts that go in the main to wealthy, \nhigh-income people. Cuts in programs for dislocated workers, job \ntraining, you name it. All in the name of tax cuts? We do not go after \nany of the subsidies for the oil companies but we cut low-income energy \nassistance? We do not go after any of the military contractors, any of \nthe waste there, but we make cuts in low-income energy assistance, job \ntraining programs for kids, counseling programs for elderly people, for \nconsumer protection.\n  To me it was unacceptable.\n  I just want to respond to one or two points that the majority leader \nmade, and then I will conclude my remarks.\n  This was not something just done on Friday. I just got this bill. I \nam not going to be bulldozed over as a Senator. I want to look and see \nwhat is in this piece of legislation. That is the responsible thing to \ndo. And it certainly is true that those people, be they elderly people \nwith disabilities, be they children, working poor people who are \naffected by low-income energy assistance may not have all the clout and \nmake all the money and make all the contributions, deserve \nrepresentation here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The cuts, I believe, are unconscionable. So this was not something I \njust come to on Friday. This has been a priority issue for me as a \nSenator from a cold weather State where many people are affected by \nthese cuts for a long, long time. And will continue to be so.\n  Second, I care fiercely about the assistance for people in Oklahoma \nand California. We will be back to this bill. We all know it. Of \ncourse, we will be back to this bill. And, of course, there will be \nrelief, and I have voted for that relief and will continue to do so. We \nall know we are going to be back on this piece of legislation--and we \nmust. I hope there will be some discussion in the meantime and we can \nwork out some reasonable compromise.\n  Finally, I have the utmost respect for the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Oregon, and certainly for the Senator from West Virginia. \nBut as to what happens in the future, we cannot be bound by the \npriorities and the parameters of what the House of Representatives is \ndoing in these kinds of budget resolutions. We can make changes next \nyear. I just simply tried to say today, and I will say it over and over \nagain--I will shout it from the mountain top, from the floor of the \nSenate, if that is what is necessary--that these are distorted \npriorities. To ask some of the most vulnerable citizens in this country \nto tighten their belts when they cannot, to cut low-income energy \nassistance for people in my State, a cold weather State, and not even \nlook for offsets? Not to restore that kind of funding? That is \nunacceptable to me.\n  So, I have no doubt that we will be back on this.\n  My final point would have been that by amendment, I would have on the \nfirst amendment talked about other \n\n[[Page S9511]]\nStates, the number of people affected in Missouri, in Kansas, or in \nMinnesota by low-income housing energy assistance, or Illinois. I would \nhave laid out some important data. I would have talked about real \npeople who are behind these statistics, and I would have talked about \noffsets.\n  But in all due respect to the majority leader to come out at the end \nand say: I will roll them all into one amendment and have 10 minutes \nand then move to table--I do not legislate that way. I do not know too \nmany Senators who really find that acceptable when it is the issue you \nhave been working on for the people you are trying to represent.\n  So I hope that we will be back on this bill right away, and we will \ngo forward with the discussion. I hope that we can work out a \nsatisfactory agreement. In any case, I intend to keep on speaking and \nkeep on fighting, not with malice, not with bitterness, but with \ndignity, and face the policy that I honestly believe in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, this morning has been difficult for all of us. But I \nhave to say that particularly when some of the pages came over and \nspoke to me a while ago, I could not help but be reminded of how it is, \nparticularly in this U.S. Senate, in this legislative body, that one \nperson really can make a difference.\n  And if a person, a Senator, cares deeply about something, then that \nSenator has the right and the opportunity to make the case, to make a \npoint, and to raise the issue. Sometimes in raising the issue, it \nresults in change. Sometimes it does not. But certainly, raising the \nissue is of primary and critical importance.\n  I have not been here long enough. But, at the same time, I am a \nSenator, and I was elected by my State. I am called on to be the voice \nfor the people who sent me here, and to stand up for interests and \nconcerns of the voters and citizens of my State.\n  I believe that it is of real importance to raise the fact that the \ndecisions in this bill represent misplaced priorities, that it ought to \nhave been changed, and that the priorities represented ought to have \nbeen changed. I mean no disrespect to my colleagues on the committee \nwho came up with this compromise--I know they worked hard and I know \nthey felt strongly and feel strongly about the particulars in this \nbill. But if anything, that is what legislation represents--ideas. That \nis what it is. It is an idea. If the idea has a flaw in it, then I \nthink it is our obligation to get up and say there is something wrong \nwith it.\n  That is why I came to the floor this morning with Senator Wellstone. \nI have and will continue to say that it is wrong to take money away \nfrom job training opportunities for our disadvantaged teenagers. I \nthink it is wrong to take money away from senior citizens who may need \nheating assistance. I think it is wrong to say we are not going to \nstart fixing up some of the schools that make it almost impossible for \nstudents to learn.\n  I also thought that while there are some things about this bill that \nwere good, that we could find the money to take care of these \npriorities.\n  I came to the Senate floor with Senator Wellstone to try to offer \nsome amendments. But, as you know, the procedures are sometimes \nconvoluted; the procedures are sometimes complex.\n  The bottom line result was that we were not given an opportunity to \nactually have a vote on our amendments in the context of the amendment \nprocess, and the bill was pulled.\n  I thought we could go to the bill. I think Senator Wellstone is \nright, that the bill will come back, that we will have another shot at \nit at some point in time if, indeed, this is the will of the \nleadership. I certainly did not want--and I know Senator Wellstone did \nnot want--to annoy anybody or to put anybody out or to impair anybody's \nplans for vacation. But we have a responsibility, it seems to me, to do \neverything that is within our power to speak to the ideas that get \nfloated around here as legislation.\n  I think this is one of those critical moments, as we start the debate \nof what kind of march are we going to take down that road to deficit \nreduction, we must also engage in the debate of how are we going to \nmarch down that road? Are we going to march down that road together, as \nAmericans with a shared sacrifice and everybody pitching in, or are we \ngoing to march down that road stepping on the backs of the feet of the \nteenagers, the senior citizens, the poor, the vulnerable, and the \npeople who cannot necessarily speak for themselves?\n  I tell you, Mr. President, that I believe what happened here this \nmorning, I hope that what happened here this morning, will help to \nshape the debate about how we go about achieving deficit reduction and \nhow we get on that glidepath to a balanced budget; and that, in having \ncome out here and exercised our rights as legislators, that Senator \nWellstone and I reached our colleagues on the television sets in their \noffices, or wherever they are right now, that we reached some people to \nsuggest that as we go down that path, we have to go down that path in a \nway that recognizes that our future as Americans is inextricably wound \ntogether and that we cannot, we must not, take more sacrifice from one \ngroup than another; that the contributions ought to be based on the \nability to contribute; that we do not call on people who are already \nhanging on by their fingernails, call on the least able in our society \nto give the most; and that we can achieve this glidepath recognizing \nthat investment in our people is the single most important investment \nwe can make as Americans.\n  That I think is what this debate this morning was really about, or \nwhat we hoped it would be about. I had hoped to offer two amendments. \nSenator Wellstone also had amendments. We did not get that chance. But \nI know we will have a chance to do so. I hope we will have a chance to \ndo so on this legislation or some other legislation as we go down this \nprocess, as we move toward adjournment.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, as we approach these issues, \nlet us recognize that really we do have an obligation to talk to one \nanother and to try to work these issues out in a way that is fair to \nall Americans--not just some Americans, but every American--including \nthose who do not have the wherewithal to weigh in with lobbyists and \nthe like.\n  I thank the Chair very much, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes under the previous unanimous consent order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9510-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9511-S9512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE RESCISSIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nmake comments about the rescissions bill which has been before us but \nwhich has been withdrawn from consideration as a result of the \nunwillingness on the part of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota to allow amendments to be voted on.\n  Just moments ago, the Senator from Illinois said that there were \namendments which she had prepared which she hoped she would have the \nopportunity to submit. I recall this morning having listened to the \nleader ask specifically that amendments be submitted. He asked not only \nthat the Senator from Illinois submit amendments for consideration but \nasked that the Senator from Minnesota submit amendments for \nconsideration. Over and over again, they would deny that they wanted to \nsubmit amendments; they would refuse to submit amendments.\n  Then I saw the leader, the majority leader, come to this podium and \nsay I have heard the debate and I will craft an amendment which will \nreflect the concerns of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nMinnesota, and I will submit that amendment so that we can have a vote \nso that the Senate can express itself in regard to the amendment, if I \ncan have unanimous consent to do that.\n  The objections which were heard in this Chamber at that time were the \nobjections from the very Senators who now say they were deprived of an \nopportunity to forward such concerns and have a vote on their concerns. \n\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\n  I find that to be confusing, and it is troublesome because every \neffort was made and every deference was given to those individuals in \nthis Chamber to submit their own amendments.\n  Then absent their own capacity to submit their amendments, the \nmajority leader generously offered to formulate and submit an amendment \nin their behalf so that there could be a vote reflecting those \nconcerns, and they simply refused to allow those concerns to be \nreflected in an amendment.\n  I want the Record to be clear on this. Mr. President, the majority \nleader made the opportunity clear and made it expansive for amendments \nto be provided here. No amendments were offered.\n  Second, when the majority leader himself offered in their behalf an \namendment and needed unanimous consent in order to so do, they objected \nto that amendment.\n  It is clear to me that the opportunity for amending the rescissions \npackage was thorough and substantial, and that the majority leader bent \nover backwards in order to make those concerns not available as \nopportunities but to put them in a position and posture whereupon they \ncould be voted. But the objection to that procedure was, in fact, made \nby those individuals who had later protested that they had not had the \nopportunity.\n  Let me just say that we have worked on this issue since early this \nmorning, and that the rescissions bill is a bill, the content of which \nis well known. In general, it restores $772 million of proposed \nrescissions and cuts an additional $794 million in the fiscal year 1995 \nappropriations, for a total rescissions of $16.4 billion. It passed the \nHouse by a vote of 276 to 151.\n  The suggestion by individuals in this Chamber that you could not know \nwhat was in this bill, that there had been inadequate information or \ntime for consideration, I do not believe, is an accurate suggestion.\n  The restored funding included $225 million for safe drinking water, \n$105 million to the so-called AmeriCorps volunteer program. That is \nwhat it costs us just in this bill in increased funding over our \nprevious effort at rescissions to support the President's so-called \nvolunteer program in which he pays each volunteer $15,000 a year. Of \ncourse, then it requires a $15,000 commitment to the bureaucracy to \nsupport that volunteer program.\n  There was $220 million in safe/drug free schools restored funding in \nthis rescissions package; $120 million in education and job training \nthat was restored in this rescissions package over the previous \nrescissions package.\n  It was interesting to hear objection raised that we are somehow \ndepriving opportunities for job training, and the Senator from \nMinnesota said this was an unconscionable bill. I wonder if that is the \nway he views his President's recommendation that this bill be passed \nand assurance that he would sign the bill if the bill were to be \npresented to him.\n  When the Senator from Illinois talked about job training, I wonder if \nshe was referring to the fact that $120 million was restored in this \nbill in the area of job training and that there was $102 million in \ncommunity development block grants, and that this measure as a matter \nof fact had $39 million as an increase in the 1995 appropriations in \nmiscellaneous housing, community and education programs.\n  Well, I could go on and on. Much was said this morning about a \ngeneral who had spent $100,000 moving an airplane and asking that he be \ntransported, and I do not think we ought to have generals abusing air \ntravel privileges. That is why I think we ought to support this \nrescissions bill. This rescissions bill cuts $375 million in Government \nadministration travel. We need to cut that. We need to delete that. And \nyet under the guise of complaining about travel abuses we have stopped \nthe consideration of a bill which would cut $375 million in Government \nadministrative travel.\n  I believe that the efforts have been counterproductive in this \nChamber today. I believe that they have failed to achieve the purposes \nwhich they have stated--as a matter of fact, they have turned in on \nthemselves. And the very things they said they sought to assist--job \ntraining, cutting abuses, travel abuses in the administration--as a \nmatter of fact, would have been addressed in this rescissions bill, but \nwe were simply denied the opportunity to consider them today.\n  They talked about LIHEAP, the energy program. What we really need to \ntalk about today is the fact that we must make progress toward bringing \nGovernment spending into balance with Government resources, and in \norder to do that we are going to have to make some cuts. We are going \nto have to make some adjustments.\n  We are looking at the Fourth of July. That is Independence Day. We \nshould be thinking about legislation in the context of independence. We \nshould be thinking about legislation in the context of freeing \nourselves from debt. This was an opportunity to free ourselves from \nexpenditures totaling $9.3 billion, with a consensus reached by House \nleaders, by Senate leaders, by the White House, some way that we could \nbegin to get a handle on the deficit, and we were refused.\n  One of the reasons is there is no willingness to cut the so-called \nLIHEAP program. Let us look at what LIHEAP represents.\n  Back in the 1970's, when energy prices more than doubled, there was a \nspecial program to take the sting out of the massive increase in energy \ncosts. This was a special program to help people buy fuel oil for their \nhomes. The price for energy now has gone below where it was before the \ncrisis. And yet while the energy price has gone down, the LIHEAP \nprogram has gone up and up and up.\n  Eventually, if we are going to do what the people of this great \nNation sent us here to do--and that is to get Government under \ncontrol--we are at least going to have to look carefully at programs, \nthe need for which is no longer existent but which grow as a result of \nthe fact that bureaucrats who want to buy the favor of citizens \ncontinue to build and build and build the programs.\n  Mr. President, we have had today an opportunity which is sorely \nmissed--missed because there are those who would have, they said, \nimproved the future for our children. I do not think maintaining debt \nimproves the future for America. Virtually every child born today faces \ninterest payments on the Federal debt of nearly $200,000 over their \nlifetime. We must not saddle the yet unborn children whose wages are \nyet unearned with the burden, the incredible burden of that kind of \nweight, a weight in interest costs on the Federal debt.\n  We must get it under control. It is time for us to curtail the $4.9 \ntrillion debt of this country, and the first step, the step agreed to \nby the House in an overwhelming vote, agreed to by the President of the \nUnited States, agreed to by the leadership of the Senate, was to make \nthe $9.3 billion downpayment of rescissions.\n  It has been said loudly and sometimes very sincerely that we maybe \ndid not need a balanced budget amendment. We simply needed to have the \ncapacity to balance the budget. I wonder about our capacity. If we do \nnot have the ability and discipline when we come to a negotiated \nconclusion about what can be done, what ought to be done to restrict \nspending, even by a small amount like $9.3 billion as it relates to the \ntrillion dollar budget of this country, I wonder if we have much \nopportunity for success.\n  So I heard the debate this morning, the debate of apologies between \nindividuals about, oh, it was terrible that we had to rescind these \nfunds. I am here to say that I do not apologize for rescinding funds, \nfunds that we can no longer spend at the expense of the next \ngeneration. It is time for us to be serious about curtailing the debt \nof the United States of America to save the next generation and their \nopportunities.\n  Independence Day is but a few days away. Unfortunately, independence \nfrom debt is not that close, but it is time for us to make a beginning.\n  Mr. President, happy Fourth of July.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you very much. The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9511-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\n\n      COMMENDING SCOTT BATES ON 25 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise to commend Scott \nBates, our legislative clerk, on his outstanding 25 years of service to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Scott Bates began his career in Washington as a summer intern in the \nbill clerk's office under Senator John L. McClellan's patronage in \n1970. It was the beginning of a most auspicious match for both Scott \nand the Senate.\n  From the beginning, politics was in Scott's blood. His father, Paul \nBates, served as a member of the Arkansas Legislature. Scott loved \npolitics in school, and he served as a page in both the house and the \nsenate of the Arkansas Legislature.\n  In 1975, Scott first began working at the Senate desk where he has \ncontinued working ever since. His contributions to this body and to its \nworkings have been many and notable.\n  As the bill clerk of the Senate, Scott was instrumental in developing \nthe first automated recordkeeping system in the Senate, later known as \nLEGIS. Scott Bates established the current method used here in the \nSenate for numbering amendments, and he has left his innovative mark on \nmuch of the printed material used on the Senate floor to aid us in our \nwork, from rollcall tally sheets to the Senate calendar.\n  Although public service in general and careers in Washington have \nfallen out of favor, I believe that Scott Bates' life and work \nexperience present a compelling case against the current cynicism about \nthe many fine people who serve here in the Congress in various \ncapacities. Their names are never in the papers. They experience few \npublic kudos, and yet they work as long hours, probably longer, than we \ndo. They are dedicated, capable, patriotic individuals who represent \nthe best that America produces from all over this Nation.\n  Scott Bates is a fine example of what I am talking about. He was born \nand grew up in Pine Bluff, AR, where his parents, Paul and Mae Bates, \nstill reside. As a lad, he participated in the Boy Scouts, achieving \nthe high honor of Eagle Scout. He went farther than I went in the \nScouts.\n  Scott personifies what we politicians like to refer to as ``family \nvalues.'' He has always been active in his church and has been married \nto his wife, Ricki, for 20 years this July. Scott and Ricki have three \nwonderful children--Lisa, Lori and Paul.\n  As all of us know, one of Scott's official duties as legislative \nclerk is to call the roll of the Senate during votes and during quorum \ncalls. To his young son, Paul, this is obviously the most fascinating \npart of his dad's work. When once asked what his father did for a \nliving, young Paul responded: ``My dad calls other people names.''\n  And he gets by with it. Nobody quarrels about it. Nobody criticizes \nthis man for calling other people names.\n  Of course, the calling of the roll is only one small part of Scott's \nmany duties and responsibilities, and he handles them all with aplomb \nand dignity.\n  To one of the very best of the many fine individuals who serve their \ncountry with distinction as dedicated employees of this body, I extend \nmy heartiest congratulations on 25 years of outstanding service.\n  Along with the Members of the Senate and the legislative floor staff \nof the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, among whom Scott Bates is \nperceived as a leader and as a teacher, I express my hope that he will \ncontinue his fine work with the Senate for many more years to come.\n  Mr. President,\n\n       It isn't enough to say in our hearts\n       That we like a man for his ways;\n       Nor is it enough that we fill our minds\n       With psalms of silent praise;\n       Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n       As our confidence upward mounts;\n       As going right up to the man himself\n       And telling him so that counts.\n\n       Then when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n       Don't leave a kind word unsaid.\n       For fear to do so might make him vain\n       And cause him to lose his head.\n       But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done.''\n       And see how his confidence swells.\n       It isn't the flowers that we strew on the grave,\n       It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have a series of short statements that I \nwould like to make. I know the hour is late.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9513-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT W. McCORMICK\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to honor a \ndedicated public servant on the occasion of his retirement. Mr. Robert \nW. McCormick, Director of the U.S. Senate Telecommunications \nDepartment, has more than 38 years' experience in the field of \ntelecommunications. He served 26 years active duty in the U.S. Army, \nincluding 13 years with the White House Communications Agency under \nfour Presidents. During his more than 12 years as Director of the \nSenate Telecommunications Department, serving under seven Sergeants at \nArms, Bob McCormick has been responsible for the planning, research, \ntesting, and delivery of telecommunications equipment and services for \nall Washington, DC, Senate offices, and the approximately 400 State \noffices.\n  While Bob McCormick's accomplishments are too numerous to \nspecifically mention all of them, I would like to highlight a few of \nhis major achievements. He directed the installation of a state-of-the-\nart digital telephone switch and sets for Washington, DC, offices in \n1986-87. Soon thereafter, he oversaw installation of the FaxXchange \nsystem; the Senate Voice Mail System; and the Cloakroom and Sergeant at \nArms Group Alert systems that are integrated into the telephone system. \nIn 1993, he was given responsibility for the U.S. Capitol Police Radio \nSystem and for the Senate's data communications network. Under his \nleadership, the Capitol Police radio system has been upgraded. Senate \ndata communications are being transmitted by the faster, reliable, and \nless expensive frame relay service.\n  During his directorship, he has negotiated approximately a 50-percent \nreduction in Senate long-distance per-minute rates--for both \nWashington, DC, and State offices. He has also achieved substantial \nsavings in the cost of data communications by converting to the frame \nrelay network.\n  There is a saying that when goodness and skill work together, expect \na masterpiece. Bob McCormick is a masterpiece. Not only has he been a \nmodel public servant, but also he is a devoted husband, father, and \ngrandfather. He is an active member of church and community \norganizations in Queen Anne's County, MD, where he and his wife, Mary \nAnn, live on a farm.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Bob McCormick for his \nyears of public service and wishing him well on his retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9513-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9513-S9514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, victory was declared on Wednesday in the \ntrade negotiations with Japan. But I think a lot of Americans are \nwondering ``in favor of which side?''\n  A lot of Americans are wondering exactly what did the United States \nget after years of tough talk and threats?\n  A closer look reveals that after 2\\1/2\\ years of negotiations, the \nfinal agreement is vague, unenforceable, non-binding--in short, it is \nvirtually empty.\n  Mr. President, Japanese car manufacturers apparently promised to \nincrease production at their transplant operations in the United \nStates. But for the most part, the promised increases may be no more \nthan what was already planned. It is hard to see why the threat of a \nmajor trade war was necessary to persuade the Japanese to do what they \nalready had announced.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. negotiators claimed to have reached landmark \nagreements in the areas of auto parts and dealerships. But the Japanese \nimmediately issued disclaimers, emphasizing that any commitments were \nnot government commitments, carry no \n\n[[Page S9514]]\ngovernment backing, and are not enforceable.\n  The U.S. negotiators announced an estimate of expected increases in \nsales of auto parts under the agreement. Incredibly, the Japanese \nnegotiator then specifically disavowed the United States estimate. He \nsaid the United States estimate was shared ``neither by the minister \nhimself nor by the government of Japan.''\n  Mr. President, it makes one wonder, who were we negotiating with? One \nreport this morning states that some Japanese officials ``expressed \namazement that the U.S. accepted the final\n deal.''\n\n  Is this the ``specific, measurable, concrete'' deal the President \npromised?\n  If the estimated increases in parts purchases fail to occur, there \nare no consequences. If the number of dealerships does not increase, \nJapan faces no penalties. If the United States estimates in any of \nthese categories do not materialize--well, the Japanese never \nacknowledged those United States estimates in the first place. And a \njoint United States-Japan statement adds the ultimate qualifier: Both \nsides agreed to recognize that ``changes in market conditions may \naffect the fulfillment of these plans.''\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that this agreement does very \nlittle, if anything, to address the continuing problem of market access \nin Japan. After this agreement is in place, Japan will remain the most \nclosed major industrial economy in the world. Japan will remain a \nsanctuary economy with the lowest level among all industrial nations of \nimport penetration across numerous industry sectors.\n  This agreement does nothing to address the continuing problem of \nJapanese cartel-like behavior in their home market. It does nothing to \naddress the restrictive business practices that effectively block \nUnited States companies from penetrating the Japanese market. And it \ndoes nothing to encourage, not to mention require, the Japanese \nGovernment to take any action against those practices.\n  Mr. President, we went to the brink of a trade war with one of our \nmost important trading partners and would up with vague promises that \ncannot be enforced.

I think those hearings were very important, and the American \npeople ought to know what Congressman Zeliff and his National Security \nSubcommittee discovered.\n  You may remember that it was Bill Zeliff who invited Nancy Reagan and \na number of other drug experts from around the country to testify in \nMarch of this year, and who held an all-day hearing in April with Dr. \nLee Brown, the White House drug czar.\n  Mrs. Reagan testified that we have to get back on track, and she was \nright. The fact is that drug use fell each year of the Reagan \nadministration, and up until 1992, it continued to fall. For example, \nmonthly cocaine use dropped from 2.9 million users in 1988 to 1.3 \nmillion in 1992. Overall drug use dropped from 22.3 million users in \n1985 to 11.4 million users in 1992.\n  Drug use has gone up with 17 and 18 year olds, 15 and 16 year olds, \n13 and 14 year olds. Now we are spending less on drug interdiction \nprograms in this administration.\n  But, as Congressman Zeliff's hearings highlighted, drug use since \n1993 has been steadily rising. A 1994 survey of 51,000 kids showed use \nof LSD, non-LSD hallucinogens, stimulants, and marijuana all up. \nCocaine street prices continue to fall, while cocaine emergency room \nadmissions are at historically high levels. In 1994, twice the number \nof 8th graders were experimenting with marijuana than in 1991, and \ndaily use by seniors was up 50 percent between December 1993 and \nDecember 1994.\n  During his hearings, Congressman Zeliff also turned up these \ndisturbing facts:\n  First, the head of DEA, Administrator Constantine, admitted that \nexploding drug use in this country and international drug\n cartels should be seen as our No. 1 national security threat. \nAdministrator Constantine also admitted that rising casual drug use \namong U.S. kids is a timebomb waiting to explode.\n\n  Second, the President's interdiction coordinator, Admiral Kramek, \nadmitted that his office, which is supposed to coordinate the whole \nNation's drug interdiction effort, has just six full-time employees--\nand that the administration's interdiction effort has been cut for 3 \nstraight years.\n  Third, officials at the DEA, the President's interdiction \ncoordinator, and the head of U.S. Customs all suggest that President \nClinton's drug strategy is not fulfilling stated expectations.\n  Fourth, the General Accounting Office has\n   released a report confirming that the administration's anti-drug \nstrategy in the source countries is badly managed, poorly coordinated \namong agencies, and holds low priority in key embassies, including the \nU.S. Embassy in Mexico--despite the fact that 70 percent of the cocaine \ncoming into the United States comes over the border with Mexico.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Chairman Zeliff for convening these \nimportant hearings. The hearings are a wake-up call to all of us in \nCongress that we must regain the offensive and renew our commitment to \nthe war on drugs.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9514-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S 219TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, next Tuesday, in homes, neighborhoods, and \ncommunities across the country, Americans will celebrate Independence \nDay.\n  And since the Senate will not be in session on America's birthday, I \nwanted to take a minute today to share some very meaningful words with \nmy colleagues.\n  The words are not mine. Rather, they were first written in 1955, as a \npublic relations advertisement for what is now the Norfolk Southern \nCorp. The words have been updated slightly since that time, and they \neloquently encompass what America is all about.\n\n       I was born on July 4, 1776, and the Declaration of \n     Independence is my birth certificate. The bloodlines of the \n     world run in my veins, because I offered freedom to the \n     oppressed. I am many things, and many people. I am the Nation \n     . . .\n       I am Nathan Hale and Paul Revere. I stood at Lexington and \n     fired the shot heard around the world. I am Washington, \n     Jefferson, and Patrick Henry. I am John Paul Jones, the Green \n     Mountain Boys and Davy Crockett. I am Lee and Grant and Abe \n     Lincoln.\n       I remember the Alamo, the Maine and Pearl Harbor. When \n     freedom called I answered and stayed until it was over, over \n     there. I left my heroic dead in Flanders Fields, on the rock \n     of Corregidor, on the bleak slopes of Korea, and in the \n     steaming jungles of Vietnam.\n       I am the Brooklyn Bridge, the wheat fields of Kansas, and \n     the granite hills of Vermont. I am the coalfields of the \n     Virginias and Pennsylvania, the fertile lands of the west, \n     the Golden Gate and the Grand Canyon. I am Independence Hall, \n     the Monitor and the Merrimac.\n       I am big. I sprawl from the Atlantic to the Pacific . . . \n     my arms reach out to embrace Alaska and Hawaii. Three million \n     square miles throbbing with industry. I am millions of farms. \n     I am forest, field, mountain and desert. I am quiet \n     villages--and cities that never sleep.\n       You can look at me and see Ben Franklin walking down the \n     streets of Philadelphia with his breadloaf under his arm. You \n     can see Betsy Ross with her needle. You can see the lights of \n     Christmas, and hear the strains of ``Auld Lang Syne'' as the \n     calendar turns.\n       I am Babe Ruth and the World Series. I am 110,000 schools \n     and colleges, and 330,000 churches where my people worship \n     God as they think best. I am a ballot dropped in a box, the \n     roar of a crowd in a stadium, and the voice of a choir in a \n     cathedral. I am an editorial in a newspaper and a letter to a \n     congressman.\n       I am Eli Whitney and Stephen Foster. I am Tom Edison, \n     Albert Einstein, and Billy Graham. I am Horace Greeley, Will \n     Rogers, and the Wright brothers. I am George Washington \n     Carver, Jonas Salk, and Martin Luther King.\n       I am Longfellow, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Walt Whitman and \n     Thomas Paine.\n       Yes, I am the Nation, and these are the things that I am. I \n     was conceived in freedom and, God willing, in freedom I will \n     spend the rest of my days.\n       May I possess always the integrity, the courage, and the \n     strength to keep myself unshackled, to remain a citadel of \n     freedom, and a beacon of hope to the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I know all Senators join with me in wishing America a \nhappy 219th birthday.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9514-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\n\n                        REVIEW OF 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Finally, Mr. President, we have now completed 6 months work \nin the U.S. Senate and the Congress.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare to return to our States for the July 4 \nrecess, I wanted to take just a minute to review the last 6 months, and \nto look ahead to the 6 that remain in this year.\n  When Republicans asked Americans to put Congress under new management \nfor the first time in 40 years, Mr. President, we promised that we were \na different way of doing business. We promised we would not stand for \nthe status quo. We promised we would bring change to Capitol Hill.\n  We have kept those promises. We have kept our word. We have brought \nchange to Capitol Hill.\n  One change we brought was in our work load. In past sessions, \nCongress would convene in January, and then take it easy for a month or \ntwo. This Congress put an end to that. We hit the ground running.\n  From January 5 through June 28, the Senate has been in session for \n106 days, meeting for a total of 933 hours and 52 minutes--that is 21 \nmore days and nearly 350 more hours than the Senate spent in session \nfrom January 5 through June 30, 1993--the first 6 months of the fist \nsession of the 103d Congress.\n  What has the Senate accomplished in that time? Well, one thing we \nhave not done is pass more legislation than the previous Senate. And \nthat is a good thing. Because the people did not send us here to pass \nmore laws that mean more regulations and more Government. They sent us \nhere to rein in the Federal bureaucracy, and to return power to States, \nto communities, and to the people.\n  And that is exactly what we have done.\n  we began by leading by example, passing the Congressional \nAccountability Act, which will subject Congress to the same laws we \nimpose on everybody else.\n  We put an end to the practice of sending Federal mandates to our \nStates and local Governments, but not sending along the money to pay \nfor them.\n  We passed the Paperwork Reduction Act, which will help to reduce \nredtape.\n  We passed the line-item veto legislation, which will result in the \nreduction of unnecessary Federal spending.\n  We took the first step to reforming a civil litigation system that is \nout of balance, out of control, and out of common sense.\n  In the wake of the terrible tragedy in Oklahoma city, we moved \nquickly to pass antiterrorism legislation. Legislation that we can be \njust as proud of 10 years from now, as we are today, and legislation \nthat included historic habeas corpus reform.\n  We passed a telecommunications bill that reduces Government \ninterference in that fast growing industry.\n  And, of course, we passed a historic budget resolution that sets \nAmerica on a 7 year path to a balanced budget.\n  This is just a partial list of legislation we have passed this \nsession. All in all, not a bad start.\n  And let me assure the American people it is just that. A start. \nRepublicans know we have much to do before the end of this first \nsession.\n  This includes regulatory reform. Welfare reform. A tough anticrime \nbill. A congressional gift ban and lobby reform. And the appropriations \nbills, which will offer final proof that we are serious about balancing \nthe budget. And speaking of that, we have not given up on passing the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once said that ``the best prize life has to offer is \nthe chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' I guarantee to my \ncolleagues that over the next 6 months we'll have an opportunity to win \nthat best prize, because we will continue to work hard at work worth \ndoing. The American people deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a listing of some of the \nimportant legislation adopted by the Senate this session be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Bills Considered and Passed in the Senate (104th Congress)\n\n       H.R. 1(S. 2), Congressional Accountability.\n       H.R. 421, Alaska Native Claims Settlement.\n       H.R. 483, Medicare Select.\n       H.R. 517, Chacoan Outliers Protection Act.\n       H.R. 831, Self-Employed Health Insurance.\n       H.R. 889, Emergency Supplemental and Recissions.\n       H.R. 956, Common Sense Legal Reform.\n       H.R. 1158, Emergency Supplemental/Disaster Relief.\n       H.R. 1240, Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act.\n       H.R. 1345, D.C.

This Act \nwould limit the manufacture, importation, and distribution of handgun \nammunition that serves little sporting purpose, but which kills law \nenforcement officers. The details of this proposal are described in the \nenclosed section-by-section analysis.\n  Existing law already provides for limits on ammunition based on the \nspecific materials from which it is made. It does not, however, address \nthe problem of excessively powerful ammunition based on its \nperformance.\n  Criminals should not have access to handgun ammunition that will \npierce the bullet-proof vests worn by law enforcement officers. That is \nthe standard by which so-called ``cop-killer'' bullets are judged. My \nproposal would \n\n[[Page S9516]]\nlimit the availability of this ammunition.\n  The process of designating such ammunition should be a careful one \nand should be undertaken in close consultation with all those who are \naffected, including representatives of law enforcement, sporting \ngroups, the industries that manufacture bullet-proof vests and \nammunition, and the academic research community. For that reason, the \nlegislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the \nappropriate groups before regulations are promulgated. The legislation \nalso provides for congressional review of the proposed regulations \nbefore they take effect.\n  This legislation will save the lives of law enforcement officers \nwithout affecting the needs of legitimate sporting enthusiasts. I urge \nits prompt and favorable consideration by the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify the \npension laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE PENSION SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Pension \nSimplification Act of 1995. This very important legislation is designed \nto simplify the tax laws governing our Nation's private retirement \nsystem.\n  This legislation is the result of the efforts of many, and these \nefforts date back to March of 1990 when I first held hearings in the \nFinance subcommittee on private retirement plans.\n  Later, in the summer of 1990, I introduced the Employee Benefits \nSimplification Act, S. 2901. As a matter of history, many experts, \nincluding pension planners for small and large businesses, logged \ncountless hours to help me develop this legislation, and many \norganizations pushed to get this legislation enacted into law.\n  In the 102d Congress, I reintroduced this legislation as the Employee \nBenefits Simplification and Expansion Act of 1991. In early 1992, this \nlegislation was included in the Tax Fairness and Economic Growth Act of \n1992, which was H.R. 4210, and which was passed by the Congress, but it \nwas vetoed by President Bush for reasons not associated with this \nparticular piece of the overall tax bill.\n  During the summer of 1992, portions of the simplification effort were \npassed as part of the 1992 Unemployment Compensation Act. This \nlegislation was then designed to liberalize the rollover rules which \nallow the worker the ability to take his pension benefits with him or \nher when they change jobs.\n  Later that year, the remainder of the simplification bill was \nincluded as part of the Revenue Act of 1992, which was H.R. 11, also \npassed by Congress, also vetoed by President Bush for reasons not \nrelated to the substance of this legislation.\n  Since that time, there has been no tax bill which could include the \nas-yet-unpassed provisions of the simplification effort.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am very happy to be joined by Senator Orrin \nHatch of Utah, Senator Breaux of Louisiana, and Senator Leahy of \nVermont in introducing this legislation as the Pension Simplification \nAct of 1995. This bill includes many of the provisions passed two times \nby Congress in 1992, but it also includes some very new and important \nprovisions, which evidences our continuing effort to simplify the very \ncomplex and arcane pension rules. To some, this in itself is an \nextremely arcane issue, but to small businesses across our great \ncountry it is a critical part of doing business. And it is that part of \nbusiness which provides for savings and retirement funds ultimately for \nmillions of employees.\n  This act is the next significant step toward reducing the costs \nassociated with providing pension benefits. The legislation achieves \nthis result by eliminating many of the complexities and the \ninconsistencies in the private pension system which will in turn \npromote the establishment of new pension plans by both large and small \ncompanies.\n  While this legislation affects both small and large businesses, who \nprovide retirement plans for their workers, new provisions in this bill \nspecifically target complex and costly rules affecting small business, \nand there is very good reason for this action in this legislation.\n  In 1993, 83 percent of the companies with 100 or more employees \noffered some type of retirement plan. In contrast, in businesses with \nfewer than 25 employees, only 19 percent of those firms had an \nemployer-provided pension plan available to them, and only 15 percent \nof these employees even participated in those plans.\n  The major factor contributing to this dismal statistic is the sky-\nhigh per-participant cost of establishing and maintaining a pension \nplan for small business. The Pension Simplification Act alleviates the \nhigh-cost barriers for small business by creating a tax credit which \ncan be applied toward the start-up costs of providing a new plan for \nemployers with 50 or fewer employees. Of course, this is geared toward \nand focused on small business.\n  Next, the legislation slashes extensive annual nondiscrimination \ntesting requirements for firms where no employee is highly compensated. \nThese provisions, Mr. President, combined with the broad simplification \nprovisions for all plans, will significantly reduce the costs of \nstarting up and maintaining a retirement plan. Thus, this bill we are \nintroducing today encourages private retirement savings for our \nNation's small business worker.\n  Mr. President, rather than continuing a discussion of the many \ndetailed provisions of the Pension Simplification Act of 1995, I ask \nunanimous consent that a 5-page summary of the legislation and a copy \nof the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1006\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DATE FOR ADOPTION OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.\n\n       If any amendment made by this Act requires an amendment to \n     any plan, such plan amendment shall not be required to be \n     made before the first day of the first plan year beginning on \n     or after January 1, 1997, if--\n       (1) during the period after such amendment takes effect and \n     before such first plan year, the plan is operated in \n     accordance with the requirements of such amendment, and\n       (2) such plan amendment applies retroactively to such \n     period.\n\n     In the case of a governmental plan (as defined in section \n     414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), this section \n     shall be applied by substituting ``1999'' for ``1997''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   Pension Simplification Act of 1995\n\n       The Pension Simplification Act will provide greater access \n     to our private pension system by reducing the costs of \n     providing pension benefits. The Act achieves this result by \n     eliminating many of the unnecessary complexities in the Tax \n     Code. While the Act affects both large and small employers, \n     special provisions target small business where sponsorship of \n     a plan by an employer, and employee participation, is \n     historically very low.\n       1. Simplification of the Definition of ``Highly Compensated \n     Employee''. Current law requires an employer to identify HCEs \n     using a 7-part test in order to ensure that HCEs do not \n     disproportionately benefit under the plan. The bill proposes \n     a simpler 3-part test to achieve this goal. Under the \n     proposal, an employee is an HCE if the employee (1) was a 5-\n     percent owner at any time during the year or preceding year, \n     (2) has compensation for the preceding year in excess of \n     $80,000 (indexed), or (3) was the highest-paid officer during \n     the year (see #10 below which provides an exception to this \n     rule for certain small businesses).\n       2. Repeal of the Family Aggregation Rules. The family \n     aggregation rules greatly complicate the application of the \n     nondiscrimination tests, particularly for family-owned or \n     operated businesses, and may unfairly reduce retirement \n     benefits for the family members who are not HCEs. The bill \n     eliminates the rule that requires certain HCEs and their \n     family members to be treated as a single employee.\n       3. Simplify the Definition of ``Compensation'' under \n     Section 415. The general limit on a participant's annual \n     contributions is based on that individuals's taxable \n     compensation. The result is that pre-tax employee \n     contributions (e.g., to cafeteria plans) reduce the \n     participant's taxable compensation, and in turn, their \n     section 415 contribution limit. This rule makes it difficult \n     to communicate in advance the section 415 limit and it leads \n     to many inadvertent violations. Under the bill, pre-tax \n     employee contributions would be counted as compensation under \n     section 415.\n       4. Exempt Defined Contribution Plans from the Minimum \n     Participation Rule. Every qualified plan currently must cover \n     at least 50 employee or, in smaller companies, 40% of all \n     employees of the employer. This rule is intended to prevent \n     the use of individual defined benefit plans to give high paid \n     employees better benefits than those provided to others under \n     a separate plan. Because the abuses addressed by the rule are \n     unlikely to arise in the context of defined contribution \n     plans, the rule adds unnecessary administrative burden and \n     complexity for defined contribution plans; therefore, the \n     bill repeals the rule for these plans.\n       5. Section 401(k) Safe Harbor. Current law requires \n     complicated, annual comparisons between the level of \n     contributions to 401(k) plans made by HCEs and non-highly \n     compensated employees. First, the Act will eliminate end-of-\n     year adjustments caused by employee population changes during \n     the year by providing a rule that the maximum contribution \n     for HCEs is determined by reference to NHCEs for the \n     preceding, rather than the current year. Second, the bill \n     provides two 401(k) plan designs which if offered by the \n     employer, will qualify the employer for a special safe \n     harbor, thus eliminating the need to do several annual, \n     complex discrimination tests that apply to traditional plans.\n       6. Simplify Taxation of Annuity Distributions. A simplified \n     method for determining the nontaxable portion of an annuity \n     payment, similar to the current simplified alternative, would \n     become the required method. Taxpayers would no longer be \n     compelled to do calculations under multiple methods in order \n     to determine the most advantageous approach. Under the \n     simplified method, the portion of an annuity payment that \n     would be nontaxable is generally equal to the employees's \n     total after-tax contributions, divided by the number of \n     anticipated payments listed in a table (based on the \n     employee's age as of the annuity starting date).\n       7. Repeal Rule Requiring Employer Plans to Commence Minimum \n     Distributions before Retirement. The Act repeals the current \n     law rule requiring distribution of benefits after a \n     participant reaches age 70\\1/2\\, even if he or she does not \n     retire. However, the current law rule will continue to apply \n     to 5% owners.\n       8. Eliminate the Section 415(e) Combined Plan Limit. \n     Section 415(e) applies an overall limit on benefits and \n     contributions with respect to an individual who participates \n     in both a defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan \n     maintained by the same employer. These rules are extremely \n     complicated, and very burdensome to administer because they \n     require maintaining compensation and contribution records for \n     all employees for all years of service. Further, the test is \n     duplicative in that there are other provisions in the Code \n     which safeguard against an individual accruing excessive \n     retirement benefits on a tax-favored basis.\n       9. Repeal 5-year Income Averaging for Lump-Sum \n     Distributions. The bill repeals the special rule that allows \n     a plan participant to calculate the current year tax on a \n     lump-sum pension distribution as if the amount were received \n     over a 5-year period. This special rule, designed to prevent \n     unfair ``bunching'' of income, is no longer needed because of \n     liberalized rollover rules enacted in 1992 (originally part \n     of the Pension Simplification Act) which allow for partial \n     distributions from a plan.\n       10. Targeting Small Business. Retirement plan coverage \n     among employees of small employers is dismally low. The cost \n     of establishing a retirement plan is, in a significant way, \n     disproportionately high for small employers. The following \n     provisions will help to alleviate these barriers:\n       Tax Credit for Start-Up Costs. Employers with less than 50 \n     employees that have not maintained a qualified retirement \n     plan at any time during the immediately preceding two years, \n     would be eligible for an income tax credit (up to $1000) \n     equal to the cost of establishing a qualified plan.\n       Elimination of the One-High-Paid Officer Rule. The highest \n     paid officer of an employer is considered an HCE under \n     current law. This rule is unfair for small employers with \n     low-wage workforces. For example, the highest paid officer of \n     a small employer may earn an amount less than $66,000 yet \n     that employee must be treated as highly compensated. The \n     result is that the nondiscrimination rules severely limit his \n     or her benefits. Thus many small employers decide not to \n     offer plans. The bill provides that no owners or employees \n     would be treated as highly compensated unless they received \n     compensation in excess of $80,000.\n       Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pensions (SEPs). The \n     Act adds the two design-based safe harbors, discussed in #5 \n     above, as methods of satisfying the nondiscrimination \n     requirements for SEPs. Further, the Act provides that SEPs \n     may be established by employers with 100 or fewer employees, \n     instead of current law (25 or fewer employees), and the Act \n     repeals the requirement that at least half of eligible \n     employees actually participate in a salary reduction SEP.\n       Exemption from Top Heavy Plan Requirements. Under the Act, \n     if no employee makes over $80,000 (indexed) in the preceding \n     year, the top heavy plan requirements do not apply for that \n     year.\n       11. Permit Tax Exempt Organizations to Maintain 401(k) \n     Plans. Except for certain plans established before July 2, \n     1986, an organization exempt from income tax is not allowed \n     to maintain a 401(k) plan. This rule prevents many tax-exempt \n     organizations from offering their employees retirement \n     benefits on a salary reduction basis. The bill provides that \n     tax exempt organizations (except section 501(c)(3)s which may \n     currently provide 403(b) plans) may provide 401(k) plans to \n     their employees.\n       12. Leased Employees. Generally, the bill defines an \n     employee as a ``leased employee'' of a service recipient only \n     if the services are performed by the individual under the \n     control of the recipient. This simplified ``control test'' \n     replaces the complicated, 4-part ``historically performed \n     test.''\n       13. Vesting for Multi-Employer Plans. The bill conforms \n     vesting requirements for multi-employer plans to vesting \n     requirements for all other qualified plans. Thus, the current \n     law 10-year vesting rule for collectively bargained plans \n     would be repealed and such plans would be required to comply \n     with general vesting rules.\n       14. Full-Funding Limitations for Multi-Employer Plans. The \n     bill simplifies the calculation of the full funding \n     limitation for multi-employer plans, and requires actuarial \n     valuations be performed at least every 3 years, instead of \n     every year.\n       15. Alternative Full-Funding Limitation. current law \n     provides a formula which limits pension contributions an \n     employer may make to a plan, in order to prevent overfunding. \n     The bill provides the Secretary of Treasury authority to \n     allow employers some flexibility in determining the full-\n     funding limitation.\n       16. Volunteer Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA). \n     Current regulations require that employees eligible to \n     participate in a VEBA share an employment-related common \n     bond. The bill clarifies this requirement by specifying that \n     an employment-related common bond includes employer \n     affiliation where employers are in the same line of business; \n     they act jointly to perform tasks that are integral to the \n     activities of each of them; and that such joint activities \n     are sufficiently extensive that the maintenance of a common \n     VEBA is not a major part of such joint activities.\n       17. Government Plans. The limitations on contributions and \n     benefits present special problems for plans maintained by \n     State and local governments due to the special nature of the \n     involvement and operation of such governments. The Act \n     addresses these problems by providing (1) section 457 does \n     not apply to excess benefit plans maintained by State or \n     local governments, (2) the compensation limit on benefits \n     under a defined benefit plan does not apply to plans \n     maintained by a State or local government, and (3) the \n     defined benefit pension plan limits do \n\n[[Page S9526]]\n     not apply to certain disability and survivor benefits provided under \n     State and local government plans.\n       Further, because of the unique characteristics of the State \n     and local government employee plans, many long-tenured and \n     relatively low-paid employees may be eligible to receive \n     benefits in excess of their average compensation. Therefore, \n     the Act provides that the current law 100% of compensation \n     limit does not apply to plans maintained by State and local \n     governments.\n       18. State and Local Government Deferred Compensation \n     (Section 457) Plans. The Act makes 3 changes to Section 457 \n     plan rules: (1) it indexes the dollar limit on deferrals; (2) \n     it permits in-service distributions from accounts of less \n     than $3,500 if there has been no amount deferred with respect \n     to the account for 2 years and if there has been no prior \n     distribution under this cash-out rule; and (3) it permits an \n     additional election as to the time distributions must begin \n     under the plan. These changes are designed to make Section \n     457 plan participants treated more like private plan \n     participants.\n       19. Rural Cooperatives. Unlike all other section 401(k) \n     plans, rural cooperative 401(k) plans are not permitted to \n     make in-service distributions for hardship or after age 59\\1/\n     2\\. The Act treats rural cooperative plans the same as all \n     other 401(k) plans. The Act also clarifies the definition of \n     a ``rural cooperative'' for purposes of determining \n     eligibility to offer a 404(k) plan.\n       20. Rules for Plans Covering Pilots. The Act applies the \n     same discrimination testing rules to pensions maintained for \n     airland pilots, whether or not the plans are collectively-\n     bargained. Thus, under the rules, employees who are not air \n     pilots may be excluded from consideration in testing whether \n     the plan satisfies the minimum coverage requirements.\n       21. Eligible Faculty Voluntary Retirement Incentive Plans. \n     The Act modifies the ``risk of forfeiture'' rule governing \n     the timing of tax liability to allow qualifying future \n     payments under an eligible faculty voluntary retirement \n     incentive plan to be taxes when received, as opposed to at \n     the time the participant becomes entitled to them.\n       22. Uniform Retirement Act/Social Security Retirement Age. \n     The bill recognizes that plans use age 65 as a ``normal \n     retirement age'' in part because it is Social Security's \n     ``normal retirement age.'' Because the ``normal retirement \n     age'' is scheduled to increase under the Social Security law, \n     the bill provides that for purposes of the general \n     nondiscrimination rule, the Social Security retirement age is \n     a uniform retirement age.\n       23. Blue-Ribbon Commission. The bill establishes a blue-\n     ribbon commission which will identify the long-term goals for \n     private retirement savings. The 18-member commission would \n     consist of 6 members appointed by the President; 6 by the \n     Speaker of the House; and 6 by the Senate Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this month I was extremely gratified when \nPresident Clinton unveiled his approach to simplify the pension rules. \nMany of the provisions in this legislation are also in this particular \nPension Simplification Act of 1995 that I am introducing today and am \njoined with by my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Breaux, and Leahy.\n  I wish to thank our colleagues for helping us in this matter. I \ncommend the President for focusing on this very important cause \naffecting small businesses throughout our country. I believe that by \nworking together with our Republican colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle and with our President, all of us together this year can \nenact this legislation into law. Should we do this, small businesses \nacross America would be extremely grateful. It is important that this \nlegislation have support from both sides, Mr. President, and I am happy \nto have Senator Hatch, my fellow member of the Finance Committee, as a \nlead cosponsor on this bill. I wish to thank him for joining us, and I \nlook forward to working with him on this very important legislation.\n  Mr. President, these new pension simplification provisions affecting \nsmall business have already been strongly endorsed by three important \nsmall business organizations:\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the Small Business Council of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of these letters of endorsement \nfrom these very distinguished organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Small Business Council\n\n\n                                                    of America\n\n                                                Overland Park, KS.\n     Re Pension simplification bill.\n\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The Small Business Council of America \n     strongly endorses the new pension simplification legislation \n     which will streamline the country's voluntary retirement plan \n     system and encourage savings. We particularly appreciate the \n     provisions that target the Nation's small businesses. There \n     is no question that these provisions will give small \n     businesses greater access to the retirement plan system than \n     they have had over the last decade.\n       We have watched with approval your unceasing drive to \n     revive the retirement plan system. Of particular importance \n     to our members is the repeal of family aggregation, the \n     institution of voluntary safe harbors for 401(k) plans and \n     the tax credit for start up costs, the recognition that for \n     many small businesses there is no such thing as a highly \n     compensated employee, the return of 401(a)(26) to its \n     original purpose and the repeal of the complicated 415(e) \n     fraction. All of these changes, as well as others set forth \n     in the bill, will dramatically improve the existing \n     retirement plan system. By making the system user friendly, \n     more small businesses will sponsor retirement plans. Easing \n     administrative burdens will reduce the costs of maintaining \n     retirement plans particularly for small businesses.\n       Retirement plans sponsored by small businesses operate \n     under a stringent and excessively complicated statutory and \n     regulatory system. These limitations and rules are now so \n     complicated that the costs of sponsoring a retirement plan \n     often outweigh the benefits that a small business can \n     reasonably expect to obtain. By making the changes called for \n     in this legislation, with a few additional changes, the costs \n     incurred by small businesses sponsoring retirement plans will \n     be brought back into line. The Small Business Council of \n     America, with its technical expertise in the small business \n     retirement plan area, believes that the changes contemplated \n     by this legislation will significantly improve the country's \n     voluntary retirement plan system.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Paula A. Calimafde.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I wish to indicate our strong support for your \n     legislation, The Pension Simplification Act of 1995.\n       NFIB believes that simplification of the regulations and \n     reduction in the costs associated with retirement plans are \n     of vital importance to American small business. Almost two-\n     thirds of NFIB members strongly support pension \n     simplification and the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business ranked pension simplification number seven out of \n     sixty. Your legislation will increase the chances that small \n     employers will set-up retirement plans, enabling their \n     employees and themselves to provide for a secure retirement.\n       Three out of every four small businesses currently do not \n     have retirement plans. Until small employers offer pension \n     plans, many American workers will not be covered for their \n     retirement outside of individual savings and Social Security.\n       An NFIB Education Foundation study revealed that one-third \n     of small businesses which recently terminated their \n     retirement plans, did so because of changing and complex \n     regulations. Enabling small employers to implement a \n     retirement plan without complex participation and non-\n     discrimination rules as well as clarifying the definition of \n     highly compensated employees will provide small employers \n     with incentives to offer plans.\n       I also want to commend you for including a tax credit for \n     small businesses equal to the cost of establishing a \n     qualified retirement plan. And finally, NFIB supports your \n     proposal to prohibit the IRS from issuing retirement plan \n     regulations unless the regulation includes a section \n     addressing the needs of small employers.\n       Small business owners purchase pensions coverage the same \n     way they purchase other employee benefits. The lower the \n     costs--in time, trouble and dollars--the more likely \n     employers will participate. We look forward to working with \n     you to achieve its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Faris,\n     Presdient.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                               of the United States of America\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 1995.\n     Hon. David H. Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce Federation of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and \n     local chambers of commerce. 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, and 72 American Chambers of Commerce abroad, I \n     commend you for introducing the ``Pension Simplification Act \n     of 1995.''\n       The American business community is encouraged by your \n     efforts to simplify the highly complex and overly burdensome \n     private pension laws. We are especially pleased that many of \n     the proposed changes in the legislation target small \n     employers, providing incentives for small businesses to \n     sponsor retirement plans.\n       As you know, the time has come to reverse the decade-old \n     assault on private pensions, \n\n[[Page S9527]]\n     and to enact sensible reform legislation that encourages employers to \n     sponsor retirement plans for their employees. This \n     legislation provides a solid framework for such reforms by \n     making meaningful changes to many of the Internal Revenue \n     Code provisions that currently hinder the private pension \n     system. While the introduction of this legislation is a good \n     start, there is much more that can and should be done to \n     ensure that pension reform provides truly meaningful \n     opportunities for increased savings through employer-\n     sponsored pension plans.\n       The Chamber appreciates your leadership on this issue. We \n     look forward to working with you and other members of \n     Congress to ensure that the goals of simplifying our nation's \n     pension laws and providing incentives for plan sponsorship \n     are not lost as this legislation moves through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, finally, in the coming days, I will be \nasking our colleagues to look closely at the Pension Simplification Act \nand join me in cosponsoring this effort. It is a bipartisan effort.\n  The bottom line is that it will increase retirement savings for \nworkers in our country, especially those who work in small firms which, \nof course, is so critical to America's future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Pryor, to introduce the Pension Simplification Act \nof 1995. I commend Senator Pryor for the work he has done on this issue \nover the past few years.\n  I would also like to compliment President Clinton for his efforts in \nthis area. We welcome the administration's suggestions on this issue.\n  Mr. President, simplification of this complex area of the tax law is \nlong overdue. In 1974, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n[ERISA] was passed into law. The original intent of Congress for this \nact was, as the name implies, to provide security for private sector \nretirees. However, almost all of the laws and regulations governing \nprivate sector pensions that have been added since that time have had \nthe completely opposite effect.\n  Since 1980, Congress has passed an average of one law per year \naffecting private sector pensions. As the rules and regulations \ngoverning pension plans have multiplied, defined benefit pension plans \nhave become less and less attractive to employers, As a result, pension \nplan terminations have consistently outpaced the growth of new plans.\n  My colleague, Senator Pryor, has tried to get Congress to act on \npension simplification for the past 5 years. Meanwhile, an alarming \nnumber of pension plans have been terminated. Over the past 5 years, \nover 40,000 employee defined benefit plans have been terminated, \naffecting the retirement savings of more than 3 million Americans.\n  Pension regulation has directly affected the retirement security of \nmillions of working Americans. The migration of employers away from \ndefined benefit pension plans and toward defined contribution plans is \na direct result of increased regulation. Employers prefer defined \ncontribution plans because such plans are easier to administer and do \nnot have the complex, burdensome rules that govern defined benefit \nplans. This movement away from defined benefit plans has effectively \nshifted the risks of the retirement plan investments from employers to \nemployees.\n  At a time when the long-term adequacy of our Social Security Program \nis in question, we should be encouraging private sector retirement \nsaving, not crippling pension plans with more and more regulation. The \npension system provides a vital source of funding for the retirement \nneeds of our nation's workforce. Over 41 million working Americans \ncurrently enrolled in private sector pension plans would directly \nbenefit from pension simplification.\n  As unfortunate as the number of terminations of pension plans have \nbeen, Mr. President, the real tragedy of pension law complexity is at \nthe small business level. Much of the burden of current pension law has \nfallen squarely on the shoulders of America's small businesses. Many \nsmall businesses simply cannot afford to establish pension plans for \ntheir employees.\n  Even if a small firm is able to establish a pension plan, current law \nthrows up barriers to keeping the plan qualified for tax deferral \ntreatment. Small businesses simply do not have the resources necessary \nto comply with all of the tests and antidiscrimination rules demanded \nby current law.\n  As a result of the heavy regulation of pension plans, lack of \nretirement plan sponsorship has left employees of small businesses out \nin the cold. Retirement plans are simply not an option for small \nemployers because of the high cost to establish and administer them. In \n1993, only 19 percent of employers with fewer than 25 employees \nsponsored a pension plan.\n  Thus, small businesses are placed at a competitive disadvantage to \nlarger firms by our current pension law. Not only do the compliance \ncosts take away from a small firm's profitability, but the firm's \nability to attract high-quality employees is also impaired. Employees \nseeking retirement security prefer to work for a large company that can \nmuch more easily provide a pension plan over a small firm that cannot \nprovide such security.\n  Mr. President, the Pension Simplification Act will provide relief to \nemployers that are laboring under our outmoded and inflexible \nregulations to provide retirement plans for their employees. This act \nwill restore flexibility to our pension laws and thus encourage \nemployers, including small businesses, to offer and maintain retirement \nplans that are vital to the retirement security of our Nation's work \nforce.\n  The Pension Simplification Act contains several provisions which will \nprovide the relief that will result in retirement security for working \nAmericans.\n  This bill introduces safe harbor rules for 401(k) plans that will \nhelp employers know whether or not their plans are qualified\n for tax-deferred treatment. The complex compliance tests required by \ncurrent law will be eliminated.\n\n  A strong disincentive to offer defined benefit pension plans will be \nremoved by simplifying the method for determining the nontaxable \nportion of annuity payments. Thus, employers would no longer have to \nmake complex calculations to determine whether offering a defined \nbenefit or a defined contribution plan is more advantageous.\n  The Pension Simplification Act also benefits State and local \ngovernment pension plans by clarifying the application of the benefit \nlimitation rules and by allowing these employers to establish 401(k)-\ntype plans.\n  This bill also removes many of the burdens that small businesses face \nwhen trying to provide retirement programs for their employees. The \nPension Simplification Act will make it easier for small businesses to \nprovide retirement security for millions of Americans by providing a \ntax credit for starting a new pension plan. The bill also removes the \ncomplex discrimination rules for small employers and exempts small \nbusinesses from the minimum participation rules.\n  Mr. President, this bill targets a complex and confusing area of law. \nHowever, our goal is quite simple--increased retirement security for \nAmerican workers.\n  The Pension Simplification Act is great bill, I urge my colleagues to \njoin Senator Pryor and me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n Section-by-Section Analysis of the Pension Simplification Act of 1995\n\n\n      title i--simplification of the nondiscrimination provisions\n\n       Sec. 101. Definition of Highly Compensated Employee (HCE)\n\n       In general, under present law, an employee is treated as \n     highly compensated with respect to a year if during the year \n     or the preceding year the employee (1) was a 5-percent owner \n     of the employer, (2) received more than $75,000 (indexed at \n     $100,000 for 1995) in annual compensation from the employer, \n     (3) received more than $50,000 (indexed at $66,000 for 1995) \n     in annual compensation from the employer and was a member of \n     the top 20 percent of employees by compensation, or (4) was \n     an officer of the employer who received compensation greater \n     than $45,000 (indexed at $60,000 for 1995). If, for any year, \n     no officer has compensation in excess of $60,000, then the \n     highest paid officer of the employer for such year is treated \n     as an HCE.\n       Under present law, all family members of (1) a 5-percent \n     owner, or (2) a HCE in the group consisting of the 10 highest \n     paid HCEs \n\n[[Page S9528]]\n     are treated as a single HCE and all the compensation of the family \n     members is treated as compensation of the HCE.\n       The bill provides that an employee is highly compensated \n     with respect to a year if the employee (1) was a 5-percent \n     owner of the employer at any time during the year or the \n     preceding year, or (2) has compensation for the preceding \n     year in excess of $80,000 (adjusted for cost-of-living \n     increases using a base period beginning October 1, 1995 (sec. \n     415(d)), or (3) was the most highly compensated officer of \n     the employer for the preceding year.\n       The bill provides that the dollar limit applicable for any \n     year is the amount in effect for the calendar year with \n     respect to which compensation is determined under the bill. \n     For example, assume HCEs are being determined for the 1997 \n     plan year in the case of a calendar year plan. Under the \n     bill, 1996 compensation is used to make this determination, \n     and the $80,000 figure for 1996, is the applicable dollar \n     limit for the 1997 plan year (rather than the $80,000 figure \n     as adjusted for 1997).\n       Under the bill, no employee would be treated as highly \n     compensated in a year unless he or she received compensation \n     from the employer during the preceding year in excess of \n     $80,000. This proposal would apply to officers and to 5-\n     percent owners. It targets small businesses where pension \n     coverage is very low. For detailed discussion, see Title III, \n     Targeted Access for Employees of Small Employers, section \n     302, page 17.\n       The bill repeals the family aggregation rules.\n       This provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995, except that for purposes of determining \n     whether an employee is an HCE in years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995, the provision is effective for years \n     beginning after December 31, 1994. Thus, for example, in \n     determining whether an employee is highly compensated for \n     1996 with respect to calendar year plan, the determination is \n     to be based on whether the employee had compensation during \n     1995 in excess of $80,000 (not $66,000 which may have been \n     the applicable amount for the employee in 1995 prior to this \n     bill).\n\n         Sec. 102. Definition of compensation under Section 415\n\n       Generally under present law, the section 415 limits with \n     respect to an individual are based in part on the \n     individual's taxable compensation. The general limit on a \n     participant's annual additions under a defined contribution \n     plan is the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of the participant's \n     taxable compensation.\n       For example, assume a plan participant has a $20,000 \n     salary. The 25% of compensation limit would generally permit \n     the participant to have an annual addition of $5,000 (25% \n     $20,000). However, because pre-tax employee contributions to \n     a cafeteria plan would reduce the employee's taxable \n     compensation from $20,000, any such contributions would also \n     reduce the participant's section 415 limit. Moreover, \n     contributions to a 401(k) plan, and other types of pre-tax \n     employee contributions, would further reduce the \n     participant's taxable compensation and section 415 limit.\n       The effect of pre-tax employee contributions makes it \n     difficult to communicate in advance the section 415 limit \n     applicable to each employee; this issue also leads to \n     numerous inadvertent violations of section 415. Moreover, the \n     reduction of the section 415 limit caused by pre-tax employee \n     contributions primarily affects nonhighly compensated \n     employees; this is so in part because section 125 \n     contributions generally do not vary with compensation and \n     thus have a proportionately smaller effect on higher paid \n     employees.\n       Under the proposal, pre-tax employee contributions \n     described in sections 402(g), 125, or 457 would be counted as \n     compensation for purposes of section 415. In previous Pension \n     Simplification bills this provision was limited to state and \n     local governmental plans, however, the bill expands the \n     provision to all plans.\n\n    Sec. 103. Modification of Additional Participation Requirements\n\n       Under present law, a plan is not a qualified plan unless it \n     benefits no fewer than the lesser of (1) 50 employees or (2) \n     40 percent of all employees of an employer (sec. 401(a)(26)). \n     This minimum participation rule cannot be satisfied by \n     aggregating comparable plans, but can be applied separately \n     to different lines of business of the employer. A line of \n     business of the employer does not qualify as a separate line \n     of business unless it has at least 50 employees. Also, \n     certain employees may be disregarded in applying the rules.\n       The bill provides that the minimum participation rule \n     applies only to defined benefit pension plans. In addition, \n     the bill provides that a defined benefit plan does not \n     satisfy the rule unless it benefits no fewer than the lesser \n     of (1) 50 employees or (2) the greater of (a) 40 percent of \n     all employees of the employer or (b) 2 employees (or 1 \n     employee if there is only 1 employee). The separate line of \n     business and excludable employee rules apply as under present \n     law.\n       In the case of an employer with only 2 employees, a plan \n     satisfies the present-law minimum participation rule if the \n     plan covers 1 employee. However, under the bill, a plan \n     satisfies the minimum participation rule only if it covers \n     both employees.\n       The provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n   Sec. 104. Nondiscrimination Rules for Qualified Cash or Deferred \n                              Arrangements\n\n       a. In general: The bill modifies the present-law \n     nondiscrimination test applicable to elective deferrals and \n     employer matching and after-tax employee contributions to \n     provide that the maximum permitted ADP or ACP for HCEs for \n     the year is determined by reference to the ADP or ACP for \n     nonhighly compensated employees for the preceding, rather \n     than the current year. In the case of the first plan year of \n     the plan, the ADP or ACP of nonhighly compensated employees \n     for the previous year is deemed to be 3 percent or, at the \n     election of the employer, the actual ADP or ACP for such plan \n     year.\n       b. Section 401(k) Safe Harbor: Under present law, the \n     special nondiscrimination test applicable to elective \n     deferrals under qualified cash or deferred arrangements \n     (401(k)s) is satisfied if the actual deferral percentage \n     (ADP) under a cash or deferral arrangement for eligible HCEs \n     for a plan year is equal to or less than either (1) 125 \n     percent of the ADP of all non-highly compensated employees \n     eligible to defer under the arrangement, or (2) the lesser of \n     200 percent of the ADP of all eligible nonhighly compensated \n     employees or such ADP plus 2 percentage points (section \n     401(k)). The ADP for a group of employees is the average of \n     the ratios (calculated separately for each employee in the \n     group) of the contributions paid to the plan on behalf of the \n     employee to the employee's compensation.\n       A cash or deferred arrangement that satisfies the special \n     nondiscrimination test is deemed to satisfy the \n     nondiscrimination requirement applicable to qualified plans \n     with respect to the amount of contribution or benefits \n     (section 401(a)(4)).\n       In addition, under present law, a special nondiscrimination \n     test is applied to employer matching contributions and after-\n     tax employee contributions (section 401(m)). This special \n     nondiscrimination test is similar to the special \n     nondiscrimination test in section 401(k).\n       An employer matching contribution means (1) any employer \n     contribution made on behalf of an employee on account of an \n     employee contribution made by such employee, and (2) any \n     employer contribution made on behalf of an employee on \n     account of an employee's elective deferral.\n       The bill adds alternative methods of satisfying the special \n     nondiscrimination requirements applicable to elective \n     deferrals and employer matching contributions. Under these \n     safe harbor rules, a cash or deferred arrangement is treated \n     as satisfying the ADP test if the plan of which the \n     arrangement is a part (or any other plan of the employer \n     maintained with respect to the employees eligible to \n     participate in the cash or deferred arrangement) meets (1) \n     one of two contribution requirements and (2) a notice \n     requirement. These safe harbors permit a plan to satisfy the \n     special nondiscrimination tests through plan design, rather \n     than through the testing of actual contributions.\n       A plan satisfies the contribution requirements under the \n     safe harbor rule for qualified cash or deferred arrangements \n     if the plan either (1) satisfies a matching contribution \n     requirement or (2) the employer makes a contribution to the \n     plan of at least 3 percent of an employee's compensation on \n     behalf of each nonhighly compensated employee who is eligible \n     to participate in the arrangement without regard to whether \n     the employee makes an elective contribution under the \n     arrangement. Under both tests, contributions may also be made \n     to highly compensated employees.\n       A plan satisfies the matching contribution requirement if, \n     under the arrangement: (1) the employer makes a matching \n     contribution on behalf of each nonhighly compensated employee \n     that is not less than (a) 100 percent of the employee's \n     elective contributions up to 3 percent of compensation and \n     (b) 50 percent of the employee's elective contributions from \n     3 to 5 percent of compensation; and (2) the level of match \n     for highly compensated employees is not greater than the \n     match rate for nonhighly compensated employees.\n       Alternatively, if the matching contribution requirement is \n     not satisfied at some level of employee compensation, the \n     requirement is deemed to be satisfied if (1) the level of \n     employer matching contributions does not increase as employee \n     elective contributions increase and (2) the aggregate amount \n     of matching contributions with respect to elective \n     contributions up to that level of compensation at least \n     equals the amount of matching contributions required under \n     the general safe harbor rule.\n       Under the safe harbor, an employee's rights to employer \n     matching contributions or nonelective contributions used to \n     meet the contribution requirements are required to be 100 \n     percent vested.\n       An arrangement does not satisfy the contribution \n     requirements with respect to nonelective contributions unless \n     the requirements are met without regard to the permitted \n     disparity rules (sec. 401(1)), and nonelective contributions \n     used to satisfy the contribution requirements are not taken \n     into account for purposes of determining whether a plan of \n     the employer satisfies the permitted disparity rules. It is \n     intended that the rule applies to matching contributions as \n     well.\n       Employer matching and nonelective contributions used to \n     satisfy the contribution requirements of the safe harbor \n     rules are subject to the restrictions on withdrawals \n\n[[Page S9529]]\n     that apply to an employee's elective deferrals under a qualified cash \n     or deferred arrangement (sec. 401(k)(2)(B)).\n       The notice requirement is satisfied if each employee \n     eligible to participate in the arrangement is given written \n     notice within a reasonable period before any year of the \n     employee's rights and obligations under the arrangement. This \n     notice must be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to \n     apprise the employee of his or her rights and obligations and \n     must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by \n     the average employee eligible to participate.\n       c. Alternative method of satisfying special \n     nondiscrimination test for matching contributions: The bill \n     provides a safe harbor method of satisfying the special \n     nondiscrimination test applicable to employer matching \n     contributions. Under this safe harbor, a plan is treated as \n     meeting the special nondiscrimination test with respect to \n     matching contributions if (1) the plan meets the contribution \n     and notice requirements applicable under the safe harbor \n     method of satisfying the special nondiscrimination \n     requirement for qualified cash or deferred arrangements, and \n     (2) the plan satisfies a special limitation on matching \n     contributions. After-tax employee contributions continue to \n     be tested separately under the present ACP test, taking into \n     account both employee contributions and employer matches in \n     calculating contribution percentages.\n       The limitation on matching contributions is satisfied if \n     (1) matching contributions on behalf of any employee may not \n     be made with respect to employee contributions or elective \n     deferrals in excess of 6 percent of compensation and (2) the \n     level of an employer's matching contribution does not \n     increase as an employee's contributions or elective deferrals \n     increase.\n\n\n                Title II.--Simplified Distribution Rules\n\n       Under present law, distributions from tax-favored \n     retirement arrangements are generally includable in gross \n     income when received, however special rules apply in certain \n     circumstances.\n       For example, certain distributions from tax-favored \n     retirement arrangements attributable to contributions prior \n     to January 1, 174, could qualify for treatment as long-term \n     capital gains.\n       Under present law, a taxpayer may elect to have 5-year \n     forward averaging apply to a lump-sum distribution from a \n     qualified plan. Such an election may be made with respect to \n     a distribution received on or after the employee attains age \n     59\\1/2\\ and only one election may be made with respect to an \n     employee.\n       Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 10-year forward \n     averaging was available with respect to lump-sum \n     distributions. The Tax Reform Act replaced 10-year averaging \n     with 5-year averaging and phased out capital gains treatment. \n     The Tax Reform Act provided transition rules which generally \n     preserved prior-law treatment in the case of certain \n     distributions with respect to individuals who attained age 50 \n     before January 1, 1986.\n       Under present law, a taxpayer is not required to include in \n     gross income amounts received in the form of a lump-sum \n     distribution to the extent that the amounts are attributable \n     to net unrealized appreciation in employer securities. Such \n     unrealized appreciation is includable in income when the \n     securities are sold.\n       The bill eliminates 5-year averaging for lump sum \n     distributions from qualified plans, repeals the $5000 \n     employer-provided death benefit exclusion, and simplifies the \n     basis recovery rules applicable to distributions from \n     qualified plans. In addition, the bill modifies the rule that \n     generally requires all participants to commence distributions \n     by age 70\\1/2\\.\n\n Sec. 201. Repeal of 5-Year Income Averaging for Lump-Sum Distributions\n\n       The bill repeals the special 5-year forward averaging rule. \n     The original intent of the income averaging rules for pension \n     distributions was to prevent a bunching of taxable income \n     because a taxpayer received all of the benefits in a \n     qualified plan in a single taxable year. Liberalization of \n     the rollover rules enacted in 1992, as originally part of \n     this bill, increases the flexibility of taxpayers in \n     determining the time of the income inclusion of pension \n     distributions, and eliminates the need for special rules to \n     prevent bunching of income.\n       The bill preserves the transition rules for 10 year \n     averaging adopted in the Tax Reform Act; in addition, the \n     repeal of 5-year averaging is not applicable to individuals \n     eligible for those transition rules. The bill also retains \n     the present-law treatment of net unrealized appreciation on \n     employer securities and generally retains the definition of \n     lump-sum distribution solely for such purpose.\n       The provisions are effective with respect to distributions \n     after December 31, 1995.\n\n   Sec. 202. Simplified Method for Taxing Annuity Distribution Under \n                         Certain Employer Plans\n\n       Under the bill, the portion of an annuity distribution from \n     a qualified retirement plan, qualified annuity, or tax-\n     sheltered annuity that represents nontaxable return of basis \n     generally is determined under a method similar to the \n     present-law simplified alternative method provided by the \n     IRS. Under the simplified method provided in the bill, the \n     portion of each annuity payment that represents nontaxable \n     return of basis generally is equal to the employee's total \n     investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date, \n     divided by the number of anticipated payments determined by \n     reference to the age of the participant listed in the table \n     set forth in the bill. The number of anticipated payments \n     listed in the table is based on the employee's age on the \n     annuity starting date. If the number of payments is fixed \n     under the terms of the annuity, that number is to be used \n     instead of the number of anticipated payments listed in the \n     table.\n       The simplified method does not apply if the primary \n     annuitant has attained age 75 on the annuity starting date \n     unless there are fewer than 5 years of guaranteed payments \n     under the annuity. If in connection with commencement of \n     annuity payments, the recipient receives a lump-sum payment \n     that is not part of the annuity stream, such payment is \n     taxable under the rules relating to annuities (section 72) as \n     if received before the annuity starting data, and the \n     investment in the contract used to calculate the simplified \n     exclusion ratio for the annuity payments is reduced \n     accordingly.\n       As under present law, in no event will the total amount \n     excluded from income as nontaxable return of basis be greater \n     than the recipient's total investment in the contract.\n\n                    Sec. 203. Required Distributions\n\n       Under present law, distributions under all qualified plans, \n     IRAs, tax-sheltered custodial accounts and annuities, and \n     eligible deferred compensation plans of State and local \n     governments are required to begin no later than April 1 of \n     the calendar year following the calendar year in which the \n     participant or owner attains age 70\\1/2\\, without regard to \n     the actual date of separation from service. In the case of \n     church plans and governmental plans, distributions are \n     required to begin no later than the later of the April 1 date \n     described above or April 1 of the calendar year following the \n     calendar year in which the participant retires.\n       The bill repeals the rule that requires all participants in \n     qualified plans to commence distributions by age 70\\1/2\\ \n     without regard to whether the participant is still employed \n     by the employer, and therefore, generally replaces it with \n     the rule in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act. Thus, under \n     the bill, distributions are required to begin by April 1 of \n     the calendar year following the later of (1) the calendar \n     year in which the employee attains age 70\\1/2\\, or (2) the \n     calendar year in which the employee retires. In the case of a \n     5-percent owner of the employer, distributions are required \n     to begin no later than April 1 of the calendar year following \n     the year in which the 5-percent owner attains age 70\\1/2\\. \n     Distributions from an IRA are required to begin no later than \n     April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the \n     IRA owner attains age 70\\1/2\\.\n       In addition, in the case of an employee (other than a 5-\n     percent owner) who retires in a calendar year after attaining \n     age 70\\1/2\\, the bill requires the employee's accrued benefit \n     to be actuarially increased to take into account the period \n     after age 70\\1/2\\ in which the employee was not receiving \n     benefits under the plan. Thus, under the bill, the employee's \n     accrued benefit is required to reflect the value of benefits \n     that the employee would have received if the employee had \n     retired at age 70\\1/2\\ and began receiving benefits at that \n     time.\n       The actuarial adjustment rules does not apply, under the \n     bill, in the case of a governmental plan or church plan.\n       This provision applies to years beginning after December \n     31, 1995.\n\n\n     Title III.--Targeted Access for Employees of Small Employers.\n\n  Sec. 301. Tax Credit for the Cost of Establishing a Plan for Small \n                               Employers\n\n       Retirement plan coverage among employees of small employers \n     is dismally low. The cost of establishing a retirement plan \n     is, in a significant way, disproportionately high for small \n     employers. Many costs of plan establishment--plan design, \n     plan drafting, application for IRS approval--are relatively \n     fixed. Accordingly, the per-employee costs can be much higher \n     for a small employer than for a large employer.\n       Under the proposal, employers with 50 or fewer employees, \n     that have not maintained a qualified retirement plan at any \n     time during the immediately preceding two years, would be \n     eligible for an income tax credit (up to a maximum of $1,000) \n     equal to the cost of establishing a qualified retirement \n     plan.\n\n        Sec. 302. Elimination of the One-High-Paid-Officer Rule\n\n       Under present law, the term highly compensated employee \n     includes the employer's highest paid officer even if no \n     employee in the plan receives over $45,000 (indexed to \n     $60,000 in 1995).\n       The application of the highest paid officer rule is unfair \n     for small employers with low-wage workforces. For example, \n     the highest paid officer of a small employer may earn less \n     than $66,000, yet that employee is highly compensated under \n     this rule. If the same individual less than $66,000 working \n     for a large employer with numerous highly paid employees, \n     that individual would not be defined as highly compensated.\n       Because the individual described above is considered highly \n     compensated, the nondiscrimination rules can severely limit \n     his or her benefits (such as 401(k) contributions). In fact, \n     due to the way the nondiscrimination rules work, these \n     limitations are actually more restrictive for the $30,000-a-\n     year HCE of a small employer than they are for the $150,000-\n     a-year executive of a large employer. These limitations can, \n     in turn, result in the small employer deciding not to \n     establish a plan or deciding to terminate an existing plan.\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\n       Under the bill, no employee would be treated as highly \n     compensated in a year unless he or she received compensation \n     from the employer during the preceding year in excess of \n     $80,000. This proposal would apply not only to officers but \n     also to 5-percent owners.\n       This proposal would, however, be subject to two conditions. \n     First, the proposal would not apply to any plan maintained by \n     the employer unless the plan makes all contributions, \n     benefits, and other plan features available on a \n     nondiscriminatory basis. For this purpose, 5-percent owners \n     would be treated as highly compensated; if there are no 5-\n     percent owners, the highest paid officer for the preceding \n     year would be an HCE.\n       The purpose of the conditions set forth above is to prevent \n     abuse. The conditions would, for example, prevent an employer \n     from establishing a plan solely (or primarily) for the owner.\n       The second condition is that this proposal would not apply \n     to the extent provided in regulations. The purpose of this \n     second condition is to prevent business owners from avoiding \n     HCE status by treating an amount as compensation that is less \n     than reasonable compensation.\n       This provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995, except that for purposes of determining \n     whether an employee is an HCE in years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995, the provision is effective for years \n     beginning after December 31, 1994. Thus, for example, in \n     determining whether an employee is highly compensated for \n     1996 with respect to a calendar year plan, the determination \n     is to be based on whether the employee had compensation \n     during 1995 in excess of $80,000 (not $66,000 which may have \n     been the applicable amount for the employee in 1995 prior to \n     this bill).\n        Sec. 303. Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pensions\n\n       Under present law, a simplified employee pension (SEP) is \n     an individual retirement plan established with respect to an \n     employee that meets certain requirements. Employers with 25 \n     or fewer employees may provide that contributions to a SEP \n     maybe made on a salary reduction basis.\n       The bill conforms the eligibility requirements for SEP \n     participation to the rules applicable to pension plans \n     generally by providing that contributions to a SEP must be \n     made with respect to each employee who has at least one year \n     of service with the employer.\n       The bill adds alternative methods of satisfying the special \n     nondiscrimination requirements for SEPs applicable to \n     elective deferrals and employer matching contributions. These \n     are the same alternative methods or ``safe harbors'' \n     discussed in Title I.-section 104 above, relating to 401(k) \n     plans.\n       Further, the bill modifies the rules relating to salary \n     reducion SEPs by providing that such SEPs may be established \n     by employers with 100 or fewer employees.\n       The bill also repeals the requirement that at least half of \n     eligible employees actually participate in a salary reduction \n     SEP.\n       The provision applies to years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n          Sec. 304. Exemption From Top Heavy Plan Requirements\n\n       In general, under present law, a top-heavy plan is required \n     to satisfy special requirements regarding vesting, minimum \n     benefits or contributions, and section 415. The requirements \n     regarding minimum benefits or contributions are particularly \n     burdensome. For example, a small employer may maintain a plan \n     that permits employees to make section 401(k) contributions \n     and that provides matching contributions on behalf of \n     employees who make the section 401(k) contributions. \n     Generally, if such a plan is top-heavy, all non-key employees \n     must receive nonelective contributions equal to at least 3% \n     of compensation, even though the plan does not otherwise \n     provide for nonelective contributions.\n       The top-heavy plan rules were intended to address \n     situations where an excessive percentage of a plan's \n     retirement benefits is attributable to the highly paid \n     executives and owners of the business. However, the rules \n     actually apply more broadly and are applicable to small \n     businesses where none of the owners and officers of the \n     business is highly paid. In these cases, the top-heavy plan \n     rules place a burden on middle-income individuals solely \n     because they are owners or officers of a small business.\n       Under the bill, if no employee makes over $80,000 (as \n     provided in the bill's new definition of ``highly compensated \n     employee'') in the preceding year, the top-heavy plan \n     requirements do not apply for that year.\n\n    Sec. 305. Tax Exempt Organizations Eligible Under Section 401(k)\n\n       Under present law, tax-exempt organizations are generally \n     prohibited from establishing qualified cash or deferred \n     arrangements (401(k)s). Because of this limitation, many such \n     employers are precluded from maintaining broad-based, funded, \n     elective deferral arrangements for their employees.\n       The bill allows tax-exempt organizations (other than \n     501(c)(3)s, State and Local governments, and their agencies \n     and instrumentalities who have available salary deferral \n     arrangements) to maintain 401(k)s.\n       The provision applies to years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n           Sec. 306. Regulatory Treatment of Small Employers\n\n       Unlike large employers, small employers often do not have \n     the resources to monitor and affect the development of \n     regulations relating to qualified retirement plans. \n     Accordingly, such regulations often do not take into account \n     the unique circumstances of small employers.\n       Under the bill, no IRS regulation relating to a qualified \n     retirement plan could become effective unless the regulation \n     includes a section addressing the special needs of small \n     employers.\n       The provision is effective for regulations issued after \n     date of enactment.\n                     title v.--paperwork reduction.\n\n                    Sec. 401. Repeal Section 415(e)\n\n       Section 415(e) applies an overall limit on benefits and \n     contributions with respect to an individual who participates \n     in both a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit \n     plan maintained by the same employer. These rules are \n     extremely complicated. They are also very burdensome to \n     administer because they require maintaining compensation and \n     contribution records for all employees for all years of \n     service.\n       The section 415(e) limit is not the only limit in the Code \n     that safeguards against an individual accruing excessive \n     retirement benefits on a tax-favored basis. For example, \n     section 401(a)(17) provides for limitations on compensation \n     that can be taken into account for benefits and contributions \n     to qualified plans; section 401 provides extensive \n     nondiscrimination rules; and section 415 provides limits on \n     contributions paid to and benefits paid from qualified plans. \n     Taken in combination, these provisions sufficiently constrain \n     excessive tax-favored benefits accruing to highly compensated \n     employees. In addition, a 15% ``excess distribution'' penalty \n     achieves many of the same goals as Section 415(e).\n       Because Section 415(e) is both cumbersome and duplicative, \n     the bill repeals this provision.\n       The provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n        Sec. 402. Duties of Sponsors of Certain Prototype Plans\n\n       The IRS master and prototype program is an administrative \n     program under which trade and professional associations, \n     banks, insurance companies, brokerage houses, and other \n     financial institutions can obtain IRS approval of model \n     retirement plan language and then make these preapproved \n     plans available for adoption by the customers, investors, or \n     association members.\n       Master and prototype plans reduce the costs and burdens of \n     administering plans, especially for small to medium sized \n     employers, and improve IRS administration of plan rules.\n       Today, a majority of employer-provided qualified plans are \n     approved master and prototype plans. Further expansion of the \n     program is desirable, but statutory authority should be given \n     to the IRS to define the duties of master and prototype \n     sponsors before the program becomes more widely utilized.\n       The bill authorizes the IRS to define the duties of \n     organizations that sponsor master and prototype, regional \n     prototype, and other preapproved plans, including mass \n     submitters. The provision's purpose is to protect employers \n     against the loss of qualification merely because they are \n     unaware of the need to arrange for certain administrative \n     services, or the unavailability of professional assistance \n     from parties familiar with the sponsor's plan. The bill \n     should not be construed as creating fiduciary relationships \n     or responsibilities under Title I of ERISA that would not \n     exist in the absence of the provision.\n\n\n                   title v.--miscellaneous provisions\n\n                Sec. 501. Treatment of Leased Employees\n\n       Under present law, an individual performing services is \n     treated as a leased employee of a service recipient for \n     certain employee benefit purposes if (1) the individual is \n     not a common law employee of the service recipient, (2) the \n     services are provided pursuant to an agreement between the \n     recipient and any other person, (3) the individual performs \n     services for the recipient on a substantially full-time basis \n     for a period of at least one year, and (4) the services are \n     of a type historically performed in the business field of the \n     recipient by employees.\n       The bill replaces the historically performed test with a \n     control test. Thus, under the bill, an individual is a leased \n     employee of a service recipient only if the services are \n     performed by the individual under the control of the \n     recipient.\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 1995.\n           Sec. 501. Plans Covering Self-Employed Individuals\n\n       Prior to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of \n     1982 (TEFRA) different rules applied to retirement plans \n     maintained by incorporated employers and unincorporated \n     employers (such as partnerships and sole proprietors). In \n     general, plans maintained by unincorporated employers were \n     subject to special rules in addition to the other \n     qualification requirements of the Code. TEFRA eliminated \n     most, but not all, of this disparity.\n       Under present law, certain special aggregation rules apply \n     to plans maintained by owner-employers that do not apply to \n     other qualified plans (sec. 401(d) (1) and (2)). The bill \n     eliminates these special rules.\n       The provision applies to years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n Sec. 503. Elimination of Special Vesting Rule for Multiemployer Plans\n\n       Under present law, except in the case of multiemployer \n     plans, a plan is not a qualified plan unless a participant's \n     employer-\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n     provided benefit vests at least as rapidly as under 1 of 2 alternative \n     minimum vesting schedules. A plan satisfies the first \n     schedule if a participant acquires a nonforfeitable right to \n     100 percent of the participant's accrued benefit derived from \n     employer contributions upon the participant's completion of 5 \n     years of service.\n       A plan satisfies the second schedule if a participant has a \n     nonforfeitable right to at least 20 percent of the \n     participant's accrued benefit derived from employer \n     contributions after 3 years of service, 40 percent at the end \n     of 4 years of service, 60 percent at the end of 5 years of \n     service, 80 percent a the end of 6 years of service, and 100 \n     percent at the end of 7 years of service.\n       In the case of a multiemployer plan, a participant's \n     accrued benefit derived from employer contributions is \n     required to be 100 percent vested no later than upon the \n     participant's completion of 10 years of service. This special \n     rule applies only to employees covered by the plan pursuant \n     to a collective bargaining agreement.\n       The bill conforms the vesting rules for multiemployer plans \n     to the rules applicable to other qualified plans.\n       The provision is effective for plan years beginning on or \n     after the earlier of (1) the later of January 1, 1996, or the \n     date on which the last of the collective bargaining \n     agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained \n     terminates, or (2) January 1, 1998, with respect to \n     participants with an hour of service after the effective \n     date.\n\n       Sec. 504. Full Funding Limitation of Multi-Employer Plans\n\n       Under present law, a deduction is allowed (within limits) \n     for employer contributions to a qualified pension plan. No \n     deduction is allowed for contributions in excess of the full \n     funding limit. The full funding limit is the excess, if any, \n     of (1) the lesser of (a) the accrued liability under the plan \n     (including normal cost) or (b) 150 percent of a plan's \n     current liability, over (2) the lesser of (a) the fair market \n     value of the plan's assets or (b) the actuarial value of the \n     plan's assets.\n       Plans subject to the minimum funding rules are required to \n     make an actuarial valuation of the plan not less frequently \n     than annually.\n       The bill provides that the 150 percent of current liability \n     limitation does not apply to multi-employer plans. Consistent \n     with this change, the bill also repeals the present law \n     annual valuation requirement for multi-employer plans and \n     applies the prior law requirement that valuations be \n     performed at least every 3 years.\n       The provision applies to years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n             Sec. 505. Alternative full-funding limitation\n\n       The Secretary may, under regulations, adjust the 150-\n     percent figure contained in the full funding limitation to \n     take into account the average age (and length of service, if \n     appropriate) of the participants in the plan (weighed by the \n     value of their benefits under the plan). In addition, the \n     Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations that apply, \n     in lieu of the 150 percent of current liability limitation, a \n     different full funding limitation based on factors other than \n     current liability. The Secretary may exercise this authority \n     only in a manner so that in the aggregate, the effect on \n     Federal budge receipts is substantially identical to the \n     effect of the 150-percent full funding limitation.\n       The bill provides that an employer may elect to disregard \n     the 150-percent limitation if each plan in the employer's \n     control group is not top-heavy and the average accrued \n     liability of active participants under the plan for the \n     immediately preceding 5 plan years is at least 80-percent of \n     the plan's total accrued liability (the ``alternative full \n     funding limitation''). The Secretary is required to adjust \n     the 150-percent full funding limitation (in the manner \n     specified under the bill) for employers that do not use the \n     alternative full funding limit to ensure that the election by \n     employers to disregard the 150-percent limit does not result \n     in a substantial reduction in Federal revenues for any fiscal \n     year.\n       Under the bill, employers electing to apply the alternative \n     limitation generally must notify the Secretary by January 1 \n     of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     election period begins. The provision is effective on January \n     1, 1997.\n\nSec. 506. Affiliation Requirements for Employers Jointly Maintaining a \n                                  VEBA\n\n       Treasury regulations require that employees eligible to \n     participate in a voluntary employees' beneficiary association \n     (``VEBA'') share an employment-related common bond. Under the \n     regulations, employees employed by a ``common employer (or \n     affiliated employers)'' are considered to have such a bond.\n       Under the bill, employers are considered affiliated for \n     purposes of the VEBA rules if (1) such employers are in the \n     same line of business, (2) the employers act jointly to \n     perform tasks that are integral to the activities of each of \n     the employers, and (3) such joint activities are sufficiently \n     extensive that the maintenance of a common VEBA is not a \n     major part of such joint activities.\n       Under the bill, employers are considered affiliated, for \n     example, in the following circumstances: the employers \n     participating in the VEBA are in the same line of business \n     and belong to an association that provides to its members a \n     significant amount of each of the following services: (1) \n     research and development relating to the members' primary \n     activity; (2) education and training of members' employees; \n     and (3) public relations. In addition, the employers are \n     sufficiently similar (e.g., subject to similar regulatory \n     requirements) that the association's services provide \n     material assistance to all of the employers. The employers \n     also demonstrate the importance of their joint activities by \n     having meetings at least annually attended by substantially \n     all of the employers. Finally, the employers maintain a \n     common retirement plan.\n       On the other hand, it is not intended that the mere \n     existence of a trade association is a sufficient basis for \n     the member-employees to be considered affiliated, even if \n     they are in the same line of business. It is also not \n     sufficient if the trade association publishes a newsletter \n     and provides significant public relations services, but only \n     provides nominal amounts, if any, of other services integral \n     to the employers' primary activity.\n       A group of employers are also not considered affiliated \n     under the bill by virtue of the membership of their employees \n     in a professional association.\n       This bill is intended as a clarification of present law, \n     but is not intended to create any inference as to whether any \n     part of the Treasury regulations affecting VEBAs, other than \n     the affiliated employer rule, is or is not present law.\n\n  Sec. 507. Treatment of Certain Governmental Plans under Section 415\n\n       Under present law, the limitations on benefits and \n     contributions (section 415) generally apply to plans \n     maintained by State and local governments.\n       Under present law, unfunded deferred compensation plans \n     maintained by State and local government employers are \n     subject to certain limitations (sec. 457). For example, such \n     plans generally may not permit deferred compensation in \n     excess of $7,500 in a single year.\n       The limitations on contributions and benefits present \n     special problems for plans maintained by State and local \n     governments due to the special nature of the involvement and \n     operation of such governments.\n       The bill addresses these problems by providing that (1) \n     section 457 does not apply to excess benefit plans maintained \n     by a State or local government, (2) the compensation \n     limitation on benefits under a defined benefit pension plan \n     does not apply to plans maintained by a State or local \n     government, and (3) the defined benefit pension plan limits \n     do not apply to certain disability and survivor benefits \n     provided under such plans. Excess plans maintained by a State \n     or local government are subject to the same tax rules \n     applicable to such plans maintained by private employers.\n       Under present law, benefits under a defined benefit plan \n     generally may not exceed 100 percent of the participant's \n     average compensation. However, because of the unique \n     characteristics of State and local government employee plans, \n     many long-tenured and relatively low-paid employees may be \n     eligible to receive benefits in excess of their average \n     compensation as a result of cost-of-living increases. The \n     bill provides that the 100 percent of compensation limitation \n     does not apply to plans maintained by State and local \n     governments.\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning on \n     or after the date of enactment. Governmental plans are \n     treated as if in compliance with the requirements of section \n     415 for years beginning on or before the date of enactment.\n\n Sec. 508. Treatment of Deferred Compensation Plans of State and Local \n                Governments and Tax-Exempt Organizations\n\n       Under a section 457 plan, an employee who elects to defer \n     the receipt of current compensation will be taxed on the \n     amounts deferred when such amounts are paid or made \n     available. The maximum annual deferral under such a plan is \n     the lesser of (1) $7500 or (2) 33\\1/2\\ percent of \n     compensation (net of the deferral).\n       In general, amounts deferred under a section 457 plan may \n     not be made available to an employee before the earlier of \n     (1) the calendar year in which the participant attains age \n     70\\1/2\\, (2) when the participant is separated from service \n     with the employer, or (3) when the participant is faced with \n     an unforeseeable emergency. Amounts that are made available \n     to an employee upon separation from service are includable in \n     gross income in the taxable year in which they are made \n     available.\n       Under present law, benefits under a section 457 plan are \n     not treated as made available if the participant may elect to \n     receive a lump sum payable after separation from service and \n     within 60 days of the election. This exception to the general \n     rules is available only if the total amount payable to the \n     participant under the plan does not exceed $3500 and no \n     additional amounts may be deferred under the plan with \n     respect to the participant.\n       The bill makes three changes. First, the bill permits in-\n     service distributions of accounts that do not exceed $3500 if \n     no amount has been deferred under the plan with respect to \n     the account for 2 years and there has been no prior \n     distribution under this cash-out rule.\n       Second, the bill increases the number of elections that can \n     be made with respect to the time distributions must begin \n     under the plan. The bill provides that the amount payable to \n     a participant under a 457 plan is not to be treated as made \n     available merely because the participant may elect to defer \n     commencement of distributions under the plan if (1) the \n     election is made after amounts may be distributed under the \n     plan but before \n\n[[Page S9532]]\n     the actual commencement of benefits, and (2) the participant makes only \n     1 such additional election. This additional election is \n     permitted without the need for financial hardship, and the \n     election can only be to a date that is after the date \n     originally selected by the participant.\n       Finally, the bill provides for indexing of the dollar limit \n     on deferrals.\n       The provisions are effective for taxable years beginning \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n        Sec. 509. Contributions on Behalf of Disabled Employees\n\n       Under present law, special limitations on contributions to \n     a defined contribution plan apply in the case of certain \n     disabled participants. In particular, the compensation of a \n     disabled participant in a defined contribution plan is \n     treated, for purposes on the limitations or contributions and \n     benefits, as the compensation the participant received before \n     becoming disabled if (1) the participant is permanently and \n     totally disabled (within the meaning of sec. 22(c)(3)), (2) \n     the participant is not a highly compensated employee, and (3) \n     the employer elects to have this special rule apply.\n       The bill makes requirements (2) and (3) inapplicable if the \n     defined contribution plan provides for the continuation of \n     contributions on behalf of all participants who are \n     permanently and totally disabled.\n       It is not intended, however, that an employer be able to \n     provide contributions on behalf of all disabled participants \n     only during certain years so as to favor highly compensated \n     participants over nonhighly compensated participants. \n     Accordingly, if an employer provides for contributions on \n     behalf of all disabled participants and subsequently amends \n     its plan to delete such contributions, the plan shall cease \n     to be qualified if the timing of the amendment results in \n     discrimination in favor of highly compensated participants.\n       The provision applies to years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n    Sec. 510. Technical Clarifications of Section 401(k) for Rural \n                           Cooperative Plans\n\n       Under present law, a qualified section 401(k) arrangement \n     must be a part of one of the following: a profit-sharing or \n     stock bonus plan, a pre-ERISA money purchase plan, or a rural \n     cooperative plan.\n       A ``rural cooperative plan'' is defined generally to mean a \n     defined contribution pension plan that is maintained by a \n     rural cooperative. with respect to rural electric \n     cooperatives, a rural cooperative is generally defined to \n     mean any organization that (1) is tax-exempt or is a State or \n     local government, and (2) ``is engaged primarily in providing \n     electric service on a mutual or cooperative basis.''\n       Present law was clearly intended to permit the rural \n     electric cooperatives to continue to maintain their section \n     401(k) plan. However, there are two technical issues that \n     should be clarified in order to better achieve this \n     objective.\n       First, in the vast majority of states, rural electric \n     systems are organized as cooperatives. However, in some \n     states, some utilities are organized as public power \n     districts. Public power districts are subdivisions of a state \n     that provide electric service. Thus, they would clearly fall \n     within the definition of a rural cooperative but for the \n     requirement that a rural cooperative provide electric service \n     ``on a mutual or cooperative basis.''\n       This requirement is not further defined in the statute or \n     regulations. Accordingly, some concern is warranted with \n     respect to whether a public power district satisfies this \n     requirement since they are political subdivisions of a state \n     and do not have the member ownership traditionally required \n     for mutual or cooperative status.\n       Secondly, many rural electric cooperatives participate in a \n     multiple employer money purchase pension plan that contains a \n     section 401(k) arrangement. This multiple employer plan must \n     fit within the definition of a rural cooperative plan in \n     order for the section 401(k) arrangement to be qualified. An \n     issue therefore arises due to the fact that the definition of \n     a ``rural cooperative'' does not include taxable \n     cooperatives. Although the vast majority of rural electric \n     cooperatives are tax-exempt, some within these multiple \n     employer plans are taxable. It is unclear whether this would \n     cause the section 401(k) arrangement in the multiple employer \n     plan to fail to be qualified with respect to the \n     participating taxable cooperatives.\n       The bill clarifies both of these potential problems by \n     providing that the definition of a ``rural cooperative'' \n     would be modified to include, in addition, any other \n     organization that is providing electric service. However, \n     this expansion of the definition would only apply with \n     respect to section 401(k) plans in which substantially all of \n     the employers fit within the present-law definition of a \n     rural cooperative. This limitation prevents unintended \n     expansion of the term ``rural cooperative plan.''\n       In addition, under present law, unlike all other section \n     401(k) plans (other than certain pre-ERISA plans), rural \n     cooperative plans are not permitted to make in-service \n     distributions for hardship or after age 59-\\1/2\\. Under the \n     proposal, rural cooperative plans would be permitted to make \n     such distributions after the date of enactment.\n\n               Sec. 511. Rules for Plans Covering Pilots\n\n       Under present law, employees covered by a collective \n     bargaining agreement are excluded from consideration in \n     testing whether a qualified retirement plan satisfies the \n     minimum coverage and non discrimination requirements (section \n     410(b)(3)). Similarly, in the case of a plan established \n     pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between airline \n     pilots and one or more employers, all employees not covered \n     by the collective bargaining agreement are disregarded for \n     purposes of testing whether the plan satisfies the minimum \n     coverage and nondiscrimination requirements (section \n     410(b)(3)(B)). This provision applies only in the case of a \n     plan that provides contributions or benefits for employees \n     whose principal duties are customarily performed abroad \n     aircraft in flight. Thus, a collectively bargained plan \n     covering only airline pilots in tested separately from \n     employees who are not air pilots.\n       The bill provides that, in the case of a plan established \n     to provide contributions or benefits for air pilots employed \n     by one or more common carriers engaged in interstate or \n     foreign commerce on air pilots employed by carriers \n     transporting mail for or under contract with the United \n     States Government, all employees who are not air pilots are \n     excluded from consideration in testing whether the plan \n     satisfies the minimum coverage requirements (whether or not \n     they are covered by a collective bargaining agreement).\n       The provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n                       Sec. 512. Tenured Faculty\n\n       Present law section 457 governs and provides limits for \n     nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of a \n     governmental or tax-exempt employers. Under section 457(f), \n     an individual is taxed on the value of the benefits under an \n     ineligible arrangement when there is no risk of forfeiture of \n     the benefit, rather than when any benefit is received. Risk \n     of forfeiture is generally tied to the performance of future \n     services. For example, if an employer adopted an early \n     retirement incentive to pay a yearly supplement of $10,000 \n     over 5 years, the retiree will be taxed on the present value \n     of the full $50,000 in the year of retirement notwithstanding \n     the fact that he only received a payment of $10,000.\n       Under the bill, ``eligible faculty voluntary retirement \n     incentive plans'' are not subject to the taxation provisions \n     of section 457(f). Payments under such plans will be taxed \n     when they are made available to participants, rather than \n     when a risk of forfeiture lapses. An ``eligible faculty \n     voluntary retirement incentive plan'' means a plan \n     established for employees serving under contracts of \n     unlimited tenure at an institution of higher learning. Total \n     benefits under the contract cannot exceed two times annual \n     compensation, and all payments must be completed over a five-\n     year period.\n       The provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n                    Sec. 513. Uniform Retirement Age\n\n       A qualified plan generally must provide that payment of \n     benefits under the plan must begin no later than 60 days \n     after the end of the plan year in which the participant \n     reaches age 65. Also, for purposes of the vesting and benefit \n     accrual rules, normal retirement age generally can be no \n     later than age 65. For purposes of applying the limits on \n     contributions and benefits (section 415), social security \n     retirement age is generally used as retirement age. The \n     social security retirement age as used for such purposes is \n     presently age 65, but is scheduled to gradually increase.\n       The bill provides that for purposes of the general \n     nondiscrimination rule, the social security retirement age is \n     a uniform retirement age and that subsidized early retirement \n     benefits and joint and survivor annuities are not treated as \n     not being available to employees on the same terms merely \n     because they are based on an employee's social security \n     retirement age.\n       The provision is effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n           Sec. 514. Reports of Pension and Annuity Payments\n\n       The penalty reform provisions of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1989 revised the penalties imposed for \n     failures to file correct and timely information returns to \n     IRS, and to provide statements to payees. This revised \n     penalty structure applies to 18 different types of reportable \n     payments. Section 6724(d)(1).\n       However, this developed structure does not apply to reports \n     of pension and annuity payments required under section \n     6047(d). It also does not apply to certain reports required \n     by sections 408(i) and 408(l) relating to IRAs and SEPs.\n       The bill provides that the definition of ``information \n     return'' under section 6724(d) includes reports of pension \n     and annuity payments required by section 6047(d), and any \n     report required under subsection (i) or (l) of section 408.\n       Similarly, the definition of ``payee statement'' under \n     section 6724(d)(2) is amended to include reports of pension \n     and annuity payments required by section 6047(d) and any \n     report required under subsection (i) or (1) of section 408. \n     The bill provides that section 6652(e) is amended to delete \n     reports of designated distributions from the scope of its $25 \n     per day penalty.\n       Under present law, interest and dividend payments do not \n     have to be reported if less than $10 is paid to a person in \n     any year. Miscellaneous income need not be reported unless it \n     exceeds $600. However, the law currently contains no dollar \n     threshold for reports of ``designated distributions''--\n     primarily pension and annuity payments. The bill provides a \n     $10 reporting threshold for designated distributions.\n     \n[[Page S9533]]\n\n\n         Sec. 515. National Commission on Private Pension Plans\n\n       In 1974, Congress first recognized the importance of the \n     Federal Government taking an active role in creating a system \n     where American workers could earn private pension benefits to \n     supplement Social Security and ensuring that promised pension \n     benefits are paid. It did this by passing the Employment \n     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n       Today, our private pension system works by delivering \n     trillions of dollars to retiring American workers. However, \n     since its enactment in 1974, ERISA has become more and more \n     complex, and the administrative costs of maintaining a \n     pension plan has risen substantially.\n       The bill will authorize the Commission (six members \n     appointed by the President, six by the Speaker of the House, \n     and six by the Senate Majority Leader) to review existing \n     Federal incentives and programs that encourage and protect \n     private retirement savings and set forth recommendations \n     where appropriate for increasing the level and security of \n     private retirement savings.\n\n             Sec. 516. Date for Adoption of Plan Amendments\n\n       The bill provides that any plan amendment required by the \n     bill are not required to be made before the first plan year \n     beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the plan is \n     operated in accordance with the applicable provision and the \n     amendment is retroactive to the effective date of the \n     applicable provision. In the case of state and local \n     governmental plans, plan requirements are required to be made \n     on the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1999.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1008.

A bill to prohibit the fraudulent production, sale, \ntransportation, or possession of fictitious items purporting to be \nvalid financial instruments of the United States, foreign governments, \nStates, political subdivisions, or private organizations, to increase \nthe penalties for counterfeiting violations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the financial instruments anti-fraud act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am today introducing the \nFinancial Instruments Anti-Fraud Act of 1995.\n  This legislation combats the use of factitious financial instruments \nto defraud individual investors, banks, pension funds, and charities. \nThese fictitious instruments have been called many names, including \nprime bank notes, prime bank derivatives, prime bank guarantees, \nJapanese yen bonds, Indonesian promissory notes, U.S. Treasury \nwarrants, and U.S. dollar notes. Fictitious financial instruments have \ncaused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.\n  Mr. President, these frauds have been perpetrated by antigovernment \ngroups such as the Posse Comitatus and ``We the People,'' which use \nfictitious financial instruments to fund their violent activities. In \nthe wake of the terrible tragedy in Oklahoma City, I hope my colleagues \nwill support legislation that will cut the purse strings of these \norganizations.\n  Because these fictitious instruments are not counterfeits of any \nexisting negotiable instrument, Federal prosecutors have determined \nthat the manufacture, possession, or utterance of these instruments \ndoes not violate the counterfeit or bank fraud provisions contained in \nchapters 25 and 65 of title 18 of the United States Code. The \nperpetrators of these frauds can be prosecuted under existing Federal \nlaw only \n\n[[Page S9534]]\nif they used the mails or wires, or violated the bank fraud statute.\n  Mr. President, we have worked closely with the Treasury Department \nand various U.S. Attorneys' Offices to prepare the Financial \nInstruments Anti-Fraud Act of 1995. This bill makes it a violation of \nFederal law to possess, pass, utter, publish, or sell, with intent to \ndefraud, any items purporting to be negotiable instruments of the U.S. \nGovernment, a foreign government, a State entity, or a private entity. \nIt closes a loophole in Federal counterfeiting law.\n  Fictitious financial instruments are typically produced in very large \ndenominations and purport to offer very high rates of return. Promoters \nof these schemes claim that they have exclusive access to secret \nwholesale markets paying 25 percent or more to investors. The June 13, \n1994, issue of Business Week reported that innocent investors, \nincluding the National Council of Churches and Salvation Army, lost \nhundreds of millions of dollars in a scam involving bogus guarantees \nissued by the Czech Republic's Banka Bohemia.\n  Mr. President, organized terrorist and militia groups are \ndistributing do-it-yourself kits that provide the materials and \ninstructions for members of such organizations to produce phony money \norder and securities. These antisocial groups seek to undermine the \nsoundness of the U.S. financial system, and to raise funds to advance \ntheir violent, radical agenda. They claim, for example, that the IRS is \na tool of Zionist international bankers and advocate violent \nconfrontation with Federal law enforcement agents.\n  Drug traffickers also rely on fictitious financial investment \ninstruments. Some West African organized criminal syndicates, for \ninstance, use these instruments to fund their thriving heroin trade.\n  In addition to combating the use of fictitious financial investment \ninstruments, this legislation correct a technical error that occurred \nwhen the Congress enacted the Counterfeit Deterrence Act of 1992. \nCongress intended this bill to increase penalties for counterfeit \nviolations. As a result of a drafting error, however, the 1992 \nlegislation actually lowered criminal penalties for counterfeiting.\n  This bill imposes criminal penalties for the production and sale of \nfictitious instruments. These penalties are identical to those imposed \nfor counterfeiting. Criminals found guilty under these sections will \nfact up to 25 years in prison.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge passage of the Financial Instruments \nAnti-Fraud Act of 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 1010. A bill to amend the ``unit of general local government'' \ndefinition for Federal payments in lieu of taxes to include unorganized \nboroughs in Alaska and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                            pilt legislation\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska shoulders more than its \nfair share of the Federal lands. Federal lands are costly to State and \nlocal governments, which cannot impose a property tax on the Federal \nGovernment. Also, we are not able to develop the Federal lands to \nproduce jobs and strengthen our economy.\n  The Payments In Lieu of Taxes [PILT] program provides Federal funds \nto local governments which have tax-exempt Federal lands within their \nboundaries. PILT funding is designed to relieve the fiscal burden on \nlocal governments which Federal lands impose by severely reducing the \nproperty tax base. Under the act directing PILT payments, the Secretary \nof the Interior makes annual payments to each unit of general local \ngovernment within which Federal lands are located.\n  Despite Alaska's stature as the largest State in the Union and \ndespite the millions of Federal acres in Alaska, Alaska is currently \nonly the 10th highest PILT recipient. This is because the definition of \n``unit of general local government'' includes only organized boroughs \nand certain independent cities in Alaska. Yet over 60 percent of Alaska \nand 60 percent of the Federal lands are located outside of any \norganized borough.\n  I cannot over-emphasize this point. Only 40 percent of the Federal \nlands in Alaska are located in organized boroughs. Over half of the \nFederal lands in Alaska, 60 percent, are not currently considered in \ndetermining PILT payments to Alaska. Therefore, hundreds of poor rural \nAlaskan communities which are surrounded by Federal lands, but which \nare outside of organized boroughs, receive no PILT payments. Most of \nthese villages lack adequate sewer and water systems and do not have \nhealth facilities within 200 or 300 miles.\n  Last year, I introduced a bill to include Federal lands which are not \nwithin organized boroughs or independent cities. That legislation, \nwhich the Senate passed, would have accomplished this by correcting an \ninequity in the present definition of ``unit of general local \ngovernment'' for the purpose of determining PILT payments to include \nunorganized boroughs. Today, I am introducing a similar bill.\n  This bill will resolve a great injustice. The villages in Alaska that \nare surrounded by tax-exempt Federal lands should be compensated for \nloss of property tax revenues and for the inability to use the lands \nfor any development. The increase in Alaskan PILT payments will \ndirectly benefit villages which are in desperate need of resources to \nsustain basic necessities for their remote existence.\n  Currently, the local governments in Alaska receive about $4.5 million \na year from PILT. Under this legislation, the funds the State and \nvillages receive would increase by about $2.5 million under the \ncorrected PILT program. $2.5 million a year will only begin to improve \nthe living conditions in the villages--but it will help. And it is \nmuch-needed.\n  This bill will not increase the current entitlement ceiling of PILT. \nIt will only change the way the PILT fund is divided. It will provide a \nsmall additional share of the PILT fund distribution to those Alaskan \ncommunities that are outside organized boroughs.\n  This legislation also will not reduce other States' PILT funding by \nvery much because PILT calculations include population statistics. \nTherefore, Alaska will never receive as much as some of the Western \nStates with high populations and relatively high Federal acreage.\n  It is a matter of fairness--60 percent of the Federal lands in Alaska \nare not included under current PILT calculations. Alaska is the only \nState not fully compensated for all of its Federal lands. Even the \nterritories and the District of Columbia are fully compensated.\n  I would appreciate the support of the other Senators to see that \nAlaska finally receives PILT funds for all of the Federal lands in the \nState--not just 40 percent of them.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1011. A bill to help reduce the cost of credit to farmers by \nproviding relief from antiquated and unnecessary regulatory burdens for \nthe Farm Credit System, and for other purposes.\n\n\n              The Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief Act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the Farm \nCredit System Regulatory Relief Act of 1995. I am pleased that my \ncolleague, Senator Heflin along with the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar and Leahy, join me as \noriginal cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief Act of 1995 will provide for \nthe elimination, consistent with safety and soundness requirements, of \nall regulations that are unnecessary, unduly burdensome or costly, or \nnot based on statute.\n  The Farm Credit System supplies about 25 percent of the credit \nprovided to American producers and more than 80 percent of the credit \nprovided to agricultural cooperatives. The cost of this credit is \nincreased by unnecessary regulations. The increasingly competitive \nglobal market combined with the decreasing role of the Federal \nGovernment in agricultural support programs necessitates that farmers \nand ranchers have continued access to competitive sources of financial \ncapital.\n  There are 8 Farm Credit System banks and approximately 230 locally \nowned farm credit associations located across all 50 of the United \nStates. If the Farm Credit System is to remain the \n\n[[Page S9535]]\nviable financial partner for American agriculture that it is, then the \ntime is now to make these significant revisions. Mr. President, I would \nalso emphasize for the record that this piece of legislation is simply \nand solely regulatory relief, it does not provide the Farm Credit \nSystem with any additional or expanded lending authorities.\n  The changes, as I have outlined in the attached section-by-section \nsummary, are an important step toward ensuring that our American \nfarmers will be able to obtain competitive loan rates and better \nservice from the Farm Credit System.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nanalysis of this bill along with a letter from the Farm Credit \nAdministration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n   The Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief Act of 1995--Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1: Short title; table of contents: The short title \n     is the ``Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2: References to the Farm Credit Act of 1971: As \n     used in this bill, all references, unless otherwise noted, \n     are references to the ``Farm Credit Act of 1971.''\n       Section 3: Regulatory Review: This section describes the \n     findings of Congress regarding recent efforts by the Farm \n     Credit Administration (FCA) to reduce regulatory burden on \n     Farm Credit System institutions. This section also directs \n     FCA to continue its efforts to eliminate, consistent with \n     safety and soundness, all regulations that are unnecessary, \n     unduly burdensome or costly, or not based on statute.\n       Section 4: Examination of Farm Credit System Institutions: \n     Under current law, the Farm Credit Administration has the \n     authority to examine System direct lender institutions \n     whenever and as often as the agency chooses, but not less \n     than once every year. This section would grant the FCA \n     flexibility to extend the length of time between mandatory \n     examinations to 18 months. This section would not apply to \n     Federal Land Bank Associations, which under current law are \n     only mandated for examination every three years.\n       Nothing in this section would affect FCA's ability to \n     examine any System institution at any time the regulator \n     deems necessary. Likewise, this section would not affect the \n     specific technical requirements of FCA's examinations or the \n     Agency's enforcement authorities.\n       This section is designed to reduce examination costs for \n     well-captialized System institutions while fully preserving \n     FCA's existing safety and soundness oversight authorities.\n       Section 5; Farm Credit Insurance Fund Operations. This \n     section would authorize the Farm Credit System Insurance \n     Corporation (FCSIC) to allocate to System banks excess \n     interest earnings generated by the Farm Credit Insurance Fund \n     once the Fund reaches the secure base amount. At the same \n     time, until the excess interest earnings are rebated to \n     system banks, which would not begin until five years after \n     the secure base amount is reached, any uses of the Fund would \n     could first from the allocated earnings held in the Fund. \n     Only after such allocated amounts were exhausted would funds \n     from the secure base amount be used.\n       Current law requires the FCSIC to assess premiums until \n     such time as the aggregate amount in the Farm Credit \n     Insurance Fund (The Fund) equals the secure base amount. The \n     secure base amount is defined as an amount equal to 2 percent \n     of the insured liabilities of the Farm Credit System, or such \n     other amount determined by FCSIC to be actuarially sound. \n     Once the secure base is reached (expected in early 1997), \n     premiums can be suspended. However, FSCIC does not have the \n     authority to address the excess interest earnings that will \n     continue to build above the secure base amount.\n       This section would allow the eventual rebate of this excess \n     interest to those institutions that have paid insurance \n     premiums based on a three-year running average of their \n     accruing loan volume. This section would also authorize, but \n     not require, FCSIC to reduce insurance premiums as the \n     Insurance Fund approaches the 2 percent secure base amount.\n       Section 6: Powers with Respect to Troubled Insured System \n     Banks: This section would require FCSIC to implement the \n     least costly of all alternatives available to it, including \n     an assisted merger, as it considers options for providing \n     assistance to a troubled System institution. It would also \n     make clear that the directorship and management of an \n     assisted institution serves at the discretion of and is \n     subject to the approval of FCSIC. Current law permits FCSIC \n     to provide ``open-bank'' assistance to a troubled System \n     institution if such assistance is merely less costly than \n     liquidation, and also permits FCSIC to ignore this least-cost \n     restriction altogether in certain limited circumstances. \n     Current law also permits FCSIC to provide financial support \n     to a troubled institution without any requirement that the \n     operations or management of that institution be materially \n     changed. Failure to amend current authorities could lead to \n     open-ended cost to the Farm Credit Insurance fund, and \n     potentially result in additional costs to other, healthy FCS \n     institutions.\n       Section 7: Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation Board \n     of Directors: This section would retain the current structure \n     of the FCSIC Board by removing provisions of current law \n     requiring a new FCSIC Board structure. Currently, the FCSIC \n     board is comprised of the three board members of the Farm \n     Credit Administration. The Chairman of FCSIC is elected by \n     the board and must be someone other than the FCA chairman. \n     Effective January 1, 1996, current law requires the \n     establishment of a new, full-time presidentially-appointed, \n     three-person board completely separate and independent from \n     the FCA board. This section would remove the provision in \n     current law and would result in the retention of the FCA \n     board as the FCSIC board.\n       Section 8: Conservatorships and Receiverships: This section \n     makes a conforming change to clarify that FCSIC can act in \n     the capacity of a receiver or conservator of a System \n     institution.\n       Section 9: Examinations by the Farm Credit System Insurance \n     Corporation: This section provides that once the Farm Credit \n     Administration cancels the charter of a System institution \n     that is in receivership, FCSIC shall have exclusive authority \n     to examine the institution.\n       Section 10: Oversight and Regulatory Actions by the Farm \n     Credit System Insurance Corporation: This section provides \n     that the Farm Credit Administration shall consult with FCSIC \n     before approving any debt issuances by a System bank that \n     fails to meet the minimum capital levels set by FCA. This \n     section also provides for consultation with FCSIC before the \n     Farm Credit Administration approves a proposed merger or \n     restructuring of a System bank or large association that does \n     not meet FCA's minimum capital levels. Finally, the section \n     grants FCSIC similar authority to that of the FDIC to \n     prohibit any golden parachute payment of indemnification \n     payment by a System institution that is in a troubled \n     condition.\n       Section 11: Formation of Administrative Service Entities: \n     This section would allow Farm Credit System associations to \n     establish administrative service entities. These entities \n     would not be permitted to perform activities or carry out \n     functions not currently authorized by statute. Under current \n     law, Farm Credit System banks can form such entities under \n     Section 4.25 of the Farm Credit Act. This section would \n     extend that authority to FCS associations, although an entity \n     organized under this section would have no authority either \n     to extend credit or provide insurance services to Farm Credit \n     System borrowers, nor would it have any greater authority \n     with respect to functions and services than the organizing \n     assocaiton or associations possess under the Farm Credit Act.\n       Section 12: Requirements for Loans Sold into the Secondary \n     Market: This section would make inapplicable the borrower \n     rights requirements of current law, and allow System banks \n     and associations to change their bylaws to make inapplicable \n     the borrower stock requirements of current law, for any loan \n     specifically originated for sale into the secondary market. \n     Under current law, Farm Credit borrowers are required to buy \n     and maintain stock or participation certificates in the \n     System institution which originated their loan, even when the \n     loan was originated with the express intent of selling it \n     into the secondary market.\n       In addition, System loans to farmers are covered by the \n     borrower rights provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act of \n     1987. This section would allow System institutions to waive \n     these requirements for loans that are originated for sale \n     into the secondary market. If loans designated for sale into \n     the secondary market are not sold within one year, the \n     relevant borrower stock and borrower rights requirements \n     would again apply.\n       The borrower stock provisions of this section would apply \n     whether or not the bank or association retains a subordinated \n     participation interest in a loan or pool of loans or \n     contributes to a cash reserve pursuant to title VIII of the \n     Farm Credit Act.\n       Section 13: Removal of Antiquated and Unnecessary Paperwork \n     Requirements:\n       Compensation of Association Personnel: This section would \n     remove the requirement in current law that Farm Credit System \n     banks approve the appointment and compensation of association \n     CEOs.\n       Use of Private Mortgage Insurance: This section would allow \n     a rural home loan borrower to obtain financing in excess of \n     85 percent of the value of the real estate collateral \n     pledged, provided the borrower obtains private mortgage \n     insurance for the amount in excess of 85 percent. Under \n     current statute, Farm Credit System institutions can only \n     lend up to 85 percent of the value of the real estate \n     security unless federal, state, or government agency \n     guarantees are obtained.\n       Removal of Certain Borrower Reporting Requirements: This \n     section would repeal the provision of current law which \n     requires all long-term mortgage borrowers to provide updated \n     financial statements every three years, regardless of the \n     status of the borrower's loan.\n       Disclosure Relating to Adjustable Rate Loans: For loans not \n     subject to the Truth-In-Lending Act, current regulation \n     requires Farm Credit System institutions to notify a borrower \n     of any increase in the interest rate applicable to the \n     borrower's loan at least 10\n      \n\n[[Page S9536]]\n     days in advance of the effective date of the change. For adjustable \n     rate loans that are based on an underlying index (such as \n     prime), this requirement is impossible to fulfill.\n       This section would permit notice of a change in the \n     borrower's interest rate to be given within a reasonable time \n     after the effective date of an increase or decrease.\n       Joint Management Agreements: This section would remove the \n     requirement in current law that both stockholders and the \n     Farm Credit Administration approve joint management \n     agreements, thereby leaving such decisions to the discretion \n     of the boards of directors of the institutions involved.\n       Dissemination of Quarterly Reports: This section would \n     require that regulations issued by the Farm Credit \n     Administration governing the dissemination of quarterly \n     reports to shareholders be no more burdensome or costly than \n     regulations issued by other financial regulators governing \n     similar disclosures by national banks.\n       Section 14: Removal of Federal Government Certification \n     Requirement for Certain Private Sector Financings: This \n     section would remove government certification procedures for \n     certain Banks for Cooperatives' lending activities without \n     changing eligibility requirements in current statute. Under \n     current law, eligibility for FCS bank for cooperative rural \n     utility lending is based on the eligibility requirements in \n     the Rural Electrification Act. Current statute requires the \n     administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration \n     (REA) to certify that rural utility companies are eligible \n     for REA financing in order for those systems to obtain \n     private sector financing from the Banks for Cooperatives. \n     This section would remove the certification requirement \n     without changing the underlying eligibility criteria in the \n     statute.\n       Section 15: Reform of Regulatory Limitations on Dividend, \n     Member Business, and Voting Practices of Eligible Farmer-\n     Owned Cooperatives: This section would allow greater \n     flexibility for evolving cooperative structure issues such as \n     dividend, member business, and voting practices. Under \n     current law, farmer-owned cooperatives are required to \n     maintain rigid operating procedures in order to maintain \n     their eligibility for FCS Bank for Cooperatives financing. \n     This section would allow existing borrowers to adapt their \n     operations, while retaining their farmer-owned nature, and \n     thereby maintain their continued eligibility to borrow from \n     the Banks for Cooperatives. This section would not expand \n     Banks for Cooperatives eligibility to cooperatives that do \n     not meet the eligibility criteria in current law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Farm Credit Administration,\n\n                                        McLean, VA, June 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     Chairman, Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization \n         Subcommittee.\n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your request, the Farm \n     Credit Administration provides its views on the proposed Farm \n     Credit System Regulatory Relief Act of 1995 (Relief Act). \n     Relieving regulatory burden has been a strategic goal of the \n     FCA's since 1994, and we have accomplished a great deal in \n     this area. We are, nevertheless, supportive of legislative \n     efforts to relieve burdens we lack the power to remove, \n     provided safety and soundness are not compromised.\n       We do not believe it is necessary for the Congress to \n     direct FCA to continue its efforts to eliminate regulations \n     that are unnecessary, unduly burdensome or costly or not \n     based on statute. The FCA has been actively involved in an \n     effort to streamline its regulations with a view to relieving \n     regulatory burden and is committed to continuing that \n     process. The FCA Board recently reaffirmed the existing \n     policy to regulate only as necessary to implement or \n     interpret the statute or as required by safety and soundness \n     and to conduct a periodic review of regulations with a view \n     to eliminating unnecessary burden.\n       While we understand the position the System has taken with \n     respect to the statutory provision for financial statements, \n     we do believe that timely financial information on large \n     loans with annual or infrequent payment schedules is required \n     for safe and sound business decisions and planning. Should \n     the statutory provision be eliminated, we would continue to \n     address this issue by regulation as necessary for safety and \n     soundness. It should also be noted that the current FCA \n     regulation (12 CFR 614.4200(c)) exempts loans with regular \n     and frequently scheduled payments such as rural housing or \n     other similarly amortized consumer-type loans.\n       With respect to the provisions dealing with information \n     provided to stockholders, FCA regulations require that \n     borrowers receive a 10-day advance notice of the increase in \n     rates on an adjustable rate loan, whether the rate is an \n     administered rate or is tied to an index that is available to \n     the general public and not under the lender's control. The \n     Relief Act proposes to delete this requirement and provide \n     for a post increase notice within a reasonable time. The FCA \n     Board has expressed interest in relaxing the regulatory \n     requirement and would support notification to the borrower \n     within 10 days after the increase or decrease.\n       The Relief Act provisions would relieve an association of \n     any obligation to provide stockholders with a quarterly \n     financial report. The quarterly report, together with the \n     annual report, serves a dual purpose. The reports provide \n     shareholders with current information on the performance of \n     their investment and the management of the association they \n     own. In addition, they serve as the basis for disclosure to \n     prospective shareholders. FCA regulations currently require \n     that quarterly reports be sent to stockholders or published \n     in a widely available publication. The FCA currently is \n     considering a request from a number of System institutions to \n     permit these reports be made available only when stockholders \n     request them. The Relief Act would relieve System \n     institutions of the obligation to provide a quarterly report \n     even if requested. We think shareholders need to have access \n     to recent financial information about the institution they \n     own.\n       With respect to the provision related to the Farm Credit \n     System Insurance Corporation Board structure, we believe that \n     it would result in significant savigns and that addressign \n     this issue as proposed in the Relief Act would be consistent \n     with the current emphasis on streamlining government.\n       We thank you for the opportunity to comment. If we can be \n     of further assistance, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Marsha Martin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                                    Doyle L. Cook,\n                                                     Board Member.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of, and am proud \nto lend my cosponsorship to, the Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief \nAct of 1995.\n  The Farm Credit System has played a central role in providing capital \nto farming families for decades. However, as we face an evolving \nbusiness world, modifications are necessary for Farm Credit to remain a \nviable financial partner for American agriculture.\n  The availability of credit is of vital importance to rural economies. \nThe Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief Act addresses the need for \nadequate and reliable credit by providing for the removal of \nunnecessary and burdensome regulation which will facilitate the flow of \nrequired capital.\n  The Farm Credit Regulatory Relief Act grants the Farm Credit \nAdministration the flexibility to extend the length of time between \nmandatory examinations to 18 months. The Farm Credit Administration has \nthe authority to examine system-direct lending institutions whenever \nand as often as the agency chooses. This improvement only changes the \nmandatory period between examinations. This change will reduce the \nisntitutions' examination costs and the savings will be passed back to \nrural borrowers through lwoer loan rates, thereby making capital more \neasily attainable where it is most needed.\n  In addition to reducing costs, the Regulatory Relief Act will also \nallow the Farm Credit System to better serve local communities by \ncreating administrative service entities. Current law allows Farm \nCredit banks to establish such service entities. This act would extend \nexisting authority to Farm Credit System associations which serve the \nrural communities. I fully support this change and believe that it is \nlong overdue.\n  Through the removal of outdated and burdensome regulations, the Farm \nCredit System will be able to better serve farming families and rural \ncommunities wshile promoting cost savings to agriculture by providing \nfarmers with competitive loan rates. For these reasons, I strongly \nsupport the Farm Credit Regulatory Relief Act of 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1012. A bill to extend the time for construction of certain FERC \nlicensed hydro projects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                 Hydroelectric power license extension\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, that will \nkeep two hydroelectric projects in upstate New York on track. Our \nlegislation will extend the time limitations on two Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission [FERC] licensed hydroelectric projects located on \ntwo existing dam sites on the Hudson River--the Northumberland project \nand the Waterford project.\n  The Northumberland Hydroelectric project, when completed, will \ngenerate 48 million kilowatt hours of electricity while the Waterford \nHydroelectric project will produce 42 million kilowatt hours. The \ndevelopment of these two dams will provide a clean alternative energy \nsource. In addition, the construction and operation of these projects \nwill provide jobs for this upstate region of New York. \n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues who are familiar with similar projects know, \nthe Federal Power Act sets a time limit for the beginning of \nconstruction on a hydropower project once FERC has issued a license. \nOnce a license is issued, construction must occur 2 years from the \nlicensing date unless FERC extends the initial two year deadline. The \nFederal Power Act allows only one extension for up to 2 years. Failure \nto commerce construction within the time allotted opens the license to \ntermination. In the case of these two projects, FERC has already \nextended the deadline--the Northumberland deadline is January 16, 1996, \nwhile the Waterford deadline is June 7, 1997.\n  The bill that we are introducing today is identical to legislation \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Solomon and McNulty. Both \nbills give FERC the authority to extend the construction deadline for \neach project for up to a total of 6 years. The current licensees for \nthese projects are moving steadily toward development, however, they \nrecognize that they may not be able to achieve their goals within the \nprescribed deadlines. By enacting this legislation, the extra time \nnecessary to realize the potential of these projects will be granted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1012\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION.\n\n       Notwithstanding the limitations of section 13 of the \n     Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \n     upon the request of the licensee or licensees for FERC \n     projects numbered 4244 and 10648 (and after reasonable \n     notice), is authorized in accordance with the good faith, due \n     diligence, and public interest requirements of such section \n     13 and the Commission's procedures under such section, to \n     extend the time required for commencement of construction for \n     each of such projects for up to a maximum of 3 consecutive 2-\n     year periods. This section shall take effect for the projects \n     upon the expiration of the extension (issued by the \n     Commission under such section 13) of the period required for \n     commencement of construction of each such project.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 1014. A bill to improve the management of royalties from Federal \nand Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leases, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    The royalty fairness act of 1995\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, over time, serious problems have \ndeveloped with the ways courts and consequently the Minerals Management \nService [MMS] have interpreted the Federal statute of limitations \ngoverning royalty collection. Basically the issue is: At what time does \nthe statute of limitations begin to run on the underpayment of \nroyalties?\n  Some courts claim that the statute of limitations does not begin to \nrun until the MMS ``should have known about the deficiency'' in the \namount the producer has paid [Mesa v. U.S. (10th Cir. 1994)]. Other \ncourts have held that the current six year statute ``is tolled until \nsuch time as the government could reasonably have known about a fact \nmaterial to its right of action.'' [Phillips v. Lujan (10th Cir. \n1993)].\n  Either of the above interpretations subject producers to unlimited \nliability--a period that well exceeds the statute of limitations on \nother agency actions regarding procedures. This situation has created a \nclimate of deep uncertainty in the payment of royalties that was not \nintended by Congress and that is not in the best interests of \nconsumers, producers, or ultimately the U.S. Government.\n  Oil and gas producers pay billions of dollars every year for the \nopportunity to drill on Federal land. The payment of royalties is a \nroutine part of doing business with the federal government. Their is no \nattempt here to alter that obligation to pay.\n  However, like all other businesses, oil and gas producers need \ncertainty in their business relationships and in their business \ntransactions with the Federal Government. That certainty is not now \npresent in the MMS's regulations or in numerous court decisions \ninterpreting the applicable statute of limitations. Certainty can be \nachieved only through legislation. For that reason, I am introducing \ntoday the Royalty Fairness Act of 1995.\n  The main objective of this legislation is to identify the time when \nthe statute of limitations begins to run on royalty payments. In most \ncases, it will be when the obligation to pay the royalty begins. That \nwill occur, in most instances, at the time of an underpayment of the \nroyalty payment to the MMS.\n  Let me summarize the effects and provisions of this bill:\n  The bill establishes a 6-year statute of limitations for auditing \nroyalty activities and correcting errors, defined to commence the month \nfollowing the month of production.\n  The bill also addresses the refund period for overpayments on OCS \ndrilling. Currently, there is a 2-year period to file for an \noverpayment on offshore leases. Experience has shown that this period \nis too short and that, as a result, producers can lose legitimate \nrefunds. To correct this problem, the bill extends the refund period \nfrom 2 to 3 years. This section also provides for routine crediting or \noffsetting of overpayments against payments currently due--something \nthat is not permitted now for royalty payments but would increase the \nefficiencies of collection.\n  An amendment to the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of \n1982 [FOGRMA] is included to similarly shorten the time frame for \nproducers to keep records. There is simply no need to keep records \nbeyond the proposed 6-year statute of limitations.\n  Interest reciprocity is established, but requires offsetting by both \nthe lessee and the Secretary. This offsetting procedure applies to all \noverpayments and underpayments at the lessee level for all federal \nleases of the same category prior to determining the ``net'' \noverpayment or underpayment which is subject to interest.\n  The Act allows the Secretary to waive interest. Currently, the law is \ninterpreted to require the collection of interest in all cases. That \ninterpretation has made it difficult to resolve payment issues or \nsettle disputed claims. Thus, this section is intended to facilitate \nthe settlement of payments and disputes.\n  Furthermore, the Act provides an inducement for MMS to resolve \nadministrative proceedings in a diligent timeframe (3 years). There is \ncurrently no such inducement; in fact, the MMS in many instances tolls \nits decisions indefinitely.\n  This bill provides for the imposition of civil or criminal penalties \nupon a showing of willful misconduct or gross negligence. Currently \npenalties or assessments are imposed without notice or an opportunity \nto be heard. This section provides for due process.\n  No section of this bill allows for reduced royalties either before or \nafter production is commenced.\n  It does, however, eliminate the need to give formal notice before \nseeking enforcement of the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Act [OCSLA].\n  These are the major provisions of the Act. It covers leases \nadministered by the Secretary of the Interior on Federal lands and the \nOuter Continental Shelf but specifically excludes Indian lands.\n  The MMS has made a number of attempts to correct these problems, and \ncurrently it has several information policies that parallel many of the \nprovisions in this bill. However, there will be no permanent solution \nuntil Congress enacts legislation. The bill has strong support among \noil and gas producers. I am confident that creating a climate of \ncertainty in the oil and gas industry and getting rid of some \ninconsistencies in current regulation is very much in the national \neconomic interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I submitted legislation in the \n103d Congress designating the week beginning on November 21, 1993, and \nthe week beginning on November 20, 1994, as ``National Family Week.'' \nThis was signed by the President and became Public Law 103-153. Today I \nam pleased to submit legislation which would designate a ``National \nFamily Week'' for the following 2 years, the week beginning on November \n19, 1995, and the week beginning on November 24, 1996.\n  The family is the basic strength of any free and orderly society and \nit is rather appropriate to honor the family as a unit essential to the \ncontinued well-being of the United States. It is only fitting that \nofficial recognition be given to the importance of family loyalties and \nties and that the people of the United States observe such weeks with \nappropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Since Thanksgiving falls during both these weeks, families may \nalready be gathered for festivities. Therefore, it is particularly \nsuitable to pause as a Nation and recognize the support that families \ngive to their members, and therefore to the community of the United \nStates. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9541-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 147--TO DESIGNATE NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK \n                             COLLEGES WEEK\n\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Historically Black \nColleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through \nwhich young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding \nopportunities for continued social progress.\n  Recent statistics show that Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities have graduated 60 percent of the black pharmacists in the \nNation, 40 percent of the black attorneys, 50 percent of the black \nengineers, 75 percent of the black military officers, and 80 percent of \nthe black members of the Judiciary.\n  Mr. President, through adoption of this Senate Resolution, Congress \ncan reaffirm its support for Historically Black Colleges, and \nappropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I \nlook forward to the speedy adoption of this Resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9541-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9541-S9542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 148--RELATIVE TO THE ARREST OF HARRY WU\n\n  Mr. HELMS submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The Secretary shall \n     promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record \n     upon which such penalty or sanction was imposed, as provided \n     in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. The findings \n     and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court \n     if they are not found to be supported by substantial \n     evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Collection.--\n       (1) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil \n     penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, \n     or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in \n     favor of the Secretary, the matter shall be referred to the \n     Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in \n     any appropriate district court of the United States. In such \n     action the validity and appropriateness of the final order \n     imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.\n       (2) A high seas fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, \n     furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the \n     commission of an act prohibited by section 106 shall be \n     liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such \n     violation under subsection (a) and may be proceeded against \n     in any district court of the United States having \n     jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a \n     maritime lien on such vessel that may be recovered in an \n     action in rem in the district court of the United States \n     having jurisdiction over the vessel.\n     SEC. 109.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ICCAT \n                   NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sharing of Conservation Burden.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that in future negotiations of the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereafter \n     in this section referred to as ``ICATT''), the Secretary of \n     Commerce shall \n\n[[Page S9559]]\n     ensure that the conservation actions recommended by international \n     commissions and implemented by the Secretary for United \n     States commercial and recreational fishermen provide fair and \n     equitable sharing of the conservation burden among all \n     contracting harvesters in negotiations with those \n     commissions.\n       (b) Enforcement Provisions.--It is further the sense of the \n     Congress that, during 1995 ICCAT negotiations on swordfish \n     and other Highly Migratory Species managed by ICCAT, the \n     Congress encourages the United States Commissioners to add \n     enforcement provisions similar to those applicable to bluefin \n     tuna.\n       (c) Enhanced Monitoring.--It is further the sense of the \n     Congress that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration and the United States Customs Service should \n     enhance monitoring activities to ascertain what specific \n     stocks are being imported into the United States and the \n     country of origin.\n       (d) Multilateral Enforcement Process.--It is further the \n     sense of the Congress that the United States Commissioners \n     should pursue as a priority the establishment and \n     implementation prior to December 31, 1996, an effective \n     multilateral process that will enable ICCAT nations to \n     enforce the conservation recommendations of the Commission.\n\n                  TITLE IV--FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) customary international law and the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of \n     passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the \n     waters commonly referred to as the ``Inside Passage'' off the \n     Pacific Coast of Canada;\n       (2) in 1994 Canada required all commercial fishing vessels \n     of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain \n     a ``license which authorizes transit'' through the Inside \n     Passage;\n       (3) this action was inconsistent with international law, \n     including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea, and, in particular, Article 26 of that Convention, which \n     specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety \n     of United States commercial fishermen who sought to avoid the \n     fee by traveling in less protected waters;\n       (4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 provides for the \n     reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a \n     license fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been \n     seized, but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by \n     the owner in advance in order to prevent a seizure;\n       (5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person \n     in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by \n     mail;\n       (6) significant expense and delay was incurred by \n     commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to \n     travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports \n     in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the \n     costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the \n     Fishermen's Protective Act;\n       (7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be \n     amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees \n     required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in \n     order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if \n     the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with \n     international law;\n       (8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from \n     Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse \n     vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;\n       (9) the United States should review its current policy with \n     respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada \n     in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters \n     in and near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such \n     vessels the same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of \n     the United States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of \n     Canada off British Columbia;\n       (10) the President should ensure that, consistent with \n     international law, the United States Coast Guard has \n     available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and \n     Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, \n     the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the \n     rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels \n     operating in disputed waters;\n       (11) the President should continue to review all agreements \n     between the United States and Canada to identify other \n     actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any \n     reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against \n     Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately \n     implement any actions which the President deems appropriate \n     if Canada reinstates the fee;\n       (12) the President should continue to convey to Canada in \n     the strongest terms that the United States will not now, nor \n     at any time in the future, tolerate any action by Canada \n     which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of passage \n     of vessels of the United States in a manner inconsistent with \n     international law; and\n       (13) the United States should continue its efforts to seek \n     expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery \n     conservation and management measures that can be implemented \n     through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual \n     concern.\n     SEC. 402. AMENDMENT TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF \n                   1967.\n\n       (a) The Fishermen's Protective Act 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1971 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec. 11. (a) In any case on or after June 15, 1994, in \n     which a vessel of the United States exercising its right of \n     passage is charged a fee by the government of a foreign \n     country to engage in transit passage between points in the \n     United States (including a point in the exclusive economic \n     zone or in an area over which jurisdiction is in dispute), \n     and such fee is regarded by the United States as being \n     inconsistent with international law, the Secretary of State \n     shall, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, \n     reimburse the vessel owner for the amount of any such fee \n     paid under protest.\n       ``(b) In seeking such reimbursement, the vessel owner shall \n     provide, together with such other information as the \n     Secretary of State may require--\n       ``(1) a copy of the receipt for payment;\n       ``(2) an affidavit attesting that the owner or the owner's \n     agent paid the fee under protest; and\n       ``(3) a copy of the vessel's certificate of documentation.\n       ``(c) Requests for reimbursement shall be made to the \n     Secretary of State within 120 days after the date of payment \n     of the fee, or within 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this section, whichever is later.\n       ``(d) Such funds as may be necessary to meet the \n     requirements of this section may be made available from the \n     unobligated balance of previously appropriated funds \n     remaining in the Fishermen's Protective Fund established \n     under section 9. To the extent that requests for \n     reimbursement under this section exceed such funds, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be needed for \n     reimbursements authorized under subsection (a), which shall \n     be deposited in the Fishermen's Protective Fund established \n     under section 9.\n       ``(e) The Secretary of State shall take such action as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate to make and collect claims \n     against the foreign country imposing such fee for any amounts \n     reimbursed under this section.\n       ``(f) For purposes of this section, the term `owner' \n     includes any charterer of a vessel of the United States.''.\n       (b) The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1971 \n     et seq.) is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 12. (a) If the Secretary of State finds that the \n     government of any nation imposes conditions on the operation \n     or transit of United States fishing vessels which the United \n     States regards as being inconsistent with international law \n     or an international agreement, the Secretary of State shall \n     certify that fact to the President.\n       ``(b) Upon receipt of a certification under subsection (a), \n     the President shall direct the heads of Federal agencies to \n     impose similar conditions on the operation or transit of \n     fishing vessels registered under the laws of the nation which \n     has imposed conditions on United States fishing vessels.\n       ``(c) For the purposes of this section, the term `fishing \n     vessel' has the meaning given that term in section 2101(11a) \n     of title 46, United States Code.\n       ``(d) It is the sense of the Congress that any action taken \n     by any Federal agency under subsection (b) should be \n     commensurate with any conditions certified by the Secretary \n     of State under subsection (a).''.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of State shall reimburse the owner of any vessel of \n     the United States for costs incurred due to the seizure of \n     such vessel in 1994 by Canada on the basis of a claim to \n     jurisdiction over sedentary species which was not recognized \n     by the United States at the time of such seizure. Any such \n     reimbursable under section 3 of the Fishermen's Protective \n     Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1973), legal fees and travel costs \n     incurred by the owner of any such vessel that\n      were necessary to secure the prompt release of the vessel \n     and crew.

KONIAG EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) The Secretary shall enter into negotiations for an \n     agreement or agreements to exchange Federal lands or \n     interests therein which are in the State of Alaska for the \n     selection rights.\n       (2) if the value of the federal property to be exchanged is \n     less than the value of the selection rights established in \n     Section 202, and if such federal property to be exchanged is \n     not generating receipts to the federal government in excess \n     of one million dollars per year, than the Secretary may \n     exchange the federal property for that portion of the \n     selection rights having a value equal to that of the federal \n     property. The remaining selection rights shall remain \n     available for additional exchanges.\n       (3) For the purposes of any exchange to be consummated \n     under this Title II, if less than all of the selection rights \n     are being exchanged, then the value of the selection rights \n     being exchanged shall be equal to the number of acres of \n     selection rights being exchanged multiplied by a fraction, \n     the numerator of which is the value of all the selection \n     rights as determined pursuant to Section 202 hereof and the \n     denominator of which is the total number of acres of \n     selection rights.\n       (b) Additional Exchanges.--If, after ten years from the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary has been unable \n     to conclude such exchanges as may be required to acquire all \n     of the selection rights, he shall conclude exchanges for the \n     remaining selection rights for such federal property as may \n     be identified by Koniag, which property is available for \n     transfer to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary \n     under any provision of law and which property, at the time of \n     the proposed transfer to Koniag is not generating receipts to \n     the federal government in excess of one million dollars per \n     year.

Should \n     the value of the property so identified by Koniag be in \n     excess of the value of the remaining selection rights, then \n     Koniag shall have the option of (i) declining to proceed with \n     the exchange and identifying other property or (ii) paying \n     the difference in value between the property rights.\n       (c) Revenues.--Any property received by Koniag in an \n     exchange entered into pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section shall be deemed to be an interest in the \n     subsurface for purposes of section 7(i) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.); provided, \n     however, should Koniag make a payment to equalize the value \n     in any such exchange, then Koniag will be deemed to hold an \n     undivided interest in the property equal in value to such \n     payment which interest shall not be subject to the provisions \n     of section 9(j).\n\n     SEC. 204. CERTAIN CONVEYANCES.\n\n       (a) Interests in Land.--For the purposes of section 21(c) \n     of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1620(e)), the receipt of consideration, including, but not \n     limited to, lands, cash or other property, by a Native \n     Corporation for the relinquishment to the United States of \n     land selection rights granted to any Native Corporation under \n     such Act shall be deemed to be an interest in land.\n       (b) Authority to Appoint and Remove Trustee.--In \n     establishing a Settlement Trust under section 39 of such Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1629c), Koniag may delegate, in whole or part, the \n     authority granted to Koniag under subsection (b)(2) of such \n     section to any entity that Koniag may select without \n     affecting the status of the trust as a Settlement Trust under \n     such section.\n\n                       TITLE III--STERLING FOREST\n\n     SECTION 301. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Sterling Forest Protection \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection of \n     lands which are an integral element of the trail and which \n     would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling Forest, the \n     demand for open space in the northeastern United States, and \n     the lack of open space in the densely populated tri-state \n     region, there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the \n     Sterling forest for permanent protection of the watershed, \n     outdoor recreational resources, flora and fauna, and open \n     space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SEC. 303. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Title are--\n       (1) to establish the Sterling Forest Reserve in the State \n     of New York to protect the significant watershed, wildlife, \n     and recreational resources within the New York-New Jersey \n     highlands region;\n       (2) to authorize Federal funding, through the Department of \n     the Interior, for a portion of the acquisition costs for the \n     Sterling Forest Reserve;\n       (3) to direct the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to \n     convey to the Secretary of the Interior certain interests in \n     lands acquired within the Reserve; and\n       (4) to provide for the management of the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n\n     SEC. 304 DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Title.\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the \n     Palisades Interstate Park Commission established pursuant to \n     Public Resolution No. 65 approved August 19, 1937 (ch. 707; \n     50 Stat. 719).\n       (2) Reserve.--The term ``Reserve'' means the Sterling \n     Forest Reserve.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 305.

The scholarship, sponsored by Discover Card \nServices, Inc., in cooperation with the American Association of School \nAdministrators, are awarded to outstanding high school juniors in the \nUnited States.\n  Danny attends Lamar High School and is 1 of the 9 national winners \nselected from over 10,000 nominations nationwide. His academic \nachievement recently earned him his school's Most Outstanding Sophomore \nBoy Award. However, the scholarship program recognizes that not every \nstudent's accomplishments can be measured in grade points alone. \nAchievements in community service, leadership, special talents, unique \nendeavors, and obstacles overcome are also considered.\n  Danny is an active member in several student organizations and is an \naccomplished vocalist. He has performed in three school musicals, with \nan honor choir and with the National 4-H Choir. He created a Wildlife \nClub for young people and coordinated a shooting sports safety day \nattended by more than 60 local sportsmen.\n  But most impressive is Danny's fight against Ewing's sarcoma. His \nrecovery inspired him to present an hour long wildlife program to 450 \ncancer patients in Denver's Children's Hospital and to develop a \nnewsletter and games which he regularly sends to hospitalized children. \nIn addition, he conducted a 3-year science project centered on \ntreatments for chemotherapy-induced mouth sores. Danny intends to study \nbiology in college, and hopes to become a dentist.\n  Thank you Discover Card Services, Inc., for making a strong \ncommitment to helping our young people reach their dreams and be better \nprepared for the challenges of tomorrow. Congratulations, once again, \nto Danny McDonnall. We can all learn from his superb leadership and \nfortitude.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9563-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR DEMOCRACY IN HAITI\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Sunday, the Republic of Haiti \nheld parliamentary and local elections. These were the first elections \nin Haiti since the United States forced Raoul Cedras and his henchmen \nto abandon power and allow the return of democratically elected \nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide last fall.\n  These elections were the first test of President Aristide's \ncommitment to establish real democracy in Haiti, and they were watched \nclosely by the international community.\n  Mr. President, the elections were far from perfect. The selection of \ncandidates leading up to the election was not as open, well-organized, \nand impartial as many of us would have liked. Some voting stations \nopened late. Some station workers were not paid their promised salaries \nand did not execute their responsibilities conscientiously. Some voters \nwere not given full privacy in voting and there were some reports of \nvoter intimidation. Some ballots were lost or miscounted.\n  These irregularities were unfortunate, although given Haiti's tragic \nhistory, not unexpected. But the fact that these elections were \nimperfect in no way confirms, as some would suggest, that President \nAristide and his government are insincere in their expressions of \ncommitment to true democracy, or that the administration's policy there \nhas failed. Far from it.\n  Let us be realistic. Haiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere. \nSo many people are illiterate that the ballots had to carry symbols to \nidentify the different parties. Many villages cannot be reached by road \nat all. The only highway across the country is literally impassible \nexcept by 4-wheel-drive. Most of the people have had no experience at \nall with democracy and have only the vaguest notion of what\n it means and how it should work.\n\n  In a country like Haiti today, the conduct of elections cannot \npossibly be perfect. Some mistakes and malpractice are inevitable.\n  But one must start somewhere, and the fact that these elections were \nheld at all is an important achievement. Even more important, indeed \nhistoric, is that fact that there was practically no violence. We \nshould remember past elections in that country, where the Government \nand its armed thugs intimidated, beat, and murdered in cold blood \npeople waiting in line to vote.\n  The real question, Mr. President, is whether the Haitian people are \nsatisfied. My perception is that the vast majority of the Haitian \npeople feel that they took an important step forward with this \nelection, and one more step away from the atrocities of the past. We \nowe it to those people now to help them get to work on the next step.\n  I want to commend President Clinton, General Shalikashvili, who has \nbeen to Haiti many times over the past couple of years, Secretary \nChristopher and others, who had the patience and sense of history to \ndevote the attention and effort that they have to the cause of \ndemocracy in Haiti.\n  In a hemisphere where the trend is decidedly in favor of elected \ncivilian government, I do not believe the United States could ignore \nthe brutality in Haiti. Our resolve there in support of the Haitian \npeople's yearning for a better life, has sent a strong signal in \nsupport of democratic government throughout the hemisphere.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9563-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9563-S9565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last week the Senate conducted two \ncloture votes on the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States. As a member of the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources, I was already on record in opposition to the \nnomination. However, for the benefit of my colleagues and my \nconstituents, I wanted to once again outline my reasons for opposing \nDr. Foster and why I voted against cloture.\n  At the outset of this nomination, I chose to reserve final judgment \non Dr. Foster's qualifications to serve as Surgeon General until he had \nan opportunity to appear before the Labor Committee and address my \nconcerns and \n\n[[Page S9564]]\nthe concerns of other Senators and until I had an opportunity to review \nthe entire record.\n  After careful thought and consideration during the Labor Committee's \ndeliberations, I decided that I could not support Dr. Foster's \nnomination. I came to this conclusion for three reasons: First, I have \nserious doubts about whether Dr. Foster can unify the American people \nbehind important national health policies. Second, I am troubled about \nwhere Dr. Foster comes down on the continuum which places parents' \nrights and responsibilities on one end and the State on the other. And \nthird, I believe serious credibility questions regarding this \nnomination continued to exist. And for reasons I shall elaborate upon \nlater, I ultimately came to believe that in this instance, extended \ndebate of this nomination was necessary and appropriate.\n  Now let me just add that Dr. Foster obviously is dedicated to serving \nothers. He tended the health care needs of thousands of poor, rural \nwomen in the still segregated Deep South of the late 1960's and early \n1970's. He taught at and helped run a historically black medical school \nwhich provides 40 percent of the black doctors in America. And he \nhelped the youth of Nashville bridge the sometimes cavernous gap \nbetween a life of poverty and a life of education, economic advancement \nand social accomplishment. In all these endeavors, Dr. Foster has \nexhibited the finest qualities of civic duty and selfless public \nservice. On that basis alone, one has to admire him. Nevertheless, in \neach of the areas I cited earlier, Dr. Foster was unable to allay my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, the first concern I have relates to what I perceive as \nthis nominee's inability to serve as a unifier, bringing Americans \ntogether behind key public health principles. I have repeatedly \nexpressed my worry regarding Dr. Foster's suitability to replace Dr. \nJoycelyn Elders. Given the extremely turbulent and divisive nature of \nDr. Elders' service as Surgeon General, it came somewhat as a shock to \nme--and I think to many others as well--that the administration would \nselect someone to replace her whose background would create anxiety \namong many Americans. I have never felt that Dr. Foster's background as \nan ob-gyn or his pro-choice views disqualify him for serving as Surgeon \nGeneral. However, I believe that the fact that Dr. Foster personally \nhas performed abortions creates a different sort of burden on his \nnomination.\n  Dr. Foster has said that he wants to be seen as the Nation's doctor, \nbut his past actions will cause many Americans to shrink from thinking \nof him in that role. This would not matter if the position involved \nwere managerial or technical; but it is not.\n  The Surgeon General's role is almost exclusively that of a public \neducator. He has a bully pulpit that must be used to bring Americans \ntogether behind improved medical and health practices. As I have said, \nfollowing our experience with Dr. Elders, I think most Americans \nbelieve we should find someone for this position who can serve as a \nunifying force on the critical health care issues confronting or \nNation. I was concerned that, because of his past practices, many would \nnot at first blush choose Dr. Foster to be their physician. Therefore, \nat the confirmation hearings I asked Dr. Foster how he would try to \nrestore this confidence in his ability to serve as the Nation's doctor \nand how he would do it. Regrettably, Dr. Foster could not seem to \nrelate to this request; his response bordered on the dismissive.\n  Mr. President, I did not expect Dr. Foster to change his views. But I \ndid expect, or at least hope, that he would have a plan to unify people \nand reach out to those who--at the outset--were worried about his \nselection, but he did not. Indeed, he did not offer a single idea \nconcerning how he might address his challenge--not speeches, not \nmeetings, nothing. I feel in a position as sensitive as this we need \nsomeone who would work hard to bring people together. Dr. Foster \noffered no commitment or dedication to pursue such an objective. I \nbelieve that was a mistake.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to another area of concern that I have \nspecifically expressed from the outset: I have been worried about where \nDr. Foster comes down on the continuum which places parents' rights and \nresponsibilities on one end and the State on the other. Traveling \nthroughout Michigan during my campaign I repeatedly heard parents \nstrongly express two messages: They were concerned about the breakdown \nof the family unit and the consequences they viewed as emanating from \nthat trend: teenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, and crime. And \nthey were concerned about the degree to which Government's attempts to \nsolve these problems, often exacerbating them in the process, pushed \nmore traditional support systems such as families, relatives, and \ncommunity out of the equation.\n  Now I realize that some will say this is a little old-fashioned in \nthe generation X world of post-modern morality, but I want the Federal \nGovernment's chief health spokesman out in front on this issue, leading \nthe fight to involve parents more directly in their children's lives \nand resisting further Government usurpation of parents' \nresponsibilities. Regrettably, Dr. Foster's actions and positions have \nled me to conclude that he could not fulfill this role.\n  For example, Dr. Foster stated during the hearing that he opposed \nlaws requiring parental notification when contraceptives are provided \nto minors. And Dr. Foster has a history of opposition to parental \nconsent laws in the case of minors seeking an abortion, even those with \njudicial bypass provisions.\n  Mr. President, I share Dr. Foster's view on the importance of \npreventing teen pregnancy, and on other crucial health and social \nissues as well. Where I believe we differ is on the level of \nresponsibility we think parents should have in these areas and the \nsteps each of us is prepared to take to achieve parental involvement. \nThe question is: Would Dr. Foster, as Surgeon General, throw the moral \nauthority of his office behind such initiatives?\n  By most accounts, Dr. Joycelyn Elders dismissed parents altogether \nfrom playing any role in the sexual education and development of their \nchildren. Dr. Foster, it appears, believes that parental involvement is \nsomething to be desired and encouraged, but because of the positions he \nhas taken and will presumably continue to advocate, he will send a \ndifferent, contradictory signal.\n  We need a Surgeon General who recognizes that parents must become \nvery involved and will take positions that are consistent with that \nphilosophy.\n  Mr. President, the final concern I have, and the one which not only \nleads me to oppose this nomination but to vote against cutting off \ndebate, is the issue of Dr. Foster's credibility. In order to succeed, \na surgeon general requires one asset above all others: utmost \ncredibility. But Dr. Foster's credibility has been seriously \ncompromised in several ways. A major credibility problem arose from Dr. \nFoster's stewardship of the ``I Have a Future'' Program. When \nannouncing the selection of Dr. Foster as his nominee, President \nClinton spoke of the doctor's work in this program and its emphasis on \nreducing teen pregnancy. The President cited these as primary reasons \nfor selecting Dr. Foster. The H.H.S. press release sent out that same \nday stated, ``The program stresses abstinence * * *.''\n  Dr. Foster himself, during a February 8 ``Nightline'' broadcast, \nproclaimed, ``I favor abstinence. Abstinence, that's what I favor. \nThat's the bedrock of our program.'' But there has been no concrete \nevidence presented to support that assertion.\n  It came as a great surprise to everyone on the committee, I think, \nwhen neither the administration, the nominee, nor the ``I Have A \nFuture'' Program could produce the much-heralded abstinence brochures \nsupposedly distributed during Dr. Foster's service as director. Nor was \nany other evidence forthcoming that abstinence was the bedrock \nprinciple of the program.\n  After repeated requests to the administration and to Dr. Foster for \nthose materials, the only abstinence brochures which were ever produced \nwere those which Senator Dodd distributed at the hearing. And, as \neverybody knows, those brochures turned out to have been published \nearlier this year--long after Dr. Foster had ended his direct \nsupervision of the ``I Have A Future'' Program. There are other reasons \nto doubt assertions that the ``I Have A Future'' Program had abstinence \nas its ``bedrock'' principle. \n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\n  In an article written by Dr. Foster and two of his colleagues for the \nsummer 1990 issue of the ``Journal of Health Care for the Poor and \nUnderserved,'' entitled ``A Model for Increasing Access: Teenage \nPregnancy Prevention,'' the authors clearly stated that the ``I Have A \nFuture'' Program places considerable emphasis on widespread \ndistribution of contraceptives to teenagers. This article and other ``I \nHave A Future'' materials make clear that reducing pregnancy among \nsexually active teens was the primary focus of the program, not \npromoting abstinence.\n  Mr. President, I find it difficult to believe that Dr. Foster and the \nadministration would fail to provide documentation for their crucial \nclaim, that abstinence was the dominant feature of the program, if such \ndocumentation existed. Considering the emphasis placed by Dr. Foster \nand the administration on the role abstinence and the ``I Have A \nFuture'' Program played in this nomination, this was a devastating \nrevelation and comment on the credibility of the nomination. The \ncritical question here to me was not whether abstinence was the \n``bedrock'' principle behind the program. What I found most disturbing \nwas the apparent attempt to deceive people regarding the degree to \nwhich the program was based upon abstinence. Another credibility \nproblem, Mr. President, exists with respect to Dr. Foster's position on \nthe issue of parental consent in the area of abortion.\n  During the hearings, Senator Mikulski and I each queried Dr. Foster \nabout whether he supported requiring parental consent in cases where \nminors seek abortions. In the end, Dr. Foster maintained that he \nsupported parental consent laws as long as a judicial bypass provision \nwas included. However, in a speech before a 1984 Planned Parenthood \nconference, Dr. Foster expressed strong opposition to consent statutes, \nincluding a Tennessee statute which included judicial bypass language. \nIn that speech, Dr. Foster stated, ``However, the [Supreme] Court \nupheld consent laws for minors; hence our opponents can still create \nabortion deterrents by seeking legislation which will necessitate such \nan approval.'' And, moments later, Dr. Foster repeated this sentiment. \n``The Supreme Court * * * upheld by a single vote margin the \nconstitutionality of minority consent requirements, but in doing so, it \ndid not examine how such laws work in actual practice. Hence, an \nopening has been left for those who would like to see such laws \ninvalidated.''\n  Those are pretty definitive statements. And they are in direct \nconflict with the support Dr. Foster professed for consent legislation \nat the hearing in response to my questions. This lack of consistency \nwas troubling, Mr. President, and further buttressed my concerns about \nDr. Foster's credibility. Furthermore, this nomination has from the \nvery beginning been dogged by another credibility issue: the question \nof how many abortions Dr. Foster actually performed over the years. The \nWhite House originally told the chairman of the Labor Committee that \nDr. Foster had only performed one abortion. Then Dr. Foster issued a \nwritten statement claiming he had performed less than a dozen \nabortions. Days later, on ``Nightline,'' Dr. Foster changed his \nposition and stated that he had performed 39 abortions since 1973. \nDuring the Labor Committee hearings he admitted that he had performed a \n40th--albeit a ``pregnancy termination''--performed before 1973. During \nthe same ``Nightline'' broadcast, Dr. Foster also was asked whether he \nwas including in this count the 59 abortions obtained by women \nparticipating in a clinical trial he supervised for the drug \nprostaglandin.\n  Dr. Foster said that he did not include those abortions because they \nwere part of a research study performed by a university trying to \nmaintain accredition. Thus, Dr. Foster, at various times throughout \nthis process, has said that he performed 1 abortion, then 12, then 39, \nthen 40, then another 49. In short, the number has changed with too \nmuch frequency and is still somewhat dependent on semantics.\n  The issue here is no longer the actual number, but, again, one of \ncredibility. Knowing that the issue of abortion was going to be of \ngreat concern, I believe it was Dr. Foster's responsibility from the \nstart to provide a complete and accurate accounting so that the Labor \nCommittee and the American people would have reliable information with \nwhich to judge his qualifications.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Dr. Foster's credibility has been undermined \nby his characterization of the transcript from the 1978 HEW Ethics \nBoard meeting, a meeting at which he was an active participant, and at \nwhich he is specifically reported to have said that he performed \n``perhaps'' 700 abortions. The White House's initial response to news \nof the transcript's existence was to suggest that Dr. Foster had not \neven been at the meeting. The White House then shifted its approach and \nbegan issuing statements calling the transcript a fraud. That charge \nlater proved to be false as well.\n  Now, even if the White House issued these false statements without \nDr. Foster's knowledge, I believe he had a responsibility--to the White \nHouse, to Congress and to the American people--to correct the errors \nonce they appeared. To my knowledge, no such attempt was made.\n  Only after others verified that Dr. Foster was at this meeting and \nthat the transcript was, in fact, genuine did the White House and Dr. \nFoster adopt their current position: They now contend that the remark \nattributed to Dr. Foster about performing 700 amniocentesis and \ntherapeutic abortions was an error in the transcription.\n  However, after reviewing the transcript, it was clear to me that \nthere was no transcription error. The only transcription problems \noccurred during different portions of the meeting and were corrected on \nthe spot. Additionally, in response to my written questions, Dr. Foster \ndid not deny other remarks about amniocentesis and therapeutic \nabortions attributed to him in the transcript. In fact, he admitted to \nhaving performed ``therapeutic abortions'' after diagnosing genetic \ndisorders in unborn babies. This revelation conflicted with Dr. \nFoster's previous assertions about what was said at the meeting and \nraised even further questions in my mind about Dr. Foster's \ncredibility.\n  Mr. President, on the matters I have just outlined, I believe Dr. \nFoster's credibility has been seriously damaged. Because I believe \ncredibility is such an essential quality for any effective Surgeon \nGeneral, I do not see how, given this liability, I could in good \nconscience support Dr. Foster's nomination.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me offer my reasons for voting against \ncloture in this instance. Generally speaking, it is my intention to \nvote to confirm qualified individuals that the President nominates. But \nin those circumstances where the integrity and credibility of a \nnominee--or the actions of an administration in presenting a nominee--\nare clearly or seriously in question, I will reserve my right to vote \nagainst the President's choice, or against efforts to close off debate \non the Senate floor.\n  In my judgment, this nomination does present clear and serious \nquestions about the nominee's credibility. For that reason, Mr. \nPresident, I felt a sincere obligation to vote against invoking cloture \non the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9563-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9565-S9566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HISTORIC HOMEOWNERSHIP ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator \nChafee in support of the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act, which \nhe introduced yesterday. This will would spur growth and preservation \nof historic neighborhoods across the country by providing a limited tax \ncredit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures to historic homes.\n  An understanding of the history of the United States serves as one of \nthe cornerstones supporting this great Nation. We find American history \nreflected not only in books, films, and stories, but also in physical \nstructures, including schools, churches, county courthouses, mills, \nfactories, and personal residences.\n  The bill that Senators Chafee, Simon, Pryor, Johnston, and I are \ncosponsoring focuses on the preservation of historic residences. The \nbill will assist Americans who want to safeguard, maintain, and reside \nin these living museums.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will stimulate \nrehabilitation \n\n[[Page S9566]]\nof historic homes. The Federal tax credit provided in the legislation \nis modelled after the existing Federal commercial historic \nrehabilitation tax credit. Since 1981, this commercial tax credit has \nfacilitated the preservation of many historic structures across this \ngreat land. For example in the last two decades, in my home State of \nFlorida, $238 million in private capital was invested in over 325 \nhistoric rehabilitation projects. These investments helped preserve \nYbor City in Tampa and the Springfield historic district in \nJacksonville.\n  The tax credit, however, has never applied to personal residences. It \nis time to provide an incentive to individuals to restore and preserve \nhomes in America's historic communities.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act targets Americans of all \neconomic incomes. The bill provides lower income Americans with the \noption to elect a Mortgage Credit Certificate in lieu of the tax \ncredit. This certificate allows Americans who cannot take advantage of \nthe tax credit to reduce the interest rate on their mortgage that \nsecures the purchase and rehabilitation of a historic home.\n  For example, if a lower-income family were to purchase a $35,000 home \nwhich included $25,000 worth of qualified rehabilitation expenditures, \nit would be entitled to a $5,000 Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage \nCredit Certificate which could be used to reduce interest payments on \nthe mortgage. This provision would enable families to obtain a home and \npreserve historic neighborhoods when they would be unable to do so \notherwise.\n  This bill will vest power to those best suited to preserve historic \nhousing: the states. Realizing that the States can best administer laws \naffecting unique communities, the Act gives power to the Secretary of \nthe Interior to enter into agreements with states to implement a number \nof the provisions.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act does not, however, reflect \nan untried proposal. In addition to the existing commercial historic \nrehabilitation credit, the proposed bill incorporates features from \nseveral State tax incentives for the preservation of historic homes. \nColorado, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Utah have \npioneered their own successful versions of a historic preservation tax \nincentive for homeownership.\n  At the Federal level, this legislation would promote historic home \npreservation nationwide, allowing future generations of Americans to \nvisit and reside in homes that tell the unique history of our \ncommunities. The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will offer \nenormous potential for saving historic homes and bringing entire \nneighborhoods back to life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the preservation of \nhistory.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9565-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9566-S9570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   PAKISTAN: AMERICA'S LONG-TIME ALLY\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the United States and Pakistan have \na long-standing friendship. When South Asia gained its independence \nfrom Britain in 1947, the countries of the region faced an important \nchoice--alignment with the United States or nonalignment and \ncooperation with the Soviet Union. Pakistan unabashedly chose the \nUnited States. In 1950, Pakistan's first Prime Minister visited the \nUnited States, laying the seeds for more than 40 years of close \ncooperation between our two countries.\n  In 1950, Pakistan extended unqualified support to the United States-\nled United Nations effort on the Korean peninsula. Pakistan joined in \nthe fight against communism by joining the Central Treaty Organization \n[CENTO] in 1954 and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization [SEATO] in \n1955. In 1959, Pakistan and the United States signed a mutual defense \ntreaty, under which the United States setup a military airbase near \nPeshawar from which reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union were \nconducted. This concession came at great risk to Pakistan. After the \n1960 shoot-down of Gary Powers over the Soviet Union, the Soviets \nissued threatening statements directed at Pakistan for its support of \nthe United States.\n  Ten years later, Pakistan worked with the United States to arrange \nthe first United States opening to China when then-Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger secretly visited China from Pakistan in 1970. Partly as \na result of Soviet pique over Pakistan's assistance to the United \nStates, the Soviets entered into a treaty of friendship with India, \nwhich was shortly followed by India's invasion of East Pakistan in \n1971.\n  From 1979 to 1989, Pakistan opened its borders and joined to United \nStates forces assisting the Afghan rebels fighting against the Soviet \noccupation of Afghanistan. The reliable assistance of our friends in \nPakistan played a significant role in the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, \nthereby hastening the collapse of the Soviet empire and monolithic \nworld communism.\n  Pakistan joined the United States during the Gulf war against Iraq, \ncontributing significantly to the international forces arrayed against \nSaddam Hussein. Since 1992, Pakistan has been in the forefront of U.N. \npeacekeeping operations. In addition, Pakistan has cooperated \nextensively with the United States in our efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism, providing critical assistance in the \napprehension and swift extradition of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the alleged \nmastermind of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New \nYork City. Pakistan has truly been a good friend of the United States.\n  Pakistan currently faces a nuclear threat from India who faces a \nnuclear threat from China. This circular threat coupled with conflict \nafter conflict in the region has created a spiraling arms race in South \nAsia. In 1985 the Congress adopted an amendment to the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 cutting off all assistance to Pakistan if the \nPresident could not certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear \nexplosive device. In 1990, the President was unable to issue such a \ncertification.\n  After 5 years, it is clear that the nonproliferation approach \noutlined in this amendment--known as the Pressler amendment--has not \nworked. The approach taken by the amendment attempts to penalize only \none party to this regional nuclear arms race, while leaving the other \nparties free to produce nuclear weaponry and nuclear capable delivery \nsystems\n  China has undertaken the single largest military build-up in the \nworld. India's weapons program has continued unabated since 1974 and is \nnow developing nuclear capable missile delivery technology that is \nperceived as a direct threat to Pakistan. Faced with these threats to \nits national security, the restrictions on United States assistance \nhave not deterred Pakistan from developing a nuclear weapons \ncapability. It is clear that no progress in non-proliferation has been \nmade in South Asia since these restrictions took effect.\n  The President recognized this fact during the April 11, 1995, meeting \nwith Prime Minister Bhutto of Pakistan after which he stated that ``in \nthe end we're going to have to work for a nuclear-free subcontinent, a \nnuclear-free region, region free of all proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.'' Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the \nPresident's press conference with Mrs. Bhutto be printed in the Record.\n  The text is as follows:\nPress Conference by the President and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of \n                        Pakistan, April 11, 1995\n\n       The President. Please be seated. Good afternoon. It's a \n     great pleasure for me to welcome Prime Minister Bhutto to the \n     White House. I'm especially pleased to host her today because \n     of the tremendous hospitality that the Prime Minister and the \n     Pakistani people showed to the First Lady and to Chelsea on \n     their recent trip.\n       I've heard a great deal about the visit, about the people \n     they met, their warm welcome at the Prime Minister's home, \n     about the dinner the Prime Minister gave in their honor. The \n     food was marvelous, they said, but it was the thousands of \n     tiny oil lamps that lit the paths outside the Red Fort in \n     Lahore that really gave the evening its magical air. I regret \n     that here at the White House I can only match that with the \n     magic of the bright television lights. (Laughter)\n       Today's meeting reaffirms the longstanding friendship \n     between Pakistan and the United States. It goes back to \n     Pakistan's independence. At the time, Pakistan was an \n     experiment in blending the ideals of a young democracy with \n     the traditions of Islam. In the words of Pakistan's first \n     President, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Islam and its idealism have \n     taught us democracy. It has taught us the equality of man, \n     justice, and fair play to everybody. We are the inheritors of \n     the glorious traditions and are fully alive to our \n     responsibilities and obligations. Today Pakistan is pursuing \n     these goals of combining the \n\n[[Page S9567]]\n     practice of Islam with the realities of democratic ideals, moderation, \n     and tolerance.\n       At our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused on \n     security issues that affect Pakistan, its neighbor, India, \n     and the entire South Asian region. The United States \n     recognizes and respects Pakistan's security concerns. Our \n     close relationships with Pakistan are matched with growing \n     ties with India. Both countries are friends of the United \n     States, and contrary to some views, I believe it is possible \n     for the United States to maintain close relations with both \n     countries.\n       I told the Prime Minister that if asked, we will do what we \n     can to help these two important nations work together to \n     resolve the dispute in Kashmir and other issues that separate \n     them. We will also continue to urge both Pakistan and India \n     to cap and reduce and finally eliminate their nuclear and \n     missile capabilities. As Secretary Perry stressed during his \n     visit to Pakistan earlier this year, we believe that such \n     weapons are a source of instability rather than a means to \n     greater security. I plan to work with Congress to find ways \n     to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to preserve the \n     aims of the Pressler Amendment, while building a stronger \n     relationship with a secure, more prosperous Pakistan. Our two \n     nations' defense consultative group will meet later this \n     spring.\n       In our talks the Prime Minister and I also discussed issues \n     of global concern, including peacekeeping and the fight \n     against terrorism and narcotics trafficking. I want to thank \n     Prime\n      Minister Bhutto and the Pakistani officers and soldiers who \n     have worked so closely with us in many peacekeeping \n     operations around the globe, most recently in Haiti, where \n     more than 800 Pakistanis are taking part in the United \n     Nations operation.\n       On the issue of terrorism, I thank the Prime Minister for \n     working with us to capture Ramszi Yousef, one of the key \n     suspects in the bombing in the World Trade Center. We also \n     reviewed our joint efforts to bring to justice the cowardly \n     terrorist who murdered two fine Americans in Karachi last \n     month. I thanked the Prime Minister for Pakistan's effort in \n     recent months to eradicate opium poppy cultivation, to \n     destroy heroin laboratories, and just last week, to extradite \n     two major traffickers to the United States. We would like \n     this trend to continue.\n       Finally, the Prime Minister and I discussed the ambitious \n     economic reform and privatization programs she has said will \n     determine the well-being of the citizens of Pakistan and \n     other Moslem nations. Last year, at my request, our Energy \n     Secretary, Hazel O'Leary, led a mission to Pakistan which \n     opened doors for many U.S. firms who want to do business \n     there. Encouraged by economic growth that is generating real \n     dividends for the Pakistani people. The United States and \n     other foreign firms are beginning to commit significant \n     investments, especially in the energy sector. I'm convinced \n     that in the coming years, the economic ties between our \n     peoples will grow closer, creating opportunities, jobs and \n     profits for Pakistanis and Americans alike.\n       Before our meetings today, I was reminded that the Prime \n     Minister first visited the White House in 1989 during her \n     first term. She left office in 1990, but then was returned as \n     Prime Minister in free and fair elections in 1993. Her \n     presence here today testifies to her strong abilities and to \n     Pakistan's resilient democracy. It's no wonder she was \n     elected to lead a nation that aims to combine the best of the \n     traditions of Islam with modern democratic ideals. America is \n     proud to claim Pakistan among her closest friends. (Applause)\n       Prime Minister Bhutto: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: \n     I'd like to begin by thanking the President for his kind \n     words of support and encouragement.\n       Since 1989, my last visit to Washington, both the world and \n     Pak-U.S. relations have undergone far-reaching changes. The \n     post-Cold War era has brought into sharp focus the positive \n     role that Pakistan, as a moderate, democratic, Islamic \n     country of 130 million people, can play, and the fact that it \n     is strategically located at the tri-junction of South Asia, \n     Central Asia and the Gulf--a region of both political \n     volatility and economic opportunity.\n       Globally, Pakistan is active in U.N. peacekeeping \n     operations. We are on the forefront of the fight against \n     international terrorism, narcotics, illegal immigration and \n     counterfeit currency. We remain committed to the control and \n     elimination of weapons of mass destruction, as well as the \n     delivery systems on a regional, equitable and non-\n     discriminatory basis.\n       Since 1993, concerted efforts by Pakistan and the United \n     States to broaden the base of bilateral relations have \n     resulted in steady progress. In September 1994, in a symbolic \n     gesture, the United States granted Pakistan about $10 million \n     in support for population planning. This was announced by the \n     Vice President at the Cairo Summit on population planning. \n     This was followed by the presidential mission, led by Energy \n     Secretary Hazel O'Leary, which resulted in agreement, worth \n     $4.6 billion being signed. And, now, during my visit here, we \n     are grateful to the administration and the Cabinet \n     secretaries for having helped us sign $6 billion more of \n     agreements between Pakistan and the United States.\n       During the Defense Secretary's visit to Pakistan in January \n     1995, our countries decided to revive the Pakistan-United \n     States Defense Consultative Group. And more recently, we had \n     the First Lady and the First Daughter visit Pakistan, and we \n     had an opportunity to discuss women's issues and children's \n     issues with the First Lady. And we found the First Daughter \n     very knowledgeable. We found Chelsea very knowledgeable on \n     Islamic issues. I'm delighted to learn from the President \n     that Chelsea is studying Islamic history and has also \n     actually read our Holy Book, the Koran Shariah.\n       I'm delighted to have accepted President Clinton's \n     invitation to Washington. This is the first visit by a \n     Pakistani's Chief Executive in six years. President Clinton \n     and I covered a wide range of subjects, including Kashmir, \n     Afghanistan, Central Asia, Gulf, Pakistan-India relations, \n     nuclear proliferation, U.N. peacekeeping, terrorism and \n     narcotics.\n       I briefed him about corporate America's interest in \n     Pakistan, which has resulted in the signing of $12 billion \n     worth of MOUs in the last 17 months since our government took \n     office. I urged an early resolution of the core issue of \n     Kashmir, which poses a great threat to peace and security in \n     our region. It has retarded progress on all issues, including \n     nuclear and missile proliferation. A just and durable \n     solution is the need of the hour, based on the wishes of the \n     Kashmiri people, as envisaged in the Security Council \n     resolutions. Pakistan remains committed to engage in a \n     substantive dialogue with India to resolve this dispute, but \n     not in a charade that can be used by our neighbor to mislead \n     the international community. I am happy to note that the \n     United States recognizes Kashmir as disputed territory and \n     maintains that a durable solution can only be based on the \n     will of the Kashmiri people.\n       Pakistan asked for a reassessment of the Pressler \n     Amendment, which places discriminatory sanctions on Pakistan. \n     In our view, this amendment has been a disincentive for a \n     regional solution to the proliferation issue. Pakistan has \n     requested the President and the administration to resolve the \n     problem of our equipment worth $1.4 billion, which is held \n     up. I am encouraged by my discussions with the President this \n     morning and the understanding that he has shown for \n     Pakistan's position. I welcome the Clinton administration's \n     decision to work with Congress to revise the Pressler \n     Amendment.\n       Thank you, Mr. President.\n       The President. Thank you.\n       Terry.\n       Question. Mr. President, you both mentioned the Pressler \n     Amendment, but I'm not sure what you intend to do. Will you \n     press Congress to allow Pakistan to receive the planes that \n     it paid for or to get its money back?\n       The President. Let me tell you what I intend to do. First \n     of all, I intend to ask Congress to show some flexibility in \n     the Pressler Amendment so that we can have some economic and \n     military cooperation. Secondly, I intend to consult with them \n     about what we ought to do about the airplane sale.\n       As you know, under the law as it now exists, we cannot \n     release the equipment. It wasn't just airplanes, it was more \n     than that. We cannot release the equipment. However, Pakistan \n     made payment. The sellers of the equipment gave up title and \n     received the money, and now it's in storage. I don't think \n     what happened was fair to Pakistan in terms of the money. \n     Now, under the law, we can't give up the equipment. The law \n     is clear. So I intend to consult with the Congress on that \n     and see what we can do.\n       I think you know that our administration cares very deeply \n     about nonproliferation. We have worked very hard on it. We \n     have lobbied the entire world community for an indefinite \n     extension of the NPT. We have worked very hard to reduce the \n     nuclear arsenals of ourselves and Russia and the other \n     countries of the former Soviet Union. We are working for a \n     comprehensive test ban treaty. We are working to limit \n     fissile material production. We are working across the whole \n     range of issues on nonproliferation. But I believe that the \n     way this thing was left in 1990 and the way I found it when I \n     took office requires some modification, and I'm going to work \n     with the Congress to see what progress we can make.\n       Question. Mr. President, what was your response to \n     Pakistan's suggestion that the United States would play an \n     active role in the solution of the Kashmir issue?\n       President Clinton: The United States is willing to do that, \n     but can, as a practical matter, only do that if both sides \n     are willing to have us play a leading role. A mediator can \n     only mediate if those who are being mediated want it. We are \n     more than willing to do what we can to try to be helpful \n     here.\n       And, of course, the Indians now are talking about \n     elections. It will be interesting to see who is eligible to \n     vote, what the conditions of the elections are, whether it \n     really is a free referendum of the people's will there. And \n     we have encouraged a resolution of this. When Prime Minister \n     Rao was here, I talked about this extensively with him. We \n     are willing to do our part, but we can only do that if both \n     sides are willing to have us play a part.\n       Question. Madam Prime Minister, why do you need nuclear \n     weapons? And, Mr. President, don't you weaken your case to \n     denuclearize the world when you keep making exceptions?\n       Prime Minister Bhutto: We don't have nuclear weapons; I'd \n     like to clarify that--that we have no nuclear weapons. And \n     this is our decision to demonstrate our commitment to----\n       Question. But you are developing them?\n       Prime Minister Bhutto: No. We have enough knowledge and \n     capability to make \n\n[[Page S9568]]\n     and assemble a nuclear weapon, but we have voluntarily chosen not to \n     either assemble a nuclear weapon, to detonate a nuclear \n     weapon or to export technology. When a country doesn't have \n     the knowledge and says it believes in nonproliferation, I \n     take that with a pinch of salt. But when a country has that \n     knowledge--and the United States and other countries of the \n     world agree that Pakistan has that knowledge--and that \n     country does not use that knowledge to actually put together \n     or assemble a device, I think that that country should be \n     recognized as a responsible international player which has \n     demonstrated restraint and not taken any action to accelerate \n     our common goals of nonproliferation.\n       The President: On your question about making an exception, \n     I don't favor making an exception in our policy for anyone. \n     But I think it's important to point out that the impact of \n     the Pressler Amendment is directed only against Pakistan. And \n     instead, we believe that in the end we're going to have to \n     work for a nuclear-free subcontinent, a nuclear-free region, \n     a region free of all proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction. And the import of the amendment basically was \n     rooted in the fact that Pakistan would have to bring into its \n     country, would have to import the means to engage in an arms \n     race, whereas India could develop such matters within this \n     own borders.\n       The real question is, what is the best way to pursue \n     nonproliferation? This administration has an aggressive, \n     consistent,\n      unbroken record of leading the world in the area of \n     nonproliferation. We will not shirk from that. But we \n     ought to do it in a way that is most likely to achieve the \n     desired results. And at any rate, that is somewhat \n     different from the question of the Catch-22 that Pakistan \n     has found itself in now for five years, where it paid for \n     certain military equipment; we could not, under the law, \n     give it after the previous administration made a \n     determination that the Pressler Amendment covered the \n     transaction, but the money was received, given to the \n     sellers, and has long since been spent.\n       Question. But will you get a commitment from them to sign \n     the Non-Proliferation Treaty?\n       The President: I will say again, I am convinced we're going \n     to have to have a regional solution there, and we are working \n     for that. But we are not making exceptions.\n       Let me also make another point or two. We are not dealing \n     with a country that has manifested aggression toward the \n     United States or--in this area. We're dealing with a country \n     that just extradited a terrorist or a suspected terrorist in \n     the World Trade Center bombing; a country that has taken \n     dramatic moves in improving its efforts against terrorism, \n     against narcotics; that has just deported two traffickers--or \n     extradited two traffickers to the United States; a country \n     that has cooperated with us in peacekeeping in Somalia, in \n     Haiti, and other places.\n       We are trying to find ways to fulfill our obligations, our \n     legal obligations under the Pressler Amendment, and our \n     obligation to ourselves and to the world to promote \n     nonproliferation and improve our relationships across the \n     whole broad range of areas where I think it is appropriate.\n       Prime Minister Bhutto: May I just add that as far as we in \n     Pakistan are concerned, we have welcomed all proposals made \n     by the United States in connection with the regional solution \n     to nonproliferation, and we have given our own proposals for \n     a South Asia free of nuclear weapons and for a zero missile \n     regime. So we have been willing to play ball on a regional \n     level. Unfortunately, it's India that has not played ball. \n     And what we are asking for is a leveling of the playing field \n     so that we can attain our common goals of nonproliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       Question. Mr. President, why has the United States toned \n     down its criticism of India's human rights violations in \n     Kashmir--why has the United States toned down its criticism \n     of India's human rights violations in Kashmir?\n       President Clinton: I'm sorry, sir. I'm hard of hearing. \n     Could you----\n       Question. Why has the United States toned down criticism of \n     India's human rights violations in Kashmir?\n       President Clinton: There's been no change in our policy \n     there. We are still trying to play a constructive role to \n     resolve this whole matter. That is what we want. We stand for \n     human rights. We'd like to see this matter resolved. We are \n     willing to play a mediating role. We can only do it if both \n     parties will agree. And we would like very much to see this \n     resolved.\n       Obviously, if the issue of Kashmir were resolved, a lot of \n     these other issues we've been discussing here today would \n     resolve themselves. At least, I believe that to be the case. \n     And so, we want to do whatever the United States can do to \n     help resolve these matters because so much else depends on \n     it, as we have already seen.\n       Question. Mr. President, a domestic question on the bill \n     you signed today for health insurance for the self-employed. \n     Other provisions in that bill send a so-called wrong message \n     on issues like affirmative action, a wrong message on wealthy \n     taxpayers. Why then did you sign it as opposed to sending it \n     back? Were you given any kind of a signal that this was the \n     best you'd get out of conference?\n       President Clinton. Well, no. I signed the bill because--\n     first of all, I do not agree with the exception that was made \n     in the bill. I accept the fact that the funding mechanism \n     that's in there is the one that's in there and I think it's \n     an acceptable funding mechanism. I don't agree with the \n     exception that was made in the bill. And it's a good argument \n     for line-item veto that applies to special tax preferences as \n     well as to special spending bills. If we had the line-item \n     veto, it would have been a different story.\n       But I wanted this provision passed last year, and the \n     Congress didn't do it. I think it's a down payment on how we \n     ought to treat the self-employed in our country. Why should \n     corporations get a 100-percent deductibility and self-\n     employed people get nothing or even 35 percent or 30 percent? \n     I did it because tax day is April 17th, and these people are \n     getting their records ready, and there are millions of them, \n     and they are entitled to this deduction. It was wrong for it \n     ever to expire in the first place.\n       Now, I also think it was a terrible mistake for Congress to \n     take the provision out of the bill which allows--which would \n     have required billionaires to pay taxes on income earned as \n     American citizens and not to give up their citizenship just \n     to avoid our income tax. But that can be put on any bill in \n     the future. It's hardly a justification to veto a bill that \n     something unrelated to the main subject was not in the bill. \n     It is paid for.\n       This definitely ought to be done. It was a bad mistake by \n     Congress. But that is not a justification to deprive over \n     three million American business people and farmers and all of \n     their families the benefit of this more affordable health \n     care through this tax break.\n       Question. Mr. President, don't you think that the United \n     States is giving wrong signals to its allies by dumping \n     Pakistan who has been an ally for half a century in the cold \n     after the Iran war?\n       President Clinton. First of all, sir, I have no intention \n     of dumping Pakistan. Since I've been President, we have done \n     everything we could to broaden our ties with Pakistan, to \n     deepen our commercial relationships, our political \n     relationships and our cooperation. The present problem we \n     have with the fact that the Pressler amendment was invoked \n     for the first--passed in 1985, invoked for the first time in \n     1990, and put Pakistan in a no-man's land where you didn't \n     have the equipment and you'd given up the money. That is what \n     I found when I became President. And I would very much like \n     to find a resolution of it.\n       Under the amendment, I cannot--I will say again--under the \n     law, I cannot simply release the equipment. I cannot do that \n     lawfully. Therefore, we are exploring what else we can do to \n     try to resolve this in a way that is fair to Pakistan. I have \n     already made it clear to you--and I don't think any American \n     President has ever said this before--I don't think it's right \n     for us to keep the money and the equipment. That is not \n     right. And I am going to try to find a resolution to it. I \n     don't like this.\n       Your country has been a good partner, and more importantly, \n     has stood for democracy and opportunity and moderation. And \n     the future of the entire part of the world where Pakistan is \n     depends in some large measure on Pakistan's success. So we \n     want to make progress on this. But the United States, a, has \n     a law, and b, has large international responsibilities in the \n     area of nonproliferation which we must fulfill.\n       So I'm going to do the very best I can to work this out, \n     but I will not abandon Pakistan. I'm trying to bring the \n     United States closer to Pakistan, and that's why I am elated \n     that the Prime Minister is here today.\n       Prime Minister Bhutto. And I'd like to say that we are \n     deeply encouraged by the understanding that President Clinton \n     has shown of the Pakistan situation, vis-a-vis the equipment \n     and vis-a-vis the security needs arising out of the Kashmir \n     dispute. And also, that Pakistan is willing to play ball in \n     terms of any regional situation.\n       We welcome American mediation to help resolve the Kashmir \n     dispute. We are very pleased to note that the United States \n     is willing to do so, if India responds positively. And when \n     my President goes to New Delhi next month, this is an issue \n     which he can take up with the Prime Minister of India. But \n     let's get down to the business of settling the core dispute \n     of Kashmir so that our two countries can work together with \n     the rest of the world for the common purpose of peace and \n     stability.\n       The President. Thank you.\n       The Press. Thank you.\n\n  Mr BROWN. Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was \ncatalysed by the Prime Minister's recent visit, and agreed during our \nrecent markup that a new approach is needed. We passed, by a vote of 16 \nto 2, an amendment to modify these existing restrictions. I ask that a \ncopy of the amendment and the report language also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The amendment and report language are as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No.--\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 510.

Section 510(1) strikes \n     the restrictions on all assistance to Pakistan and insert a \n     restriction on military assistance in its stead. Section \n     510(e)(E) adds several sections to section 620E(e) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act, including: (1) a paragraph which \n     specifies that prohibitions of military assistance to \n     Pakistan do not apply to any assistance provided fro the \n     purposes of international narcotics control, military to \n     military contacts, training or humanitarian assistance, \n     peacekeeping, multilateral operations or antiterrorism \n     activities; (2) a waiver of storage costs for military \n     equipment not delivered to Pakistan and authorized repayment \n     of those costs; (3) authorization for the return of Pakistani \n     owned, unrepaired military equipment sent to the United \n     States; (4) a sense of Congress statement relating to United \n     States policy toward South Asia; and (5) an enhanced \n     reporting requirement under section 620F(c) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961.\n       The United States friendship with Pakistan dates from 1947, \n     soon after Pakistani independence. Since then Pakistan's \n     cooperation with the United States has been remarkable; \n     Pakistan stood with the United States throughout the cold war \n     against Soviet totalitarian expansionism; Pakistan has been \n     in the forefront of U.S.-initiated United Nations \n     peacekeeping operations; and Pakistan has cooperated \n     extensively with the United States in counterterrorism, \n     providing critical assistance in the apprehension and switch \n     extradition of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the alleged mastermind of \n     the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York \n     City.\n       For much of the last two decades, Pakistan has faced a \n     nuclear threat from India. India's nuclear program, initiated \n     in response to the threat perceived by China's development of \n     a nuclear weapon, and three wars fought between the two \n     countries, created the incentive for Pakistani pursuit of a \n     nuclear program. The United States provided conventional \n     military assistance to Pakistan, in part to discourage the \n     development of a nuclear program. In October 1990, the \n     President was unable to certify under section 620E(e) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 as amended (known as the \n     ``Pressler Amendment'') that Pakistan did not possess a \n     nuclear explosive device, and United States assistance to \n     Pakistan was ended.\n       The Pressler restrictions required a cut-off of all United \n     States assistance to Pakistan, including assistance to United \n     States companies doing business there. However, this \n     legislation has not proven to be an effective tool of United \n     States non-proliferation efforts in South Asia. In \n     recognition of this, President Clinton called for a review of \n     the Pressler amendment on April 11, 1995.\n       After careful and extensive consideration, the committee, \n     on a vote of 16 to 2, agreed to modify the existing \n     prohibitions on United States assistance to Pakistan under \n     section 620E(e). The provision included by the committee \n     specifically exempts from restrictions all assistance \n     provided for bilateral international narcotics control \n     activities, military-to-military contact, humanitarian \n     assistance, peacekeeping and counterterrorism assistance.\n       The committee also clarified that the prohibition shall \n     only apply to military assistance. Currently, the State \n     Department has interpreted the Pressler amendment to include \n     all United States assistance and sales. The committee is \n     aware that certain aid, such as antiterrorism assistance, and \n     certain sales of United States goods are warranted and should \n     be encouraged. For example, equipment that assists in \n     confidence building measures between Pakistan and India \n     should not be prohibited. Such items would include border \n     surveillance equipment, radar, radar warning receivers, etc. \n     Items such as these not only promote border security and help \n     prevent surprise attacks, but also prevent accidental \n     incursions and incidents that could escalate into significant \n     confrontations. As with sales of military and non-military \n     items to India, sales of non-military equipment to Pakistan \n     would be made on a case-by-case basis.\n       Notwithstanding President Clinton's commitment to resolve \n     the outstanding issue of $1.4 billion worth of equipment that \n     Pakistan bought, but that has not been delivered, the \n     administration continues to investigate possible solutions \n     and has yet to recommend a course of action. The committee \n     generally agreed that some resolution 1\n      of this issue is important, but took no action pending an \n     administration recommendation.\n     Section 511.--Statement of policy and requirement for report \n         on oil pipeline through Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and \n         Turkey\n       Section 511 states that it is the sense of the Senate to \n     support construction of an oil pipeline through Azerbaijan, \n     Armenia, Georgia, and turkey. The section also requires a \n     report analyzing potential routes for construction of the \n     pipeline. The report shall include a discussion of the \n     advantages and disadvantages for different routes, including: \n     (1) the amount of oil to be transported along each route of \n     the pipeline; (2) the cost of constructing the pipeline; (3) \n     options for commercial and public financing of construction \n\n[[Page S9570]]\n     of each route of the pipeline; and (4) the impact on regional stability \n     of the pipeline along each route.\n       The oil-rich Transcaucasus region that stretches between \n     the Southern border of the Russian Federation and Iran is of \n     great geostrategic interest to the United States. Development \n     of an oil pipeline through Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey or \n     Georgia would provide the countries in the Transcaucasus with \n     economic access outside Russian or Iranian control. The \n     committee believes that such a pipeline would help ensure \n     that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia remain strong and \n     independent nations while simultaneously providing the United \n     States with a major source of petroleum outside of the \n     Persian Gulf.\n     Section 512.--Reports on eradication of production and \n         trafficking in narcotic drugs and marijuana\n       Section 512 requires the President to submit a semiannual \n     report to Congress on the progress made by the United States \n     in eradicating production of and trafficking in illicit \n     drugs. The report shall be submitted in unclassified form \n     with a classified annex, if required.\n     Section 513.--Reports on commercial disputes with Pakistan\n       Section 513 requires the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to report 30 \n     days after the bill's enactment, and every 90 days \n     thereafter, on the status of disputes between the Government \n     of Pakistan and United States persons with respect to \n     cellular telecommunications and on the progress of efforts to \n     resolve such disputes. The requirement to submit the report \n     shall terminate upon certification by the Secretary of State \n     to Congress that all significant disputes between the \n     Government of Pakistan and United States persons with respect \n     to cellular communications have been satisfactorily resolved.\n       In other sections of this bill, the committee broadened the \n     Pressler amendment to allow, among other things, for United \n     States trade and investment programs in Pakistan. However, \n     the committee believes that United States companies should \n     enjoy a friendly business atmosphere in Pakistan, without \n     which further development of economic relations will be \n     difficult.\n     Section 514.--Nonproliferation and disarmament fund\n       Section 514 authorizes $25 million for each of the fiscal \n     years 1996 and 1997 for the Nonproliferation and Disarmament \n     Fund [NDF]. The NDF supplements United States diplomatic \n     efforts to halt the spread of both weapons of mass \n     destruction and advanced conventional weapons, their delivery \n     systems, and related weapons and their means of delivery.\n       Under authority provided in section 504 of the Freedom for \n     Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets \n     Support Act of 1992 (Freedom Support Act), significant \n     accomplishments in furthering these nonproliferation and \n     disarmament goals have been made. The NDF has, for example, \n     assisted in the purchase of unsafeguarded highly enriched \n     uranium from Kazakhstan, the destruction of Hungarian SCUD \n     missiles, and work on deploying seismic arrays in Egypt and \n     Pakistan necessary to test a global network to verify a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       The NDF seeks bilateral and multilateral project proposals \n     that dismantle and destroy existing weapons of mass \n     destruction, their components and delivery systems, that \n     strengthen international safeguards and delivery systems, \n     that strengthen international safeguards, and that improve \n     export controls and nuclear smuggling efforts.\n       Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the NDF will assume \n     responsibility for export control assistance to the Newly \n     Independent States [NIS]. This assistance has been provided \n     by the Department of Defense in earlier legislation \n     authorized under the Nunn-Lugar Comprehensive Threat \n     Reduction Program.\n       The committee believes the NDF is an important element in \n     achieving the high priority national security and foreign \n     policy goal of slowing and reversing the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional \n     weapons.\n     Section 515.--Russian nuclear technology agreement with Iran\n       Section 515 expresses the sense of Congress regarding \n     Russia's nuclear agreement with Iran. The Committee is \n     profoundly concerned about an agreement between Russia and \n     Iran to sell nuclear power reactors to Iran. It is the sense \n     of this Committee that the Russian Federation should be \n     strongly condemned if it continues a commercial agreement to \n     provide Iran with nuclear technology which would assist that \n     country in its development of nuclear weapons. Moreover, if \n     such a transfer occurs, Russia would be ineligible for \n     assistance under the terms of the Freedom Support Act.\n       During the May 1995 summit in Moscow, Russian President \n     Yeltsin was asked by President Clinton to cancel the reactor \n     sale to Iran. President Yeltsin did not halt the sale, but \n     instead cancelled the Russian sale of a gas centrifuge to \n     Iran and halted the training of 10 to 20 Iranian scientists a \n     year in Moscow.\n       Iran is aggressively pursuing a nuclear-weapons acquisition \n     program. The Central Intelligence Agency stated in September \n     1994 that Iran probably could, with some foreign help, \n     acquire a nuclear weapons capability within 8 to 10 years. \n     Iran is receiving that foreign help from Russia and China. \n     Specifically, China is helping Iran build a nuclear research \n     reactor, and in April it concluded a deal to sell Iran two \n     light-water reactors. Pakistan, a country with . . . \n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the nearly unanimous action by the Foreign \nRelations Committee is only a first step. Most importantly, there \nremains $1.4 billion worth of military equipment which Pakistan bought \nand paid for but which has never been delivered because of existing \nrestrictions. President Clinton himself has said this situation is \n``not fair to Pakistan.'' On behalf of a country that has been one of \nour closest allies throughout the cold war, the United States must \nrectify this circumstance.\n  I am certain the administration is developing alternatives, and I \nstand ready to work with them to ensure that our relationship with our \nclose ally is able to move forward. Pakistan deserves fair \ntreatment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9566-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9570-S9571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  PAUL BRUHN--1995 HARRIS AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, early last month, Paul Bruhn of \nSouth Burlington, Vermont, received the 1995 Harris Award. Paul is the \nExecutive Director of the Preservation Trust of Vermont, and I know \nthat he was given the Award because of his life-long devotion to \nimproving the Burlington area and helping Vermont in all things. He was \nrecognized as the Downtown Business Person of the Year, and the honor \nis justly deserved.\n  During the past 20 years, I cannot remember a thing done to help \nBurlington that did not involve Paul Bruhn. Those of us who think of \nBurlington as home know how much we owe to Paul. I ask that two \narticles from the Burlington Free Press regarding Paul, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 5, 1995]\n\n                     Architect, Consultant Honored\n\n                           (By Stacey Chase)\n\n       Breaking with tradition, the Downtown Burlington \n     Development Association has announced the winners of the \n     Nathan Harris and Hertzel Pasackow awards that will be \n     presented at the association's annual dinner May 11.\n       The 1995 Harris Award will be given to Paul Bruhn, \n     executive director of the Non-profit Preservation Trust of \n     Vermont and a private public affairs consultant. This year's \n     Pasackow Award goes to Bob Miller for the development of his \n     namesake building, Miller's Landmark, on the Church Street \n     Marketplace.\n       ``I was surprised, flattered, a little embarrassed but very \n     appreciative,'' said Bruhn, 48, of South Burlington.\n       The Harris Award has been given since 1978 to the person \n     ``who best emulates the enthusiasm, dedication and foresight \n     of Nate Harris in maintaining and improving the economic \n     vitality of the Burlington central business district.''\n       ``Paul Bruhn has been involved and concerned with the \n     vitality of downtown Burlington all of his life,'' said Ed \n     Moore, executive director of the development association. \n     ``And the interesting part of Paul's accomplishment and \n     contribution is that he's never in the limelight; he's always \n     been behind the scenes working very, very hard.''\n       The Pasackow Award has been given since 1984 for \n     significant contribution to the physical or architectural \n     quality of downtown Burlington. Miller's Landmark contains 15 \n     stores and office space.\n       ``When J.C. Penny chose to leave the city, the thought of a \n     vacant shell of a building caused concern for many in \n     downtown,'' Moore said. ``Then Bobby Miller purchased the \n     building, created a vision and began implementation of a plan \n     that is represented by that building as we know it today.''\n       Miller, 59, of Shelburne is president of REM Development \n     Co.

Mr. President, one of the critical national \nsecurity issues that the Senate, and indeed the Nation, is currently \nfacing is the future of the North Atlantic Alliance. NATO, which has \nbeen the bedrock of European peace and stability for almost 50 years, \nis in a period of transition--adjusting to the realities of the post-\ncold war world. Key among the issues confronting NATO is its possible \nexpansion to include the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, and, \npossibly, the states of the former Soviet Union.\n  Last Thursday, June 22, Senator Nunn addressed this issue in a speech \nto the Supreme Allied Command Atlantic [SACLANT] conference in my State \nat Norfolk, VA. I have enormous respect for the views of Senator Nunn, \nmy friend and colleague for 17 years in the Senate. We have traveled \ntogether extensively and jointly worked on projects such as the Nunn-\nWarner Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers, currently located in Washington, \nDC and Moscow.\n  He is recognized around the world as an expert on national security \nissues, and in particular on issues related to NATO. While I might not \nagree with all of the points made in Senator Nunn's speech on NATO \nexpansion, it is a very thoughtful contribution to this important \ninternational dialog. I commend it to the attention of my colleagues, \nand I ask that the text of Senator Nunn's speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text of the speech follows:\n                The Future of NATO in an Uncertain World\n\n                         (By Senator Sam Nunn)\n\n\n          1. introduction: the importance of nato enlargement\n\n       Thank you, General Sheehan, for your kind introduction. \n     Secretary General Claes, NATO Military Committee Chairman \n     Field Marshal Vincent, distinguished NATO ambassadors, \n     distinguished military commanders, distinguished guests, I am \n     honored to be with you this morning to discuss the role of \n     NATO in the post Cold War period.\n       The pivotal issue of NATO expansion deserves thorough and \n     careful consideration, because it has important \n     ramifications: for the future of NATO; for the countries of \n     central and eastern Europe; for the future of Russia and the \n     other countries of the former Soviet Union; and for the \n     future security and order throughout Europe, east and west.\n\n\n                       ii. new security situation\n\n       NATO was established primarily to protect the Western \n     democracies from an expansionist Soviet Union that seemed \n     determined to spread its influence through subversion, \n     political intimidation and the threat of military force.\n       When NATO was formed in the late 1940's, Europe was faced \n     with postwar devastation and the emergence of Soviet \n     aggression and confrontation. Western consensus developed \n     around two critical concepts that were decisive in winning \n     the Cold War and in winning the peace; First, Germany and \n     Japan should not be isolated but should be integrated into \n     the community of democratic nations. Second, the western \n     democracies should pursue together a policy of containment, \n     and unite in NATO to carry out this policy.\n       Integration and containment succeeded; The Berlin Wall is \n     down and Germany is united. Eastern Europe and the Baltics \n     are free at last. The Soviet Empire has disintegrated and \n     Russia is struggling to try to establish a market economy and \n     some semblance of democracy.\n       For almost half a century, NATO's military strength was our \n     defensive shield against aggression by the Soviet Union, but \n     our offensive sword was our free societies, our innovative \n     and energetic peoples, our free market systems and our free \n     flow of ideas.\n       With the end of the Cold War, we have witnessed a heart-\n     pounding, terrain-altering set of earthquakes centered in the \n     former Soviet Union and in Easter Europe. These seismic \n     events have ended an international era.\n       The European security environment has changed. We have \n     moved from a world of high risk, but also high stability \n     because of the danger of escalation and balance of terror, to \n     a world of much lower risk but must less stability. In a \n     strange and even tragic sense, the world has been made safer \n     for racial, ethnic, class and religious vengeance, savagery \n     and civil war. Such tragedy has come to the people of Bosnia, \n     Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sudan, Tajikistan, \n     Georgia, Azerbaijan, and many others.\n       The dust has not settled. Bosnia continues to erode NATO's \n     credibility and confidence. Yet it is clear that the overall \n     security and freedom of Europe has dramatically improved.\n       The Eastern European countries, the Baltic countries, and \n     many of the countries of the former Soviet Union have become \n     fully independent, are turning westward, and are anxious to \n     become part of the European community and to join NATO as \n     full members.\n       We are no longer preoccupied with the crucial Cold War \n     issue of how much warning time NATO would have in advance of \n     a massive conventional attack westward by the Warsaw Pact.\n       During the Cold War, we worried about a Soviet invasion \n     deep into\n      Western Europe. As Michael Mandelbaum points out, the \n     current debacle in Chechnya indicates that Russia today \n     has serious trouble invading itself.\n       Today, our military planners estimate that preparation for \n     a Russian conventional military attack, even against Eastern \n     Europe, would take several years at a minimum--assuming the \n     resources could be found to rebuild the undermanned, \n     underfunded, poorly trained and poorly disciplined Russian \n     military establishment.\n       Russia itself has gone from being the center of a menacing, \n     totalitarian global empire to an economically-weak, \n     psychologically-troubled country struggling to move toward \n     democracy and a market-based economy.\n       A multilateral security system is forming across Europe \n     that reduces nuclear and conventional armaments and makes a \n     surprise attack by Russian conventional military forces \n     toward the West increasingly unlikely.\n       I have in mind the cumulative effect of such agreements as \n     the INF Treaty, the CFE Treaty, the unilateral U.S. and \n     Soviet decisions to reduce tactical nuclear weapons in \n     Europe, the START I and pending START II Treaties, and the \n     pending Chemical Weapons Convention and Open Skies Treaty.\n       These mechanisms are far from perfect, several await \n     ratification, and they require vigorous verification and full \n     implementation. Yet even at this stage, they significantly \n     enhance warning time that today is measured in years rather \n     than in days or in months.\n       We are all aware of the dramatic change in the threat \n     environment in Europe resulting from these changes.\n       The immediate danger is posed by violent terrorist groups; \n     by isolated rogue states, by ethnic, religious, and other \n     types of sub-national passion that can flare into vicious \n     armed conflict. The lethality of any and all of these threats \n     can be greatly magnified by the proliferation of nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons, as well as by the spread of \n     destabilizing conventional weapons.\n       This audience is well aware that Russia currently possesses \n     over 20,000 nuclear weapons, at least 40 thousand tons of \n     chemical weapons, advanced biological warfare capabilities, \n     hundreds of tons of fissile material, huge stores of \n     conventional weapons, plus thousands of scientists and \n     technicians skilled in manufacturing weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       This is the first time in history that an empire has \n     disintegrated while possessing such enormous destructive \n     capabilities. Even if these capabilities are greatly reduced, \n     the know-how, the production capability, and the dangers of \n     proliferation will endure for many years. This is the number \n     one security threat for America, for NATO, and for the world.\n       As we contemplate NATO enlargement, we must carefully \n     measure its effect on this proliferation threat.\n       In the longer term, we cannot dismiss the possibility of a \n     resurgent and threatening Russia.\n       Russia not only has inherited the still dangerous remnants \n     of the Soviet war machine. In addition, even in its currently \n     weakened condition, Russia possesses great potential in human \n     and material resources. By virtue of its size and strategic \n     location, Russia exerts considerable weight in Europe, Asia \n     and the Middle East. Meanwhile, Russia has inherited the \n     USSR's veto power in the UN Security Council and therefore \n     has a major voice in multilateral decision making.\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\n       Russia will be a major factor, for better or worse, across \n     the entire spectrum of actual and potential threats.\n       Russia can fuel regional conflicts with high technology \n     conventional weapons, along with political and other material \n     support.\n       Or Russia can cooperate with us in defusing such conflicts, \n     particularly by preventing the spread of Russian weaponry to \n     irresponsible hands.\n       Russia can itself emerge as a militarily aggressive power.\n       Or Russia can assist us in averting new rivalry among major \n     powers that poisons the international security environment.\n       Russia can pursue a confrontational course that undermines \n     security and cooperation in Europe.\n       Or it can work with us to broaden and strengthen the \n     emerging system of multilateral security in Europe.\n       Out of all this background come five fundamental points:\n       First, preventing or curbing the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction is the most important and most difficult \n     security challenge we face.\n       Second, Russia is a vast reservoir of weaponry, weapons \n     material and weapons know-how. Thousands of people in Russia \n     and throughout the former Soviet Union have the knowledge, \n     the access, and strong economic incentives to engage in \n     weapons traffic.\n       Third, increased Russian isolation, paranoia or instability \n     would make this security challenge more difficult and more \n     dangerous.\n       Fourth, although the West cannot control events in Russia, \n     and probably can assist political and economic reform there \n     only on the margins, as the medical doctors say, our first \n     principle should be DO NO HARM.\n       Fifth, we must avoid being so preoccupied with NATO \n     enlargement that we ignore the consequences it may have for \n     even more important security priorities.\n\n\n      iii. problems with the current approach to nato enlargement\n\n       It is against this background that I offer a few \n     observations on the current approach to NATO enlargement.\n       NATO's announced position is that the question of \n     enlargement is not whether, but when and how. Somehow I have \n     missed any logical explanation of WHY. I cannot speak of \n     public opinion in other countries, but in America when the \n     enlargement debate focuses on issues of NATO nuclear policy, \n     NATO troop deployments, and formal NATO military \n     commitments--played against the background of repercussions \n     in Russia--somebody had better be able to explain to the \n     American people WHY, or at least WHY NOW.\n       NATO was founded on a fundamental truth: the vital \n     interests of the countries of NATO were put at risk by the \n     military power and political intimidation of the Soviet \n     Union. As President Harry Truman said in his memoirs: ``The \n     [NATO] pact was a shield against aggression and against the \n     fear of aggression. . . .'' Because NATO was built on this \n     fundamental truth, and because we discussed it openly and \n     faced it truthfully with our people, the alliance endured and \n     prevailed.\n       Today, we seem to be saying different things to different \n     people on the subject of NATO enlargement.\n       To the Partnership for Peace countries, we are saying that \n     you are all theoretically eligible and if you meet NATO's \n     entrance criteria (as yet not fully spelled out), you will \n     move to the top of the list.\n       To the Russians, we are also saying that NATO enlargement \n     is not threat-based and not aimed at you. In fact, you too \n     can eventually become a member of NATO. This raises serious \n     questions.\n       Are we really going to be able to convince the East \n     Europeans that we are protecting them from their historical \n     threats, while we convince the Russians that NATO's \n     enlargement has nothing to do with Russia as a potential \n     military threat?\n       Are we really going to be able to convince Ukraine and the \n     Baltic countries that they are somehow more secure when NATO \n     expands eastward but draws protective lines short of their \n     borders and places them in what the Russians are bound to \n     perceive as the ``buffer zone?''\n       In short, are we trying to bridge the unbridgeable, to \n     explain the unexplainable? Are we deluding others or are we \n     deluding ourselves?\n       The advantages of NATO's current course toward enlargement \n     cannot be ignored. If NATO expands in the near term to take \n     in the Visegrad countries, these countries would gain in \n     self-confidence and stability. It is possible that border \n     disputes and major ethnic conflicts presumably would be \n     settled before entry--for instance, the dispute involving the \n     Hungarian minority in Romania.\n       However, the serious disadvantages must be thought through \n     carefully.\n       For example, my conversations with Russian government \n     officials, members of the Russian parliament across the \n     political spectrum, and non-official Russian foreign policy \n     specialists convince me that rapid NATO enlargement will be \n     widely misunderstood in Russia and will have a serious \n     negative impact on political and economic reform in that \n     country. There are several reasons for this:\n       At the moment, Russian nationalism is on the rise and \n     reformers are on the defensive. The Russian military \n     establishment and the still huge military-industrial complex \n     that undergirds it are dispirited and resentful.\n       The average Russian voter has trouble making ends meet, is \n     unsure what the future may hold, but is well aware that \n     Russia has gone from being the seat of a global empire and \n     the headquarters of a military superpower to a vastly \n     weakened international status.\n       Russian nationalists feed this sense of loss and \n     uncertainty by proclaiming that rapid NATO enlargement is \n     intended to take advantage of a weakened Russia and will pose \n     a grave security threat to the Russian people. Russian \n     demagogues argue that Russia must establish a new global \n     empire to counter an expansionist west. They smile with glee \n     every time NATO expansion is mentioned.\n       Russian democrats do not see an immediate military threat \n     from an enlarged NATO but fear the reaction of the Russian \n     people. The democrats worry that alarmist messages, however \n     distorted, will set back democracy by increasing popular \n     tolerance for authoritarianism and renewed military spending \n     within Russia, and by isolating Russia from western \n     democracies.\n       In short, if NATO enlargement stays on its current course, \n     reaction in Russia is likely to be a sense of isolation by \n     those committed to democracy and economic reform, with \n     varying degrees of paranoia, nationalism and demagoguery \n     emerging from across the current political spectrum.\n       In the next few years, Russia will have neither the \n     resources nor the wherewithal to respond with a conventional \n     military build-up. If, however, the more nationalist and \n     extreme political forces gain the upper hand, by election or \n     otherwise, we are likely to see other responses that are more \n     achievable and more dangerous to European stability. For \n     example:\n       While Russia would take years to mount a sustained military \n     threat to eastern Europe, it can within weeks or months exert \n     severe external and internal pressure on its immediate \n     neighbors to the west--including the Baltic countries and \n     Ukraine. This could set in motion a dangerous action-reaction \n     cycle.\n       Moreover, because a conventional military response from \n     Russia in answer to NATO enlargement is infeasible, a nuclear \n     response, in the form of a higher alert status for Russia's \n     remaining strategic nuclear weapons and conceivably renewed \n     deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, is more likely. The \n     security of NATO, Russia's neighbors, and the countries of \n     eastern Europe will not be enhanced if the Russian military \n     finger moves closer to the nuclear trigger.\n       By forcing the pace of NATO enlargement at a volative and \n     unpredictable moment in Russia's history, we could place \n     ourselves in the worst of all security environments: rapidly \n     declining defense budgets, broader responsibilities, and \n     heightened instability. We will also find ourselves with \n     increasingly difficult relations with the most important \n     country in the world in terms of potential for proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction.\n       This is the stuff that self-fulfilling prophecies, and \n     historic tragedies, are made of.\n\n\n            iv. specific recommendations for alliance policy\n\n       Where do we go from here? I recognize that it is much \n     easier to criticize than to construct, but I do have a few \n     suggestions.\n       I suggest a two-track approach to NATO enlargement.\n       The first track would be evolutionary and would depend on \n     political and economic developments within the European \n     countries who aspire to full NATO membership. When a country \n     becomes eligible for European Union membership, it will also \n     be eligible to join the Western European Union and then be \n     prepared for NATO membership, subject to course to NATO \n     approval.\n       This is a natural process connecting economic and security \n     interests.\n       We can honestly say to Russia that this process is not \n     aimed at you.\n       The second track would be threat-based. An accelerated, and \n     if necessary immediate, expansion of NATO would depend on \n     Russian behavior. We should be candid with the Russian \n     leadership, and above all honest with the Russian people, by \n     telling them frankly:\n       If you respect the sovereignty of your neighbors, carry out \n     your solemn arms control commitments and other international \n     obligations, and if you continue on the path toward democracy \n     and economic reform, your neighbors will not view you as a \n     threat, and neither will NATO.\n       We will watch, however, and react:\n       (1) to aggressive moves against other sovereign states;\n       (2) to militarily significant violations of your arms \n     control and other legally binding obligations pertinent to \n     the security of Europe;\n       (3) to the emergence of a non-democratic Russian government \n     that impedes fair elections, suppresses domestic freedoms, or \n     institutes a foreign policy incompatible with the existing \n     European security system.\n       These developments would be threatening to the security of \n     Europe and would require a significant NATO response, \n     including expansion eastward. We would be enlarging NATO \n     based on a real threat. We would not, however, be helping to \n     create the very threat we are trying to guard against.\n       Finally, Partnership for Peace is a sound framework for \n     this two-track approach. Its role would be to prepare \n     candidate countries and NATO itself for enlargement on either \n\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n     track. Programs of joint training and exercises, development of a \n     common operational doctrine, and establishment of inter-\n     operable weaponry, technology and communications would \n     continue, based on more realistic contingencies. Tough issues \n     such as nuclear policy and forward stationing of NATO troops \n     would be discussed in a threat-based framework, one which we \n     hope would remain theoretical.\n       As the Russian leaders and people make their important \n     choices, they should know that Russian behavior will be a key \n     and relevant factor for NATO's future. This straightforward \n     approach is also important for our citizens, who will have to \n     pay the bills and make the sacrifices required by expanded \n     NATO security commitments.\n       The profound historical contrast between post-World War I \n     Germany and post-World War II Germany should tell us that \n     neo-containment of Russia is not the answer at this critical \n     historical juncture. If future developments require the \n     containment of Russia, it should be real containment, based \n     on real threats.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9571-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE CHURCH PUBLIC SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to call the attention \nof my colleagues to an institution in Michigan that is celebrating \ntheir 100th anniversary. On July 9, 100 years ago land for the church \nschool, formally known as Lincoln No. 2, was deeded to the school \ndistrict by Julius and Sophia Labute for the price of $49.50. The Huron \nTribune posted a notice on June 21, 1895, that requested sealed tenders \nfor the erection of a veneered schoolhouse in District No. 2, Township \nof Lincoln.\n  While the complete records of who taught at the school that first \nyear were not preserved, we do know that the school was completed and \nwas most likely in session because of June Nelson who authored the \nstory, A Long Trek. The story is one of many in Ms. Nelson's book \nentitled ``Tales From the Tip of the Thumb.'' The story tells of a \nwagon train leaving from Filion, MI, in October 1895 and the travelers \nwere looking for a map of the United States. One of them remembered \nthat the new Lincoln No. 2 schoolhouse on the corner had such a map in \nits geography chart and they had no trouble obtaining it in the middle \nof the night.\n  For 100 years that schoolhouse on the corner has taught thousands of \nstudents the basic building blocks that lead to a life of learning. I \ncongratulate them on a century of success and wish them well as they \nenter the new millennium with the timeless values that have served them \nand their students well since the 19th century.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9573-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I ask that the following article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 9, 1995]\n\n                         Hot Air Baking Alaska\n\n                           (By Alston Chase)\n\n       Our helicopter swooped down on a black bear that was lazily \n     grazing lush grass beside a crystal clear mountain river. \n     Around him, I could see an intense green mosaic of meadows \n     and, beyond them, thick forests that stretched to the \n     skyline, where dark peaks loomed through the mist.\n       I was flying over the Thorne River on Prince of Wales \n     Island in Southeast Alaska's Tongass National Forest--a \n     stream that in April the conservation group American Rivers, \n     claiming that ``extensive logging'' would harm ``potentially \n     threatened'' creatures, designated one of the country's \n     ``most endangered'' rivers.\n       But environmentalists, I discovered, had things backward. \n     Prince of Wales, which has been extensively logged, is \n     thriving. By contrast, more than 96 percent of the Tongass \n     remains untouched, yet is dying.\n       For more than a decade, various groups have insisted that \n     the Tongass, ``America's rain forest,'' is in deep trouble \n     due to unprincipled logging. I found that while this region \n     is indeed at risk, the culprit is conservationism. The \n     Thorne, in particular, is flourishing.\n       Contrary to activist claims, the Forest Service manages it \n     as a ``Scenic and Recreational River'' and plans no logging \n     there, except in a tiny portion of one tributary. Where \n     harvests are under consideration, they would be prohibited \n     within a half-mile of any stream. And although 21 percent of \n     the drainage has already been logged--much of it long ago--\n     pink salmon runs have risen from lows of 300 in the 1960s to \n     highs of 350,000 in the 1990s.\n       This reveals what foresters know: that in this land which \n     annually receives 160 inches of rain and where trees grow \n     like weeds, logging can be nature's best friend. Properly \n     harvested, these forests could grow at the rate of 1.35 \n     billion board feet a year. But left alone, they are dying. \n     Meanwhile, the lack of cutting ensures few recreational \n     opportunities are available for ordinary people. Dotted with \n     muskeg swamps, littered with deadfall and covered with a \n     solid curtain of densely packed trees, the land is nearly \n     impenetrable. Only the super-rich can afford the helicopters \n     needed to reach camping and fishing spots in its interior.\n       That is what makes Prince of Wales different. Thanks to \n     logging, it is experiencing phenomenal tree growth and has a \n     wonderful road and trail network that puts the lakes and \n     streams within reach of hikers.\n       Unfortunately, such accessibility displeases the scions of \n     Grosse Point and the Barons of the Beltway, whose largess and \n     appetite for power sustains the environmental movement. These \n     elite prefer to keep the Tongass so remote its choice spots \n     can only be reached by qualified governmental authorities or \n     refined persons such as themselves, who have access to, or \n     can afford, guides and helicopters. So to make their \n     playground safe from democracy, they successfully lobbied and \n     litigated to reduce harvest plans until, today, cutting \n     approaches zero.\n       Of the Tongass' 17 million acres, 10 million are forested, \n     and of that 5.7 million are accessible for ``commercial'' \n     forestry. In 1980, federal legislation set aside around 1.6 \n     million of this as wilderness. After the 1990 Tongass Timber \n     Reform Act and other conservation measures, only 1.71 million \n     was left for logging. And 400,000 of that was second-growth \n     that could not be ready to cut for 40 years. Now, the Clinton \n     administration has invoked the Endangered Species Act to \n     create Habitat Conservation Areas totaling 600,000 acres of \n     the remainder for ``potentially endangered species.''\n       Thus, of the Tongass' 17 million acres, 600,000 is actually \n     available for logging. In a forest that grows more than a \n     billion board feet annually, loggers last year cut a mere 276 \n     million. And as harvests plummet, mills close and \n     unemployment rises. In 1989, the pulp mill in Sitka ran out \n     of logs and closed its doors, and last winter, the saw mill \n     in Wrangell went belly up for the same reason. And while \n     Alaska's congressmen promise to open the forest, the citizens \n     of this region are not optimistic. They have heard that kind \n     of talk before.\n       Citizens of the Tongass are victims of phoney science that \n     supposes mythical ``ecosystem health'' is more important than \n     people; of preservation laws that provide lush grazing for \n     activist attorneys; of shark pack activists who ride \n     piggyback on each others' media campaigns, repeating half-\n     truths until the public believes them; of federal subsides to \n     groups who sue ``to protect the environment;'' of public \n     ignorance and activist propaganda; of media arrogance and \n     government's inexorable urge to grow.\n       They wonder when America will learn the truth: that without \n     logging, trees die and people suffer. Without logging, the \n     Tongass will remain an exclusive preserve of the affluent or \n     anointed, who don't deserve it.\n       They know this is a national outrage. But they wonder: Does \n     anyone in Washington care?\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9574-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9574-S9575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE DISASTER VICTIMS CRIME PREVENTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, shortly after the Senate returns \nfrom the Fourth of July recess, I plan to introduce the Federal \nDisaster Preparedness and Response Act of 1995. This bill will be very \nsimilar to the measure I offered in the 103d Congress with Senator \nGlenn and Graham of Florida.\n  It is very appropriate to announce my intention to reintroduce this \nlegislation as we debate the conference report on the supplemental \ndisaster bill. We are all aware of the tremendous costs incurred during \na natural disaster. What many of us are unaware of is the need to \ncombat fraud against victims of Federal disasters. The legislation I \nplan to introduce would make it a Federal crime to defraud persons \nthrough the sale of materials or services for cleanup, repair, and \nrecovery following a federally declared disaster.\n  Because of instant media coverage of the destruction caused by these \ncatastrophic events, we are able to see first-hand the concern of \nothers, such as Red Cross volunteers passing out blankets and food and \ncitizens travelling hundreds of miles to help rebuild strangers' homes.\n  Despite the outpouring of public support that follows these \ncatastrophes, there are unscrupulous individuals who prey on trusting \nand unsuspecting victims. This measure would criminalize some of the \nactivities undertaken by these unprincipled people whose sole intent is \nto defraud hard-working men and women.\n  Every disaster has examples of individuals who are victimized twice--\nfirst by the disaster and later by unconscionable price hikes and \nfraudulent contractors. In the wake of the 1993 Midwest flooding, Iowa \nofficials found that some vendors raised the price of portable toilets \nfrom $60 a month to $60 a day! In other flood-hit areas, carpet \ncleaners hiked their prices to $350 per hour, while telemarketers set \nup telephone banks to solicit funds for phony flood-rated charities.\n  Nor will television viewers forget the scenes of beleaguered South \nFloridians buying generators, plastic sheeting, and bottled water at \noutrageous prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.\n  After Hurricane Iniki devastated the Island of Kauai, a contractor \npromising quick home repair took disaster benefits from numerous \nhomeowners and fled the area without completing promised construction.\n  While the Stafford Natural Disaster Act currently provides for civil \nand criminal penalties for the misuse of disaster funds, it fails to \naddress contractor fraud. To fill this gap, my legislation would make \nit a Federal crime to fraudulently take money from a disaster victim \nand fail to provide the agreed upon material or service for the \ncleanup, repair, and recovery.\n  The Stafford Act also fails to address price gouging. Although it is \nthe responsibility of the States to impose restrictions on price \nincreases prior to a Federal disaster declaration, Federal penalties \nfor price gouging should be imposed once a disaster has been declared. \nI am pleased to incorporate in this measure an initiative Senator Glenn \nbegan following Hurricane Andrew to combat price gouging and excessive \npricing of goods and services.\n  There already is tremendous cooperation among the various State and \nlocal offices that deal with fraud and consumer protection issues and \nit is quite common for these fine men and women to lend their expertise \nto their colleagues from out-of-State during a natural disaster. This \nexchange of experiences and practical solutions has created a strong \nsupport network.\n  However, a Federal remedy is needed to assist States when a disaster \noccurs. There should be a broader enforcement system to help \noverburdened State and local governments during a time of disaster. The \nFederal Government is in a position to ensure that residents within a \nfederally declared disaster area do not fall victim to fraud. Federal \nagencies should assist localities to provide such a support system.\n  In addition to making disaster-related fraud a Federal crime, this \nbill would also require the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to develop public information materials to advise \ndisaster victims about ways to detect and avoid fraud. I have seen a \nnumber of anti-fraud material prepared by State consumer protection \n\n[[Page S9575]]\noffices and believe this section would assist States to disseminate \nanti-fraud related material following the declaration of a disaster by \nthe President.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in enacting this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9574-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9575-S9576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        THE UNITED NATIONS AT 50\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 50 years ago this week in San \nFrancisco, the U.N. Charter was opened for signature. After some 9 \nweeks of negotiations, as World War II was drawing to a close, \nrepresentatives from 50 countries unanimously adopted the charter. On \nthe 24th of October 1945, the charter came into force, and the United \nNations was effectively born.\n  During this, the 50th anniversary year of the United Nations, I am \ndeeply concerned that, rather than celebrating its endurance, we are \nwitnessing a disturbing series of attacks upon it. Ironically, these \nattacks come at a challenging time for the United Nations. For now, \nwith the end of the cold war, the United Nations has a genuine \nopportunity to function as it was intended to at the end of World War \nII.\n  For many years, a constant Soviet veto in the Security Council \neffectively neutralized the United Nations. Between 1946 and 1970, for \nexample, the Soviet Union vetoed Security Council actions more than 100 \ntimes before the United States even cast its first veto.\n  But the United States chose to persevere within the existing U.N. \nframework. Even when casting their votes in 1945 to support \nratification of the U.N. Charter, Senators recognized the challenging \nagenda faced by the United Nations in the years ahead. Senator Mead, a \nDemocrat from New York, offered the following admonition:\n\n       The Charter is not a key to utopia. Words written upon \n     paper have no power in and of themselves to alter the course \n     of events. It is only the spirit of men and nations behind \n     those words which can do that.\n\n  Today we continue to face the question: What kind of spirit do we \nwish to guide our discussion of the United Nations in 1995?\n  There are two sharply contrasting directions in which our discussion \nof the United Nations can proceed. One is tantamount to withdrawing \nU.S. support from the United Nations by constantly searching out ways \nof undermining and weakening the institution. Unfortunately there are \nlegislative proposals before this Congress which would move in this \ndirection. Alternatively, we could apply our energies toward ensuring \nthat the United States plays a key role in reforming and strengthening \nthe United Nations as we prepare to enter a new century. I strongly \nbelieve that the hope of building a peaceful and prosperous world lies \nin choosing the latter course.\n  There have been times in our history when Americans believed that we \ncould go it alone and simply ignore conflicts and problems originating \nin other parts of the world. Indeed, isolationist sentiment succeeded \nin preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations at \nthe end of World War I, despite the fact that President Woodrow Wilson \nwas its leading architect.\n  Those who labored in San Francisco and elsewhere to create the United \nNations half a century ago learned from the mistakes of their \npredecessors with respect to the League of Nations. Parties to the \ninitial negotiations at Dumbarton Oaks on establishing a United \nNations, and to later preparations in San Francisco, insisted, for \nexample, that the U.N. organization recognize the reality of great \npowers by granting significant authority to a Security Council. In that \nCouncil, the United States and other major powers were given the veto \npower--thereby ensuring that the United Nations could not undertake \noperations which United States opposed. In recognition of the \nleadership role taken by the United States in building the United \nNations, New York was later chosen to serve as U.N. headquarters.\n  Ensuring responsible U.S. engagement within the United Nations in \n1995 remains nearly as demanding as in 1945. Much of the advice offered \nby Senator Gurney, a Republican from South Dakota, to his Senate \ncolleagues in 1945 rings true today:\n\n       . . . let me caution that after our almost unanimous vote \n     for the Charter today we cannot merely sit back and feel and \n     say, ``Everything is fixed now, everyone is safe.'' No; our \n     people are entitled by their sacrifices in this war and \n     others to more than that. We and all other nations must give \n     the Charter organization the all-out support of all our \n     people--sincere, honest support, continuing for years to \n     come--in order that this world organization may be a growing, \n     living instrumentality, capable of handling world problems in \n     a fair and effective way.\n\n  Even as we mark the United Nation's first 50 years, we must look to \nthe challenges of a new century. In past decades, others designed the \nUnited Nations, drafted the charter, passed the enabling legislation, \nand persevered throughout the cold war. The task facing us in this \ndecade is to assist the United Nations to adapt to the end of the cold \nwar and to a new century. The need for a United Nations remains clear, \nfor, as Madeleine Albright, the U.S. representative to the United \nNations, has commented:\n\n       The battle-hardened generation of Roosevelt, Churchill and \n     De Gaulle viewed the U.N. as a practical response to an \n     inherently contentious world; a necessity not because \n     relations among states could ever be brought into perfect \n     harmony, but because they cannot.\n\n  This sense of realism seems absent from many of the current \ndiscussions of the United Nations. While many rail about the \ndeficiencies of the United Nations, they have not proposed a viable \nalternative to the United Nations. If we look back at the debate 50 \nyears ago, we see that Senators recognized the necessity of U.N. \nmembership partly because they acknowledged the absence of an \nalternative.\n  While the United Nations work for peace and prosperity has never been \neasy, current challenges to peace have grown more complex partly \nbecause the nature of the conflicts the United Nations is asked to \naddress\n has changed. Complex interethnic conflicts are resurfacing after \nhaving been suppressed. Guerrilla warfare is increasingly conducted by \nwarring factions who do not respond to political or economic pressure. \nConflict is frequently within borders and involves militias and armed \ncivilians who lack discipline and clear chains of command. Disputes \noften take place without clear front lines. The fact that combatants \noften target civilians leads to increasing numbers both of displaced \npersons and refugees.\n\n  In an effort to address such conflicts, the United Nations has \nexpanded its operational responsibilities. As a result, U.N. \npeacekeeping missions have been deployed in places like Somalia or \nRwanda where personnel must grapple with the fact that no effective \nstate structure exists. In many trouble sports, the police and \njudiciary have collapsed, and general banditry and chaos prevail. \nGovernment assets have been destroyed and stolen; experienced officials \nhave been killed or forced to flee the country. These realities are \nforcing the U.N. personnel to reconsider their terms of reference and \nto grapple with inadequate mandates. The truth is that the United \nNations has been asked to handle some of the most uncertain, \nintractable, and dangerous cases of conflict.\n  Clearly, the United Nations must be practical about the limits of its \npeacekeeping and must not undertake efforts that will drain U.N. \nresources without achieving the mission's goals. It is frustrating not \nto be able to resolve all the many conflicts on the international \nagenda, but do we abandon the United Nations if it cannot completely \nand successfully solve every problem in our world? Few institutions \ndealing with such complex matters (or for that matter much simpler \nones) have 100-percent success records.\n  In 1945, President Truman made an observation that is relevant to the \ncurrent examination of U.N. peacekeeping efforts. He said,\n\n       Building a peace requires as much moral stamina as waging a \n     war. Perhaps it requires even more, because it is so \n     laborious and painstaking and undramatic. It requires undying \n     patience and continuous application. But it can give us, if \n     we stay with it, the greatest reward that there is in the \n     whole field of human effort.\n\n  I believe Americans recognize the wisdom of President Truman's words \nand want to do their part; the United Nations is one means by which \nthey can do so.\n  While U.N. peacekeeping has recently been the focus of attention, \nmuch of the United Nations work takes place in other areas. Less in the \nspotlight are the steadfast efforts of U.N. agencies \n\n[[Page S9576]]\nworking to alleviate poverty, to slow the spread of HIV/A.I.D.S., and \nto feed and educate the world's children. Where conflict leads to \ndestabilization of families and societies, the United Nations is there \nto shelter and feed refugees and displaced persons. Progress made on \nupholding international norms on human rights also stems from the work \nof U.N. agencies. Finally, the United Nations is responsible for many \nof the gains made in reducing the use of ozone-depleting substances, \nevaluating environmental impacts, and conserving biological diversity. \nThese are but a few of the challenges facing the world today. Many of \nthese problems have effects that do not respect national or geographic \nborders, and the United Nations offers a coherent and coordinated \napproach for meeting such challenges.\n  Mr. President, whether Americans feel the responsibility of \nexercising global leadership, are responding to humanitarian concerns, \nor seeking to expand opportunities for international trade and \ncommerce, the United Nations offers us a critical world forum. to \ncripple the United Nations by an erosion or withdrawal of American \nparticipation would be a terrible mistake. The United Nations provides \nthe institutional means for leveraging American diplomatic, economic, \nand military resources in ways that enhance our vital National \ninterests. Opinion surveys consistently indicate that a solid majority \nof the American people recognize the positive role that the United \nNations can play. I hope such recognition of the United Nations value \nand importance will be demonstrated when the Senate considers U.S. \nparticipation in and support for the United Nations. Let us heed the \nwords of warning offered by President Truman in 1945: ``The immediate, \nthe greatest threat to us is the threat of disillusionment, the danger \nof insidious skepticism--a loss of faith in the effectiveness of \ninternational cooperation.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9575-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     ONE HUNDRED YEARS IN HARDWARE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my hearty congratulations to the \nMichigan Retail Hardware Association on its 100th anniversary. This \nfine organization has been serving the hardware, home center, and \nlumber industry since July 9, 1895, when it was founded in Detroit. In \nreaching this milepost, they have weathered the years, surviving wars \nand depression, growing to be a robust and vigorous organization.\n  The backbone of this association is in the ranks of the hundreds of \nthe small business men and women who stand behind those hardware store \ncounters each day, ready to serve their customers with a smile and a \nhelping hand. Those weekend chores we all face, to fix up or cleanup \nour homesteads, becomes a pleasant endeavor after that cheerful visit \nto the neighborhood hardware store.\n  Over the years business leaders in this enterprise have come together \nand prospered, exercising that grand democratic tradition of flexing \ntheir common interests and gathering strength in numbers. By coming \ntogether, the members of the Michigan Retail Hardware Association make \nour communities and our economy solid, skills of managers and workers \nare fortified and commraderie and good fellowship grows.\n  The trip to the hardware store has become a valued ritual for \nAmerican families labor to make improvements on hearth and home. As we \nbuild and fix and sand and paint, we look to our hardware centers to \ngive them the tools and gadgets we need to make their lives more \ncomfortable and bright. For me, the nostalgia of the hardware store is \nthat no small town in America really seems complete without a hardware \nstore plunked down in the middle of Main Street.\n  My best wishes for this business group on the centennial anniversary \nof their founding. My best hopes for many more additional years of \nproductivity ahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9576-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9576-S9577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   HOUSE CUTS CRIME-FIGHTING DOLLARS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong opposition \nto actions taken by the House Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations \nSubcommittee earlier this week. In passing the 1996 appropriation's \nbill the subcommittee Republicans have set off on a course which would \ncripple Federal, State, and local efforts to combat crime. If the \nsubcommittee Republicans' plan is adopted: New FBI agents will not be \nhired; 20,000 State and local police will not be hired; thousands of \nwife-beaters will not be arrested, tried or convicted; new DEA agents \nwill not be hired; 80,000 offenders released on probation will not be \ntested for drugs or subject to certain punishment; and digital \ntelephony technology vital to law enforcement will not be developed.\n  First, let me address the cuts to Federal law enforcement. The \nPresident requested an increase of $122 million for FBI agents and \nother FBI activities--but the subcommittee Republicans cut $45 million \nfrom that request.\n  I would also point out that the subcommittee Republicans provides no \ndollars of the $300 million authorized for FBI in the Dole/Hatch \ncounter-terrorism bill. This legislation has not passed into law, so \nsome might say that is the reason that none of these dollars are made \navailable. But, the subcommittee Republicans did find a way to add \ntheir block grant which passed the House, but not the Senate.\n  So, I do not think there is any explanation for cutting the FBI other \nthan a fundamental lack of commitment to Federal law enforcement by the \nsubcommittee Republicans. I have heard time and again over the past \nseveral months from my Republican colleagues in the Senate that the \nPresident was not committed to Federal law enforcement. I have heard \ntime and again from my Republican colleagues that they would increase \nfunding for Federal law enforcement.\n  Well, something just does not add up--House subcommittee Republicans \nwill not give the President the increase he requested for the FBI, \ndespite all the rhetoric I have heard over the past several months.\n  The cuts to Federal law enforcement do not even stop there. The House \nsubcommittee Republicans cut $17 million from the $54 million boost \nrequested for DEA agents by the administration. That is more than a 30-\npercent cut. The House subcommittee Republicans provide no dollars of \nthe $60 million authorized for DEA in the Dole/Hatch counterterrorism \nbill.\n  Let me review another area where the actions of these subcommittee \nRepublicans are completely opposite the rhetoric I have heard from the \nother side here in the Senate.\n  The Violence Against Women Act--having first introduced the Violence \nAgainst Women Act 5 years ago, I had welcomed the bipartisan support \nfinally accorded the act last year. I would note the strong support \nprovided by Senators Hatch and Dole.\n  But, when we have gotten past the rhetoric and it came time to \nactually write the check in the Appropriations Subcommittee, the women \nof America were mugged. The President requested $175 million for the \nJustice Department's violence against women programs, and the House \nsubcommittee Republicans have provided less than half--$75 million.\n  While the specific programs have not been yet identified, that $100 \nmillion will mean the key initiatives will not get the funding that \neveryone on both sides of the aisle agreed they should: $130 million \nwas requested for grants to State and local police, prosecutors and \nvictims groups; $28 million was requested to make sure that every man \nwho beats his wife or girlfriend is arrested; $7 million was requested \nfor enforcement efforts against family violence and child abuse in \nrural areas; and $6 million was requested to provide special advocates \nfor abused children who come before a court.\n  I keep hearing about how the Violence Against Women Act is a \nbipartisan effort. In all the new so-called crime bills I have seen \nproposed by Members of the other side, not once have I seen any effort \nto repeal or cut back on any element of the Violence Against Women Act. \nBut, the actions of the House subcommittee Republicans tell a \ncompletely different story.\n  To discuss yet another troubling aspect of the House subcommittee \nRepublican bill--this bill eliminates the $1.9 billion sought for the \nsecond year of the 100,000 police program. That $1.9 \n\n[[Page S9577]]\nbillion would put at least 20,000 more State and local police officers \non the streets--and probably many more, for the $1.1 billion spent so \nfar this year has put well over 16,000 more police on the streets.\n  What happens to the $1.9 billion? In the House Republican bill, these \ndollars are shifted to a LEAA-style block grant for ``a variety of \nprograms including more police officers, crime prevention programs, \ndrug courts and equipment and technology,'' quoting the summary \nprovided by the House Republicans on the subcommittee.\n  In other words, not $1 must be spent to add State and local police \nofficers. I keep hearing about support for State and local police from \nthe other side of the aisle. But, just when it really matters, just \nwhen we are writing checks and not just making speeches, America's \nState and local police officers are being ripped-off. Instead of a \nguarantee that police officers and police departments get each and \nevery one of these $1.9 billion, the House subcommittee Republicans \npropose empty deal--money in the same type of grants that failed in the \n1970's and under standards so lax that America's police could wait \nthrough all next year without a single dollar.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the actions of the House Republicans on \nthe subcommittee are reversed in the full Appropriations Committee. And \nif not there, then I hope these actions will be reversed on the floor \nof the House.\n  But, if the House Republicans stand with the subcommittee and against \nFederal law enforcement, against FBI agents, against DEA agents, \nagainst the women of America, and against State and local police \nofficers, I urge all my colleagues in the Senate to stand by the \npositions they have taken all year and stand up to the House \nRepublicans.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9576-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9577-S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   SENATOR PELL AND THE U.N. CHARTER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last weekend I was honored to \nhave participated in the ceremonies in San Francisco commemorating the \n50th anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter. The event was an \nimportant reaffirmation of the commitment of member nations to abide by \nthe rule of law.\n  The ceremonies were enriched by the participation of those who had \nparticipated in the conference 50 years ago. We in the Senate are \nhonored to have the beloved former chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Claiborne Pell, counted among those who were \n``Present at the Creation'' of the Charter.\n  Senator Pell served throughout World War II in the Coast Guard. He \ncontinued to serve his country, as he has all his life, when he was \ncalled to be a member of the International Secretariat of the San \nFrancisco Conference, as it worked to draft the Charter. Senator Pell \nserved as the Assistant Secretary of Committee III, the Enforcement \nArrangements Committee, and worked specifically on what became articles \n43, 44, and 45 of the Charter.\n  In an article in the New York Times by Barbara Crossette, Senator \nPell recalls the trip to San Francisco:\n\n       It started out just right, he recalled in a recent \n     conversation in his Senate office. Instead of flying us to \n     San Francisco, they chartered a train across the United \n     States.\n       You could see the eyes of all those people who had been in \n     wartorn Europe boggle as we passed the wheat fields, the \n     factories, he said. You could feel the richness, the clean \n     air of the United States. It was a wonderful image. We shared \n     a spirit, a belief, that we would never make the same \n     mistakes; everything would now be done differently.\n\n  Senator Pell's commitment to the Charter was properly noted by the \nPresident, when during his address in San Francisco on Monday, he \nstated ``Some of those who worked at the historic conference are still \nhere today, including our own Senator Claiborne Pell, who to this very \nday, every day, carries a copy of the U.N. Charter in his pocket.''\n  On Sunday, the Washington Post carried an article by William Branigin \non the drafting of the Charter. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1995]\n\n  U.N.: 50 Years Fending Off WWIII--Charter Forged in Heat of Battle \n                   Proves Durable, as Do Its Critics\n\n                         (By William Branigin)\n\n       United Nations.--It was the eve of her first speech before \n     the 1945 organizing conference of the United Nations, and \n     Minerva Bernardino was eager to seize the opportunity to push \n     for women's rights. Then, while serving drinks to fellow \n     delegates in her San Francisco hotel suite, she fell and \n     broke her ankle.\n       For the determined diplomat from the Dominican Republic, \n     however, nothing was more important than delivering her \n     speech. So after being rushed to the hospital in an \n     ambulance, she refused a cast, had doctors tape up her ankle \n     instead and enlisted colleagues the next day to help her \n     hobble to the podium.\n       Bernardino, 88, is one of four surviving signatories of the \n     U.N. Charter, which was hammered out during the two-month \n     conference by representatives from 50 nations and signed in \n     San Francisco on June 26, 1945. With a handful of other women \n     delegates, she claims credit for the charter's reference to \n     ``equal rights of men and women.''\n       Just as she witnessed the birth of the United Nations that \n     day in the presence of President Harry S. Truman, Bernardino \n     plans to be in the audience Monday when President Clinton \n     caps the 50th birthday ceremonies with a speech at San \n     Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, scene of the historic \n     conference. Truman, whose first decision after taking office \n     in April 1945 was to go ahead with the conference, had flown \n     to San Francisco to carry the charter back to Washington for \n     ratification by the Senate.\n       Gathering for the anniversary are envoys from more than 100 \n     countries, senior U.N. officials led by Secretary General \n     Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Britain's Princess Margaret and \n     several Nobel peace prize laureates, including Polish \n     President Lech Walesa and South Africa's Archbishop Desmond \n     Tutu.\n       In creating the United nations 50 years ago, the more than \n     1,700 delegates and their assistants were driven by the \n     horror of a war that had cost an estimated 45 million lives. \n     Among the founders were prominent diplomats: Vyacheslav \n     Molotov and Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet Union, Edward R. \n     Stettinius of the United States and Anthony Eden of Britain. \n     The sole surviving U.S. signatory is Harold Stassen, the \n     former Republican governor of Minnesota and presidential \n     aspirant, now 88.\n       The leading conference organizer was its secretary general, \n     Alger Hiss, then a rising star in the State Department. He \n     later spent four years in prison for perjury in a \n     controversial spy case that launched the political ascent of \n     Richard M. Nixon. Now 90, in poor health and nearly blind, \n     Hiss has been invited to the commemoration but is unable to \n     attend.\n       ``We had a sense of creation and exhilaration,'' said Sen. \n     Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), who was then a young Coast Guard \n     officer attached to the conference's secretariat. World War \n     II was drawing to a close, and the assembled delegates were \n     determined to put into practice their lofty ideals of a \n     peaceful new world order.\n       As the United Nations celebrates its golden anniversary, \n     however, the world body seems to be under criticism as never \n     before. The credibility it gained after the end of the Cold \n     War and its role in the Persian Gulf conflict seem to have \n     been largely squandered by debacles in Somalia, Angola and \n     Bosnia, by its tardy response to carnage in Rwanda and by its \n     inability so far to undertake serious internal reforms.\n       From relatively lean beginnings with 1,500 staffers, the \n     United Nations has burgeoned into a far-flung bureaucracy \n     with more than 50,000 employees, plus thousands of \n     consultants. In many areas, critics say, it has become a talk \n     shop and paper mill plagued by waste, mismanagement, \n     patronage and inertia.\n       Although most Americans strongly support the United \n     Nations, a ``hard core of opposition'' to the body appears to \n     be growing, according to a new poll by the Times Mirror \n     Center for the People and the Press. It showed that 67 \n     percent of Americans hold a favorable attitude toward the \n     United Nations, compared to 53 percent for Congress and 43 \n     percent accorded the court system.\n       However, the poll showed, 28 percent expressed a ``mostly'' \n     or ``very'' unfavorable opinion of the United Nations, the \n     highest of four such polls since 1990.\n       In fact, after the demise of the ``red menace'' with the \n     end of the Cold War, the organization seems to have become \n     something of a lightning rod for extreme right-wing groups, \n     which see it as part of a plot to form a global government.\n       For the United Nations, the 50th birthday bash is an \n     opportunity to trumpet a list of achievements. To celebrate \n     the occasion, the organization is spending $15 million, which \n     it says comes entirely from voluntary contributions.\n       Over the years, U.N. officials point out, the world body \n     and its agencies have performed dangerous peacekeeping \n     missions, promoted decolonization, assisted refugees and \n     disaster victims, helped eradicate smallpox, brought aid and \n     services to impoverished countries and won five Nobel peace \n     prizes.\n       At the same time, the anniversary is focusing attention on \n     the organization's shortcomings and on efforts to chart a new \n     course for its future. Among the proposals in a recent study \n     funded by the Ford Foundation, for example, are expanding the \n     Security Council, curtailing veto powers, establishing a \n     permanent U.N. armed force and creating an international \n     taxation system to help finance the organization.\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\n       As the United Nations has expanded, some of its agencies \n     have lost their focus and become bogged down in tasks that \n     duplicate efforts elsewhere in the system or serve little \n     purpose but to employ bureaucrats, critics charge. Meanwhile, \n     financing problems have grown acute, especially with the \n     explosion in recent years of expenses for peacekeeping, a \n     function that was not specifically spelled out in the \n     original charter.\n       The U.N. peacekeeping budget this year bulged to $3.5 \n     billion, far exceeding the regular U.N. budget of $2.6 \n     billion. Moreover, several countries, including the United \n     States, owe U.N. dues totaling hundreds of millions of \n     dollars. Unpaid peacekeeping dues for Bosnia alone come to \n     $900 million.\n       The Bosnian quagmire has underscored the limits of U.N. \n     peacekeeping. Critics, notably in the U.S. Congress, have \n     tended to blame U.N. bureaucrats for the mess, while U.N. \n     officials say the operation exemplifies a penchant by member \n     states for setting heavy new mandates without providing the \n     resources to carry them out.\n       ``Member countries should take advantage of the 50th \n     anniversary to really look hard at the U.N. and to revise and \n     strengthen it,'' said Catherine Gwin of the Washington-based \n     Overseas Development Council. ``Increased demands are being \n     made on an organization that has been neglected, misused and \n     excessively politicized by its member governments for years, \n     and it is showing the strain.''\n       As the United Nations has expanded, forming entities that \n     deal with topics from outer space to seabeds, the original \n     purpose often has been overlooked. That is, as the U.N. \n     Charter's preamble states, ``to save succeeding generations \n     from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has \n     brought untold sorrow to mankind.''\n       While scores of conflicts costing millions of lives have \n     broken out since that signing 50 years ago, some of the \n     organization's promoters say it deserves a share of credit \n     for averting its founders' worst nightmare: World War III. \n     Clearly, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the \n     subsequent nuclear standoff between the United States and the \n     Soviet Union may have been the main deterrents, but the world \n     body also played a role, U.N. supporters say.\n       ``If we didn't have the United Nations, we would have had \n     another world war,'' said Bernardino in an interview in her \n     New York apartment, where she keeps an office filled with \n     U.N. mementos. On her desk is a large silverframed, \n     personally dedicated photograph of her role model, Eleanor \n     Roosevelt, and in her drawer is an original signed copy of \n     the U.N. Charter.\n       At the time of the signing, U.S. public opinion held that \n     there would be a third world war by the early 1970s, Stassen \n     said.\n       ``We believed we were going to stop future Hitlers from \n     future acts of aggression,'' said Brian Urquhart, a Briton \n     who joined the United Nations shortly after the conference \n     and rose to become an undersecretary general. ``There was an \n     enormous sense of confidence and optimism in the charter . . \n     . led by the Untied States. This was predominantly a U.S. \n     achievement.''\n       Indeed, the United Nations was principally the brainchild \n     of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who gave the organization \n     its name and reached agreement on its formation with British \n     Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph \n     Stalin.\n       At the San Francisco conference, however, major problems \n     developed over \n     decolonization and the \n     Soviets' insistence on a broad veto power over virtually all \n     Security Council business, even the setting of agenda items \n     and the discussion of disputes. Initially, the Soviets had \n     also wanted 16 votes in the General Assembly, adding one for \n     each of their 15 republics. They eventually settled for three \n     after it was pointed out that by that logic, the United \n     States ought to have 49 votes.\n       According to Stassen, who served as Minnesota's youngest \n     governor before joining the Navy during the war and who went \n     on to seek the Republican nomination for president four \n     times, his wife Esther played a key role in resolving the \n     veto impasse. Some of the Soviet delegates' wives had told \n     her that Stalin had set the veto position and none of their \n     husbands dared ask the dictator to modify it, Stassen said. \n     But if the Americans could present their arguments directly \n     to Stalin, he might change his mind, the wives advised.\n       Stassen said he reported this to President Truman, who had \n     taken office upon Roosevelt's death. Truman dispatched Harry \n     Hopkins, Roosevelt's closest adviser, to Moscow, and Stalin \n     was persuaded to limit the veto to the Security Council's \n     final resolutions.\n       The lone American woman delegate, Virginia Gildersleeve, \n     the dean of Barnard College, played a key role in drafting \n     the U.N. Charter's preamble.\n       Stassen recalls her exasperation after the drafting \n     committee's first meeting, where language along the lines of \n     ``the high contracting parties have assembled and entered \n     this treaty'' was proposed. ``That's no way to start a \n     charter for the future of the world,'' fumed Gildersleeve. \n     ``It's got to say, `We the peoples of the United Nations . . \n     .''' Her proposal was ridiculed by diplomats, who insisted \n     that the charter could not be formed by ``peoples,'' but only \n     by the representatives of governments. Eventually, however, \n     she prevailed and eloquence overcame diplomatese.\n       For Stassen, the defining moment came five days before the \n     signing when Secretary of State Stettinius, the conference \n     chairman, announced that there was nothing else on his \n     agenda. He then asked all heads of delegations who were ready \n     to sign the charter to stand.\n       ``Chairs began to scrape . . . and suddenly the delegations \n     realized that every one of the 50 chairmen was standing, and \n     they broke out into applause for the first time in those \n     sessions,'' Stassen recalled.\n       Still, the seeds of the Cold War evidently had been \n     planted. Pell, now 76 and the ranking Democrat on the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, recalls walking to a restaurant \n     with a Soviet admiral when a big black car suddenly pulled \n     over and picked up the Russian.\n       ``He wasn't supposed to go to lunch with capitalists,'' \n     Pell said.\n       The senator also vividly remembers traveling to San \n     Francisco by train from the East Coast with other young \n     officers from Europe. As the train rolled past the seemingly \n     endless grain fields and the unscathed cities and towns of \n     America's heartland, the Europeans were stunned by the \n     contrast with their own war-ravaged countries. ``Their eyes \n     got wider and wider,'' Pell said, and they arrived in San \n     Francisco with a sense of awe for the power and resources of \n     the United States.\n       Bernardino's most vivid memory was of the day the war in \n     Europe ended while the conference was underway in may 1945. A \n     Honduran delegate, who had just heard the news of the street, \n     burst into her committee meeting and shouted, ``The war is \n     over!'' and the room erupted in celebration, she said.\n       For Betty Teslenko, then a 22-year-old stenographer at the \n     conference, the imposing cast of characters was most \n     impressive. One who deserved special credit as a mediator of \n     many disputes was the Australian foreign minister, Herbert \n     Evatt, whose broad accent prompted some good-natured ribbing, \n     she recalled. One joke that made the rounds: What's the \n     difference between a buffalo and a bison? Answer: a bison is \n     what Evatt uses to wash his hands in the morning.\n       According to Teslenko, Hiss was so efficient in organizing \n     the conference that he became the choice of many delegates to \n     be the United Nations' first secretary general. However, an \n     unwritten rule that the organization's head should not come \n     from one of the five permanent, veto-wielding members of the \n     Security Council--the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, \n     France and China--made that impossible.\n       For Piedad Suro, then a young reporter from Ecuador, the \n     conference was memorable chiefly for the difficulties of \n     finding out what was going on in the closed sessions--and for \n     a whirlwind courtship by the man who became her husband, \n     Guillermo Suro, the State Department's chief of language \n     services. Their son, Roberto Suro, is now a Washington Post \n     editor.\n       ``That was where we dated and he proposed,'' Suro said of \n     the San Francisco conference. ``We became engaged the last \n     week and were married in New York two months later.'' She \n     denies, however, that her fiance ever gave her a scoop.\n       As Truman arrived in San Francisco to witness the signing \n     50 years ago, an estimated 250,000 cheering people turned out \n     to greet his mile-long motorcade, giving him what The \n     Washington Post at the time described as ``the most \n     tumultuous demonstration since he entered the White House.''\n       ``You have created a great instrument for peace,'' Truman \n     said at the signing ceremony to a standing ovation, ``Oh, \n     what a great day this can be in history.''\n       Today a common view among both U.N. supporters and critics \n     seems to be that if the world body were to disappear, it \n     would have to be quickly reinvented.\n       ``While it hasn't been altogether a 100 percent success,'' \n     said Sen. Pell, ``we're certainly far better off for having \n     the United Nations exist than we would be without \n     it.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9577-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         CHANGING TIME FOR VOTE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the nomination of Tena Campbell for the position of U.S. \ndistrict judge for the district of Utah.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am keenly aware of the \nimportance of the Federal judiciary and its impact on our citizens; not \nonly litigants whose cases are decided by Federal courts, but all \nAmericans who, in so many ways, are affected in their daily lives by \nrulings handed down by Federal judges. It is for this reason that I \nhave always believed that nominees for Federal judicial positions must \nbe individuals of the highest caliber, both professionally and \npersonally. I am pleased to say that Tena Campbell is such a nominee.\n  Tena Campbell is an individual whose accomplishments and \nqualifications for the position of Federal district court judge speak \nfor themselves. After working in private practice and in the \n\n[[Page S9580]]\nSalt Lake County attorney's office, Mrs. Campbell became an assistant \nU.S. attorney in Utah, where she has served with distinction since \n1982. During that time, she has tried more than 60 felony cases--more \ncases than most lawyers try in their entire career.\n  She has risen to become the Financial Institution Fraud Coordinator \nfor the U.S. attorney's office, in charge of all cases involving \nfederally insured institutions, in addition to prosecuting other \ncomplex white-collar crime cases. It is a measure of her dedication \nthat despite the complexity and time-consuming nature of white-collar \ncrime cases, she has also chosen to continue to prosecute violent crime \ncases.\n  Throughout her service as an assistant U.S. attorney, Tena Campbell \nhas earned the respect of the Federal bench and a reputation as a \nhardworking, tough, yet compassionate, prosecutor. She has received the \nhighest rating, Well Qualified, from the American Bar Association. I am \nconvinced that as a Federal judge, where she would be the first woman \nin Utah history to serve in that position, Tena Campbell will be fair, \nhonest, and knowledgeable, and I am proud to support her nomination.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n\n\n        statement of the nomination of clifford gregory stewart\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Greg Stewart to be general counsel of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC].\n  Greg Stewart is a native New Jerseyan and has most recently served as \nthe director of the division of civil rights for the State of New \nJersey. I believe that Greg Stewart has the qualifications and the \nexperience to make an excellent general counsel at EEOC.\n  Mr. President, Greg Stewart has been involved in civil rights issues \nfor over 13 years. He has served as the director of the division of \ncivil rights in New Jersey under both a Democratic and Republican \ngovernor. He has also worked for the department of the public advocate \nin New Jersey, again under Democratic and Republican Governors. During \nwhatever free time he has had since he graduated from Rutgers Law \nSchool in 1981, he has taught constitutional and civil rights law at \nRutgers School of Law and John Jay College.\n  Greg Stewart has an outstanding scholar. He has a three degrees from \nRutgers; a B.A. in political science, an M.A. in political science, and \na J.D. from the Rutgers Law School in Newark. He has received several \nacademic honors including an Eagleton Institute of Politics fellowship. \nIn addition to his academic accomplishments, Greg has also been \ninvolved in community service. In fact, he received the Community \nService Award for the New Jersey Conference of the NAACP branches and \nthe Equal Justice Medal for the Legal Services of New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, our country is on the brink of a national debate on \naffirmation action and civil rights laws. I think Greg Stewart can make \nan excellent contribution to this debate as general counsel to the \nEEOC. He has a vast amount of experience in civil rights law and he has \nserved under Republicans and Democrats with a sincere respect for the \nlaw, objectivity, and a unique sense of balance. I am proud to support \nhis nomination and urge the Senate to confirm his nomination to EEOC \ngeneral counsel.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9579-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate proceed \nto immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 148, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 148) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the arrest of Harry Wu by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to the \nimmediate consideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n                    red chinese up to no good--again\n\n  Mr. HELMS. The resolution condemns the arrest of Mr. Peter H. W., a \npersonal friend of mine who has been arrested by the Red Chinese. I \nunderstand the House of Representatives Committee on International \nRelations reported a similar resolution yesterday that is expected to \nbe considered by the House this morning.\n  Peter Hongda Wu, known to all of us as Harry Wu, entered China last \nweek on a valid United States passport and a valid visa issued by the \nChinese themselves.\n  Harry submitted his papers at the border and was immediately placed \nunder house arrest by Chinese authorizes and held for 3 days, after \nwhich a caravan of Communist-style cars arrived in the small border \ntown near Kazakhstan and whisked Harry away.\n  Harry Wu has not been seen or heard from since. Mr. President, the \ncruelty the Chinese Communists can inflict, especially on humans they \nclaim have committed crimes against the state. Unfortunately, because \nHarry has devoted his life to exposing human rights abuses in China, \nthe Chinese have \n\n[[Page S9581]]\ntaken purely punitive action against him.\n  Harry Wu has worked and cooperated with the Senate for many years. It \nwas Harry who first informed me that the Chinese were forcing their own \nprisoners, many of them political prisoners, to produce products for \nsale to other countries. Harry was extraordinarily familiar with these \npractices since he spent 19 years in a Chinese prison.\n  More recently, Mr. President, at my invitation, Harry testified \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Chinese \nGovernment's practice of selling organs removed from the bodies of \njust-executed prisoners, including political prisoners. The Chinese \nmake these organs available on the international market--for cold \ncash--for example, $10,000 for a liver and varying amounts for corneas \nand other human organs.\n  Harry's video footage filmed in China, proved that the Chinese even \nhave gone so far as to harvest both kidneys from living prisoners. \nUnderstandably, the hearing received a great deal of international \nattention, and the Chinese are obviously punishing Harry Wu for \ninforming the U.S. Congress about this and other matters.\n  Mr. President, the Chinese have already usurped 19 years of Harry \nWu's life. They must not persecute him further. He is a faithful and \nhonest American citizen devoted to ensuring the wellbeing of Chinese \ncitizens. I urge Senators and the President to do everything within \ntheir power to press for Harry Wu's immediate release and safe return. \nAs his friend, I appeal to all Senators for their support.\n  Mr. President, my resolution expresses condemnation of the arrest and \ndetention of Harry Wu. It further calls upon China to comply \nimmediately with its commitments under the United States-People's \nRepublic of China Consular Convention by providing the United States \nGovernment with a full accounting for Harry's arrest and detention. I \nurge the Senate to adopt the resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe considered and agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nto the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 148) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows: 6se\n                              S. Res. 148\n\n       Whereas Peter H. Wu, known as Harry Wu, attempted to enter \n     the People's Republic of China on June 19, 1995, near the \n     China-Kazakhstan border;\n       Whereas Harry Wu, a 58-year-old American citizen, was \n     traveling on a valid United States passport and a valid visa \n     issued by the Chinese authorities;\n       Whereas the Chinese authorities confined Harry Wu to house \n     arrest for 3 days, after which time he has not been seen or \n     heard from;\n       Whereas the Chinese Foreign Ministry notified the United \n     States Embassy in Beijing of Mr. Wu's detention on Friday, \n     June 23;\n       Whereas the United States Embassy in Beijing approached the \n     Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday, June 26, to issue an \n     official demarche for the detention of an American citizen;\n       Whereas the terms of the United States-People's Republic of \n     China Consular convention on February 19, 1982, require that \n     United States Government officials shall be accorded access \n     to an American citizen as soon as possible but not more than \n     48 hours after the United States has been notified of such \n     detention;\n       Whereas on Wednesday, June 28, the highest ranking \n     representative of the People's Republic of China in the \n     United States refused to offer the United States Government \n     any information on Harry Wu's whereabouts or the charges \n     brought against him;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China is \n     in violation of the terms of its Consular Convention;\n       Whereas Harry Wu, who was born in China, has already spent \n     19 years in Chinese prisons;\n       Whereas Harry Wu has dedicated his life to the betterment \n     of the human rights situation in the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas Harry Wu first detailed to the United States \n     Congress the practice of using prison labor to produce \n     products for export from China to other countries;\n       Whereas Harry Wu testified before the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate on May 4, 1995, informing the \n     Committee, the Senate, and the American people about the \n     Chinese government practice of murdering Chinese prisoners, \n     including political prisoners, for the purpose of harvesting \n     their organs for sale on the international market;\n       Whereas on June 2, 1995, the President of the United States \n     announced his determination that further extension of the \n     waiver authority granted by section 402(c) of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 (Public Law 93-618; 88 Stat. 1978), also known as \n     ``Jackson-Vanik'', will substantially promote freedom of \n     emigration from the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas this waiver authority will allow the People's \n     Republic of China to receive the lowest tariff rates \n     possible, also known as Most-Favored-Nation trading status, \n     for a period of 12 months beginning on July 3, 1995; and\n       Whereas the Chinese government and people benefit \n     substantially from the continuation of such trading benefits: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the United States Senate expresses its \n     condemnation of the arrest of Peter H. Wu and its deep \n     concern for his well-being.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the People's Republic of China must immediately comply \n     with its commitments under the United States-People's \n     Republic of China Consular Convention of February 19, 1982, \n     by allowing consular access to Peter H. Wu;\n       (2) the People's Republic of China should provide \n     immediately a full accounting of Peter Wu's whereabouts and \n     the charges being brought against him; and\n       (3) the President of the United States should use every \n     diplomatic means available to ensure Peter Wu's safe and \n     expeditious return to the United States.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States with \n     the request that the President further transmit such copy to \n     the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United \n     States.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9580-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9581-S9589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             FISHERIES ACT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

CIVIL PENALTIES AND LICENSE SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Civil Penalties.--\n       (1) Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice \n     and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 \n     of title 5, United States Code, to have committed an act \n     prohibited by section 106 shall be liable to the United \n     States for a civil penalty.

The Secretary shall \n     promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record \n     upon which such penalty or sanction was imposed, as provided \n     in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. The findings \n     and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court \n     if they are not found to be supported by substantial \n     evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Collection.--\n       (1) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil \n     penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, \n     or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in \n     favor of the Secretary, the matter shall be referred to the \n     Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in \n     any appropriate district court of the United States. In such \n     action the validity and appropriateness of the final order \n     imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.\n       (2) A high seas fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, \n     furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the \n     commission of an act prohibited by section 106 shall be \n     liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such \n     violation under subsection (a) and may be proceeded against \n     in any district court of the United States having \n     jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a \n     maritime lien on such vessel that may be recovered in an \n     action in rem in the district court of the United States \n     having jurisdiction over the vessel.\n\n     SEC. 109.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) customary international law and the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of \n     passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the \n     waters commonly referred to as the ``Inside Passage'' off the \n     Pacific Coast of Canada;\n       (2) Canada recently required all commercial fishing vessels \n     of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain \n     a ``license which authorizes transit'' through the Inside \n     Passage;\n       (3) this action was inconsistent with international law, \n     including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea, and, in particular, Article 26 of that Convention, which \n     specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety \n     of United States commercial fishermen who sought to avoid the \n     fee by traveling in less protected waters;\n       (4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 provides for the \n     reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a \n     license fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been \n     seized, but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by \n     the owner in advance in order to prevent a seizure;\n       (5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person \n     in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by \n     mail;\n       (6) significant expense and delay was incurred by \n     commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to \n     travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports \n     in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the \n     costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the \n     Fishermen's Protective Act;\n       (7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be \n     amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees \n     required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in \n     order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if \n     the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with \n     international law;\n       (8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from \n     Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse \n     vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;\n       (9) the United States should review its current policy with \n     respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada \n     in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters \n     in and near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such \n     vessels the same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of \n     the United States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of \n     Canada off British Columbia;\n       (10) the President should ensure that, consistent with \n     international law, the United States Coast Guard has \n     available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and \n     Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, \n     the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the \n     rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels \n     operating in disputed waters;\n       (11) the President should continue to review all agreements \n     between the United States and Canada to identify other \n     actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any \n     reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against \n     Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately \n     implement any actions which the President deems appropriate \n     if Canada reinstates the fee;\n       (12) the President should continue to immediately convey to \n     Canada in the strongest terms that the United States will not \n     now, nor at any time in the future, tolerate any action by \n     Canada which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of \n     passage of vessels of the United States in a manner \n     inconsistent with international law; and\n       (13) the United States should redouble its efforts to seek \n     expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery \n     conservation and management measures that can be implemented \n     through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual \n     concern.\n\n     SEC. 402.

(a) In any case on or after June 15, 1994, in \n     which a vessel of the United States exercising its right of \n     passage is charged a fee by the government of a foreign \n     country to engage in transit passage between points in the \n     United States (including a point in the exclusive economic \n     zone or in an area over which jurisdiction is in dispute), \n     and such fee is regarded by the United States as being \n     inconsistent with international law, the Secretary of State \n     shall reimburse the vessel owner for the amount of any such \n     fee paid under protest.\n       ``(b) In seeking such reimbursement, the vessel owner shall \n     provide, together with such other information as the \n     Secretary of State may require--\n       ``(1) a copy of the receipt for payment;\n       ``(2) an affidavit attesting that the owner or the owner's \n     agent paid the fee under protest; and\n       ``(3) a copy of the vessel's certificate of documentation.\n       ``(c) Requests for reimbursement shall be made to the \n     Secretary of State within 120 days after the date of payment \n     of the fee, or within 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this section, whichever is later.\n       ``(d) [such] Such funds as may be necessary to meet the \n     requirements of this section may be made available from the \n     unobligated balances of previously appropriated funds \n     remaining in the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund established under \n     section 7 and the Fishermen's Protective Fund established \n     under section 9.

(a) If the Secretary of State finds that the \n     government of any nation imposes conditions on the operation \n     or transit of United States fishing vessels which the United \n     States regards as being inconsistent with international law \n     or an international agreement, the Secretary of State shall \n     certify that fact to the President.\n       ``(b) Upon receipt of a certification under subsection (a), \n     the President shall direct the heads of Federal agencies to \n     impose similar conditions on the operation or transit of \n     fishing vessels registered under the laws of the nation which \n     has imposed conditions on United States fishing vessels.\n       ``(c) For the purposes of this section, the term `fishing \n     vessel' has the meaning given \n\n[[Page S9588]]\n     that term in section 2101(11a) of title 46, United States Code.\n       ``(d) It is the sense of the Congress that any action taken \n     by any Federal agency under subsection (b) should be \n     commensurate with any conditions certified by the Secretary \n     of State under subsection (a).''.\n\n     SEC. 403. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Section 7(c) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 \n     (22 U.S.C. 1977(c)) is amended by striking the third \n     sentence.\n       (b) Section 7(e) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 \n     (22 U.S.C. 1977(e)) is amended by striking ``October 1, \n     1993'' and inserting ``October 1, 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 404. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.\n\n       (a)(1) Section 15(a) of Public Law 103-238 is amended by \n     striking ``April 1, 1994,'' and inserting ``May 1, [1994,''.] \n     1994.''.\n       (2) The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall be effective \n     on and after April 30, 1994.\n       (b) Section 803(13)(C) of Public Law 102-567 (16 U.S.C. \n     5002(13)(C)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(C) any vessel supporting a vessel described in \n     subparagraph (A) or (B).''.\n\n        TITLE V--FISHERIES ENFORCEMENT IN CENTRAL SEA OF OKHOTSK\n\n     SEC. 501.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``High Seas Driftnet Fishing \n     Moratorium Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress has enacted and the President has signed into \n     law numerous Acts to control or prohibit large-scale driftnet \n     fishing both within the jurisdiction of the United States and \n     beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, including \n     the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act \n     of 1987 (title IV, Public Law 100-220), the Driftnet Act \n     Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-627), and the High Seas \n     Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act (title I, Public Law 102-\n     582);\n       (2) the United States is a party to the Convention for the \n     Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South \n     Pacific, also known as the Wellington Convention;\n       (3) the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted \n     three resolutions and three decisions which established and \n     reaffirm a global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing \n     on the high seas, beginning with Resolution 44/225 in 1989 \n     and most recently in Decision 48/445 in 1993;\n       (4) the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted \n     these resolutions and decisions at the request of the United \n     States and other concerned nations;\n       (5) the best scientific information demonstrates the \n     wastefulness and potentially destructive impacts of large-\n     scale driftnet fishing on living marine resources and \n     seabirds; and\n       (6) Resolution 46/215 of the United Nations General \n     Assembly calls on all nations, both individually and \n     collectively, to prevent large-scale driftnet fishing on the \n     high seas.\n\n     SEC. 603. PROHIBITION.\n\n       The United States, or any agency or official acting on \n     behalf of the United States, may not enter into any \n     international agreement with respect to the conservation and \n     management of living marine resources or the use of the high \n     seas by fishing vessels that would prevent full \n     implementation of the global moratorium on large-scale \n     driftnet fishing on the high seas, as such moratorium is \n     expressed in Resolution 46/215 of the United Nations General \n     Assembly.\n\n     SEC. 604. NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of State, on behalf of the United States, \n     shall seek to enhance the implementation and effectiveness of \n     the United Nations General Assembly resolutions and decisions \n     regarding the moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on \n     the high seas through appropriate international agreements \n     and organizations.\n\n     SEC. 605. CERTIFICATION.\n\n       The Secretary of State shall determine in writing prior to \n     the signing or provisional application by the United States \n     of any international agreement with respect to the \n     conservation and management of living marine resources or the \n     use of the high seas by fishing vessels that the prohibition \n     contained in section 603 will not be violated if such \n     agreement is signed or provisionally applied.\n\n     SEC. 606. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       The President shall utilize appropriate assets of the \n     Department of Defense, the United States Coast Guard, and \n     other Federal agencies to detect, monitor, and prevent \n     violations of the United Nations moratorium on large-scale \n     driftnet fishing on the high seas for all fisheries under the \n     jurisdiction of the United States and, in the case of \n     fisheries not under the jurisdiction of the United States, to \n     the fullest extent permitted under international law.\n\n          TITLE VII--GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL FISHERY AGREEMENT\n\n     SEC. 701. AGREEMENT WITH ESTONIA.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 203 of the Magnuson Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1823), the \n     governing international fishery agreement between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the government \n     of the Republic of Estonia as contained in the message to \n     Congress from the President of the United States dated \n     January 19, 1995, is approved as a governing international \n     fishery agreement for the purposes of such Act and shall \n     enter into force and effect with respect to the United States \n     on the date of enactment of this Act.\n                           Amendment No. 1488\n\n  (Purpose: To correct certain minor and technical errors in the bill)\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent the reported committee amendment be \nwithdrawn and I send a substitute to the desk on behalf of Senators \nStevens, Kerry, Snowe, and Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for Mr. Stevens, for \n     himself, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Breaux, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1488.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I urge the Senate to support the \npassage of S. 267, the Fisheries Act of 1995--what the Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries calls ``the international fish package.''\n  I introduced S. 267 on January 24, 1995. It was approved by the \nCommerce Committee in executive session on March 23, 1995 and reported \nto the full Senate on May 26, 1995.\n  Senators Kerry, Gorton, Breaux, Packwood, Murkowski, and Murray join \nme as cosponsors to the bill.\n  What I am presenting today with Senator Kerry is a bipartisan \nsubstitute to the reported bill, which includes additions and minor \nchanges I will briefly address.\n  We've added an important new section--title VII--to the bill that \nwill implement the agreement reached between the United States and \nCanada on February 3, 1995 to conserve and manage Yukon River salmon \nstocks.\n  This agreement and the necessary implementing legislation will help \nassure commercial and subsistence fishermen living along the Yukon \nRiver in both Alaska and Canada that our shared salmon resources are \ncarefully managed and restored in the years ahead.\n  I introduced the Yukon legislation (S. 662) on April 3, 1995. The \ncommittee received testimony on it at our Magnuson Act reauthorization \nfield hearing in Seattle, WA, on March 18, 1995.\n  The agreement requires the United States to pay $400,000 annually \ninto a Yukon River restoration and enhancement fund for mutually \nbeneficial salmon restoration and enhancement activities along the \nYukon River.\n  The agreement also creates a joint United States/Canada Yukon River \npanel to make conservation and management recommendations and to help \ndetermine how to spend the restoration and enhancement funds.\n  My provision establishes the U.S. section of the Yukon River panel \nand authorizes spending for: The U.S. payment, the necessary costs of \nthe panel and an advisory committee, and other costs associated with \nthe conservation and management of Yukon River salmon.\n  Title III of the bill--which includes amendments to, and the \nreauthorization of, the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act--has been revised \nto require a listing procedures by the United States of nations whose \nvessels are operating in a way that diminishes the effectiveness of \nconservation efforts in the Atlantic tunas convention area.\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\n  We've also added a new provision to require a review of bluefin tuna \nregulations.\n  Minor changes have been made in title IV relating to the source of \nfunds to be used to reimburse United States fishermen who paid Canada`s \ntransit fee in 1994.\n  A new provision has been added to title IV to reimburse the legal and \ntravel costs--not to exceed a total of $25,000--of owners of scallop \nvessels seized by Canada in 1994, who were fishing for sedentary \nspecies outside of Canada's exclusive economic zone.\n  We've deleted a Governing International Fisheries Agreement [GIFA] \nwith Estonia, which already went into effect since the time we \nintroduced S. 267.\n  We've added a new section--section 801--which amends the South \nPacific Tuna Act of 1988 to authorize vessels documented under the laws \nof the United States to fish for tuna in all waters of the treaty area, \nincluding the U.S. exclusive economic zone of that area.\n  This new section also lifts certain restrictions for fishing for tuna \nin the treaty area so long as purse seines are not used to encircle any \ndolphin or other marine mammal.\n  Finally, we've added a new section--section 802--at Senator Snowe's \nrequest and with Senator Kerry's assistance, to prohibit a foreign \nallocation in any fishery within the U.S. exclusive economic zone \nunless a fishery management plan is in place for the fishery.\n  The new section 802 prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from \napproving fishing under a permit application by a foreign vessel for \nAtlantic herring or mackerel unless the appropriate regional fishery \nmanagement council has approved the fishing--and unless the Secretary \nof Commerce has included in the permit any restrictions recommended by \nthe council.\n  I want to thank Senator Kerry and his staff, Penny Dalton, Lila Helms \nand Steve Metruck for their work on this package. I also want to thank \nthe staff who assisted me with this: Trevor McCabe, Tom Melius and \nRebecca Metzner.\n  We urge the Senate to pass S. 267. We've worked in recent weeks with \nHouse members and staff on the House Resources Committee, and believe \nthe package we are presenting today will be acceptable in the House, so \nthat quick action may be possible in getting this passed into law.\n  Below is a brief summary of the bill:\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Title I (The High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995) \n     provides for the domestic implementation of the Agreement to \n     Promote Compliance with International Conservation and \n     Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, \n     which was adopted by the U.N. Food and Agriculture \n     Organization in 1993. It would establish a system of \n     permitting, reporting, and regulation for U.S. vessels \n     fishing on the high seas.\n       Title II (The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act) \n     would implement the Convention on Future Multilateral \n     Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries. The Treaty \n     calls for establishment of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries \n     Organization (NAFO) to assess and conserve high seas fishery \n     resources off the coasts of Canada and New England. Among \n     other provisions, this title would provide for: 1) U.S. \n     representation in NAFO; 2) coordination between NAFO and \n     appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils; and 3) \n     authorization for the Secretaries of Commerce and State to \n     carry out U.S. responsibilities under the Convention.\n       Title III (Atlantic Tunas Convention Act) extends the \n     authorization of appropriations for the Atlantic Tunas \n     Convention Act through fiscal year 1998; provides for the \n     development of a research and monitoring program for bluefin \n     tuna and other wide-ranging Atlantic fish stocks; establishes \n     operating procedures for the International Commission for the \n     Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) Advisory Committee; \n     calls for an annual report to be made and addresses actions \n     to be taken with nations that fail to comply with ICCAT \n     recommendations.\n       Title IV (Fishermen's Protective Act) reauthorizes and \n     amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to allow the \n     Secretary of State to reimburse U.S. fishermen forced to pay \n     transit passage fees by a foreign country regarded by the \n     U.S. to be inconsistent with international law. The amendment \n     responds to the $1,500 (Canadian $) transit fee charged to \n     U.S. fishermen last year for passage off British Columbia.\n       Title V (Sea of Okhotsk) would prohibit U.S. fishermen from \n     fishing in the Central Sea of Okhotsk (known as the ``Peanut \n     Hole'') except where such fishing is conducted in accordance \n     with a fishery agreement to which both the U.S. and Russia \n     are parties.\n       Title VI (Relating to U.N. Driftnet Ban) would prohibit the \n     U.S. from entering into any international agreement with \n     respect to fisheries, marine resources, the use of the high \n     seas, or trade in fish or fish products that would prevent \n     full implementation of the United Nations global moratorium \n     on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas.\n       Title VII (Yukon River Salmon Act) would provide domestic \n     implementing legislation for the agreement reached between \n     the United States and Canada on February 3, 1995 to conserve \n     and manage Yukon River salmon stocks. It provides for U.S. \n     representation on the Yukon River Panel; establishes voting \n     procedures for the U.S. section of the panel; and authorizes \n     appropriations for the $400,000 annual contribution required \n     by the United States under the agreement for Yukon River \n     salmon restoration and enhancement, as well as other costs \n     associated with salmon conservation on the Yukon River.\n       Title VIII (Miscellaneous) includes two sections. Section \n     801 amends the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 to authorize \n     vessels documented under the laws of the United States to \n     fish for tuna in all waters of the Treaty Area, including the \n     U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of that area. It also lifts \n     certain restrictions for fishing for tuna in the Treaty area \n     so long as purse seines are not used to encircle any dolphin \n     or other marine mammal.\n       Section 802 prohibits a foreign allocation in any fishery \n     within the U.S. exclusive economic zone unless a fishery \n     management plan is in place for the fishery. Section 802 also \n     prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from approving fishing \n     under permit application by a foreign vessel for Atlantic \n     herring or mackerel unless the appropriate regional fishery \n     management council has approved the fishing; and unless the \n     Secretary of Commerce has included in the permit any \n     restrictions recommended by the Council.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9581-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9589-S9592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ADOPTION OF S. 267\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, S. 267 the Fisheries Act of 1995, is a \nbill I am pleased to bring to the floor for consideration today. It is \ncomprised of a number of measures that would strengthen international \nfishery conservation and management.\n  I would like to recognize the efforts of Senator Stevens, our Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee chairman, who along with Senators Kerry, \nGorton, Murray, and Murkowski introduced the bill. The bill also was \ncosponsored by Senator Breaux and Senator Packwood.\n  Many of the titles in S. 267, were bills introduced in the 103d \nCongress but not enacted. The Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation held a hearing on these matters on July 21, 1994, \nindicating a strong bipartisan support for these fishery conservation \nmeasures.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported the \nbill by unanimous vote on March 23, 1995. While only technical \namendments were adopted, it was noted that Senator Snowe was \nconsidering an amendment to restrict directed foreign fishing within \nthe EEZ for Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel. We have worked with \nSenator Snowe to incorporate her concerns into the committee substitute \nbefore us and we appreciate her efforts in reaching this compromise.\n  We also have incorporated provisions addressing conservation of \nsalmon stocks of the Yukon River and regulations and enforcement \nactions for migratory species managed under the Atlantic Tunas \nConvention and the South Pacific Tuna Act.\n  I also want to note that the committee has worked with Senator \nPackwood, chairman of the Finance Committee and an active member of the \nCommerce Committee, to address a provision of the bill that deals with \namendments to the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act. We appreciate the \ncooperation that he and his staff have given us on this provision.\n  I strongly believe that through the proper conservation and \nmanagement of our Nation's living marine resources, we will enhance \neconomic opportunities for future generations. The bill before us \ncontains a number of provisions important to the conservation of \nfishery resources in our oceans. It is a noncontroversial bill with \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support S. 267 and ask my colleagues to \njoin me in it's adoption.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the substitute to S. \n267 offered by Senator Stevens, and I rise to express support for the \namendment.\n  Before proceeding to discuss the substitute, I want to offer my \nsincere thanks to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nPressler, and the chairman of the Oceans and \n\n[[Page S9590]]\nFisheries Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, for their assistance to me \nthroughout the process of considering S. 267. Early on, I expressed an \ninterest in offering an amendment to the bill, and the two chairmen and \ntheir staffs always showed a willingness to help me as a freshman \nmember of the committee. S. 267 is the first fisheries bill considered \nby the Commerce Committee in the 104th Congress, and the leadership and \nskillfulness that the Senators demonstrated in this effort deserves to \nbe commended.\n  Mr. President, the substitute includes an amendment that I sponsored \nwhich is designed to protect two of the few remaining healthy fish \nstocks in U.S. waters--Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel--from \nforeign fishing pressures. I consider this amendment and the issues \nthat it addresses to be very important for the health of our domestic \nfishing industry as well as our domestic fish stocks.\n  As media stories over the last year have reported, the New England \ngroundfish fishery is now experiencing the most serious crisis in its \nlong history. Groundfish stocks in the region have dwindled to record \nlows, threatening the future viability of this essential resource. \nStringent conservation regulations have been implemented in response to \nthe stock decline in an attempt to prevent a collapse of the fishery. \nIn combination, these two factors have drastically reduced fishing \nopportunities, threatening a centuries-old industry and the livelihoods \nof thousands of people in coastal communities across the region who \ndepend on it.\n  And the regulations approved to date are not the end of it. The New \nEngland Fishery Management Council is now developing a public hearing \ndocument for new fishing effort reduction measures that are even more \ndraconian than the existing regulations.\n  To survive in the face of such adversity, many fishermen who want to \nremain on the water will have to catch species besides groundfish. But \nunfortunately, given present rates of fishing effort, few species offer \nmuch opportunity for new harvesting capacity. Two that do are Atlantic \nherring and Atlantic mackerel. The National Marine Fisheries Service \nhas determined that these stocks are healthy, and that they can \nwithstand higher rates of harvest without endangering the resource.\n  Utilization of these species by Northeast fishermen has been limited \nto date because they generate less value in the market than groundfish. \nMaine has a viable sardine industry that uses a modest portion of the \nherring resource, and herring are harvested for bait to supply other \nfisheries like lobster and bluefin tuna. With regard to mackerel, \nseveral processors in the Northeast have established markets serving \nCanada and the Caribbean.\n  But significant potential for expansion of these domestic industries \nexists. The mackerel industry hopes to increase market share in the \nCaribbean and gain a foothold in West Africa, the Middle East, and \nEastern Europe. The Maine sardine industry has been trying to expand \nits markets in Mexico and the Caribbean. As groundfish landings \ndecline, new players are actively pursuing new opportunities in the \nsustainable development of herring and mackerel. Resource Trading \nCompany of Portland, Maine, has negotiated a deal to sell 25,000 tons \nof Atlantic herring to China--a market of enormous potential for New \nEngland fishermen.\n  New England fishing interests are not the only ones pursuing our \nherring and mackerel, however. Foreign countries like Russia and the \nNetherlands have shown a keen interest in obtaining fishing rights for \nthese species in U.S. waters. In 1993, the Russians and their domestic \npartner came close in persuading the Administrator of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service to approve an application to harvest 10,000 \ntons of Atlantic mackerel--\n despite the fact that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council had \nspecified that no foreign fishing rights for mackerel be granted. Since \nthat time, the Dutch, acting through the European Union, have \naggressively pursued foreign fishing rights for mackerel, and the \nRussians have continued to push for a portion of the stock.\n\n  Mr. President, it would be unconscionable for the U.S. Government to \nallow foreign countries to begin harvesting two of the only healthy \nstocks left in U.S waters while New England fishermen lose their jobs \nas a result of the groundfish crisis. Since the process of developing \nstrict fishing regulations for groundfish began four years ago, Federal \nfisheries managers and policymakers have encouraged groundfishermen to \npursue alternatives or ``underutilized'' species like herring and \nmackerel. They have cited this option as an important way to help some \nfishermen stay in business during the recovery period for goundfish. To \ngive away our fish to foreign fishermen at this critical time, after \nall of the rhetoric about developing underutilized species, would be a \nslap in the face to our fishermen. We should instead help fishermen and \nprocessors develop these resources in a sustainable manner, and the \nbest way that we can do that is to provide assurances that sufficient \nquantities of fish will be available to meet the needs of our industry. \nWe need to give entrepreneurs and fishermen the time to develop new \nproducts and markets so that they can compete all over the world with \nthe same countries who seek the last of our healthy fish stocks.\n  Out of my great concern for the future of the fishing industry in \nMaine and New England, and out of my strong desire to see American \nfishermen sustainable utilize Atlantic herring and mackerel, I offered \nan amendment during committee consideration of S. 267 which would have \nimposed a 4-year moratorium on the granting of foreign harvesting \nrights for these two species. This moratorium would have given our \nindustry adequate time to create new products, markets, and associated \ninfrastructure in herring and mackerel. It would have preserved \nvaluable jobs in the New England fishing industry, and it would have \ndone so without strengthening the position of our foreign competitors. \nThe Resource Trading Company deal that I mentioned earlier, which \ninvolves only U.S. fishermen, shows clearly the great potential that \nexists.\n  In committee, however, Senator Gorton expressed reservations about my \namendment. A company based in Washington State that has operated in \nRussian waters and that is pursuing new markets in Russia was concerned \nthat such a strong statement from the United States on fisheries could \nnegatively affect some of its ongoing business. I agreed to work with \nSenator Gorton, as well as Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Pressler, to \nwork out a compromise acceptable to all parties.\n  Fortunately, we were able to reach an agreement on a new amendment \nthat I sponsored and that Senator Kerry agreed to cosponsor. The \namendment is contained in the Stevens Substitute under consideration \ntoday. It has two provisions.\n  First, the amendment prohibits the awarding of any foreign harvesting \nrights for any fishery that is not subject to a fishery management plan \nunder the Magnuson Act. At a bare minimum, no foreign harvesting should \nbe allowed unless a strict regime for managing the harvest is in place. \nAtlantic herring does not have a council-approved fishery management \nplan at the present time, so this provision will protect the herring \nresource from foreign fishing pressure until the New England Fishery \nManagement Council approves a plan.\n  Second, the amendment adds a new layer of scrutiny to any \napplications submitted by foreign countries for the harvest of Atlantic \nherring and mackerel in U.S. waters. Under the current procedures in \nthe Magnuson Act, the regional fishery management council of \njurisdiction is required to specify whether foreign harvesting of a \nparticular species should be allowed. The Secretary of Commerce is \nencouraged to follow the Council's guidance on foreign fishing, but he \nis not bound by it. In effect, the Secretary can disagree with the \nCouncil, and approve a foreign fishing application despite the \nCouncil's reservations.\n  My amendment prohibits the Secretary from approving a foreign fishing \napplication for herring and mackerel unless the\n council of jurisdiction recommends approval of it. In the absence of \nexplicit Council agreement, the Secretary will no longer be able to \ngrant foreign fishing rights. A foreign applicant will therefore have \nto convince not only the Commerce and State departments, but the \nregional council that was established to conserve the \n\n[[Page S9591]]\nmarine fisheries resources of the region, and whose membership is drawn \nin part from the regional fishing industry. While I would have \npreferred a moratorium, this new provision will make it more difficult \nfor foreign countries to gain access to our important herring and \nmackerel resources.\n\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to mention a couple of additional \namendments contained in the substitute that I cosponsored. Both \namendments relate to the management and conservation of Atlantic \nbluefin tuna and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic.\n  Last year, pursuant to a request from the Maine and Massachusetts \ncongressional delegations, a scientific peer review panel convened \nunder the auspices of the National Research Council issued an important \nreport that criticized NOAA's scientific work on Atlantic bluefin tuna. \nThe report contained a number of significant findings, but perhaps most \nsignificant was the panel's finding that NOAA scientists had \nerroneously estimated Western Atlantic bluefin population trends since \n1988. Rather than a continuing decline during that period, the NRC \npanel concluded that the stock had remained stable.\n  Because the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \nTunas, to which the United States belongs, relies heavily on NOAA's \nbluefin science, the NRC peer review report had a profound impact on \nAtlantic bluefin management. Whereas ICCAT and NOAA had been advocating \na 40 percent cut in the Western Atlantic bluefin quota before the \nreport was issued, ICCAT actually approved a slight increase in the \nexisting quota after the report's findings were published. Tuna \nfishermen in New England, where most of the commercial fishery for the \nspecies in the United States exists, had long criticized the quality of \nNOAA's bluefin science. The NRC report reinforced those criticisms.\n  This episode points out the need for improved fisheries science in \ngeneral, and improved research on highly migratory species like \nAtlantic bluefin tuna, in particular. One way that we can improve \nresearch on bluefin and other highly migratory species is to ensure \nthat the scientists who conduct stock assessments and monitoring \nprograms are wholly familiar with the conditions of the primary \nfisheries for the species. In the case of Atlantic bluefin tuna, most \nof the scientific activity is conducted at NOAA's Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center in Miami, even though the overwhelming majority of the \ncommercial fishing activity for the species takes place in the \nNortheast, and much of the data used by scientists is collected from \nthis fishery.\n  Senator Kerry sponsored an amendment, which I cosponsored, that \nrequires NOAA to ensure that the personnel and resources of each \nregional fisheries research center participate substantially in the \nstock assessments and monitoring of highly migratory species that occur \nin the region. Hopefully, this provision will bring scientists closer \nto the fishery, stimulate fresh thinking about fisheries science, and \nlead to improvements in NOAA's scientific program. Senator Kerry and I \nhave also asked for administrative action on this matter, and we will \ncontinue our efforts in that regard after S. 267 is enacted.\n  I had also cosponsored another amendment offered by Senator Breaux \npertaining to the enforcement of ICCAT conservation measures. Western \nAtlantic fishermen, particularly American fishermen, have abided by \nICCAT's rules since the first stringent quotas were implemented in the \nearly 1980's. Unfortunately, some fishermen from other countries don't \nappreciate the need for conservation or international agreements the \nway that our fishermen do, and they harvest highly migratory species in \nthe Atlantic in a reckless and unsustainable manner.\n  To give ICCAT conservation recommendations greater force, Senator \nBreaux drafted an amendment which would have required the Secretary of \nCommerce to certify that ICCAT has adopted an effective multilateral \nprocess providing for restrictive trade measures against countries that \nfail to address reckless and damaging fishing practices by their \ncitizens. If ICCAT failed to adopt such a process, the Breaux/Snowe \namendment would have required the administration to initiate bilateral \nconsultations with problem nations. And in the event that consultations \nproved unsuccessful and the country in question failed to address \nunsustainable fishing practices by its nationals, the amendment would \nhave required the Secretary of the Treasury to impose a ban on the \nimports of certain fish and fish products from that country.\n  Unfortunately, due to jurisdictional problems in the House that \nthreatened to derail this entire bill, it was decided that the \nsanctions language in the original Breaux-Snowe amendment would not be \nincluded in the substitute. We did, however, include language similar \nto the other provisions of the amendment which require the Secretary to \nidentify problem nations, and which authorize the President to initiate \nconsultations on conservation-related issues with the governments of \nthese problem nations. I would have preferred the original language, \nbut this was the best that we could do without risking the entire bill.\n  Let me state, Mr. President, that I do not think the issue of foreign \ncompliance with ICCAT recommendations ends here. I intend to continue \nmonitoring this issue, and if no more progress is made, I think that \nthe Commerce Committee should be prepared to revisit it. We owe it to \nAmerican fishermen who play by the rules, and to our highly migratory \nfisheries resources, to ensure that foreign countries are doing their \npart to conserve these important natural resources.\n  Mr. President, the amendments that I have described will \nsignificantly improve S. 267, and improve U.S. efforts to manage its \nmarine fisheries. I urge my colleagues to support the substitute, and \nto support S. 267 as amended.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my pleasure as the \nSenate prepares to pass the Fisheries Act of 1995. This legislation \naddresses an issue of great importance to the people of Massachusetts, \nthe Nation, and, indeed, the world--the promotion of sustainable \nfisheries on a worldwide basis.\n  One of the world's primary sources of dietary protein, marine fish \nstocks were once thought to be an inexhaustible resource. However, \nafter peaking in 1989 at a record 100 million metric tons, world fish \nlandings now have begun to decline. The current state of the world's \nfisheries has both environmental and political implications. Last year, \nthe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] estimated \nthat 13 of 17 major ocean fisheries may be in trouble. Competition \namong nations for dwindling resources has become all too familiar in \nmany locations around the world.\n  The bill we are passing today will strengthen international fisheries \nmanagement. Among the provisions reinforcing U.S. commitments to \nconserve and manage global fisheries, are the following: First, \nimplementation of the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with \nInternational Convention and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on \nthe High Seas that would establish a system regulating U.S. vessels \nfishing on the high seas; second, implementation of the Convention on \nFuture Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries \nthat would provide for U.S. representation in the Northwest Atlantic \nFisheries Organization [NAFO] and coordination between NAFO and \nappropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils; third, improved \nresearch and international cooperation with respect to Atlantic bluefin \ntuna and other valuable highly migratory species; fourth, reimbursement \nof U.S. fishermen for illegal transit fees charged by the Canadian \nGovernment and for legal fees and costs incurred by the owners of \nvessels that were seized by the Canadian Government in a jurisdictional \ndispute that were necessary and related to securing the prompt release \nof the vessel; fifth, a ban on U.S. fishing activities in the central \nSea of Okhotsk except where such fishing is conducted in accordance \nwith a fishery agreement to which both the United States and Russia are \nparties; sixth, a prohibition on U.S. participation in international \nagreements on fisheries, marine resources, the use of the high seas, or \ntrade in fish or fish products which undermine the United Nations \nmoratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on \n\n[[Page S9592]]\nthe high seas; seventh, implementation of an interim agreement between \nthe United States and Canada for the conservation of salmon stocks \noriginating from the Yukon River in Canada; eighth, permission for U.S. \ndocumented vessels to fish for tuna in waters of the South Pacific Tuna \nAct of 1988 Area; and ninth, prohibition of a foreign allocation in any \nfishery within the United States exclusive economic zone unless a \nfishery management plan is in place for the fishery and the appropriate \nregional fishing council recommends the allocation.\n  This bill will make a substantial contribution to U.S. leadership in \nthe conservation and management of international fisheries. I want to \nacknowledge the leadership on this issue of the chairman of the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee, my friend the senior Senator from Alaska. \nIt has been a pleasure working with him. I also want to thank the \ncommittee's distinguished ranking member, Senator Hollings, for his \nsupport on this bill. I also would like to recognize the staffs of the \nCommerce Committee for their diligence and their truly bipartisan \nefforts to bring this bill to the floor, specifically Penny Dalton and \nLila Helms from the Democratic Staff and Tom Melius and Trevor Maccabe \non the Republican side.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment be agreed \nto, the bill be deemed read a third time; further that the Commerce \nCommittee be immediately discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n716 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 267, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof, further that H.R. 716 be \nconsidered read a third time, passed as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements related to the \nbill appear at appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 716), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent S. 267 be placed \nback on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange \n     and Wilderness Redesignation Act of 1995''.\n\n   TITLE I--ANAKTUVUK PASS LAND EXCHANGE AND WILDERNESS REDESIGNATION\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 \n     Stat. 2371), enacted on December 2, 1980, established Gates \n     of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the \n     Arctic Wilderness. The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in \n     the highlands of the central Brooks Range, is virtually \n     surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is \n     the only Native village located within the boundary of a \n     National Park System unit in Alaska.\n       (2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the \n     village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n     lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The \n     residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied increasingly on snow \n     machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as \n     their primary means of access to pursue caribou and other \n     subsistence resources.\n       (3) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements \n     were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n     terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n     along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved \n     unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to \n     subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental \n     impact from concentrated use.\n       (4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation \n     initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the \n     use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. \n     These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally \n     executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, \n     among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the \n     City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, \n     by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 102. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Ratification.--\n       (1) In general.--The terms, conditions, procedures, \n     covenants, reservations and other provisions set forth in the \n     document entitled ``Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests \n     in Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, City of \n     Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America'' \n     (hereinafter referred to in this Act as ``the Agreement''), \n     executed by the parties on December 17, 1992, as amended, are \n     hereby incorporated in\n      this Act, are ratified and confirmed, and set forth the \n     obligations and commitments of the United States, Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation and the \n     City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a matter of Federal law.\n       (2) Land acquisition.--Lands acquired by the United States \n     pursuant to the Agreement shall be administered by the \n     Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') as part of Gates of the Arctic National Park \n     and Preserve, subject to the laws and regulations applicable \n     thereto.\n       (b) Maps.--The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, and D \n     through I to the Agreement depict the lands subject to the \n     conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access \n     easements and all-terrain vehicle easements.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection of \n     lands which are an integral element of the trail and which \n     would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling Forest, the \n     demand for open space in the northeastern United States, and \n     the lack of open space in the densely populated tri-state \n     region, there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the \n     Sterling forest for permanent protection of the watershed, \n     outdoor recreational resources, flora and fauna, and open \n     space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SEC. 303. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Title are--\n       (1) to establish the Sterling Forest Reserve in the State \n     of New York to protect the significant watershed, wildlife, \n     and recreational resources within the New York-New Jersey \n     highlands region;\n       (2) to authorize Federal funding, through the Department of \n     the Interior, for a portion of the acquisition costs for the \n     Sterling Forest Reserve;\n       (3) to direct the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to \n     convey to the Secretary of the Interior certain interests in \n     lands acquired within the Reserve; and\n       (4) to provide for the management of the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n\n     SEC. 304 DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Title.\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the \n     Palisades Interstate Park Commission established pursuant to \n     Public Resolution No. 65 approved August 19, 1937 (ch. 707; \n     50 Stat. 719).\n       (2) Reserve.The term ``Reserve'' means the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 305. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STERLING FOREST RESERVE.\n\n       (A) Establishment.--Upon the certification by the \n     Commission to the Secretary that the Commission has acquired \n     sufficient lands or interests therein to constitute a \n     manageable unit, there is established the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve in the State of New York.\n       (b) Map.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Reserve shall consist of lands and \n     interests therein acquired by the Commission with the \n     approximately 17,500 acres of lands as generally depicted on \n     the map entitled ``Boundary Map, Sterling Forest Reserve'', \n     numbered SFR-60,001 and dated July 1, 1994.\n       (2) Availability for public inspection.--The map described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the offices of the Commission and the \n     appropriate offices of the National Park Service.\n       (c) Transfer of Funds.--Subject to subjection (d), the \n     Secretary shall transfer to the Commission such funds as are \n     appropriated for the acquisition of lands and interests \n     therein within the Reserve.\n       (d) Conditions of Funding.--\n       (1) Agreement by the commission.--Prior to the receipt of \n     any Federal funds authorized by this Act, the Commission \n     shall agree to the following:\n       (A) Conveyance of Lands in event of failure to manage.--If \n     the Commission fails to manage the lands acquired within the \n     Reserve in a manner that is consistent with this title the \n     Commission shall convey fee title to such lands to the United \n     States, and the agreement stated in this subparagraph shall \n     be recorded at the time of purchase of all lands acquired \n     within the Reserve.\n       (B) Consent of owners.--No lands or interest in land may be \n     acquired with any Federal funds authorized or transferred \n     pursuant to this title except with the consent of the owner \n     of the land or interest in land.\n       (C) Inability to acquire lands.--If the Commission is \n     unable to acquire all of the lands within the Reserve, to the \n     extent Federal funds are utilized pursuant to this title the \n     Commission shall acquire all or a portion of the lands \n     identified as ``National Park Service Wilderness Easement \n     Lands'' and ``National Park Service Conservation Easement \n     Lands'' on the map described in section 305(b) before \n     proceeding with the acquisition of any other lands within the \n     Reserve.\n       (D) Conveyance of easement.--Within 30 days after acquiring \n     any of the lands identified as ``National Park Service \n     Wilderness Easement Lands'' 29 and ``National Park Service \n     Conservation Easement Lands'' on the map described in section \n     305(b), the Commission shall convey to the United States--\n       (i) conservation easements on the lands described as \n     ``National Park Service Wilderness Easement Lands'' on the \n     map described in section 305(b), which easements shall \n     provide that the lands shall be managed to protect their \n     wilderness character; and\n       (ii) conservation easements on the lands described as \n     ``National Park Service Conservation Easement Lands'' on the \n     max described in section 305(b), which easements shall \n     restrict and limit development and use of the property to \n     that development and use that is--\n       (I) compatible with the protection of the Appalachian \n     National Scenic Trail; and\n       (II) consistent with the general management plan prepared \n     pursuant to section 305(b).\n       (2) Matching funds.--Funds may be transferred to the \n     Commission only to the extent that they are matched from \n     funds contributed by non-Federal sources.\n                  SEC. 306.

Mr. President, with respect to the rescissions package, I \nregret we were unable to pass that, were unable to complete action on \nthe rescissions package because it was something that had broad support \non both sides of the aisle, support by the President.\n  The President very much wanted to have it done before this Fourth of \nJuly recess. As I indicated earlier, the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, and the Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun, were within their rights to block action on the bill.\n  But I must say, as I listened to their statements in which they \nwished they \n\n[[Page S9596]]\ncould have offered their amendments, they had about 3 hours to offer \namendments and used all that time and just had a discussion of the \namendments and what was wrong with the bill.\n  And I am not certain when the rescissions package will be back for a \nvote. Unless there is an agreement on that side of the aisle I will not \nbring it back up on the Senate floor. As soon as the President can \npersuade my Democratic colleagues that this bill is necessary, it is \nimportant, and it ought to be passed, and I do not see any reason to \ntake any further time of other Senators because we have a lot of \nimportant legislation.\n  But keep in mind, again this bill which was blocked contains money \nfor the Oklahoma City disaster, it contains money for California \nearthquakes, it contains money for 39, I think 39, States which \nsuffered disasters, including the States of Illinois, and maybe \nMinnesota. I am not certain.\n  So, while the Senators have every right to make their point about \ncertain programs they do not agree with, this rescissions package had \nbeen the subject of long discussions, long debate, and even after it \npassed the Senate and the House, was vetoed by the President; more \ndebate, more discussion by the White House and Democrats and \nRepublicans on each side of the aisle.\n  So I hope when we come back we will have an agreement that we can \ntake it up immediately, and have an up-or-down vote on the bill itself \nwithout amendments.\n  I would say again there was certainly every opportunity by either the \nSenator from Illinois or the Senator from Minnesota to offer all the \namendments they wanted to offer today. They refused to offer \namendments. So I proposed I would offer their amendments. I asked \nconsent to offer their amendments. And they objected.\n  So I do not want the record to reflect that somehow they were somehow \ndisadvantaged and did not have an opportunity to offer their amendment. \nThat was not the case. They had plenty of time and could have offered \nthe amendments. We could have been finished with that bill by now, and \na lot of people around the country would have felt a lot better about \nit.\n  So I do not know how they explain it. But that will be their problem.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9595-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             WELFARE DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of speculation \nin recent days over the prospects for passage of a welfare reform bill. \nBefore departing for the recess, I wanted the opportunity to set the \nrecord straight.\n  Notwithstanding the efforts of some to drive us apart, Republicans \nare committed to truly ending welfare as we know it. We are not \nunmindful of the struggles faced by many in this country who need a \nhand up some time in their lives, or of children who through no fault \nof their own need the helping hand of the Government. But, Mr. \nPresident, we are also not convinced that the Federal Government holds \nall the answers to the very real problems these people face. In fact, \nthe real story is that notwithstanding the billions of dollars that \nhave been spent over the last decade, the welfare rolls have continued \nto grow and the number of children at risk has increased. We have all \ndecried these problems and have responded by adding to the list of the \nthings that the States must do. Well, the time has come to listen to \nthe States for a change and give them a chance to devise some solutions \nthat fit their needs.\n  The issues that divide us are not insurmountable nor are they easily \nresolved. But the extraordinary thing is that the debate is not over \nwhether we want block grants--it is how best to design them. Our \ndifferences are over how to distribute the funds and how much \nflexibility to give the States in the design of these programs.\n  The funding issue is a real one and of critical importance to all \nStates. There are States that will experience real population growth \nthat are concerned they will be disadvantaged in this new block grant \nenvironment. There are also States that in the past have committed \nconsiderable State resources to the program that feel their past \ncontributions should be acknowledged.\n  No formula fight is ever easy, as every Senator knows. The House and \nSenate bills create loan funds--but this may not be the perfect answer. \nWe will seek other options to balance the needs of all.\n  The second group of issues is equally thorny. None of us is \nunconcerned about the dramatic increase in the numbers of teen \npregnancies and the number of children born out-of-wedlock. These are \nserious issues--not easily addressed. Many of us believe the Governors \nof our States can and will deal with these problems, as many of them \nhave tried to do. They want us out of the way--that is what they are \nasking us--not dictating solutions. Others believe that the issue can \nbest be addressed here.\n  I remain hopeful we can strike some middle ground and am working to \nthat end.\n  For at the end of the day, we cannot fail. We must not break faith \nwith the American people who sent us a clear message last fall--end \nwelfare as we know it once and for all, require real work, and make it \na temporary helping hand, not a lifestyle.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/30/senate-section/article/S9596-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 10, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
