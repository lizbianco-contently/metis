Be still? We are \nwordsmiths and find it difficult to be still. Our craft is to talk and \nwe are proud of our polished sentences and carefully worded paragraphs. \nSometimes we forget to listen to Your voice before we speak. Now in the \nquiet of this time of prayer we realize how much we want You to be \nexalted among the nations, particularly this Nation You have called us \nto lead. Our deepest desire is to know what You desire; our lasting \npleasure is to please You. Be exalted in our hearts: our goal is to \nglorify You. Be exalted in our minds: our purpose is to be bold and \ncreative thinkers. Be exalted in this Senate as each Senator humbles \nhimself and herself to speak the truth as You reveal it and listen to \neach other with patience and openness. Remind us again that the meaning \nof the Hebrew words ``Be still'' imply ``let go, leave off, let up.'' \nWe want to do that consistently today as we open the floodgates of our \nminds and hearts to receive the inflow of Your power and peace. In our \nLord's name. Amen.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13143-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It was \napproved by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources by a unanimous \nvote on May 25.\n  While I am committed to ending the concept of welfare as an \nentitlement, I have some concerns about the legislation before us, the \nWork Opportunity Act, regarding changes that have been made to child \ncare.\n  It seems to me that one of the most important considerations we have \nto undertake when we are considering welfare reform is how we handle \nchild care. I think that all of us here in the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle regard our ability to structure welfare reform in an \neffective manner a top priority for the 104th Congress. We can talk \nabout ending support for mothers who should be working, for families \nwho should be working, but it is the children who become a crucial \nelement. It is with the children that we have to be careful and must \nbegin breaking the cycle of dependence that has occurred through years \nof being on welfare. It is the protection of the children that is the \nmost important responsibility that we have.\n  Title VI of the welfare reform bill includes the reauthorization of \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant. It is called the CCDBG and \nit was enacted in 1990 with bipartisan support because Congress \nrecognized there was a lack of adequate child care for many low-income \nworking families. These just are not families on welfare. These are \nfamilies that are in the work force, frequently with low-paying jobs, \nbut who do not have the access to affordable, quality child care.\n  It was in that light that we felt it was very important to address \nthis, with a sliding fee scale determined by the states, so that low-\nincome families could be participants with some subsidies as they \nworked their way into better paying jobs.\n  I think this continues to be a nationwide problem. One of the primary \ngoals of the CCDBG as it came out of committee is to ensure that there \nis a seamless system of child care where it counts the most at the \npoint where the parent, child, and provider meet.\n  The provision that was in S. 850 that would have consolidated child \ncare funds into one unified system is not included in the leadership \nwelfare reform bill. The amendment I offer today restores that \nprovision so that we will \n\n[[Page S 13148]]\nhave one unified system of child care, one State plan, and one set of \neligibility requirements.\n  I believe this only makes sense, Mr. President, as we are trying to \nconsolidate and trying to work together to form a better system. Why \ncontinue to have two different child care systems--one under the child \ncare and development block grant, and one under the welfare child care \nsystem?\n I think it makes sense to bring the two systems together in a unified \napproach.\n\n  My amendment does make one change to the original consolidation \nprovision that was included in S. 850, the legislation that we approved \nout of committee, and that relates to the 15-percent set-aside for \nquality improvement activities. The set-aside will apply to the \ndiscretionary funds appropriated for the CCDBG, but will not apply to \nother child care services provided through the unified system.\n  We have tried to take into account some of the concerns of Governors \nwho obviously would like to have a system that does not have too many \nrequirements from Congress, and we have tried to do that. On the other \nhand, we believe that through the CCDGB there are some important \nrequirements that have proven to be of benefit and to have created a \nsuccessful child care approach in the States.\n  My amendment also strikes the provision in the welfare bill that \nwould allow up to 30 percent of the funds to be transferred between the \nCCDBG and the cash assistance block grant. I oppose the transferability \nprovision for two major reasons.\n  First, I am concerned that there is too little child care money \navailable now. Funds transferred out of the CCDBG would not necessarily \nbe used for child care, which would create an even bigger problem; the \nGovernors could use it for other assistance such as cash benefits, \nwhich they might choose and which they may feel is important. But I \nfeel strongly that these funds need to be targeted toward child care. \nIf we fail in this, we are going to fail to reform welfare in ways that \nwill be beneficial for years to come.\n  Second, the primary purpose of the CCDBG is to assist the working \npoor who contribute something toward child care through the sliding fee \nscale. Having this type of assistance available will become even more \nimportant as individuals make the transition from welfare to work. I \nthink we all know that finding the right child care can be one of the \nmost costly and stressful aspects for parents as they enter the work \nforce. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a grandparent or an \nextended family member who can help with child care. In fact, many \ntoday do not have relatives that can or will care for their children. \nAnd that becomes one of the most stressful problems that a mother faces \nwhen she goes to work in the morning, if she cannot be certain of some \nquality child care, or cannot count on child care that she feels \ncomfortable with for her children.\n  Having this type of assistance available to those who are trying to \nwork their way off welfare will become even more important as we stress \nthe transition from welfare to work. Diverting CCDBG funds for other \npurposes diminishes a program which is badly needed by the working \npoor, and I believe it is unfair to penalize those who are struggling \nto provide for themselves and their families.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues can support the amendment I offer \ntoday, Mr. President, to consolidate child care into one unified system \nand to preserve the limited funds allocated to child care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on a Monday morning, to focus on a very \nimportant amendment that the Senator from Kansas has offered, when we \nare going to have a very long week on this bill, is a sharp contrast \nfrom sometimes the easy subjects we are discussing on Friday afternoon \nwhen we adjourn for a weekend. To start out with the very basic issue \nof child care that Senator Kassebaum has brought up is really starting \nout with a heavy burden. The Senator from Kansas is always well \nprepared, and so we cannot find any fault with the preparation for her \namendment, but we do take exception to the rationale behind the \namendment and consequently cannot support it.\n  Behind the amendment I believe is an assumption that somehow if you \nare on welfare, or are low income, and it comes to the subject of \ngetting up in the morning and going to work--and obviously if you are \non welfare, there is a family involved, so there is a child that must \nbe taken some place when you are on welfare--it assumes somehow that \nlow-income people are different than other people; that when it comes \nto child care, they cannot do it; they cannot seek good child care, go \nthrough the business arrangements required, and on their own, without \nthe help of the Federal Government or without the help of the State \ngovernment, be able to provide for the care of a child while the mother \nand/or father are at work. It assumes that low-income people are not \ncapable of this or assumes that they do not want to do it.\n  One of the things our reform proposal intends to do is to assume that \nwhether people are low income or not, they are, first of all, concerned \nabout their family; and, second, that they have the capacity to do what \nmust be done for their family; that you just cannot assume because \npeople are low income, somehow they do not have that ability.\n  Part of the basis for welfare reform is to enhance individual \nresponsibility, detract from the dependency of the State that has been \nparamount to the system we have had historically and to start out with \nthe assumption that low income people have the basic innate \ncapabilities that other people have if given the opportunity.\n  Just recently, as I have said so many times on the floor of this \nbody, our State of Iowa passed a welfare reform proposal that is going \nto enhance this individual responsibility. In fact, under our system, \nwelfare recipients sign a contract with the State establishing certain \npoints in the near future when they will take certain actions regarding \nthe family, regarding seeking a job, regarding education, if that is \nnecessary before a job, and eventually to getting a job so they work \ntheir way off welfare. Individual responsibility is the essence of that \ncontract which the recipient signs with the State of Iowa.\n  There is a welfare recipient in my State who recently told a State \nlegislator that the problem with the Iowa welfare reform was that we \nhad gone from a system of no choices, where the State told her what to \ndo, when to do it, and where to do it, to a system of choices in which \nshe had to plan for her future, decide what opportunities to take and, \nin her words, ``to be responsible.''\n  For her being faced with choices was the hardest part of the reform, \nbut I hope she recognizes, and us as well, that the hardest part of the \nreform is basic to whether or not things are going to be different \nunder a new system. The issue comes down to whether we are going to \nassume the capabilities that all Americans have of making decisions and \nwanting to make decisions and set up an environment for those decisions \nto be made.\n  I think the amendment that has just been presented by the Senator \nfrom Kansas assumes that the welfare recipient might not be totally \ncapable, or ought not to have the responsibility even, of making that \ndecision.\n  The story I mentioned about the Iowa welfare recipient is true. I \nthink it epitomizes what is wrong with the current system. And when we \ngive States an opportunity to do better than what the Federal \nGovernment wants to do, we can move in the direction of changing our \npaternalistic system. It is promoting and even rewarding dependency.\n  There are many low-income American families who are struggling to \nmake ends meet and be responsible without any public assistance. They \ntake pride in their successes. And they have dignity for their efforts \nto be self-sufficient through employment. They get up every morning and \nthey take their children to child care. They go to a job where they \nwork all day. They pick up their children in the afternoon and go home.\n  That is what most American families do. That is what even most \nAmerican families who are low income or ``working poor'' do without any \nconcern by any bureaucracy. They just do it. When you lump in some of \nthe other benefits that go with AFDC that may not have an immediate \ncash value, there are some people on welfare who are not too \n\n[[Page S 13149]]\nfar below what low-income working people make over the course of a \nyear.\n  And yet somehow with this amendment the assumption is that if you are \non welfare and make X number of dollars, the State has all this \nresponsibility to see that you have food on the table, child care, job \ntraining before you go to a job, and assistance in finding a job.\n  In contrast, if you have never been part of the welfare system and \nyou have a job that does not pay very well, you get up in the morning, \nfind your own job, take your kids to child care, pick them up at night. \nAdditionally, you had to worry about your own training if there was \ntraining for that job, without any concern of a bureaucrat looking out \nfor you.\n  Why the difference? One system breeds dependence. The other \nindependence. We want to change that. We want people who are on welfare \nto assume responsibility and to move forward with life.\n  They should not somehow be segregated as different from other people \nwithout the capability of exercising a normal life.\n  Well, those families who work are faced with decisions on how to deal \nwith their daily challenges, how to budget for their family's needs, \nwhat to do if their child care falls through for the day and how to \nplan for their future. In contrast, today's welfare system does not \nallow, expect, or encourage welfare recipients to make these normal, \neveryday decisions.\n  I think this legislation is about changing all that, ending business \nas usual for families, requiring recipients to take responsibility and \nlearn to make decisions that most American families are faced with \nevery day.\n  And, of course, one of those decisions is child care.\n  It is conceivable that a State may want to take a new approach of \ncombining cash assistance and child care funding into a single grant to \na family. The family then would make the decision on who to provide \ncare for their children and the fair rate that they need to pay in a \nnegotiated agreement with the providers.\n  That is what most American families do. The amendment before us by \nthe Senator from Kansas would apply all of the child care development \nblock grant standards to all child care funding, no matter what the \nsource of the Federal dollars might be.\n  For instance, the amendment assumes payment to the provider would be \nguaranteed directly from the State. This would take away the premise of \nfamily responsibility and independence. This is what we need to change. \nWe need a system where a State would be allowed to challenge public \nassistance recipients to be responsible and to make the child care \ndecisions themselves as well as making the payments themselves.\n  We should not assume the worst about public assistance recipients, \nthat they are incapable of making these decisions in the best interest \nof their children and family. If we really want an environment of State \nflexibility, we should be minimizing standards, not maximizing them. As \nwe all know, the best welfare reform proposals have come from the State \nlevel, not from the Federal Government. So, if we maximize State \nflexibility to be creative with reforms, including child care, we do \nthat by leaving these decisions to the States. So if we want to give \nStates block grants and the flexibility that goes with it, rather than \ncontinue the rigid existing programs and regulations, then it seems to \nme that we have to limit prescriptive operating guidelines in our \nlegislation.\n  As well intended as the Senator's amendment is, it is tied to the old \nway of doing business. It is tied to the philosophy that, first of all, \nwhen it comes to the families of AFDC recipients, everyone needs a \nbureaucrat looking out for them. It assumes that government knows \nbetter. It assumes that when government knows better, that of all \ngovernments, the Federal Government knows better. It assumes that \nparents, if low income and on a government program, know less about \nmeeting the needs of their families than low-income families who are \nnot on public assistance.\n  It assumes because you are low income that you have capabilities less \nthan people who are middle income or higher income, and that is not \ntrue.\n  It segregates too many Americans into certain categories. We ought to \nbe eliminating the categorization of Americans, the balkanization of \nour society. We ought to be working in this body to bring our country \ntogether, not to separate it.\n  We should be working in this body for eliminating any differences we \ncan, particularly those differences that come because of Government \ninvolvement.\n  So, I hope that the amendment of the Senator from Kansas can be \ndefeated. I yield the floor\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish to respond for a moment to the \nSenator from Iowa. I know that Senator Grassley cares as much as I do \nabout making sure that we can enact a welfare reform initiative and the \nimportance of doing that. But I think I need to reiterate that the \namendment I am offering deals with child care for low-income working \nfamilies.\n  The child care and development Block Grant, which has been in law for \n5 years, and is being reauthorized, has been included in this overall \nwelfare reform package. It was designed to provide, as I said earlier, \na sliding fee scale of support for low-income working families. It is \nnot addressing the child care provisions for AFDC recipients. It does \nbring them together into a single system rather than a two-track \nsystem, but it is not Government bureaucracy so much as I would argue \nthe need to continue that support for families that are moving off \nwelfare.\n  Child care is very expensive. As I say, if you are not lucky enough \nto have some member of the family or a good neighbor or friend who is \nassisting with child care--sometimes those provisions and tradeoffs can \nbe made; having a daughter and daughters-in-law who work, I know that \nsometimes it is possible, but many times it is not--child care can \nrange as low as $60 to $80 per week to as high as $150 to $200 a week. \nThat is a lot of money for families who are trying to enter the work \nforce at very low-income levels, and that is why I feel strongly about \nnot permitting transferability of funds out of the CCDBG account so \nthat we can help those families in transition.\n  It seems to me that this is a very important part of this provision. \nI think we should be concerned about low-income families who do not \nhave any support for child care versus the welfare family who would \nhave total support for child care. For those just right over the line, \nit is difficult and it does not make a lot of sense. That is why I feel \nstrongly about a sliding fee scale where recipients make a contribution \nto their child care and are given some Federal assistance based on \ntheir income as they are trying to break away from welfare assistance.\n  I think every State, including Iowa, has some concerns about how to \nhelp a population that has been very dependent on benefits over the \nyears and how to make this transition without harming children. This is \nwhat I am trying to address by keeping intact the provisions of the \nchild care and development block grant.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I call up my amendment, which is No. 2522.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2522.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, as has been indicated, this will be \none of the amendments that will be voted on after 5 o'clock this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I announce to Members of this body who \nhave amendments that are pending--and I think under the rules all \namendments must have been filed by last week--that several of those \namendments have been reviewed and agreed to. If those amendments can be \noffered \n\n[[Page S 13150]]\ntoday, we would like to have the Members come and bring those \namendments up, and those amendments will be accepted.\n  I and other managers of this legislation, throughout the course of \nthe day, will be happy to handle those amendments if the Members are \nnot able to do so or do not want to do so this morning, so that we can \nuse this time before the votes at 5 o'clock this afternoon to expedite \nas many amendments as we can from our list of over 200.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take this opportunity to speak as in \nmorning business. When somebody comes and wants the floor for work on \nwelfare reform, I will yield it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the past several months, the \ninternational drug program has not fared very well in Congress. Funding \nfor interdiction, law enforcement, and international efforts have \ndeclined steadily. In part this is the result of a failure by the \nadministration to either present a serious strategy or to fight for it \nin any meaningful way. The President has been all but invisible and his \ndrug czar, left without support, has been ineffective. The obvious \nconsequence of this dereliction in tough budget times is an erosion of \nfunding and support to other projects that have more defenders.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's indifference has reinforced the \nattitudes of some in Congress that the program is not worth fighting \nfor, that nothing we do to combat drug use works, and so we should \nsurrender. The result has been devastating for our international effort \nand for the morale and capabilities of our frontline forces.\n  It is a myth to believe that nothing we do to combat illegal drugs \nworks. In fact, whenever we have consistently and seriously attacked \nthe problem--and we have a history going back to the beginnings of this \ncentury--we have had considerable success in reducing drug use and \nreversing epidemics. The trouble comes in believing that we should only \nhave to combat illegal drug use once.\n  The belief in some quarters seems to be that, unlike any other major \nsocial problem, we should have some magic formula that banishes the \nissue forever. This attitude seems peculiarly endemic to our counter \ndrug efforts. Despite a long history, we have yet to solve the problem \nof murder, spouse abuse, incest, rape, or theft. One rarely hears the \ncall, however, that because these problems persist we should give up \ntrying to stop them or legalize them as a way out of solving our \nproblem. Everyone recognizes that to seek such a solution would be \nirresponsible. Yet, when it comes to drugs, we seem to take a vacation \nfrom common sense.\n  We must also remind ourselves that our measure for success cannot be \nsome simplistic formula. Too often, the standard that critics apply to \nthe counter drug effort, to prove that nothing works, is to create an \nimpossible standard of perfection by which to judge it. For some, if \nthere is one gram of cocaine on the streets of America somewhere, or \none trafficker left in Colombia, then our efforts are a bust. Such \ncounsels of perfection are enemies of realistic approaches. It is a lot \nlike arguing that because we beat the other team 28 to 17 we really \nlost because they managed to score. Like a football team, our effort \nmust be continually renewed. You do not win the championship once and \nfor all, you have to train for the next season. The struggle to control \nillegal drug production and trafficking does not simply end when the \nwhistle blows. Nor can our efforts simply stop.\n  But let us look more closely at whether all our drug efforts are \nfailures. In the mid-1980s, The American public made it quite clear to \nthis body that stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the United States \nand ending the poisoning of millions of America's young people was a \ntop priority. We got the message. In a series of legislative \ninitiatives, we forced the administration to take the drug issue \nseriously. We created a drug czar to coordinate efforts. And we voted \nto increase funding across the board for counter-drug programs, from \nlaw enforcement to education and treatment.\n  Remember that those efforts came after almost two decades of \ntolerance of drug use and a major cocaine and crack epidemic. When we \ndecided to act, we faced a massive addiction problem and a widespread \nacceptance of drugs as an alternate life style. Yet, look at what \nhappened. In the space of a few years, less than a third of the time it \ntook us to get into the mess we created, we reversed attitudes toward \ndrug use, and cut causal use of drugs by 50 percent and cocaine use by \nover 70 percent. Working with our Latin America allies, we wrapped up \nthe Medellin cartel--which critics said would never happen--and made \nsignificant inroads in stopping the flow of drugs to this country.\n  Now, we clearly did not eliminate either drug use or trafficking, but \nelimination was hardly the criteria for our programs nor the measure of \nsuccess for evaluating them. It is also clear that we have more to do. \nBut serious reflection on the issue shows that this is one of those \nproblems for which continual effort is our only possible response. And \nour efforts pay dividends. While there is no ultimate victory parade, \nsurrender is not an option--unless we are prepared to live with the \nconsequences. Our past responses to public concern indicates that we \nare not.\n  But can we afford the price? The notion that we are spending an \ninordinate amount of money on fighting drug use is one of the arguments \nused to justify cuts in the program. Such criticism, however, only \nworks in isolation. Looking at the context shows a different picture.\n  The total Federal budget is $1.5 trillion. Of that, the entire drug \nbudget of the United States--for all drug-related law enforcement, \ntreatment, education, and international programs--is less than 1 \npercent of the total. Of the money we allocate to the drug program--\nbefore present proposed cuts--we spend less than 4 percent of the total \non international efforts. Even adding in all DOD detection, monitoring, \nand law enforcement support the total is only 8 percent of the Federal \ndrug budget. Hardly significant sums.\n  Compared to what Americans spend on other activities, these sums are \ninsignificant. We spend annually five times as much on beauty parlors \nand personal-care products than we spend on the total drug budget. At \ncurrent wholesale prices, a mere 8 percent of the cocaine imported into \nthe United States would more than cover the costs of our entire \ninternational counter-drug effort; and 20 percent would cover the costs \nof adding in DOD efforts.\n  Moreover, we cannot afford the annual the costs of not acting. At \npresent levels, the annual costs of drug use--some $60 billion to \nindustry, some $50 billion spent on drugs, and untold billions in the \ncosts of crime, violence, and medical costs--dwarf our expenditures on \ncounterdrug programs and create major social problems. Yet, critics \nargue than we spend too much. We could double our drug budget and still \nbe spending only half of what we spend on legal services. It is simply \nnot the case that we are spending too much.\n  The issue, however, is not just a question of throwing money, however \nsmall, at a problem, but of what we are getting for our investment. As \nI indicated, the returns are significant and if they had been achieved \nin other areas of public problems we would regard them as successes. \nYet, we act as if a 50-percent overall reduction in drug use is a \nfailure. We become frustrated because this is one of those problems \nthat requires ongoing efforts not one-time quick fixes. If we forget \nthis simple fact, we will find ourselves repeating history--of once \nagain having to dig ourselves out of a major addiction problem. The \nsigns that we are drifting in that direction are already there, we \nignore them at the peril of our young people. We need to sustain the \nefforts that have proven themselves in the past. Success, however, is \nnot a one-time thing. It requires both the moral leadership and the \nconsistent message to our young people that illegal drug use is risky \nbusiness. \n\n[[Page S 13151]]\n\n  In this regard, I intend to work with my Senate and House colleagues \nto restore realistic funding to our counter-drug efforts and to raise \nthe priority. We cannot afford to return to disastrous policies of the \n1970's that did so much harm. We cannot afford to ignore the continuing \npublic concern over this issue. We cannot afford to spend less on our \ncounterdrug programs, or expect less for our investment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed as in morning business to comment on the very able remarks of \nmy friend and collaborator at this point from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I Would like to share his concern about the state of \nthe White House operation in this matter--the matter of drug \ninterdiction and drug abuse--which was established by legislation in \n1988. The then majority leader, Robert C. Byrd, created a task force \nwhich consisted of the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, and myself, and \nI think we had more than a little influence in the legislation that \nfinally passed. I will take a moment of the Senate's time to speak \nabout that legislation. We saw the problem as being twofold.\n  One was the reduction in the supply of drugs--most of which began as \nlegal pharmaceutical products. They arrived from the onset of organic \nchemistry in German universities in the early 19th century.\n  You take this gradual escalation from opium to morphine to heroin. \nHeroin, Mr. President, is a trade name. You can find advertisements in \nthe Yale Alumni News, if you wish, for heroin in 1910 or thereabouts. \nIt was developed by the Bayer Co., that produced Bayer aspirin. Aspirin \nis a trade name. Heroin was tried out and tested on its employees and \nit made them feel heroisch in German, heroic.\n  Cocaine emerged from the same process, from the coca leaf to the \nsynthesized product. Sigmund Freud's first publication ``Uber Coca'' \ndescribed his use of cocaine as a means of treating morphine addiction, \nwhich did not succeed, and he became very much opposed to it.\n  These drugs were outlawed in 1915, if memory serves, by the Federal \nGovernment, and remain so. It is the last of the prohibition decrees of \nthat era.\n  We thought in terms of supply and demand. If I can tell my friend a \nlittle story, I think it may be said that in the late 1960's we had a \nheroin epidemic in this country, very much so in this city. You could \ntell it by the incidence of robbery of small grocery stores and food \noutlets--small amounts of money needed by persons who are getting \nwithdrawal symptoms from the lack of heroin.\n  It was so serious that--at this point I was Assistant to President \nNixon for Urban Affairs--I was called to a meeting across the street, \ncater-cornered from the White House, by some of the most respected and \nresponsible citizens in the city of Washington, who asked me if I would \nask the President to garrison the Capitol. Such was the problem.\n  This particular flow of heroin originated in the opium fields in \nTurkey, made its way to Marseilles, where, in small simple \nlaboratories, it was converted into heroin, thence smuggled into New \nYork, more or less directly, and then around the country.\n  It seemed to me a curious thing. In 1969, as Assistant to the \nPresident for Urban Affairs, I thought the most important thing we had \nto deal with was welfare, which we are doing today, and next the heroin \nepidemic.\n  President Nixon, in August of that year, sent to the Congress a very \nwide-ranging proposal, the Family Assistance Plan, which would \nestablish a guaranteed income and replace the welfare program \naltogether. It passed the House twice and never get out of the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate.\n  That done, I left immediately for Turkey by way of India, which is \nstill the largest source of illicit opium. I would not want to live in \na world without morphine, not with my teeth. But it is still widely \nused properly as a medicine for medicinal purposes.\n  I went to Turkey, to Istanbul, and met with the Foreign Minister, \nrepresenting the President of the United States. I said, we have an \nepidemic in our country and we have to stop it. That means we have to \nstop the production of opium in the province of Afyon. Opium is made \nfrom poppy seeds. Poppy seeds are part of the Turkish cuisine. They put \npoppy seeds on their bread.\n  This was not an easy thing to do. It is like someone arriving in \nWashington and telling our Secretary of State they had to stop growing \ncorn in Iowa--sorry about that, you just have to stop. The Secretary of \nState will say, I see, of course.\n  Actually, they did not close them down; they just harvested them in a \ndifferent way, called straw poppy. You could still extract the \ningredients needed for pharmaceutical purposes, but without the paste \nwhich is derived by simply putting an incision on the stamen of the \npoppy plant, collecting the moisture which oozes out by fingers and \nwrapping it up in a leaf until it gradually became raw opium.\n  I then went to Paris where I found the American Embassy was not aware \nthat anything was going on in Marseilles, much less going on in \nWashington. But they took my word for it and I met with the director of \nthe Surete, their internal police, which has been there since the \nNapoleonic age.\n  These conversations went back and forth a number of times. Finally \nthe French agreed, all right, they would close down the Marseilles \noperations, and the Turks agreed they would move to this new mode of \nharvest.\n  I was in a helicopter--I wonder if my friend from Iowa might hear \nthis because it would help him--I was in a helicopter on my way up to \nCamp David and just back from Paris. The only other person present was \nthe then Director of the Office of Management and Budget, George P. \nShultz. I said to him, ``George, I have good news, I think we are going \nto close down the French connection.'' This is what it became known as. \nHe looked up from his papers and said, ``Good,'' and then I said, a \nlittle deflated, ``No, no, really. This is important. They are going to \nclose it down. I have it from the head of the Surete in Paris.'' And he \nlooked up and said ``Good.'' Then, quite crestfallen, I said ``I \nsuppose''--he being an economist--``I suppose you think that so long as \nthere is a demand there will be a supply?'' He looked up at me and \nsaid, ``You know, there is hope for you yet.''\n  Of course in 3 to 4 years' time the Mexicans were providing heroin. \nNow it comes in from anywhere in the world, and will continue to do so.\n  That is why in our 1988 legislation, we said there will be two \ndeputies in the newly created White House office--the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy. One would be the Deputy Director for \nDemand Reduction, who would seek a clinical device, a pharmaceutical \nblock, an equivalent in one way or another in that general field of \nmethadone treatment for heroin, who would learn the chemistry of this \nsubject enough to have some treatment beyond the sort of psychiatric, \npsychological treatment available. The numbers would overwhelm us. We \ncannot cope.\n  President Bush made extraordinary, fine appointments. He appointed \nDr. William Bennett as the head of the office. As the Deputy Director \nfor Demand Reduction he appointed Dr. Herbert Kleber, a physician at \nthe Yale Medical School, a research scientist, and exactly the man you \nwould want for this.\n  Then after a while Bennett left, and Kleber also left. Kleber has \ngone to Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and is working at \nthe New York Psychiatric Institute in this field.\n  Nobody succeeded him in a scientific role. There have been a number \nof persons in the job. I am sure they are good persons, but they are \nnothing like what we had in mind in the legislation.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I tried to learn what had been the professional \nqualifications of the persons who had succeeded Dr. Kleber, and I found \nthat in this office in the White House, they could not tell me. They \ndid not know. This was not a long time back. It was 1988--well, 1990. \nThey did not know their history 5 years back. They had no idea what the \nstatute intended. They were not doing anything the statute \ncontemplated.\n  So I actually thought I would put in legislation abolishing the \nposition, on the grounds that if it was not going to do what it was \nintended to do by statute, why not just eliminate it? \n\n[[Page S 13152]]\n\n  I would like to think someone there is listening to what the Senator \nfrom Iowa said, and what I said. I doubt it very much. I will introduce \nthat measure, or insist on it. But I may try to offer it as an \namendment somewhere along the line.\n  The main point is, we enacted a good statute which has been \ntrivialized, a fact which I regret, but about which I can do very \nlittle.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senators seeking recognition. The \nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations is on the floor. He may \nbe seeking the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig).

Mr. President, the last thing I want to do is shorten any \nremarks that the distinguished Senator from New York wished to make. He \nis a fine orator and a good Senator and a good friend.\n  Let me ask a parliamentary inquiry, if I may. Is there a time \nlimitation on each amendment this day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limitation on each amendment, \nbut the Dodd amendment does have a 4-hour time limitation with a vote \nscheduled for 5 this evening, so debate on that particular amendment \ncould begin no later than 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. HELMS. I see. So I will not be burdening the Senate if I take a \nfew minutes longer than 5 or 10 minutes with my remarks, if no Senator \nis here to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2523\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I call up amendment, No. 2523, and ask it \nbe stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2523.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995 edition of the Record.]\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I had the clerk read what I considered to \nbe the most relevant part of the amendment. It has to do with people \nsitting around on their posteriors and doing no work at all--not \nwanting to do any work at all--yet drawing food stamps regularly and \npurchasing anything they want to purchase with them, regardless of the \nstatute. I say this as a Senator who has been here for almost 23 years, \nas a Senator who has served as chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, during which time I did my best to crack down on the abuse \nof the Food Stamp Program.\n  I recall getting the inspectors general to conduct a pilot program in \na number of States, and I specified that my State be first, the State \nof North Carolina. The inspectors went to cities like Fayetteville and \nWilmington, Laurel Hill and Durham, Charlotte and High Point, Winston-\nSalem, Greensboro and Asheville. Everywhere they went, they found \nterrific fraud in the Food Stamp Program. That is the reason I am \noffering this amendment today.\n  Now, there are going to be Senators who will speak in opposition to \nit--including at least one who is a very close personal friend of mine, \nMr. Cochran--as I understand it.\n  I intend to hold the floor until Senator Cochran can get here so that \nhe can speak against my amendment, which I wish he would not do. But he \ndoes what he does in good conscience and I respect him for it.\n  Mr. President, I have seen the good intentions of Members of the \nSenate and the House of Representatives and others who have sponsored \nand advocated the Food Stamp Program. Instead, this program has moved \nrapidly into a multibillion dollar boondoggle with the American \ntaxpayers footing the bill. I doubt there are very many citizens who, \nthemselves, have not seen examples of exactly what I am talking about.\n  The Federal Food Stamp Program, over the past 3 decades, has clearly \nbeen a major contributor to the Federal debt which, I might add, Mr. \nPresident, will surpass the $5 trillion mark before the end of this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, as an aside, I went into the Cloakroom not long ago \nand posed a little question to several Senators. I asked, ``How many \nmillion in a trillion?'' I received five different answers from \nSenators who participate in the fiscal policy of this country. If the \nChair wants to know how many million in a trillion, I will tell him. \nThere are a million million in a trillion. That gives you a perspective \nof what we are doing to the young people in allowing this debt to \nincrease and increase and increase while efforts to enact a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution are filibustered.\n  I say that as a preface to my having offered an amendment to the Dole \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 4, the Work Opportunities Act. If Congress \ntruly expects to achieve meaningful welfare reform, Congress \nabsolutely, in my judgment, must insist upon responsibility and common \nsense in the operation of the Federal Food Stamp Program. On many, many \noccasions, I urged the Agriculture Committee and the various witnesses \nand nominees who have come before the committee to reexamine their \nspending priorities when it comes to Federal nutrition programs.\n  I have pleaded, time and time again, that the Agriculture Committee \ndecide, and decide now, whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will \nbe restored, as an entity, to its original purpose--that is to say, a \ndepartment dedicated to America's farmers and agriculture--instead of \nthe social services instrumentality that it has become during the past \n30 years.\n  For the record, the USDA's 1995 feeding assistance and nutrition \nprograms cost the American taxpayers an estimated $39 billion with more \nthan 40 million Americans participating in the free food and free \nservices program. That is for 1 year. The Food Stamp Program alone \ncosts $27 billion of which $3 billion is squandered due to waste, \nabuse, and fraud--as I described earlier when inspectors went into my \nown State of North Carolina. And what is true in North Carolina is true \nin every State in the Union.\n  Mr. President, to put these figures into perspective, 62 percent of \nthe entire USDA budget goes for food and consumer services with the \nFood Stamp Program comprising 42 percent of the entire budget. I wonder \nhow many Americans realize that. It is easy to understand why the \nfarmers I hear from are sick and tired of being shoved around by the \nFederal agency created to serve them.\n  I recall my years as chairman of the Ag Committee in the 1980's. I \nfocused attention time and time again, on specific, precise \nidentification of the waste and fraud found in the Food Stamp Program. \nI found a program in desperate need of repair--that was 10 years ago--\nbecause of the countless numbers of people willing to take advantage of \na Federal Government handout--and they still are. The only difference \nis there are more of them today than there were then. I discovered then \nwhat Reader's Digest reported in its February, 1994 issue:\n\n       . . . food stamps have become a second currency used to pay \n     for drugs, prostitution, weapons, cars--even a house.''\n\n  People have even bought homes. They have gone to houses of \nassignation, and the proprietors of such enterprises accept food \nstamps.\n  Unfortunately, the political climate today is the same as it has \nalways been. Attempts to restructure Federal programs to meet the needs \nof the poor while trying to use wisely the money of the American \ntaxpayers brings the same old cadre of people saying this is heartless \nand this is cruel. It is not. It is an attempt to straighten this \nGovernment out--one small facet of it, but one expensive facet \nnonetheless.\n  Those who support the status quo of maintaining unlimited resources \nfor social programs without regard to the cost of these programs to the \ntaxpayers of today, and tomorrow, have simply ignored two significant \nfacts crucial to \n\n[[Page S 13153]]\nthe welfare debate--and I would be derelict in my duty if I did not \nbring that up.\n  First, Congress--not some bureaucracy downtown--the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate, is responsible for the expensive \nand costly social service programs and the resulting runaway debt. \nThese programs may have been recommended from downtown, or by some \npolitician who was thinking of the next election instead of the next \ngeneration, but the final, ultimate responsibility for the debt, for \nthe creation of these foolish programs, lies right here where we work. \nWe cannot put it on any President or any department or any bureaucrat. \nIt was done right here.\n  Every day that the Senate has been in session, for more than 3 years, \nI have reported--maybe some Senators have noticed it--the most recently \navailable exact total of the Federal debt down to the penny. For \nexample, as of the close of business on Thursday, September 7, the \nexact total stood at $4,968,651,845,437.79. (On a per capita basis \nevery man, woman and child owes $18,861.09.)\n  The second point, which naturally follows the first, is that Congress \nmust restore fiscal responsibility and integrity to federal social \nservice and welfare programs. Nobody else is going to do it. Nobody \nelse can do it. If we do not do it, it will not be done, which brings \nme to the current discussion on precisely how the Federal Government is \ngoing to remedy the broken and irreparably destructive welfare system. \nI intentionally used the word ``irreparably'' because the current \nsystem built on a foundation of a government handout with nothing in \nreturn is beyond restoration. The concept is bad. It is bad for the \ntaxpayer. It is bad for the personal morality of the lawmakers who \npermit it to happen, and in fact, encourage it to happen. And, it is \nbad for the recipient of welfare who is able to work but just will not \nwork.\n  So that is why I am here this morning. We must instill into the \nwelfare instrumentality and infrastructure the components of the \nunderpinnings of what I like to call the Miracle of America. Can you \nimagine what laughter would have ensued if a little over 200 years ago \nat Philadelphia the Founding Fathers had been confronted with the \nsuggestion that they pay people not to work--if somebody had suggested \na Food Stamp Program? I think Thomas Jefferson would have rolled on the \nfloor in protest.\n  We absolutely owe it to the people of America to do what we can--and \ndo it now--to build an accountable work ethic, personal responsibility \nand common sense in public policy. If we do not do this, we fail in our \nduty.\n  So the pending amendment, which I have offered to the Dole substitute \namendment, will require able-bodied individuals who receive food stamp \nbenefits to work at least 40 hours every month--not every week, 40 \nhours every month--before they receive food stamp benefits. This \namendment will save the American taxpayers $5.6 billion.\n  My amendment focuses on people who are able to work. I do not want \nanybody coming to the Senate floor moaning and groaning, ``How about \nthe sick and the infirm?'' And do not try to tell me that there are not \nsome kind of jobs available. It may not be the kind of jobs or the kind \nof work that these people want to do. The problem is they do not want \nto work.\n  The underlying substitute amendment simply does not go far enough in \nwork requirements, as far as I am concerned. It allows recipients to \nreceive benefits for an entire year while requiring that they work only \n6 months.\n  This loophole--and I admire the author of the substitute--allows \nrecipients to sit on their rear ends and do nothing and yet continue to \nreceive those benefits that cost the taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  My pending amendment sets the parameters so that able-bodied citizens \nreceiving food stamp benefits--and this includes approximately 2.5 \nmillion people--must work before he or she receives their monthly \nallotment of food stamp benefits. In the meantime, while earning their \nfood assistance, recipients will have ample time to look for further \npermanent employment so that they can move altogether off of the \nwelfare rolls.\n  One additional important fact: the pending amendment exempts \nchildren; it exempts their parents; it exempts the disabled; it exempts \nthe elderly. The pending amendment focuses--as I stated before--on the \n2.5 million able-bodied food stamp recipients.\n  In my judgment, Congress simply can no longer look the other way when \nit comes to restoring responsibility to the Federal nutrition and \nwelfare programs. Congress can no longer allow unlimited tax dollars to \nbe used on misguided, although well-intentioned, social programs. It is \ntime to stop throwing taxpayers' money at pie-in-the-sky Federal \nprograms instead of working to get to the root of the problem. This is \none step toward reaching the root of the problem.\n  It goes without saying that I hope Senators will help accomplish this \ngoal with their support of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I understood the distinguished Senator, my friend from \nMississippi, Mr. Cochran, was to be here about 11 or 11:15 so that he \ncould speak in opposition to my amendment. I hope the Chair will \nrecognize the Senator from Mississippi at such time as he may appear in \nthe Chamber for that purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in general terms \nabout the bill that is before us, not particularly on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, but I will be brief and be \nhappy to yield if Senator Cochran comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I, of course, have watched with great interest over \nthe last week as we have talked about welfare, and much of it has been \nin great detail, as it should be. But I rise basically to support the \nDole amendment. I rise to urge that we pass this bill. There will be \nchanges. There should be changes. There should be great debates. There \nare differences of view. But those things can, indeed, be resolved.\n  The point is we have come to the time, the monumental time in which \nwe can reform welfare--almost everyone says welfare needs to be \nreformed--and yet we go on and on in great detail and, indeed, risk the \nopportunity of passage of this bill.\n  So I rise to suggest to my colleagues that we need to move forward. \nWe need to consider the amendments. We need to consider the ideas. \nMostly, however, we need to be committed to taking this opportunity to \npassing welfare reform. It is a historic time. It is the first time in \nmost of our memories when we have had an opportunity to really look at \nwhat are basically Great Society programs that have not been reviewed, \nhave not been changed in a very long time, have not been questioned as \nto whether or not they are fulfilling the purpose for which they were \ndevised, have not been measured in terms of their effectiveness, in \nterms of accomplishing that goal.\n  No one would oppose the idea that we need to help people who need \nhelp, but the purpose is to help them back into the workplace, back \ninto the private sector so that they can help themselves.\n  Nobody would argue that making a career of welfare is a great thing \nto do. No one wants to do that. So we have for the first time an \nopportunity to make these measurements, and I certainly am encouraged \nthat we are doing it.\n  I have to admit that we are somewhat discouraged in that this is not \nthe first time this year we have entered into one of great debates when \nwe have had people stand up on both sides of the aisle and say we \ncertainly want a welfare bill, we want a nonpartisan bill, we want to \nmove it, and then go into a very partisan posture of seeing that it \ndoes not move, of having 150 amendments that have to be treated.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that we are prepared to complete this task \nand complete it in a responsible time, to complete welfare reform for \nthe first time in many years.\n  We have to deal, of course, with the perverse incentives that are \nthere, the incentives that encourage people to be locked into welfare, \nthat encourage the idea of additional children while on welfare, that \nencourage the idea of one-parent families. These are things that no one \nagrees with, but these are in fact at least partially the results of \nthings that we have been doing. In short, the system conflicts with the \nbasic principles of this country in terms of equality and opportunity, \nand that is what we are seeking to do.\n  There is a need for a new approach. I have dealt with this, as most \nof us \n\n[[Page S 13154]]\nhave, for a good long time, starting in the Wyoming Legislature when we \nhad the same kinds of debates. But I am persuaded that this is one of \nthose things--and there are many of them--in which the needs in Wyoming \nare quite different than the needs in New York or New Jersey or indeed \nin California, so that we do need to allow the States to be the \nlaboratories in which we devise the best delivery plans we can.\n  That is partly what this is all about. The States know the kinds of \nprograms. We have developed programs in Wyoming, nonpartisan programs, \nby the way, that are designed to bring people back into the workplace, \nand to a large extent they are working.\n  Workfare programs in Wyoming, known as Wyoming opportunity acts, were \nstarted by a Democratic Governor several years ago. They are very \nlimited. They are only in two or three counties out of 23, and we have \nhad difficulty getting waivers from the Federal Government to do those \nthings. But they are a move in the right direction, and that is the \nkind of flexibility we do need.\n  Obviously, the Federal Government will have a role, setting a \nframework for the States, requiring work, encouraging child care, \nstressing personal responsibility, cracking down on fraud, but we need \nto give the States the flexibility to devise the plan that works there.\n  I urge that we move forward. Many of the things that are talked about \nas being partisan are really the great debates. There are differences \nof view. There is a substantial difference between the general \nphilosophy of our friends on the other side of the aisle and this side \nof the aisle.\n  We have to resolve those. That is what it is all about. That is why \nwe take votes. And that is why we have a process. I guess I am urging \nmore than anything, however, that we collectively commit ourselves to \ncompleting this task, to accomplishing the reform of welfare.\n  The President in his initial entry into national public life said we \nare going to change welfare as we know it. Unfortunately, there has not \nbeen much activity from the White House--very little activity from the \nWhite House. This week's radio program however says let us keep \npolitics out of the welfare bill. I am for that. Let us identify those \nissues that we need to talk about. There are differences. We can \nresolve them. We need to do that.\n  Unfortunately, the White House says, let us keep politics out of it; \nand then turns loose the Press Secretary and many others in the \nadministration to come in in various areas.\n  So, Mr. President, I just believe strongly that the 1994 election and \nthe continuing polling indicates a particular message; that is, \nAmericans want action and they want something changed. They want \nreform. The American people do not want us to debate this in great \ndetail and then leave it, walk away from it without some resolution. I \nthink they indicated we are sincere and serious about breaking the \ncycle of welfare and giving the States flexibility.\n  Those are issues that almost no one can argue with. We certainly need \nto be concerned about the distribution formula, about the maintenance \nof effort in the States, about training. We had to do some of these \nthings in our Senate legislature. We had perverse incentives. We found \nit was more attractive for a single mother to stay on welfare than to \ngo off to a minimum-wage job and lose health benefits and lose child \ncare. We had to change that.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very optimistic about our chances to do \nsomething that has not been done for a very long time. And I urge my \nfellow Members of the Senate to move forward, resolve these questions--\nthey can be resolved; that is what the system is for--and produce a \nresult this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have the Helms amendment currently pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there a time limit on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limit on the amendment per se. We \nhave the Dodd amendment that does have a time limit of 4 hours, which \nwould speak to commencing debate at around 1.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. And I thank Senator Moynihan and \nSenator Helms. I had wondered about a time limit. I did not know \nwhether one had been entered into. I wanted to make sure.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak to a number of amendments to be \noffered: the one by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Helms, No. 2523; but also ones to be offered by Senator \nAshcroft, No. 2562; Senator Shelby 2527; Senator McCain, No. 2542.\n  I realize we will be voting on all of these, but I will oppose them, \nand I know of others who may. I want to lay out my reasoning. I would \nstart with the amendment of the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, No. 2523.\n  I oppose it because I believe that instead of encouraging people to \nwork, it actually punishes hard-working Americans and it also punishes \npregnant women. I know that the distinguished Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, which, of course, \nis the committee of jurisdiction over the food stamp program, strongly \nopposes the amendment of Senator Helms. In this case both the chairman \nand I, as ranking Member, join in opposing it.\n  In doing that, I want to lay out some basic facts. I want to remind \neverybody here that over 80 percent of food stamp benefits go to \nfamilies with children. Over 90 percent go to families with children, \nthe elderly or disabled.\n  Keep in mind where this is going. The average food stamp benefit is \naround 76 cents per meal, per person. And if you read this amendment, \nand follow it to its logical conclusion, it says if you work hard for \n15 years, pay your taxes for 15 years, abide by the law for 15 years, \nbut your factory closes, and you are taking more than a month to find \nanother job--maybe the main employer in the whole area closes--you \ncannot get food stamp assistance after that time.\n  And even though you put all this money into your taxes, though you \npaid for the program for 15 years, you are out. The amendment looks \nback 30 days. If a person has not worked in the last 30 days they are \ndenied food stamps.\n  Well, we all remember the earthquake in California, and hurricanes in \nFlorida--these disasters caused major disruptions to employment. Or \nthink of an area where you have one primary employer, say a large \nfactory, that closes--you are going to take a lot more than 30 days to \nfind a job. But if you have not worked in those last 30 days, even \nthough you are out actively trying to find a job, you are denied food \nstamps.\n  Incidentally, the amendment makes no exception for women who are \npregnant with their first child. If their employer goes out of \nbusiness, these pregnant women must find another job or work for free \nfor the county or the State before they get any food assistance. I do \nnot think it is fair for pregnant women, and it certainly is not going \nto help their unborn child.\n  Now, my understanding is that Senators Lugar and Cochran agree with \nme that this amendment is not one to be supported, and it is not fair \nto hard-working Americans who play by the rules, the factory workers \nwho are laid off and need some temporary food assistance. One of the \nreasons we have the food stamp program and why it is part of the safety \nnet is because we cannot say, ``Too bad, go get a job. Then we will \ngive you food stamps.'' It is a time when they are out looking for a \njob and cannot get a job that they need the food stamps. Usually if you \nare able to get a decent job, you are not eligible for food stamps \nanyway and you do not need them.\n  I think hard-working Americans deserve a better break than that. They \nshould, of course, try to find work. Everybody should. But they should \nnot be punished because their factory moved or they went out of \nbusiness or they had to lay off employees.\n  There are an awful lot of people who have paid the cost of the food \nstamp program, and of every other program the Federal Government has \nbeen involved in from the Department of Defense to agriculture. Those \npeople are going to be affected by this. \n\n[[Page S 13155]]\n\n  Now, the amendment by Senator Ashcroft, I oppose because of its \naffect on the elderly and disabled. Under the Ashcroft amendment, once \nanyone has received 24 months of assistance in their lifetime, they can \nno longer receive food stamps unless they are working. Elderly and \ndisabled Americans may work very hard for decades and then become cut \noff from benefits by that amendment.\n  The amendment also denies States the right to make a decision, a \ndecision that is offered in the bill by the distinguished majority \nleader, to choose whether to take a block grant or to participate in \nthe food stamp program. Under Senator Ashcroft's amendment States no \nlonger have that option. It is a mandatory block grant. Senator Dole's \nbill contains that option. And I agree with the handling of this by \nSenator Dole--States should not be forced to take block grants.\n  The amendment also imposes on States, whether they want it or not, an \nunfair formula for providing funds.\n  The formula penalizes those States that are growth States, especially \nthose in the Sun Belt. It penalizes those States that face recessions. \nAnd I think every one of us knows that recessions often hit individual \nStates harder than the country as a whole, and that each one of us have \nseen times when our State may be hit by a recession when other States \nare not.\n  During the last recession, my home State of Vermont was one of the \nfirst States affected by the recession.\n  Vermont suffered significant job losses throughout the recession. \nJust when Vermont would most need its food assistance, the amendment \nwould say, ``Too bad. Have a hungry day.''\n  I think States should at least have the ability to decide whether to \ntake that block grant, and this Congress should not impose it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the Ashcroft amendment, since \nit takes away the State's right to decide, it hurts the elderly and \ndisabled, and it hurts some States at the expense of others.\n  Now let me speak to the third amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, Senator Shelby. I strongly oppose this amendment. \nI believe it would lead to a huge increase in childhood hunger among \nlow-income Americans. More and more children live in poverty in this \ncountry. But Senator Shelby's amendment takes food assistance away from \nlow-income families and provides it to higher-income families who may \nnot need the assistance.\n  The bill of the distinguished majority leader, the Senator from \nKansas, already makes huge cuts in food stamp funding, but under the \nShelby amendment to the Dole bill, a lot of the funds that are left \nwould be diverted to higher income families. That means low-income \nchildren go hungry.\n  Again, remember what I said earlier, 80 percent of food stamp \nbenefits go to families with children; 90 percent go to families with \nchildren, the elderly or the disabled. But in this case, the money is \nactually diverted to higher-income families.\n  Under the current law, just to explain this, food stamp benefits are \ncarefully targeted to the most needy Americans. Almost all the benefits \ngo to those who live in poverty. But under the Shelby amendment, much \nof the food stamp money can be diverted to benefit higher-income \nfamilies.\n  It also allows States to divert substantial portions of the block \ngrant away from food assistance.\n  That, in my mind, is enough reason to defeat the amendment, but there \nis something even worse. The funds are diverted in a manner that \nreduces work programs. The one thing I think we all agree on is to try \nto get people back to work. I know I want--and this has been my \nposition for years--to get participants off food stamps and into the \nwork force. But this amendment allows diversion of funds away from \nwork-related activities that help create jobs and help get people back \nto work. It is counterproductive.\n  The best way to get families back on their feet is to help them find \na job. We should not reduce job-search efforts or job training.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain. The amendment would have some \nunusual, and I have to believe, unintended effects. Let us go back \nfirst to the bill of the majority leader. Under Senator Dole's bill, \nfood stamp assistance could be used to provide subsidies to private \nemployers to hire food stamp recipients. It is called wage \nsupplementation. It has to be done carefully, but if it is done \ncarefully, it can be a very good idea. Under Senator Dole's bill, \ncorporations can use this Federal money to subsidize wages for up to 6 \nmonths. Then the employer has to decide, do you hire the person or let \nthem go?\n  Senator McCain's amendment allows for a permanent subsidy for jobs \nfor private employers. It takes money away from others who need help \ngetting off food stamps and into the work force. We have already cut \nback the amount of money substantially in food stamps. So I oppose that \namendment also.\n  Mr. President, none of these issues are easy when it comes to food \nstamps. There are improvements that can be made to the program. We have \nmade some substantial ones over the years. One improvement that I \nstrongly support--in fact, I have written an amendment to do this--is \nto get us as quickly as possible on to an EBT Program, an electronic \nbenefits transfer program. It would save tens of millions of dollars in \njust the cost of printing and handling food stamps. We tend to forget \nthat there are millions and millions and millions of dollars that are \nspent just in printing these coupons, in collecting them and storing \nthem, and even millions in carefully destroying them.\n  Electronic benefits transfer would use a credit-card type of system, \nwith the computer ability to say, if you have 46 dollars' worth of \nbenefits, you know exactly where the $46 was spent, whether it was \nspent at a legitimate grocery store or fraudulently spent elsewhere.\n  Electronic benefits transfer would help us catch those who defraud \nthe program. There are people in all parts of this country who are \nusing this program, which was designed to help hungry children, the \npoor, the elderly, and the disabled, to rip off the taxpayers. We have \nhad instances of stores, tiny little stores, that are doing hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of business a month on food stamps. It is obvious \nthey are not selling that. They are a front to cash in these food \nstamps.\n  Under my plan, with electronic benefits transfer, we could find those \nstores more easily. We could identify them much more quickly. We could \ngive the U.S. attorney far more evidence for prosecution. And, frankly, \nMr. President, those who are defrauding the program in this way should \ngo to jail. They should be taken off the program, the store should be \ntaken off the program, the person using the food stamps should be \nbarred from the program, and the person should be prosecuted and sent \nto jail.\n  I hear a lot of talk about what might prove to be a deterrent and \nwhat might not. I found during my years as a prosecutor nothing proved \na better deterrent than the knowledge if you committed a crime you are \ngoing to do the time. I found the best deterrent was not to say, ``Oh, \nwe have all these laws on the books, you potentially could get nailed \nfor this.'' If people know they are not going to get caught, that does \nnot make any difference.\n  I will give one example. I used to give to police officers at the \npolice academy, when I was a prosecutor, a lecture. I said: You have \ntwo warehouses side by side, both filled with television sets. One is \nwell lit and has an alarm system. It is going to notify the police \nimmediately if there is a breakin. The other is down the street around \nthe corner off the view of the main thoroughfare, has no lights around \nit, has an old lock and has no alarm system. Now, the penalty for \nbreaking into those warehouses and stealing the television sets is \nexactly the same, whether you break into the one with the alarm system \nand well lit, or the one around the corner where nobody is going to see \nyou and you get away with it. The law is exactly the same. The penalty \nis exactly the same. The answer, of course, is simple. You are going to \nbreak into the one where you think you will not get caught. The penalty \nwas not the deterrent. The deterrent was that you might get caught, you \nmight get prosecuted, you might \n\n[[Page S 13156]]\ngo to jail. The same thing should be done with food stamp fraud.\n  If you are running a small store, some of which are about the size of \nour offices, and doing more food stamp business a month than a \nsupermarket, and if you know you are going to go to jail, not just that \nyou will be taken off the program and not allowed to sell, but you are \ngoing to go to jail if you do it, you are going to think twice about \ndefrauding the program, especially if the Federal authorities have a \nnew tool that gives the prosecution an ironclad ability to nail you. We \nmust provide that tool.\n  We have to do that because there is one thing we have to remember: \nThose who commit fraud in the food stamp program are taking money from \nevery American taxpayer, people who work very hard. Sometimes a husband \nand wife are holding down three jobs or four jobs between them just to \npay the bills. They should not have to pay for those who are defrauding \nthe system. For those of us who feel we should do something to help \nhungry children, it is also taking money away from them.\n  There are studies that show if we go to this, we could save $400 \nmillion over 10 years. Frankly, I would like to see us save even more, \nand I suspect we will.\n  It will not be just the paperwork where we will save money or the \nprinting and collecting and distribution of paper coupons. We will save \nmoney by reducing fraud. I think the benefits will be enormous.\n  My amendment allows States the option to convert statewide to EBT. I \nsent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter Friday, before we went out, to all of \nthe offices. I know each one of us eagerly awaits ``Dear Colleague'' \nletters so that we can read them before we do everything else. If there \nare any other Senators who just came back and have not had a chance, as \nI eagerly read all of yours, hopefully, they will read mine. This is a \nway to save money. I see the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the amendment \nof my good friend, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. I \nagree with him that our public assistance programs ought to encourage \nwork and not dependency. But it seems to me that this amendment affects \nthe wrong people.\n  For example, individuals who have a long job history, but who are \nlaid off when a factory closes, would be denied benefits under the \namendment. This result concerns me. Individuals who have never been on \nthe Food Stamp Program and who have always worked seem to me to be \nthose whom this program ought to help--people who face a temporary \nsetback.\n  In the case I have described, individuals who have been laid off when \na factory closes may face high local unemployment conditions and may \nfind it difficult to get a job.\n  A major goal of the Agriculture Committee was to preserve a safety \nnet for people who have played by the rules and need a helping hand \nthrough hard times, while ending the free ride for those who have taken \nadvantage of the system.\n  As a matter of fact, there are numerous provisions in the bill to \npromote work and to deny benefits to those who will not work even \nthough they are able-bodied and could be working. For example, States \nwill--for the first time--be able to permanently disqualify repeat \nviolators of work rules under this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have worked to analyze a number of suggestions for \nreducing the costs of this program, for tightening the rules, and \nmaking true reform come to pass. We think this is a balanced and \nthoughtful approach that we are recommending to the Senate for its \naction. I hope the Senate will support the committee's effort.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our public assistance programs should \nencourage work, not dependency. The Senator from North Carolina and I \nagree on this. However, this amendment affects the wrong people.\n  It would deny food stamps to able-bodied 18- to 55-year-old persons \nwithout dependents unless they work at least part time. Many people who \nfit that description are not long-term food stamp recipients.\n  Individuals who have long job histories but who are laid off when a \nfactory closes would be denied benefits under this amendment. This \nresult should concern all of us. Individuals who have never been on the \nFood Stamp Program and who have always worked are exactly the kinds of \npeople that the Food Stamp Program should help--people who face a \ntemporary setback.\n  Individuals who have been laid off when a factory closes may face \nhigh local unemployment and may find it difficult to get a job. The \ncase of the people I have described is not unusual. Over half of all \nfood stamp recipients will only stay on for a matter of months, and \nthey will most likely leave because their earnings increase.\n  A major goal of the Agriculture Committee was to preserve a safety \nnet for people who have played by the rules and need a helping hand \nthrough hard times, while ending the free ride for those categories of \nrecipients who have most taken advantage of the system. Under the \nleadership bill, able bodied, nonelderly adults without dependent \nchildren will have their benefits time limited if they are not in a job \nor employment program at least halftime. The time limit in the \nleadership bill prohibits the receipt of food stamps for those who were \nnot working for 6 months out of a year. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, approximately 700,000 people would be subject to this \nrequirement in an average month. USDA's estimate is higher. However, \nunder the leadership bill, the Secretary of Agriculture may waive this \nprovision in areas with over 8-percent unemployment or if there are \ninsufficient local jobs.\n  The amendment by the Senator from North Carolina does not contain any \nwaiver language. In addition, AFDC block grant recipients who violate \nan AFDC work program requirement will be sanctioned under the Food \nStamp Program. For an AFDC recipient who has been disqualified from \nfood stamps due to an AFDC work violation, the food stamp \ndisqualification continues until compliance even if the recipient loses \nAFDC eligibility.\n  Numerous other provisions in the bill promote work. For example, \nStates will--for the first time--be able to permanently disqualify \nrepeat violators of work rules.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will not consume very much more time. \nThad Cochran knows of my respect for him. There is no Senator in this \nbody for whom I have greater respect. But I have to say to him, as I \nsay to the distinguished Senator from Vermont, I do not know which \namendment they are talking about, but they are certainly not talking \nabout the pending amendment by Jesse Helms.\n  For example, both Senators have said and have voiced a lamentation \nthat people who are temporarily out of work would be cut off of food \nstamps. Clearly, on page 2 of the amendment, it says, ``For the \npurposes of paragraph (1), an individual may perform community service \nor work for a State or political subdivision of a State through a \nprogram established by a State or political subdivision.''\n  Then, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Vermont mentioned \npeople needing food stamps in earthquake situations--workers are needed \nfor community service then more than ever. They should not be desirous \nof just sitting around while somebody cleans up the mess.\n  I, then, heard that we ought not to deny pregnant women food stamps. \nMr. President, there are pregnant women all over this country working \ntoday. As long as they are able to work, they do. Some of them--who \nhave worked in my office and at my television station before I lost my \nmind and ran for the Senate--worked until a few days before they went \nto the hospital. I am not saying that they ought to do that. But, to \nsay that a pregnant woman should automatically get food stamps does not \nmake sense. It is not fair to all the pregnant women who get up and go \nto work every day by the millions in this country.\n  Excluded from this amendment--let me repeat--excluded are children \nunder 18, parents with dependents under 18, mentally or physically \ndisabled, members of a household caring for incapacitated people, and \npeople over 55 years of age. \n\n[[Page S 13157]]\n\n  Although many families with children receive some food stamp \nassistance, the overwhelming majority of them also receive aid from \nanother Federal program, another costly Federal program--the AFDC. \nWelfare benefits are already given to these families.\n  Mr. President, we are supposed to be dedicated to working toward a \nbalanced budget. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that 9 out of \nevery 10 recipients will automatically drop off the roll if you require \nthem to work under the pending amendment.\n  Also, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the pending Helms \namendment will save $5.6 billion of the taxpayers' money over the next \n7 years.\n  As for the role of the States, the Republican welfare bill removes a \nmountain of redtape and administrative costs are cut tenfold. In \naddition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a report from 1986, \nstates that enforcing strong work requirements will save $3 on welfare \ncosts for every dollar the State invests in a work program.\n  Currently, there are 15 million State and local employees within \n23,000 county and municipal governments. If absolutely nobody were to \ndrop off the welfare rolls because of the Helms amendment--and this is \nnext to impossible because of the Heritage Foundation estimate which I \njust stated--this amendment would increase the State and local \nemployment rolls by only 3 percent, and then only for workers working \none-fourth of the time.\n  Finally, it is easier for States to keep track of recipients when \nthey sign up for work and benefits at the same time and place. Trying \nto keep track of recipients in private sector jobs while making sure \nthat they are in fact working could be an administrative nightmare.\n  Therefore, I must respectfully decline to accept the criticism of the \nHelms amendment by my friend from Vermont and my friend from \nMississippi.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article of \nFebruary 1994, from the Readers Digest to which I referred earlier, \nentitled ``The Food Stamp Racket,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Food-Stamp Racket\n\n                         (By Daniel R. Levine)\n\n       Spyros Stanley was one of the wealthiest people in \n     Charleston, W.Va. He owned a bar and practically every \n     parking lot in the city. But, according to investigators, he \n     had also purchased $23,000 worth of food stamps--for a \n     fraction of their value--from welfare recipients and crack-\n     cocaine dealers. Stanley was buying the stamps to purchase \n     food for himself and his bar.\n       In Brooklyn, N.Y., J & D Meats, Inc., looked like a typical \n     big-city wholesaler, bustling with delivery trucks, vans and \n     forklifts. Its finances, however, were anything but typical. \n     J & D's owners were illegally trading meat for food stamps. \n     The wholesaler was converting the stamps to cash by \n     depositing them into the bank account of a retail meat market \n     it had once owned, but which was then out of business. In \n     nine years, J & D Meats redeemed $82-million worth of food \n     stamps at its bank.\n       In Hampton, Va., food stamps became Lazaro Sotolongo's road \n     to riches. Penniless when he arrived from Cuba in 1980, \n     Sotolongo set up a drug ring that sold crack for food stamps \n     at 50 cents on the dollar. He converted the food stamps to \n     cash by selling them to unscrupulous authorized retailers. \n     Over three years he took in more than $8 million.\n       Says Constant Chevalier, Midwest regional inspector general \n     of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):\n       ``We've seen just about every type of fraud and abuse of \n     the food-stamp program you could think of.''\n       In 1968, 2.2 million Americans received food stamps at a \n     cost of $173 million. Today, 27 million Americans are \n     enrolled in a food-stamp program that costs taxpayers $24 \n     billion a year.\n       Food stamps are available to anyone meeting certain \n     eligibility requirements, including individuals whose monthly \n     income is 30 percent above the poverty line. The eligibility \n     requirements are so generous that a family of four earning \n     $18,660 a year (and an individual earning $9,072) can qualify \n     for limited benefits. Maximum benefits for a family of four \n     with no income are $375 a month, while a family of eight can \n     receive up to $676 a month. The value of the stamps is \n     inflated to 103 percent of the cost of the government's basic \n     nutrition plan. This three-percent boost costs $850 million \n     each year.\n       Even when required by law, getting Congress to cut food-\n     stamp benefits is nearly impossible. Benefits are indexed for \n     food-price inflation once a year. But when food prices \n     dropped 1.3 percent between 1991 and 1992, Congress blocked \n     the law's automatic reduction in food-stamp\n      benefits, throwing a potential savings of $330 million out \n     the window.\n       At the same time President Clinton and Congress talk of \n     reducing the federal deficit, food-stamp spending will \n     increase by $3 billion over the next five years. Now is a \n     good time to take a look at what years of skyrocketing \n     spending have already produced.\n       Second Currency. Once a month, a large percentage of food-\n     stamp recipients receive ``authorization to participate'' \n     (ATP) cards in the mail that show their monthly allotment \n     based on household size and income. They take these to a post \n     office, bank or check-cashing store and exchange them for \n     food stamps, which are used to buy food in authorized retail \n     stores.\n       But it's when recipients trade the stamps for cash or drugs \n     that the system breaks down. A typical fraud works this way: \n     A drug dealer approaches a food-stamp recipient outside an \n     issuance center and trades $50 worth of crack for $100 in \n     food stamps. The dealer then sells the stamps to a dishonest \n     authorized retailer for $75 in cash. The store then redeems \n     the stamps at a bank for their full value. As a result food \n     stamps have become a second currency used to pay for drugs, \n     prostitution, weapons, cars--even a house. Says Cathy E. \n     Krinick, a Virginia deputy commonwealth attorney, ``Food \n     stamps are more profitable than money.''\n       In Camden, N.J., a USDA agent making an undercover \n     investigation into food-stamp fraud received a startling \n     offer in January 1991. Jack Ayboub, owner of a grocery store \n     authorized to accept food stamps, had already received $6700 \n     in coupons from the agent for $3300 in cash. Now Ayoub \n     offered to trade a three-bedroom house for $30,000 in food \n     stamps and another house every two months using the same \n     scheme. After completing the first part of the deal, Ayoub \n     was arrested by federal agents.\n       An art aficoinado in Albuquerque, N.M., used food stamps to \n     fund his collection. He also owned a general store authorized \n     by the USDA to accept food stamps. But instead of milk or \n     eggs, he gave customers cash at 30 to 50 cents on the dollar \n     for their stamps. Then he redeemed them at the bank for their \n     face value. With his profits, he bought $35,000 worth of \n     stolen art.\n       Food stamps are also easily counterfeited. Dennie Lyons of \n     New Orleans printed more than $127,000 worth of bogus stamps \n     and tried to sell them around the country. When caught, he \n     was sentenced to four years in prison, and his wife, \n     Johnette, got five years' probation for aiding him. But it \n     wasn't long before her phony food stamps were replaced by \n     real ones--soon after her indictment, she was admitted to the \n     food-stamp program.\n       Retailer Rip-Offs. Only stores authorized by the USDA's \n     Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) can accept and redeem food \n     stamps. But the procedures for receiving authorization are \n     woefully inadequate. A retailer can receive certification \n     merely by filing out an application and stating that staple \n     foods account for over\n      50 percent of his sales. At the same time, however, there \n     are some 175 FNS people assigned to monitor and \n     investigate the activities of 213,000 authorized \n     retailers, of which 3200 are estimated to be illegally \n     exchanging stamps for crash.\n       The FNS is so outmatched that even official sanctions don't \n     work. A USDA audit in 1992 found that there were ``no \n     effective procedures'' to prevent disqualified retailers from \n     continuing to accept and cash in food stamps. ``The \n     disqualification process is sorely lacking,'' says one \n     regional inspector general.\n       Adds Craig L. Beauchamp, the USDA's assistant inspector \n     general for investigations, ``We are seeing more million-\n     dollar-and-up frauds committed by retailers than we have ever \n     seen before.''\n       In Toledo, Ohio, grocer Michael Hebeka was convicted of \n     fraud and permanently banned from the food-stamp program in \n     1984. Using falsified papers, he tricked officials into \n     believing he had sold his Ashland Market to an employee. Soon \n     the government reauthorized the store to accept food stamps, \n     and Hebeka was back in business. When he was caught a second \n     time in May 1991, he had already redeemed another $7.2 \n     million in stamps.\n       In Los Angeles, two small grocery stores bought food stamps \n     for half their face value in cash and redeemed them for their \n     full value. Between 1989 and 1992, they cashed in stamps \n     worth more than $20 million. For 16 months, one of the \n     markets averaged $19,000 a day in food-stamp redemptions--\n     even though it had only $10,000 in inventory.\n       In East St. Louis, Ill., Kenneth Coates, owner of Coates \n     Market, paid as little as 65 cents on the dollar for foods \n     stamps, which he cashed in for full value. Over a year and a \n     half, he redeemed $1.3 million, enabling him to pay for his \n     children's private schooling and have enough left over for \n     $150,000 worth of stocks, at least five rental houses and a \n     Mercedes-Benz. This wasn't the first time Coates Market had \n     defrauded the food-stamp program. Ten years earlier, it had \n     been disqualified for fraud--only to be readmitted after six \n     months.\n       Bureautatic Nightmare. After Medicaid, the food-stamp \n     program is the most expensive in the federal welfare system, \n     and one of the most poorly run. Even when the number of \n     recipients has dropped, operating cost have gone up. In 1990 \n     there were 600,000 fewer people on the rolls compared with \n     1981. But administrative costs soared from $1.1 billion \n\n[[Page S 13158]]\n     to $2.5 billion. The bureaucracy has grown so unwieldy that \n     mismanagement and inefficiency permeate the program.\n       Most welfare programs are jointly funded by state and \n     federal governments. But food stamps are entirely\n      funded and regulated by Washington, while state and local \n     agencies are responsible for administering and \n     distributing the coupons. Essentially, states run the day-\n     to-day operation of a program in which they have little \n     incentive to manage costs efficiently.\n       Mistakes are rife. In 1992, $1.7-billion worth of food \n     stamps were overpaid or sent to ineligible people. The \n     government has fined states that have high error totals, but \n     the penalties are rarely taken seriously. During the past 11 \n     years, $869 million in fines have been levied, and only $5 \n     million collected.\n       With over $20 billion in federal food stamps circulating \n     every year and little reason for the states to manage them \n     effectively, it's no surprise that the program is easy \n     pickings for crooks--even those ``inside'' the system.\n       In Detroit, the department of social services sent $26,000 \n     in food stamps to Mae Duncan. But she didn't exist. The name \n     was one of 26 invented by Patricia Allen, a 39-year-old \n     social worker. Over a nine-year period, she collected more \n     than $221,000 worth of food stamps. In Baton Rouge, La., two \n     sisters who were social-service caseworkers issued $50,000 in \n     food stamps to nonexistent recipients. And in St. Paul, \n     Minn., nobody noticed when a state clerk pocketed $180,000 \n     worth of returned food stamps in nine months.\n       Of the $24 billion taxpayers fork over for food stamps, \n     nearly $2 billion is lost to fraud, waste and abuse.\n      Says welfare and social-policy expert Charles Murray of the \n     American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C., think \n     tank, ``This is a program that for three decades has grown \n     year after year, without any evidence that it should \n     grow.''\n       Clearly, radical reform is needed. Here's what can be done:\n       1. Tighten eligibility. Food stamps should be focused on \n     helping the neediest Americans--those living at or below the \n     poverty line. Lowering the income eligibility ceiling to that \n     level (except for families with elderly and disabled members) \n     would guarantee that taxpayer dollars are going to those who \n     truly need assistance.\n       2. Cut excesses. Reducing benefits so that they reflect 100 \n     percent, rather than 103 percent, of the government's basic \n     food plan would save $850 million annually. And states with \n     excessive error rates in administering food stamps should be \n     forced to reimburse the federal government for the lost \n     money. If incentives are put into place, taxpayers could be \n     saved hundreds of millions of dollars each year, and \n     recipients would be served more efficiently.\n       3. Crack down on criminals. Last August, Congress passed \n     legislation introduced by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) \n     toughening penalties against recipients and retailers \n     convicted of food-stamp trafficking. This is a good start, \n     but much more can be done. Recipients should be permanently \n     barred from the program the first time they are caught \n     trading food stamps for drugs, just as they are when they \n     trade for weapons, ammunition or explosives. Now they are \n     given two chances.\n       As for retailers, information they provide the FNS, such as \n     sales-volume and coupon-redemption data, should be shared \n     with federal law-enforcement officials. Currently, only other \n     welfare agencies are allowed to see these numbers. Also, \n     tougher standards should be imposed before retailers can be \n     certified to redeem food stamps and after a store has been \n     disqualified. Regular store visits and interviews with the \n     owners should be the rule, not the exception. Some of the \n     savings from the program should be used to hire much-needed \n     additional FNS investigators.\n       Ultimately, however, it is up to Congress to control the \n     rapid growth of food stamps. But over the program's 30-year \n     history, Congress has rarely taken the bold steps necessary \n     to rein in costs. Eliminating illicit trafficking and \n     ensuring that food stamps reach only the neediest Americans \n     in a cost-efficient manner should be a top national priority.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am taking a moment to expand on the \nremarks I made toward the end of our debate on Friday concerning the \namendment I offered, the Family Support Act of 1995, a measure which \nsimply brought up to a new set of standards the Family Support Act of \n1988.\n  We began in 1988 saying all States would have to have 20 percent of \ntheir eligible adult welfare recipients in work, job training, or job \nsearch by 1995.\n  It was understood that as we got the hang of this, as States learned \nto handle what was a new idea, welfare should be an interim measure, as \npeople moved to independence and became self-supporting. We agreed to \nchange a program that began as a widows' pension and is no longer such.\n  It was contemplated we would work our way up to higher levels of \nparticipation, and indeed in the Family Support Act of 1995 we move to \n50 percent by the year 2001, add money to the JOBS program, make \nimprovements to the child support system, and build on a program which \nwe have begun to feel is working.\n  Dramatic improvement does not happen instantly when one passes \nlegislation, not in an area like this, not in a situation where we have \nso many communities that have been reduced to an extraordinary \nincidence of dependence.\n  I mentioned on Friday that, in the city of Chicago, 46 percent of \nchildren were on welfare at some time in the course of the year 1993; \nin Detroit, 67 percent; in New York, 39; in Philadelphia, 57; San \nDiego, 30. These are massive problems.\n  It is not surprising that the first real reactions to the Family \nSupport Act, the ones that were most innovative and effective, came in \nareas not necessarily rural, but not with the masses of poor who \ninhabit the great cities. Iowa is one of these areas with great \nsignificance.\n  On the floor a month ago, Monday, August 7, my good friend and \ncomanager here, the Senator from Iowa, [Mr. Grassley], said something \nvery important. He said, ``. . . my State of Iowa began the \nimplementation of its program in October 1993. In the last 2 years, the \nnumber of AFDC employed recipients has increased from 18 percent of all \nwelfare recipients to 34 percent--I believe now the highest of any of \nthe States--as a percentage of welfare recipients who are working.'' If \nI may interpolate, I think that is correct. We had set 20 percent as \nthe initial goal. Iowa went right by it to 38 percent, more than \nhalfway to the goal of fifty percent we had contemplated in the Family \nSupport Act of 1995 presented to the Finance Committee. That bill \nfailed 12 to 8 in the Finance Committee and received 41 votes here on \nthe Senate floor; 54 to 41, if I recall.\n  But that bill of 1988, which I say, once again, went out the Senate \ndoor 96 to 1, began to take hold. The program in Iowa that Senator \nGrassley was talking about is the program created under the Family \nSupport Act. Mr. President, the Federal government pays at more than 60 \npercent of the program costs in the JOBS program. The Family Support \nAct of 1995, which we voted on Friday, would take it from 60 percent to \na minimum of 70 percent for all expenditures, including administrative \ncosts. States have not in the past drawn down the full amount available \nto them to implement the JOBS program--by increasing the federal share, \nmy bill would make possible the full implementation of the JOBS \nprogram.\n  I might just add as a preface to some of the other things I am going \nto say, Iowa passed a reform bill 2 years ago. Indeed, on that \noccasion, Mr. President, I put into the Record the Iowa Family \nInvestment Program, for which basic approval under the JOBS program was \nrequested in April 1993 and approved in August 1993. They received a \nwaiver to raise the asset limit for applicants to $5,000 for \nrecipients, exempt equity value of an automobile up to $3,000, adjust \nannual CPI by income deposited in an IDA account not to be counted as \nincome, and so forth.\n  In Iowa, if you are out in the countryside and you do not have an \nautomobile, you are not going to find a job. One of the debilitating \nthings about welfare is that it has required its recipients not only to \nbe paupers but to remain paupers. About 5 years ago a \n\n[[Page S 13159]]\nmother was discovered in a Middle Western State who had been saving, \nhad saved some $12,000 to put her daughter through college, and was, in \nconsequence, a criminal.\n  It just emiserates the population involved, and not a small number of \npersons. To say again, in some cities it is the majority of all the \nchildren living in the city--67 percent of the children in Detroit, 57 \npercent of the children in Philadelphia.\n  On Friday, Senator Harkin gave a very careful and thoughtful \ndescription of the program in Iowa, following on some of the remarks by \nhis colleague. He said he wanted to bring to his colleagues' attention \nwhat has happened in Iowa ``since we changed our welfare system.'' He \nsaid:\n\n       We enacted a welfare reform program in October 1993, and \n     almost 2 years later you can see what happened. Our total \n     spending on welfare has dropped, and dropped dramatically \n     since we had our welfare reform program.\n\n  Mr. President, what Iowa has been doing is exactly what the Family \nSupport Act hoped States would do. And Senator Harkin very properly \nsaid the program was enacted in October--that was following the \napproval from the Department of Health and Human Services in August. In \nIowa, sixty-three percent of the JOBS funds are federal moneys.\n  Iowa has every reason to be proud of its program. But is Iowa certain \nthat the program will continue when the funds are discontinued? The \nJOBS program is abolished by both the Democratic bill, that we voted on \nearlier last week, and the Republican bill. We are taking something \nthat has worked and decided, no, it has not worked fast enough. Or has \nnot worked far enough? The proposal to undo this is the nearest thing \nto vandalism I can recall in 19 years in the Senate. We will regret it \nand we may return to it. Or we may, as in the case of the \ndeinstitutionalization, forget what we did and wonder what this new, \nominous, inexplicable problem of child poverty is?\n  I say again, a 5-year limit in a situation where 76 percent of the \nrecipients are on AFDC for more than 5 years, will lead to a situation \nout of control, if it is not already. We will not begin to see the \neffects for about 5 years. Five years is a very long time in our \nmemory. I have said over and over again, how quickly we forgot that we \nemptied out our mental institutions and did not build the community \nhealth centers that President Kennedy contemplated.\n  We will forget, perhaps, what we have done, what we did on the Senate \nfloor in this September. And we are doing it in the face of the first \nreally good evidence that the JOBS program is working. The Manpower \nDemonstration Research Corporation, last July, put out a report on the \nprograms it had been following around the country, because we built \nevaluation into our studies. And the overwhelming evidence was that the \nFamily Support Act was working. The most promising results involved a \nstrategy that was tested in Atlanta, Riverside, and Grand Rapids, that \nemphasized rapid job entry. We learned something here.\n  Training? No, no. Get into a job situation, and you will learn the \njob. You will learn on the job if you can learn to get to the job.\n  The number of AFDC recipients dropped by 11 percentage points in \nthose three. Employment rose by 8.1 percentage points. Expenditures \ndropped 22 percentage points, which was exactly what Senator Harkin was \ndescribing. And the MDRC, which is a very careful organization, \nobserved that the 22 percentage point drop in expenditures exceeds the \nsavings achieved by experimentally evaluated programs in the last 15 \nyears. We are finally beginning to understand this problem.\n  What we are dealing with here is the aftermath of an enormous \nincrease in out-of-wedlock births. President George Bush was the first \nPresident to speak of this, and did so in a commencement note of 1992. \nPresident Clinton raised the issue in his State of the Union Address in \n1994. Never before had Presidents touched on this subject. Never before \nhave we debated it. We are doing so now, and as we must.\n  In the current issue of The Economist, Mr. President, a journal not \nnecessarily read widely in the United States but certainly respected, \nthis week's cover story, ``The Disappearing Family,'' talks about the \nAmerican experience, the awful experience. It includes a chart of the \nexperience of this country for which I find myself cited as the source. \nIt is the first time The Economist looked to me for data. Indeed we \nfind that in every country in northern Europe there has been \nextraordinary increase in the ratio of births to unmarried mothers in \nthe last 30 years. A few Western industrialized countries have not seen \nan extraordinary increase. Italy's rise has not been as shocking as \nours, and Switzerland has had a fairly modest increase. Japan's ratio \nwas 1 percent in 1970, and is 1 percent today.\n  This is going to be a major subject of cross-cultural studies in the \nnext century as we find ourselves asking what are the forces that make \nfor the dissolution of the marriage unit in Western society that do not \nsimilarly affect Eastern societies?\n  Just last Friday, as I believe, the Christian Coalition had a large \nconference here in Washington, and a number of Senators spoke. Mr. \nRalph Reed is their director. They heard a stirring comment from Mr. \nAlan Keyes who spoke to them. This was the Christian Coalition's annual \nconference here in Washington. He said:\n\n       And we know the breakdown of the marriage-based, two-parent \n     family is at the root of every problem, crime problem, \n     poverty problem, deteriorating education, even the problem of \n     entitlements, where we have backed away from the family \n     system that ought to take care of the children and the \n     elderly and try to turn that task over to a Government that \n     cannot get it right.\n\n  You know, Mr. Keyes I believe is a candidate for the Republican \nPresidential nomination. He said:\n\n       We are doing it wrong when we back away from the family \n     system, and we have allowed the destruction of the family \n     system because we are defining our freedom in a corrupt and a \n     centrist way that destroys the loyalty and law and sense of \n     obligation that is needed for family life. Now we know it is \n     true, and I have a question for you then. If you know it is \n     true, and you think it is right, then why on Earth would you \n     sit back this time, when it matters more than anything else \n     in this Nation that we put our No. 1 priority and put your \n     seal of approval behind people who put it on the back burner \n     and give it the backseat and only talk about it when they \n     force them to? What is the matter with you?\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The marriage-based family, the No. 1 priority of this \n     Nation's life, nothing is more important, not the budget, not \n     the deficit, not taxes, not the power of the Federal \n     Government over the State government. We will rebuild our \n     families or we will perish, and we know it.\n\n  Well, that is language that is perhaps more in the mode of bearing \nwitness than of giving testimony. But it is a purposely legitimate \nsetting and a purposely legitimate speaker saying something which I \nhappen to think is entirely the case, and I think it is so important \nthat we are talking about it. We used not to talk about it. We could \nnot do it. We did not do it 30 years ago, or 20 years ago. We started \nto talk about it 10 years ago, and now we have reached it. We do not \nknow what to do with very little evidence, no data. Only in the last \nCongress did I get a welfare indicators report established by statute, \nand in 2 years' time we get our first study. The idea is to match the \neconomic report that was created by the Employment Act of 1946. We are \ngetting there. Long before you get good answers, you have to ask good \nquestions. I think we have begun to do that. I take heart from it.\n  I wish that my friend from Iowa would acknowledge that their success \nis success under a statute we passed in 1988, and it is well deserved. \nAnd we might do worse than to build on that success rather than \ndismantle the program. But there you are. That is a decision the Senate \nwill make in good time.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota is on the floor. I understand he \nwishes to speak. In any event, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just for a couple of minutes to respond \nto what the Senator from New York had to say, I would very readily \nadmit that a certain amount of flexibility under the 1988 act gave \nStates the opportunity to change their plan and come to Washington and \nrequest waivers. It gave us an opportunity for the political \nlaboratories of our system of Government, our State legislatures, to \ntry \n\n[[Page S 13160]]\nsomething new and to experiment. Most of those States participating \nhave been very successful. I think my State of Iowa has been the most \nsuccessful.\n  But I think that what we have seen is two phenomenon which dictates \nto me that we ought to move more aggressively toward flexibility to the \nStates. The No. 1 thing is a dramatic increase in the number of people \non welfare, 3.1 million now since the 1988 act went into effect. There \nwas some leeway to States in that act that gave them an opportunity to \nmake it possible for more people to get on welfare. I do not know \nwhether that was intended or not, but it was an end result. So we have \n3.1 million more people on welfare. The second phenomenon is that it is \ncosting more money, and I think at a time when we thought we were \npassing an act that was going to save some money, that tells me, as I \nlook back to my involvement with the 1988 Act, that I failed in making \nthat judgment.\n  In the meantime, we have seen several States move dramatically \nforward, move people from welfare to work, save their taxpayers' money, \nand save the Federal taxpayers some money as well. And in that 7-year \nperiod of time, it has given me, and others of my colleagues, \nencouragement to have more faith in the States to do things even more \ndramatic and dynamic than they have done thus far under waivers.\n  I would suggest that if there is one reason that I wish to be able to \nmove forward based upon the success of the Iowa legislature and their \nplan, it is the fact that, in my judgment, that Iowa would have gone \nmuch, much further in reforming welfare if they did not have to tailor \na program that would meet the requirements of some obscure bureaucrat \nin the Department of HHS in order to get approval. So that is why \nRepublicans have a bill that gives so much more authority to the States \nthan ever before.\n  I will admit, in conclusion, that the stage was set for it by the \n1988 Family Support Act; but it set a stage that tells us now that we \ncan do even more than what we could do under the 1988 act and we ought \nto do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2529\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to call up my amendment No. \n2529.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, that will become the \npending question.\n  The Chair hears no objection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from New York for \nthe opportunity to discuss my amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I offer I call a State flexibility \namendment because it allows States to choose between the Dole AFDC and \njob training block grant and titles I and II of my own welfare reform \nplan, the WAGE Act, the Work and Gainful Employment Act, that I offered \nin May of this year. Titles I and II of the WAGE Act are based on four \nprinciples: First, work; second, protecting children; third, providing \nStates flexibility; and fourth, preserving the family structure.\n  I believe those are the fundamental principles of any serious welfare \nreform effort. My plan provides unprecedented flexibility to States \nwhile providing a safety net for children and an automatic economic \nstabilizer for States.\n  Mr. President, I agree strongly with my colleagues that States should \nbe given great flexibility to design and deliver welfare programs. My \namendment expands this principle by giving States a choice between \nblock grants, the pure block grant approach as contained in the Dole \nproposal, and my totally new approach to welfare that has a combination \nof a block grant and a temporary assistance program that includes an \nautomatic economic stabilizer so that States are not put in a \ncircumstance in which they may not be able to meet the needs of \nchildren in their States due to economic conditions or a natural \ncalamity.\n  Under my amendment, States are given a chance to choose the block \ngrant approach in the Dole bill or the WAGE approach contained in my \nbill for 4 years, after which the State could choose to continue its \nprogram or switch to the other approach. In other words, the amendment \nthat I am offering today expands the choice of individual States. They \ncan choose the Conrad approach that contains a block grant as well as a \ntemporary assistance program or they can choose the pure block grant \napproach of the Dole program.\n  For the past month, my Republican colleagues have engaged in \nextensive and arduous discussions to work out a formula for States with \nhigh rates of population growth. While we may differ with the merits of \nthe formula, the negotiations dealt with the most important issue \nconfronting the Senate as we debate welfare reform, and that is \neconomic uncertainty.\n  None of us in this room can predict the economic future. History has \ntaught us that the business cycle is not predictable, natural disasters \nare not predictable, State growth patterns are not predictable, and \neconomic performance may differ dramatically between the States.\n  Economic uncertainty must be at the forefront of this debate. It is \nprecisely the fact of economic uncertainty that leads millions of \npeople to welfare during times of crisis. Welfare programs, with all \ntheir flaws, provide the safety net that helps families survive plant \nclosings, droughts, floods, layoffs, and other crises.\n  When I set out to develop a welfare reform plan, I told my staff that \nthe word ``entitlement'' was banned from their vocabulary. The word \n``entitlement'' sends all the wrong messages and underscores the \ndevastating problems of our current system.\n  Unfortunately, in the current system, there are no incentives to \nwork. Welfare recipients learn quickly that work does not make them \nbetter off and that not working entitles them to a guaranteed monthly \ncheck. I think that is the reason the taxpayers have no respect for the \nwelfare system as it currently exists. Our current welfare system \nviolates American values of hard work and personal responsibility. We \nmust reform the status quo and create a system that encourages work, \nself-sufficiency, and that strengthens family.\n  I believe my welfare reform plan meets those tests. It does not \nentitle people to a free ride. Instead, it demands responsibility and a \npersonal commitment to become self-sufficient in return for a \ntransitional welfare check.\n  Mr. President, when I go to my State and I talk to the people in \nevery corner of North Dakota, they say to me, ``We're not unwilling to \nhelp somebody that has hit hard times or somebody that is permanently \ndisabled or somebody that for some reason has fallen into a \ncircumstance where they need some help for a time. And we're even \nwilling to help people permanently who are disabled. But, you know, we \nare not willing to be shelling out to pay for somebody who could work \nwho refuses to work. That's not fair.''\n  Mr. President, they are exactly right. Unfortunately, the debate \nbetween entitlements and block grants has missed the fundamental issue \nhighlighted by these intense Republican negotiations over formula, and \nthat is economic uncertainty. I agree that the notion of the no-\nresponsibility entitlement philosophy of welfare needs fundamental \nchange, but the automatic economic stabilization must be retained.\n  States will experience hard times and prosperous times in the coming \nyears. We cannot predict the economic winners and losers. The only \nthing we can predict is that the future will look very different in \n1996, 1997, and 1998 than it looks in 1995.\n  Under the amendment that I am offering today, if States choose my \ntransitional aid and WAGE programs, States will have almost complete \nflexibility to design welfare programs. At the same time, the funding \nmechanism will provide an automatic stabilizer to assure that States \nand regions in economic downturns receive the necessary funds.\n  Under the State flexibility amendment that I am offering today, \nStates would be allowed to choose, first, the Dole block grant, or \nsecond, the Conrad WAGE and transitional aid program. States would \nchoose one approach for 4 years, after which the State could either \nkeep the program they have chosen or switch to the other program.\n  Under either approach, States would receive their proportional share \nof funding, assuming all States were participating in the same program.\n  I would like to briefly describe the specifics of my WAGE and \ntransitional aid program. There really are two elements here: \n\n[[Page S 13161]]\n\n  The WAGE program which is a block grant for job training. The WAGE \nblock grant gives States flexibility to provide job placement and \nsupportive services to move individuals into jobs as quickly as \npossible. The WAGE block grant consolidates funding from five different \ncurrent welfare programs.\n  The JOBS Program, emergency assistance, AFDC child care, transitional \nchild care, and the administrative costs of AFDC.\n  Welfare would become what the American people want it to be, a \ntemporary, employment-based program to move people into the work force. \nThe States are given enormous flexibility under the WAGE block grant \nthat is part of my overall proposal. States have complete flexibility \nto design employment programs. States may provide monetary incentives \nto case managers for successful job placements and retention, as well \nas to outsource job services and to use performance-based contracts. \nStates determine eligibility criteria and participant requirements for \nthe specific work and training programs. States have the option to \nrequire noncustodial parents with child support arrears to participate \nin WAGE. States can establish time limits of any duration that require \nindividuals to work as a condition for benefits.\n  However, a State may not terminate participants from WAGE if the \nparticipants have played by the rules and complied with the \nrequirements set forth in the WAGE plan.\n  States have the ability under the WAGE approach that I have \nintroduced today to make the decisions on what the welfare reform \nprogram will be. We have heard the outcry that States ought to make \nthese decisions. My approach allows States to make them within a \ncertain broad framework. Self-sufficiency is the goal of my welfare \nreform plan. I am not interested in kicking kids into the streets with \nno support. If a parent is making a good-faith effort to get off \nwelfare, as required by the State--and the State determines what is a \ngood-faith effort, not the Federal Government--this parent should be \nencouraged to continue to strive for self-sufficiency.\n  States are given complete flexibility to determine the sanctions \nimposed on individuals who fail to comply with the State's program \nrequirements. Again, it is not the Federal Government deciding, it is \nthe States deciding. If a sanction results in the complete elimination \nof aid to a family, States must take measures to ensure the well-being \nof the children.\n  Mr. President, obviously there are certain requirements that are \nexpected of the States. At the very minimum, States are required to \nadminister a WAGE Program that promotes moving parents into private-\nsector employment. States must develop a wage employability plan with \nthe recipient that indicates the requirements necessary to move off of \nwelfare.\n  There is a personal contract that is entered into between the person \nseeking temporary assistance and the State. They line out a contract of \nwhat the recipient is going to do in return for what they receive.\n  The States must ensure that children are protected by making certain \nthat the child care is available for WAGE participants. The funding \nmechanism is very simple. The WAGE block grant is a cap entitlement to \nStates based on historical funding for emergency assistance, AFDC child \ncare, transitional child care, and the administrative costs of AFDC. \nThe WAGE block grant includes additional funding each year to put \npeople to work and to ensure that child care is available. The WAGE \nblock grant grows 3 percent a year. States receive incentive payments \nfor moving individuals off welfare and into employment, as well as for \nimprovements in the number of individuals combining work and welfare.\n  Mr. President, my plan is serious about work. Work rates in the WAGE \nProgram are phased in, reaching 55 percent in fiscal year 2000. That is \nthe highest participation rate of any welfare reform program that is \nbefore this body. States focus specifically on getting people into work \nwith work preparation activities with a minimum of 20 hours a week. If \nthe State decides they want to require more than that, that is their \ndecision. Half of the participation rate must be met by individuals who \nare working. After 2 years individuals must be working in order to meet \nState participation rate requirements.\n  In addition to the block grant approach that replaces current jobs \nprograms, we also have eliminated AFDC and, in its place, created a \ntransitional aid program. The transitional aid program maintains a \nbasic safety net for America's children and provides an automatic \nstabilizer for States. This is where my plan differs fundamentally from \nthe Dole plan that is before us, because the Dole plan contains only a \nblock grant approach. My plan contains a block grant approach for the \njobs programs, but has in the temporary assistance program, which \nreplaces AFDC, a continuation of the automatic stabilizer. Because, \nagain, Mr. President, none of us can predict what the future holds.\n  If there are floods in Mississippi or a drought in North Dakota, or \nsome kind of economic calamity in the State of Vermont, we do not think \nit makes sense just to have a flat amount of money going out there to \ndeal with any kind of emergency. It does not make sense.\n  We ought to continue the automatic stabilizer that allows this \ncountry to function as the United States of America, not just as 50 \nseparate States. Let the 50 individual States experiment with any kind \nof welfare program they want to create, yes, absolutely. We ought to \nhave 50 States operating in that way. But, Mr. President, if there is \nan economic calamity, then this country ought to stand as one, all of \nthe States standing together to help a sister State that may have \nexperienced some incredible economic calamity or natural disaster. That \nis the strength of America. That is not something that ought to be \nabandoned.\n  The transitional aid program, as I have indicated, maintains that \nbasic safety net for America's children. And for the States as well.\n  My plan fundamentally reforms welfare. It eliminates the Federal \nbureaucracy and overregulation that hampers State efforts to develop \ntheir own innovative welfare programs. The transitional aid program \nreduces the State plan to 14 elements, compared to the 45 in the \ncurrent AFDC State plan. Instead of Federally mandated policies, States \nhave the option to determine eligibility criteria, support and benefit \nlevels and the form of those benefits, the treatment of earned and \nunearned income, the extent to which child support is disregarded when \ndetermining eligibility and benefits, the treatment of children's \nearnings, resource limits, restrictions imposed on eligibility for \nassistance for two-parent families.\n  And States have the ability to determine the requirements on \nrecipients whether it be work, school attendance, or whatever. States \nhave the ability to determine sanctions for individuals who fail to \ncomply with State requirements. States determine the payment or denial \nof benefits to children born to individuals receiving assistance. And \nStates decide the timeframes for achieving self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, for those on the other side of the aisle who say, \n``States ought to be the laboratory of experimentation in this \ncountry,'' I say, amen. Absolutely. Let us let the States experiment. \nLet us let all of the States have a chance to determine a welfare \nreform approach and see how it works. As the Senator from New York has \nsaid repeatedly, the only thing we can be certain about is that we do \nnot know much about what works and what does not work. So let us give \nthe States an opportunity to experiment. Let us let them have a chance \nto figure out what works and what does not work.\n  But, Mr. President, while we are doing that, while we are engaging in \nthis great experiment, let us maintain the automatic stabilizer, let us \nmaintain the underlying financing of a system that permits the United \nStates to function as one country, that says if Iowa, for some reason, \ngets in special difficulty, that we are not going to just leave the \nchildren of Iowa out there on their own, that the other States of this \nUnion will come together and help that State.\n  That makes sense, Mr. President.\n  My plan, with respect to temporary assistance, requires that a family \nmeet the following criteria to be eligible for the transitional aid \nprogram: They must have a needy child that is defined \n\n[[Page S 13162]]\nby the State; they must comply with the WAGE employability plan; and \nthey must cooperate and comply with paternity and child support \nmeasures.\n  While I have indicated that States have substantial flexibility in \nthe design of their transitional aid program, there are minimal Federal \nrequirements: They must serve all families with needy children \nuniformly--uniformly--as defined by the State; they must operate a WAGE \nProgram; they must operate a child support enforcement program; they \nmust maintain categorical Medicaid eligibility for the transitional \nassistance program and provide transitional Medicaid for at least 1 \nyear. It could be longer at State option. And they must maintain \nassistance in some form to needy children and families in which the \nparent is complying fully with all WAGE and other requirements.\n  The State designs the program. The State decides what it is, but if \npeople are complying with that program, people cannot be kicked off for \nsome other reason.\n  Mr. President, under my plan, welfare remains a Federal-State \npartnership. States draw down Federal funds for the transitional aid \nprogram using the Medicaid matched rate. My plan gives States extensive \nflexibility to design these programs and to invest State funds toward \nthese efforts. The Federal Government continues to finance the majority \nof program costs.\n  In conclusion, my amendment allows States a choice. States can choose \nbetween the Dole approach and my approach, a new welfare program that \ncombines the flexibility of block grants with an automatic stabilizer \nfunding mechanism to respond to economic uncertainty.\n  Since day one, the welfare debate has focused on devolution, how much \nauthority should be turned over to the States. Every plan of either \nparty expands State authority and lessens Federal oversight, and that \nis appropriate.\n  There are many State officials, however, that have expressed grave \nconcern about ending the current funding mechanism and completely block \ngranting welfare. The Dole plan will create 50 different safety nets \nacross the country, some of which will hold strong and some of which \nwill tear and dissolve when the vagaries of the market create economic \ndownturns or in the face of a natural disaster. If States do not want \nto take this chance, we should allow them to choose the alternative \napproach I have presented in my amendment.\n  Mr. President, Americans are rightfully demanding welfare reform that \nfocuses on work, personal responsibility, and accountability. My \namendment focuses on the public's demands. It emphasizes work, it \nprotects kids, it gives the States enormous flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is the right mix of allowing States the \nright to determine what welfare reform ought to look like while at the \nsame time continuing the automatic stabilizer that has proved such an \nimportant part of our ability to function as the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I ask support for this amendment to expand States' abilities to \ndevelop welfare programs to move parents toward self-sufficiency while \nprotecting children.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have had a chance to sit with my \nfriend from North Dakota as a member of the Senate Finance Committee \nwhere all this legislation on welfare reform comes from. I sense in him \na true desire to work out compromises and solve some problems that he \nbelieves will result if we give too much leeway to the States.\n  I presume his legislation, where he gives the States a choice of \ncontinuing with a Federal program or adopting their own, is the \nultimate of discretion. I do not know who can find any fault with that \ndiscretion; however, there are goals that we have on this side of the \naisle other than just choice and discretion to the States.\n  One of those is the fact that we have a terribly bad budget problem \nfrom 30 years of irresponsible spending. Some of that irresponsible \nspending--not all of it, but some of it--is directly related to the \nfact that we have programs that we call entitlements. That means \nbasically that whatever is going to be spent, if you qualify, it will \nbe spent and there is not much congressional control over the amount of \nmoney to be spent.\n  So his program would continue that entitlement. The Republican bill \nwould end the entitlement aspect.\n  Also, we on this side of the aisle with our bill save $70 billion. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has put a cost on the Conrad amendment \nof $6.99 billion over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question or a point on that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The amendment that I am offering as an amendment to the \nDole welfare reform plan would reduce the savings by $7 billion. So is \nit not correct to say that the total package would still achieve $63 \nbillion of savings over the next 7 years? In other words, I do not \nthink it is correct to compare a $70 billion savings under the Dole \nbill to a $7 billion cost under my plan.\n  The correct comparison is a $70 billion savings over 7 years under \nthe Dole plan, $63 billion of savings under the Conrad plan.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am reading from the CBO estimate which says that your \nbill will cost $7 billion over 7 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is absolutely correct, if I might say, the \ndocument from CBO--which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF AMENDMENT PROVIDING STATE FLEXIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TAP OR WAGE PROGRAMS (CONRAD), ESTIMATED RELATIVE TO S. 1120, THE \n

Block Grant as described in Title\n  1 of S. 1120 of the Work and Gainful Employment Act (WAGE) Program described in this amendment. The WAGE program would maintain AFDC benefits as an   \n  entitlement, but grant states new flexibility to design their programs. A new capped entitlement block grant would be created which would combine AFDC\n  administrative costs, Emergency Assistance, AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care. The block grant would require no state match and would grow  \n  at 3% a year. Additional funds would be added to the block grant that are equal to 1995 federal JOBS spending and that would grow at a fixed amount   \n  equal to $200 million in 1996, rising to $2,200 million in 2002. CBO assumes that two thirds of sales would opt to participate in the block grant     \n  program established under S. 1120 and one-third would opt to participate in the Wage program established by this amendment.                           \nThis estimate does not include AFDC benefit savings associated with provisions limiting eligibility of non-citizens to benefits. If these savings were  \n  included, the cost of the amendment would be reduced.                                                                                                 \nThe estimate assumes that technical changes would be made in the amendment to ensure cost neutrality with an effective date later than 10/1/96. If      \n  technical changes were made to include At-Risk Child Care spending in the base amount of the WAGE Block Grant, the cost of this amendment would       \n  increase by $300 million per year for each year 1996-2002.                                                                                            \n\n\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that document makes clear that my \namendment would reduce the $70 billion of savings by $7 billion over 7 \nyears to still achieve $63 billion of savings, but to give the States \nthis added flexibility, which I think is critical.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while we are waiting to get that \ndeciphered, I want to go on to another point that I wanted to make \nabout the bill that is before us.\n  The Senator from North Dakota speaks about 55 percent of the people \nwho would have to be working. That 55 percent seems higher than the 50 \npercent in the Republican plan, but it depends upon what group you talk \nabout.\n  On the Republican plan, our goal and requirement is that 50 percent \nof everybody on welfare, the category of everybody on welfare, would \nhave to be working.\n  In the bill of the Senator from North Dakota, he would have these \ncategories of people exempted from the 55 percent rule: Parents of \nchildren under 12 weeks of age or, at the State's option, up to 1 year; \nindividuals who are ill or incapacitated, as defined by the States; \nindividuals needed in the home on a full-time basis to care for a \ndisabled child or other household members; individuals over 60 years of \nage; individuals under age 16, other than teenage parents. I am not \ngoing to argue about the Senator's rationale for exempting certain \npopulations.\n  So his goal is 55 percent of a group that has several exemptions in \nit as required to work. Whereas, in our bill, we have 50 percent of a \nwhole, without exemption.\n  So for those reasons--the fact that it does not save as much money as \nour proposal saves, and the fact that it does not have as high a goal \nof people to work by the year 2000--we feel that this bill, even though \nit does give an option to the States of whether to choose the Federal \nentitlement or a program defined by the individual State, does not go \nfar enough in eliminating a major problem with the welfare system of \nthe last 40 or 50 years. That problem is the Federal entitlement. It \nseems to me the maintenance of a Federal entitlement is a litmus test \nof whether or not we are going to have business in welfare reform or \nwhether or not we are going to have a completely new approach.\n  The plan offered by Senator Dole is a completely new approach--no \nlonger a Federal entitlement, no longer an environment in which there \nwill be an encouragement for dependency; but instead a requirement \nwhere we are going to move more people from welfare to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say, with respect to the \nRepublican plan, it is true that they have 50 percent of the total, but \nthat total is a different total than the total I am talking about, \nbecause they take 15 percent of the caseload right off the top. They \nhave 15 percent that are exempted right off the top. It is impossible \nto know whether the categories that we have exempted--that is, a mother \nwith a child under 12 weeks, we think it is appropriate that the mother \nstay home with the child. If somebody is sick and disabled and cannot \nwork, it is appropriate that they not be expected to work. They come at \nit a little different way. They take 15 percent off the top and say the \nprovisions do not apply to them. We come at it by specifically \ncategorizing those people who should not be expected to be part of the \nwork force.\n  Mr. President, there is a larger issue of work here, as well, and \nthat is, what is the fundamental complaint about welfare? The \nfundamental complaint is that we are not moving people to work. The \nRepublican plan is sadly deficient with respect to that issue. \nAccording to the testimony we had by the Congressional Budget Office, \nin 44 of the 50 States, there will not be a work requirement because \nthere is not sufficient funding for child care to get the people to \nwork, and that 44 of the 50 States would be better off taking a 5-\npercent penalty than to have a work requirement. So if we want to talk \nabout a work requirement, let us be honest about it.\n  The work requirement in the Republican plan is a hoax. It says it is \ntough on work, but they do not provide the funds necessary for people \nto actually go to work, because they do not have the child care. So \npeople are not going to be going to work. And States will not have the \nwork requirement because they are better off; rather than providing the \nchild care necessary to get people to work, they will take the 5-\npercent penalty. That is CBO's analysis, not mine. CBO said that 44 of \nthe 50 States will not have a work requirement under the Republican \nplan.\n  Mr. President, the proposal I am offering says we want to devolve \npower to the States. We want to give States the ability to experiment. \nWe want to have a chance to have 50 different States have 50 different \nprograms, and let us see what works. Absolutely, I am all for it. Sign \nme up. That is what my amendment does.\n  But my amendment also says there ought to be the economic stabilizer. \nI do not know if it has become an ideological question that you \neliminate the role for the Federal Government just because it feels \ngood--because rhetorically it feels good. I do not get it. Are we \nsaying that if California has massive earthquakes, tough luck? Are we \nsaying if North Dakota has a devastating drought, tough luck? Are we \nsaying if Mississippi has massive flooding, tough luck, the United \nStates is not in on the deal? I thought this was the United States of \nAmerica. I thought this was a Union. That is the America I know.\n  So there is this idea that we are going to cut States adrift and they \ncan do whatever. Here is the money and good luck, I hope things work \nout. But if you have a disaster--a natural disaster or an economic \ncalamity--and kids get put on the street, tough luck. I do not think \nmuch of that plan.\n  I was in California and I saw a young woman on the street with two \nlittle kids--a middle-class woman, begging. I went up to her and I \nsaid, ``How did you get on the streets of San Francisco begging with \nthese two little kids?'' I tell you, if you would have seen that woman, \nyou would have seen a person that looks like she just came from the \nshopping center, grocery shopping with her two little kids. She was an \nattractive woman, nicely dressed, and the kids were nicely dressed. \nThey were out on the streets begging. Why? Because her husband had \ntaken a hike and her house had gotten foreclosed, and she was homeless \nwith two little kids. Well, some of us believe that is not a \ncircumstance that should be tolerated in America. That woman and those \nlittle kids ought to have a place to go.\n  The Republican plan says we are so locked into ideology, the Federal \nGovernment should not have a role in anything, and we are willing to \ntake that chance. Well, I am not willing to take that chance. I think \nif some State suffers a disaster, the United States of America ought to \nstand together and protect the kids--at least the kids. That is the \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, this is dramatic welfare reform that is being proposed \nin my amendment--dramatic. It is not the Federal Government deciding \nthese programs; it is the States deciding. But if we get to the \ncircumstance where there is a disaster and the State cannot meet the \nneeds of the kids, then I think we live in a United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n                           Amendment No. 2560\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending question \nis amendment 2560, and the time until 5 o'clock will be equally \ndivided.\n\n[[Page S 13164]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  The struggle for decent child care is a daily fact of life that all \nworking families understand, regardless of their income.\n  Some in Congress may want to ignore these realities, but a mother \nwith young children who wants to work or go to school does not have \nthat luxury.\n  Today and every day, millions of American families face impossible \nand heart-wrenching choices--between the jobs they need and the \nchildren they love--between putting food on the table and finding safe \nand affordable care for their children.\n  We have heard a lot about turning welfare into work--but precious \nlittle about who will care for the nearly 10 million children on AFDC \nwhile their parents meet the mandate to pursue job training or go to \nwork. If we are serious about promoting work and strengthening families \ninstead of punishing them, we must deal responsibly with the issue of \nchild care.\n  Today--at long last--is our chance to do this long overdue reality \ncheck on the pending Republican welfare reform proposal.\n  Quality child care creates opportunity and increases productivity--\nnot just for one generation, but for two. Child care is not about \ngiving parents a blank check. It is about giving them a fair chance. \nFailing to make child care a centerpiece of welfare reform makes a \nmockery of any such reform. It will only pass the real life tragedy of \ndependency from one generation to the next.\n  Today, 21 million low-income children are eligible for Federal child \ncare programs. Yet less than 7 percent of these children currently \nreceive this essential support. Clearly more--not less--needs to be \ndone.\n  But too many of our Republican colleagues seem content with simply \nslashing benefits, and will do so at any cost. If that is the plan--the \nDole program fits the bill. But those who seek truly to promote work \nand strengthen families understand the need to remove real world \nbarriers to self-sufficiency.\n  For many, even most, the greatest barrier to self-sufficiency is lack \nof child care. The Census Bureau found that 1 of 3 poor women not in \nthe labor force identified child care as their greatest barrier to \nparticipation. One in five part-time workers said that they would work \nlonger hours--if child care was available and affordable.\n  A GAO study of participants in 61 welfare-to-work programs in 38 \nStates found that more than 60 percent of respondents reported that a \nlack of child care was their number one barrier to participation in the \nwork force.\n  The National Research Council recently documented that mothers with \nsafe and adequate child care arrangements were more than twice as \nlikely to successfully complete a job training program.\n  The link between child care and self-sufficiency is well documented \nin report after report after report. The real question is--will the \nSenate act based on this mounting evidence.\n  We know that 60 percent of AFDC families have at least one preschool \nchild. It is simple common sense that they would need child care \nassistance to enroll in job search, community service, or workfare \nactivities. But while there have been loud calls for cutting benefits \nand ending welfare, there has been a deafening silence on the need for \nchild care. It is time to break the silence and put together a \nrealistic program--a program not based on rhetoric but on reality and \nresults.\n  But when it comes to child care, the ever-evolving Dole bill \ncontinues to be fatally flawed. While we have now seen three \nmodifications--one essential fact remains the same. The Dole bill does \nnot dedicate a single dime to providing child care services to families \non welfare. Behind Dole No. 1, Dole No. 2, and Dole No. 3--one reality \nremains clear--the primary goal is to reduce spending and not increase \nopportunity.\n  The Republicans may choose to call their bill the Work Opportunity \nAct--but this noble claim is nothing more than a hollow promise when \nyou look at the fine print. Simply put, their numbers just do not add \nup. They know it and CBO has confirmed it. This bill is not welfare \nreform--it is welfare fraud.\n  Let us consider the facts.\n  As we prepare to move millions of American families into job search \nand workfare programs--the Dole bill repeals the child care programs \ntargeted to these families.\n  That is outrageous. That is irresponsible. That is not a joke--it is \na fraud. I ask--who will care for these children?\n  In 1988, by a vote of 96 to 1, the Senate passed and President Reagan \nsigned into law a guarantee that child care would be provided to each \nand every AFDC family pursuing job training or education or \nparticipating in workfare programs to enable them to develop the skills \nnecessary to secure private sector jobs.\n  That was not a radical idea then, and it should not be now. This is \nsound and sensible policy--adopted with strong bipartisan support. This \npolicy appropriately acknowledged the critical link between child care \nand work. But in the Republican plan, this guarantee and the resources \nto make it real are gone, wiped out, taking with them the hopes and \ndreams of poor children and families in every State.\n  Some may say that these funds are not eliminated--just given to the \nGovernors with greater flexibility to spend them as they see fit. I \nonly wish it was that simple.\n  The Dole bill takes the funds for safety net benefits, job training, \nand child care--folds them into a single block grant--and freezes \nspending at the 1994 level through the turn of the century. As States \nfeel the crunch of this dwindling Federal support, who will care for \nthe children?\n  If you want to imagine the predicament the Republicans are putting \nthe Governors in, just think about a family budget. Take the average \nfamily's annual budget--include food, rent, child care, and work \nexpenses. Cut it back to what they spent last year. Tell them they get \nno increases for the next 5 years--regardless of inflation, sickness, \nfire, or other unforeseen disasters. Undoubtedly they will run into \nserious financial trouble.\n  That is exactly what is going to happen in State after State after \nState. Children and families are going to pay the price--and in the \nlong run, so will the Nation.\n  The Dole bill professes to increase work participation rates by 131 \npercent over the next 5 years. That is an admirable goal, but who will \nbe taking care of the children?\n  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that States \nwill have to spend $11 billion more over the next 5 years on child care \nto make this happen. Senator Dole's plan budgets $12 billion less in \nreal dollars.\n  All of us are for work--but this will not work. That is why some have \ncalled this plan the ``mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  In Massachusetts alone, to meet the work requirement in the Dole \nbill, the State must increase participation from 10,000 to nearly \n30,000 in 5 years. This means funding tens of thousands of new child \ncare slots at a cost to the State of nearly $89 million in the year \n2000 alone. The State is already falling behind as 4,000 families wait \nfor the child care they need--without help from the Federal Government. \nWho will care for these children?\n  Forty-four States are projected to simply throw up their hands and \nignore the work requirements in the Dole bill, according to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CBO believes States would \nrather accept the sanctions for failing to comply, than try to reach \nthe goals without the resources needed to make it possible.\n  States are far better able to afford the 5-percent grant reduction \nthan a 165-percent increase in child care needed to make the program \nwork. Only a handful of States may even bother to comply with the work \nrequirement. That does not sound like progress to me. It sounds like \ntough talk and no action. It may provide the savings needed for a tax \ncut for wealthy individuals and corporations--but it certainly will not \nchange the welfare system. It may reduce the welfare rolls, but it will \nnot increase the future prospects of millions of American children and \ntheir families.\n  In fact, it is more likely to produce homelessness than opportunity. \nIt is more likely to leave children home alone than in quality child \ncare programs that can give them a decent head start in life. Is that \nthe direction we want to go? I do not think so and I hope my colleagues \ndo not think so.\n\n[[Page S 13165]]\n\n  Now let us review the ways that the various Dole plans have sought to \nfill this child care gap.\n  First, the Dole bill and each of its modifications includes the child \ncare and development block grant unanimously reported by the Labor \nCommittee. But this grant program was created to provide child care \nservices to low-income working families to help make ends meet. Low-\nincome families spend nearly one-third of their income on child care \nand they are too often only one pay check away from falling onto \nwelfare.\n  Low-income working families need this help too--and we must do a \nbetter job of making work pay. The average cost of a child in child \ncare is almost $5,000 a year--yet the take home pay from a minimum wage \njob is stuck at $8,500 a year. This is not manageable and it is not \nacceptable.\n  States already have long waiting list of working families who are \ndesperate for this assistance. For example, California has 255,000 on \nits waiting list, Texas has 36,000, Illinois has 20,000, New Jersey has \n25,000, and Minnesota has 7,000, just to name a few. In many States, \nyoung children will graduate high school before their names reach the \ntop of the child care waiting list.\n  If the resources provided for this program are diverted to filling \nthe child care void for welfare families created by the Dole bill, it \nwill surely jeopardize the livelihoods of the 750,000 working families \nwho currently depend on this assistance.\n  Such an approach is callous and counterproductive. In Massachusetts, \nof mothers who left welfare for work and then returned to welfare, 35 \npercent cited child care problems as the reason. Additional support at \nthis critical time could have made all the difference. But the Dole \nbill will pull the rug out from under these families, just as they are \ngetting on their feet.\n  And despite the clear reality that this program was created for low-\nincome working families, and that it falls far short of being able to \nmeet the rapidly growing need for child care services for welfare \nfamilies, the Dole bill allows governors to transfer 30 percent of \nthese essential resources to other purposes.\n  At every turn, the Dole bill chips away at child care for poor \nfamilies struggling to make a better life for themselves and their \nchildren. This simply adds insult to injury and makes a bad situation \nworse. I ask again, who will care for the children?\n  For all of these reasons, the original Dole bill was rightly called \nHome Alone. It freed parents to work, but did nothing about child care. \nIt left children home alone. In the end, it would wind up forcing more \nfamilies onto welfare than we help get off welfare. That's certainly \nnot reform.\n  And then came the sequels.\n  Home Alone II--or as I call it--Home Alone by 2--sought to address \nthe need for child care by exempting mothers with babies under the age \nof one from the work requirement.\n  But once you reached the age of one they said, you're old enough to \ncare for yourself. You do not need child care. You are on your own. \nThis may have been welcome news to the 10 percent of families on \nwelfare with a child under the age of one. But it was a continuing \nnightmare for the mothers of preschoolers and school-aged children who \nhad to face the choice of leaving their children home alone or losing \ntheir benefits and livelihood.\n  Home alone is not a joke or a Hollywood film. It is a real life \ntragedy for American families pressed to the wall. Just listen to the \nhorror stories from families who have been put in this awful position--\nand have paid an unbelievable price.\n  Think about 6-year-old Jermaine James of Fairfax County and his 6-\nyear-old friend Amanda, who were being cared for by his 8-year-old \nsister Tina. When a fire broke out in their apartment, Tina ran for \nhelp, inadvertently locking the younger children in the burning \napartment. They died before the fire department could get to them. \nSandra James and her husband needed two jobs to support their family \nand still could not afford child care. They tied to stagger their \nschedules but did not always succeed.\n  Think about 7-month-old Craig Pinner of San Francisco who drowned in \nthe bathtub while his 9-year-old brother was trying to bathe him. His \nmother was working part time and participating in job training. She \nusually left the child with her family, but her car had broken down and \nshe was no longer able to get them there. She was trying to find \naffordable child care but was unsuccessful.\n  Think about 4-year-old Anthony and 5-year-old Maurice Grant of Dade \nCounty. While home alone they climbed into the clothes dryer to look at \na magazine in a hiding place, pulled the door closed, and tumbled and \nburned to death. Their mother was waiting for child care assistance and \ngenerally left the children with neighbors. But sometimes these \narrangements fell through and she had to leave them home alone for just \na few hours.\n  This did not happen in Hollywood--but in Virginia and Florida and \nCalifornia and elsewhere. We must do everything in our power to avoid \nputting families in this kind of a situation in the name of reform.\n  The most recent Dole modification prevents families with children \nunder 5 from being sanctioned for not participating in the work program \nif they can not find child care. But 66 percent of families on welfare \nhave a preschool child.\n  I believe our top priority and our primary strategy should be to \nassist families in securing the child care they need to enable them to \nwork and achieve self-sufficiency. Is that not what real reform is all \nabout?\n  Exemptions and other protections should be our fall-back plan and not \nour national policy. If we are serious about promoting work and \nprotecting children, we need to find the money to provide the child \ncare that is needed. Home alone should not become stay at home under \nthe present system.\n  As States face the difficult task of trying to move millions of \npeople from welfare to work, we should not only give them additional \nflexibility but the tools they need to get the job done. We should help \nStates push for real change--not just in the ledger books but in the \nreal lives of their citizens who depend on them. If States are forced \nto do more with less, children will pay the price. That is not fair and \nit is not smart.\n  Investments in children pay off--not just in their lives--but for \nsociety as a whole. That is why the business community has been so \noutspoken about the importance of early childhood development programs. \nThey know that the work force of tomorrow is being cared for--or not--\ntoday. Children deserve more than custodial care. They need structure \nand positive individual attention. Above all, they need a sale place to \nlearn and grow.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Dodd, Moseley-Braun, Mikulski, Murray, \nKohl, Kerrey, Jeffords, and others in offering this important child \ncare amendment. Its purpose is simple and straightforward--it seeks to \nprovide the child care assistance necessary to make the Dole bill work. \nIt is not an attempt to change the intent of the bill, but to put \nresources behind the rhetoric to ensure real results.\n  The amendment is not about building bureaucracy or creating new \nentitlements. It is about providing States with the funding they need \nto meet, rather than ignore, the Dole bill's work requirements. It \nensures children will be cared for in safe and appropriate child care \nsettings. And it continues much-needed support for working families, \nrather than pitting them against families seeking self-sufficiency. It \nis a realistic pro-work and pro-family proposal.\n  We are in a budgetary era where we have to make some very difficult \nchoices. But if we avoid these choices, we are not representing the \nreal needs of the American people. We are taking care of the special \ninterests of corporate America, and removing these special interests \nfrom the debate. Well, it is high time to make them a part of the \ndebate, and take advantage of the billions of dollars in misguided tax \nexpenditures that are provided to large corporations across the \ncountry.\n  We have spent enormous amounts of time debating the need for a \nbalanced budget, and all of its ramifications on domestic spending--yet \nwe have refused to take a long, hard look at tax expenditures and \nloopholes, which work against the goal of a balanced budget on a \ntrillion dollar scale.\n  We at least owe it to the American people to close these loopholes \nthat are truly egregious. Corporate America \n\n[[Page S 13166]]\nand wealthy Americans with expensive tax lawyers have learned to \nnavigate through them, but they do not represent good policy. They take \naway jobs for working families and those who want to work. And we can \nuse those dollars to provide desperately needed child care.\n  At the present time, tax expenditures are not even reviewed on an \nannual basis.\n  When a tax loophole is approved, it is placed on the books and \nremains there unchallenged. It is no wonder that loopholes continue to \ngrow and expand the budget deficit.\n  Over the next 7 years, these tax expenditures will eat up $4.5 \ntrillion--$4.5 trillion. Many of these tax expenditures are necessary \nto spur investment in particular industries and goals, whether it is \nhigh technology, exporting, manufacturing, or achieving the American \ndream of buying a home.\n  The global economy within which we are now competing demands that we \nprovide necessary tax incentives for investment in this country that \nwill create new jobs for working families.\n  But it is time to take a closer look at corporate tax breaks. Often \nonly the wealthiest can take advantage of them.\n  Primary examples of the tax expenditures that should be reviewed and \nthoroughly overhauled are the loopholes that United States and foreign-\nowned multinational corporations now use to minimize their U.S. taxes.\n  Companies are now taxed on their U.S.-generated income. They have a \nsignificant incentive to minimize the calculation of their U.S. income, \nand therefore their U.S. taxation--called transfer pricing. They shift \nincome away from the United States and shift deductible expenses into \nthe United States for tax purposes.\n  As this chart shows, the General Accounting Office has reported that, \nin 1991, 73 percent of foreign-based corporations doing business in the \nUnited States paid no Federal income taxes. And more than 60 percent of \nU.S.-based companies paid no U.S. income taxes. The number of large \nnontaxpaying firms has doubled in recent years.\n  IBM, for example, was fortunate enough to accumulate $25 billion in \nU.S. sales in 1987. That same year, its 1987 annual report stated that \none-third of its worldwide profits were earned by its U.S. operations. \nClearly, its U.S. operations were appeared profitable and successful. \nYet, its tax return reported almost no U.S. earnings.\n  Multinational corporations should pay their fair share of taxes. They \nshould be required to pay taxes on their U.S. share of worldwide sales, \nassets, and payroll.\n  This is not a new problem. To the contrary, we have been trying to \nclose these types of loopholes for almost 20 years. We knew then, as we \nknow now, that it was a loophole that necessitated action. The only \ndifference now is that it is a much bigger problem, much more \npervasive, and much more costly to the Federal Treasury.\n  Our current tax laws have the unacceptable consequence of allowing \nmultinational corporations to lurk in foreign tax havens, hide behind \nforeign subsidiaries and corporate shells, suck income and profits out \nof the United States, and then thumbing their noses at Federal tax \nofficials and State tax commissioners in every State.\n  Multinational corporations can also take advantage of the so-called \ntitle passage rule; $3.5 billion per year is lost because large \nmultinational corporations sell U.S. goods abroad and avoid all U.S. \ntaxes through some sleight of hand while the goods are on the high seas \nduring the export process.\n  We have known about this serious loophole for some time. In fact, \nthis loophole was closed by both the House and the Senate during \ndeliberations on the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But for some reason it was \ndropped in conference.\n  As an example, a U.S. company makes a sale and ships the products \nfrom a U.S. port to a foreign country. Under normal circumstances, the \nshipment would generate the payment of taxes to the United States. But \nunder a special rule, that company passes title to the products on the \nhigh seas, and avoids all Federal taxes. On top of that, the company \npays taxes on the products in the country to which they are being \nexported, and uses those taxes to claim tax credits against other U.S. \ntaxes it may owe. It is a lose-lose proposition all the way around for \nthe United States.\n  This provision applies only to multinational companies. It is of no \nuse to domestic, smaller companies.\n  Some will suggest that closing such loopholes will hurt exports and \nprevent the expansion of our markets to create new jobs for the \neconomy. But these are unnecessary loopholes that were never meant to \nbe used in these ways. When these provisions originally became law, \nCongress had no idea of the loopholes being created.\n  Additional tax breaks for multinational corporations are available by \nsetting up corporations that exist only on paper. They are called \nforeign sales corporations, and provide exporters with the opportunity \nto exempt 30 percent of their export income from U.S. taxation.\n  Many other similar loopholes exist, such as tax credits provided to \nU.S. companies for payments made to foreign countries, or tax deferrals \nfor U.S. companies on income of foreign operations that is not \nrepatriated to this country.\n  These tax breaks cost the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars each \nyear.\n  And, of course, there are other types of corporate welfare:\n  The peanut program and other agricultural subsidies provide billions \nof dollars to large corporations, although the family farmer was the \nintended recipient. Senator Santorum has filed legislation to phase out \nthe peanut program.\n  The excessive mining subsidies provided through an 1872 law have \nnever been changed. Senator Bumpers was on the floor last week \ndiscussing the fact that the Secretary of the Interior was forced to \nsell 110 acres of Federal land to a large corporation for $275--$2.50 \nan acre. Yet the land has more than $1 billion in mineral value.\n  The House Republicans capital gains tax cut now will add $31 billion \nto the already existing $57 billion capital gains subsidy that now \nexists.\n  The repeal of the alternative minimum tax will cost the U.S. Treasury \nalmost $17 billion, and enable many wealthy corporations to reduce \ntheir taxes to zero by playing the loophole game.\n  The accelerated depreciation loophole was partially closed in 1986 \nand 1993, but still generates more than $100 billion in tax subsidies.\n  The billionaires' tax loophole allows super-wealthy individuals to \nrenounce their U.S. citizenship and avoid U.S. taxes.\n  The bill before us seeks to balance the budget on the backs of poor \nchildren. Over the next 5 years, the Dole bill cuts $50 billion for \nprograms and services targeted to children and families in the toughest \nof circumstances. Current spending on AFDC benefits and job training \nand child care for families on welfare represents less than 1.5 percent \nof the Federal budget. It is true that we need to reduce the deficit--\nbut the pain should be more evenly distributed.\n  We need to make difficult choices to balance the budget. But when we \nare choosing between children and the wealthy individuals and \ncorporations that have shrewd tax attorneys, the choice is clear. \nChildren should prevail. Welfare reform should include reform of \ncorporate welfare too.\n  The futures of 10 million children are in our hands--and Congress \nshould not leave them home alone under welfare reform, when reform of \ncorporate welfare can provide the resources necessary to do the right \nthing on child care.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good opportunity, I think, in the past \nfew days to address the issue on welfare reform. Quite obviously, there \nis a very strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to move \nlegislation that is going on to enhance employment and employment \npossibility and diminish welfare dependency for the citizens. No one \nreally wants that more than those that are participating in that \nprocess and system.\n  We have also begun, really, the debate on a key element about how \neffective we can be, and that is the debate that we talked about \nbriefly during the time when this issue was called up last week; more \nprecisely, on Friday last, when Senator Dodd introduced the amendment, \nwhich I welcomed the opportunity to cosponsor, which is before the \nSenate at this time.\n  It is entirely appropriate as we start this week and the Nation gives \nfocus \n\n[[Page S 13167]]\nand attention to the U.S. Senate as to where we are going to end up on \nthis debate, and where we are going to end up legislatively, to give \nfull focus and thanks to a key element of this debate and of this \nlegislation. That is, the availability in this legislation to provide \nfor good, quality, decent child care for working families.\n  That is a key element. Republicans and Democrats alike understand \nthat in the debate of last week, in the very brief exchange that I had \nwith my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, who is a \nsupporter of the legislation.\n  I went over after the discussion and reminded and talked with him \nabout the legislation that he had introduced and worked for in the \nHouse of Representatives. A key element of that program was the child \ncare program. I daresay, even as they went through the discussion \nearlier today with the Kassebaum amendment, talking about child care, \nit is something that reaches across both political spectrums, a \nrecognition that if we are not going to have good quality child care we \nare not really going to have a meaningful welfare reform.\n  The idea of this legislation is to get people to work but not at the \nexpense of the children in this country--not to be unduly harsh, \npunitive, to the children of this country.\n  I think we all understand the old adage that none of us had a chance \nto choose our parents. Children do not have a chance to make a judgment \ndecision whether they will be born in poverty or to some degree of \naffluence. They have no control over it.\n  We want to make sure as we move ahead on this legislation that we are \nnot going to get carried away with the punitive aspects of it and say \nthat we are going to have a welfare reform, and as a result of it have \na particularly harsh, devastating, unrealistic, and cruel impact on the \nchildren of this country.\n  One of the aspects that can be particularly cruel and harsh is \nseparating children away from their parents in a way that denies those \nchildren, particularly at the early ages, from the kind of nurturing \nand care and affection and love as well as the food and resources and \nsocial services and health care, to ensure that they are going to have \na good opportunity to be able to grow and to prosper.\n  We do not need much of a review and debate, Mr. President, on what is \nhappening to children. The fact is an increasing number of children in \nour country are falling into poverty. We do not need to review again \nthe importance of those early years, both the expectant mother, the \nvarious studies and reports and experiences which have taken place, the \nBeethoven project that was of such importance in terms of Chicago, that \nshows what happens when you provide expectant mothers with well-baby \ncare, and also the newborn children with the kind of attention and \nsupport and nurturing as well as nutrition, and move them in helping \nthem developing their various kinds of skills and talents, and what \nkind of results that they have in terms of their early years as \ncompared to those that do not have those kinds of attention.\n  We do not need those additional kinds of studies. We have seen those \nstudies. The evidence is out there both for the smallest of children, \ninfants, as well as children in their earliest of years, moving on \nthrough their early teens.\n  We know what is really essential. We cannot guarantee if a child has \nhealthy parents, if a child has good health care, if a child has given \ngood nutrition, if the child is going to grow up without violence and \nsurrounded by the other kinds of aspects which are so attendant to \npoverty, that that child is necessarily going to turn out to be an \nextraordinary success.\n  What we do know is that you deny that expectant mother the nutrition \nand the care. You deny those children the early kinds of intervention. \nYou set those children, really, apart from the nurturing experience of \ntheir parents or loved ones. We know that the opportunities for those \nindividuals to move ahead in the society in a constructive and positive \nway are significantly diminished.\n  I saw this morning a recognition by one of the Nation's publications \nwhere they were talking about the 100 companies that were family \nfriendly. They were talking about again, the importance of one of the \ncriteria being child care, and talking about the enormous changes that \nhave taken place over the period of recent years, the economic \nrealities where we went through in the 1980's and effectively required \nthat they were going to have the mother enter the job market as well as \nthe father, to make up for the needed resources to maintain a standard \nof living because of the freeze on wages and the freeze on employment \nopportunities.\n  We will have an opportunity to debate that at another time in terms \nof the increases in the minimum wage and what has happened in terms of \nthe incomes of working families in this country and the earned-income \ntax credit.\n  All of this has demonstrated that with the restrictions on working \nfamilies, with the limitations on income, the wives, the women in the \nfamilies entered the job market in the period of the 1980's in order to \ntry and maintain the joint income. We find now that opportunity does \nnot exist in the 1990's with all kinds of attendant results which are \nputting additional kinds of pressures on the families.\n  One of the dramatic results from the mother entering the job market \nis that there has been an increasing number of children being left \nalone at home, the home alone concept, which I have referred to in the \npast, is something which is a reality in this country and in our \nsociety and in the workplace.\n  We have reviewed for the Senate earlier in this debate the number of \nchildren, the thousands, millions of children, who are left unattended \nduring the course of the day, even at the time of the afternoon when \nthey come back from school.\n  We have to ask ourselves, what are the results of these factors, and \nwhy we are all as a society surprised when we see this extraordinary \nbehavior by children in our society, the youngest people, to think that \nthis comes right out of the blue, it comes completely off the wall.\n  We have to ask ourselves what have been the circumstances and \nconditions that so many of these children grow up in, where basically \nthey are left behind. The children are not the ones that have been left \nout. It has been too often, under too many circumstances, the parents \nthat have left them behind. The children want to be included. It has \nbeen the actions of the parents that have left them behind.\n  That, Mr. President, is important to recognize as we begin the debate \nand have had the debate on the questions of welfare reform. We are \ntrying to take people that are able bodied, that can work, and give \nthem the opportunity to work and make sure they will be productive \nmembers of our society.\n  We have learned a very fundamental fact, Mr. President. It has been \nunderstood in city after city and community after community in State \nafter State. That is, if you are expecting those individuals to take \nthe jobs that they are going to need to have some kind of a training or \nsome kind of skill, they are going to have to have day care. They will \nhave to at least have the assurance that their children will have some \ndegree of health care that is being provided for them in that \nemployment. Those are things that are provided in the existing kind of \nprogram that we are altering and changing.\n Those were evidenced in the 1988 act. But what we are seeing now, \nrather than understanding that experience and rather than building on \nthat experience, we are moving in an alternative and very different \ndirection.\n\n  We have to ask ourselves whether this is serious, meaningful reform. \nAre we really going to be presenting to the American people a program \nthat is going to move people off welfare if we are not going to provide \nchild care for their children? Not only are we not going to provide the \ncare, but are we also going to eliminate the existing care that is \nactually provided under the three different programs under the Finance \nCommittee that provides $1 billion a year for some 700,000--some \n643,000 children at the present time, that is being provided at the \npresent time under the 1988 act? And also provided is 10 percent for \n150,000 children at the present time.\n  Now, what has happened and where we are in this debate in the Senate \nas \n\n[[Page S 13168]]\nwe go through this, as the Dole amendment has effectively eliminated \nthe $1.1 billion--that is out, that is gone--what we are saying to the \n643,000 children is, ``That program will not be there. That program \nwill not be there for those working mothers who today are able to \nbenefit from that program.'' We are saying to them, ``Tough luck for \nyou. Tough luck for you. Because the program that is out there today \nthat is providing child care for your child is gone under this program, \neffectively gone.''\n  The $1 billion that was developed over here with the discretionary \nprograms, with strong bipartisan support--Senator Dodd, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Kassebaum, other members of our committee that had developed it \nsome years ago--that provides $1 billion for 750,000 children, \neffectively one-third is being taken off that to be used for other \npurposes. That is a very, very dramatic emasculation of the existing \nchild care programs.\n  Mr. President, if you look at what had been projected for child care \nover the period of time, over these future years, and look if we are \ngoing to conform with the recommendations that are included in the Dole \nproposal, we are basically saying half the people are going to have to \nwork and of those able-bodied people who are going to have to work, \nhalf of those people are going to find child care on their own. How \nthey are going to do it, we have not heard much of an explanation for \nit.\n  I wish they could come and talk to the parents in my own State of \nMassachusetts, who are on lists and have been on lists, and in scores \nof other States, where you have, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 parents who are \ntrying to get child care today. They say, ``Somehow that will be \ndone.''\n  It is not being done in the cities. It is not being done in the \nStates. But somehow Washington knows best. Remember that slogan? \nWashington knows best. Under the Dole proposal, Washington knows best. \nHalf of the able-bodied people are going to be able to get it on their \nown. That is what Washington knows, in spite of the fact that you have \nscores of States that have tens of thousands not providing it at the \nlocal level, the local community. We ought to be able to learn \nsomething from what is happening at the local community.\n  We are constantly being told we ought to learn something from what is \nhappening back home. I can tell you what is happening back home. \nWorking mothers, particularly single heads of household--but not just \nsingle heads of households, working families that are making just above \nthe minimum wage, making that $15,000, $20,000, $22,000, $24,000, \n$28,000 a year, are finding it extremely difficult to be able to get \nany kind of child care. Many of those families, depending on the size \nof the family, are living in poverty.\n  So, what are we finding out about what will be necessary? We are \nfinding out what will be necessary from this chart here, over this \nperiod of time, under the projections of the Republican welfare \nprogram, under the total amounts of $16.8 billion that will be in this \nprogram, flat-funded over the period of time. Then we take the \nprojections of what will be necessary, needed to provide child care for \nwelfare recipients mandated under the Home Alone bill. HHS has \nestimated it will cost $11.2 billion of the 16.8. That leaves the other \nmoneys available for all the other kinds of functions.\n  We may hear, during the course of the debate, ``Well, Senator, you \njust don't get it. You just don't get it. What we are doing over here \nis, sure, we are canceling out the $1 billion that we have under the \nwelfare program and we are giving maximum flexibility to a third of \nthat other billion dollars under the discretionary to let the \nGovernors--and we all know the Governors will do it. Therefore, your \nargument really does not hold a lot of water.''\n  The answer to that is, 80 percent of the funding now that is provided \nhere goes in the benefits of individuals. Let us have the testimony \nfrom those Governors who are going to do it, who say we are going to \nreduce the benefits, 80 percent of the benefits, not the child care, \nthe benefits to individuals. When you look at what is happening in the \nStates, you see that they are not doing it today. Why will we believe \nthey will do it tomorrow when they are not doing it today? When you \nhave all of these States that have these extraordinary lists for child \ncare that are out there, they are not doing it today. They say, ``You \ngive us all of this money, this $16.8 billion, and you just relax back \nthere, because we are going to do it.''\n  When I hear from these Governors how we are going to take that $16 \nbillion and we are going to spell that out, how we are going to really \nmeet the child care needs, and what benefits they are going to cut for \nthe people in their States--we have not heard it from one Governor, \nDemocrat or Republican. Not one. But we are asked to take that on good \nfaith. We are told that is what is going to happen. ``You just don't \nunderstand, Senator. You give the Governors this $16 billion. They will \nknow how to deal with this correctly. They know how to balance. They \nknow how to choose.'' Yet, when they are using 80 percent of the \ncurrent funds for benefits and they refuse to tell us about how they \nare going to use these kind of funds to take care of those children, I \nthink it is important for someone to speak for children, for someone to \nsay they are not going to be the ones who will be left out and left \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, 10 million or 11 million of the 14 or 15 million \nAmericans on welfare are children. And the principal debate is how we \nare going to get busy, in terms of how we are going to get their \nparents busy. All of us want to make sure that able-bodied people who \ncan work ought to work and go to work. That is included in the program.\n  But what we are going to do is at what price to the children? Someone \nhas to speak for the children, and this amendment does it. That is what \nthis amendment is about.\n  When this issue was brought up earlier in terms of the majority \nleader, and I inquired of him last week about the issue of child care, \nhe indicated that there was support on both sides of the aisle to try \nto address this issue. Later in the week the new legislation was \nintroduced, the modified--this legislation ``as further modified'' was \nintroduced. This is 791 pages. This is always interesting to me, having \ngone through the health care debate. Remember the times that we had all \nof our Republican colleagues who said, ``Look at this bill. Look at \nthis bill. How could we ever wind our way through this bill? Look, it \nis 1,300 pages.''\n  You had 1,400 last week, one with the Dole and one with the modified. \nNo one is squawking about that. No one is complaining about that.\n  Mr. President, 777 pages--we got the modified and we took a look at \nwhat was in the modification and all that was in the modification, what \nI call the Home Alone bill, all that was in the modification was to \npermit States, regarding mothers who had children up to 1--permit \nStates, not mandate, not say to the States, ``You cannot have the \npunitive aspects''--permit the States not to enforce the punitive \naspects of this legislation and effectively cut off all the benefits if \nthe child is under 1.\n  Then this issue was brought up again. It was said, look, we are still \nnot adding child care. Effectively, what you are doing is taking about \n10 percent of those we want to be able to work and effectively \nexcluding them, if all the States are going to do it, and I expect we \nthink they would, if we believed that mothers, primarily, with children \nunder 1, should not be penalized for deciding to stay home and care for \ntheir child rather than to go to work.\n  So later in the week we have the other amendment, which is the third \nchange that says we will permit them to exclude mothers who have \nchildren up to 5 years. That is 65 percent of the mothers on welfare. \nDo we understand? We are talking now about trying to reform the welfare \nprogram and we are saying effectively 65 percent of the people who are \non welfare will not have to have the punitive provisions because they \nwill not have to work because of the Snowe amendment. I mean, sometime \npeople have to start to say what are we really debating here? What is \nthis reform we are debating? All the measures that are being put in, I \nguess, are just being decided in some forum. We heard so much about the \nhealth care being decided behind closed doors. We have now three \ndifferent positions \n\n[[Page S 13169]]\nby the leadership on this issue that have moved from taking, I think \nemasculating, the child care programs to one position to saying we will \npermit the States to exclude at least 10 percent. Those are the mothers \nwith small children up to 1. And then later in the week for children up \nto 5, which is 65 percent of this--all being done under a request to be \nable to modify the amendment as amended.\n  Now we have to ask ourselves where are we? I want to say to our \nRepublican friends, I applaud their initiative and I applaud their \nactions because, if this measure is going to go into force, that is \ngoing to at least provide some protection for those children. But the \nfact of the matter remains that it does not add a single dime to saying \nto those mothers that may have the opportunity to work and they can \nwork, we are saying to those mothers we are providing child care for \nyou so that you can get your training, you can get your education, you \ncan make the job search, you can go out and begin the process of \nworking yourself up through the economic ladder. We are challenging you \nto go out and work.\n  How are you going to be able to do that? There is only one way to do \nit, and that is to provide child care. The real welfare bill will \nprovide work and child care. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. It is effectively providing the child care funding that is \nnecessary and has been projected as necessary for those working \nmothers. It will provide restoring the existing program, or funding, \nthat exists under the Finance Committee, and provide the additional $6 \nbillion to $5 billion, which is the existing child care funding lumped \ninto the general block grant, and $6 billion in new money needed to \nmake work requirements real.\n  That will be taken, hopefully, from what we call the corporate \nwelfare. We have reduced it in this amendment by the savings, by the \n$50-odd billion in savings. So that is specific. But our desire, \nSenator Dodd and myself, is that we take it from the corporate welfare.\n  You can say, what are these types of corporate welfare? We will have \na chance to go into those in some detail. I can still remember where we \nwere in the debate on corporate welfare when we had the billionaire's \ntax, which is $1.6 billion. Remember that here in the Senate of the \nUnited States? We came back with a small conference report a number of \nmonths ago. We went on for days before we could at least get a vote \nabout whether we ought to close the billionaire tax loophole, which \nsays effectively that you can make it big in the United States and \nthen, if you become a Benedict Arnold and reject your citizenship and \nbecome an expatriate, you do not have to pay your taxes. That is the \nbillionaire's tax loophole.\n  Some of us believe that they ought to pay their fair share, that \nanybody who has been here, has been a citizen and has been able to \nparticipate in the protections of freedom, independence, and liberty \nhave some obligation, as greedy as they might be, and as desirous as \nthey want to be of taking the money and running, we say we ought to \nclose that loophole. That is $1.6 billion. That issue about trying to \nclose that loophole passed overwhelmingly. I think it was 96 to 4 in \nthe Senate.\n  Do you think we have that particular proposal included, that $1.6 \nbillion, as a way of trying offset the child care? Do you not think the \nAmerican people say, OK, that is $1.6 billion. There is $1.6 billion of \nthat money for child care. Let us see if we cannot find the rest of it. \nOf course, we can. There is a whole series of different proposals that \nhave been referred to as the corporate welfare proposal--we hear a lot \nabout welfare--which I think ought to be considered.\n  All this amendment says is that we will reduce the savings by $6 \nbillion, but it follows on with this amendment to say, let us find the \n$6 billion out of the billions of dollars--$424 billion under the \nbudget resolution--of tax expenditures. We ought to be able to squeeze \nthose expenditures just like we are squeezing the earned-income tax \ncredit that benefits working families that are making $26,000; just \nlike we are squeezing the students in this country, sons and daughters \nof working families that are talented, creative, and have the \nintellectual ability in order to go ahead. And we are squeezing them by \nthe in-school interest payments, which will mean, for every student \nthat borrows, $3,000 to $4,000 additional a year. We are squeezing \nthose students out of $32 billion in education funds. We are squeezing \nthose students anywhere from $8 billion to $9 billion in different ways \nin education generally, under the instruction of the Human Resources \nCommittee, out of all the money that we are spending in education. We \nare squeezing them out of $8 billion to $10 billion.\n  Out of $400 billion, we ought to be able to get $6 billion for child \ncare. $1.6 billion right off the top. We voted 96 to 4 for it. Why do \nwe not say, all right, there is $6 billion, let us take that right away \nand let us look at the other $400 billion and see if we cannot get $4 \nbillion out of there to make it up and make sure that in a welfare \nreform program that requires work that we are going to provide the \nchild care? Why do we abandon them? Why do we abandon the children? Why \ndo we abandon working families? Why do we abandon workers who want to \nget off welfare and go ahead? Why do we say that corporate welfare is \nmore important than the well-being of the children of this country, the \n11 million of them that are the sons and daughters of welfare \nrecipients?\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague who is a principal \nsponsor on the floor now. I will not take additional time. But I will \npoint out that on this chart where we are talking about a total of $11 \nbillion, and we know that of this $11 billion $5 billion can be paid \nfor by discontinuing the existing--and these are the changes that have \nbeen made over in the House--additional one-third of the $60 billion. \nThey want $30 billion more in the capital gains tax. That is on the \ntable over there.\n  Some of these items are examples of corporate welfare: 5-year cost, \n$300 million; $18 billion shifting U.S. sales overseas--$18 billion. \nThese are financial incentives to more jobs overseas and to make sure \nthat the companies do not pay any taxes if they do so. That is a \nwonderful tax incentive. It seems that we ought to cut back a little \nbit on those measures.\n  I am mindful that we will not be able to get uniformity among all the \nMembers on these different items. That is not the purpose of raising \nthis chart here. But all we are saying, Mr. President, is that under \nthe Dodd-Kennedy amendment, we will provide the necessary child care \nprogram, No. 1; that we have the $5 billion under the existing programs \nthat are authorized and appropriated under the existing financing. So \nwe have to make up the $6 billion. And under the Dodd bill, that $6 \nbillion is made up on reducing the savings, and it is our position that \nwe can find the $6 billion scattered across this range of corporate \nwelfare starting with the billionaires' tax cut.\n  We are wide open to consider any suggestions from any of our \ncolleagues as to how you package together that additional $6 billion. I \nwould suggest that the first part include the billionaires' tax cut, \nbut we are wide open to how that can be done.\n  Ultimately, if you say we cannot even do that, at least let us say \nthat this measure deserves to be passed because with it being passed, \nwe will provide child care for the children of this country. We will \nsay to them, as all of us are wont of saying, that they are our future \nand they are our priority. They deserve the first priority. And rather \nthan just saying it or speaking about this rhetorically, we will be \ndoing something for the children of our future. That is what this \namendment is about, and I believe it is the most important amendment we \nwill have in this debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the examples of corporate welfare be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Examples of corporate welfare--five year costs\n\n       Shifting U.S. Income Overseas (Transfer Pricing), $300 \n     million; Shifting U.S. Sales Overseas (Title Passage), $18.3 \n     billion; Creation of Phantom Sales Corporations, $7.5 \n     billion; Billionaires' Loophole, $1.6 billion; Peanut Program \n     Phase-Out, $264 million; Mining Subsidies for Major \n     Corporations, $280 million; Capital Gains Tax Break, $57.4 \n     billion; Repeal of Alternative Minimum Tax, $16.9 billion; \n     Accelerated Depreciation of Buildings and Equipment, $115.1 \n     billion; Market Promotion Program, $425 million.\n     \n[[Page S 13170]]\n\n\n                   Corporate welfare--five year costs\n\n\n           Shifting U.S. Income Overseas--cost: $300 million\n\n       Tax loophole allows multi-national corporations to avoid \n     U.S. taxes by shifting income to foreign subsidiaries and \n     shifting costs to U.S. facilities.\n\n\n           Shifting U.S. Sales Overseas--cost: $18.3 billion\n\n       Tax loophole allows multi-national corporations to avoid \n     U.S. taxes by passing title for exported goods on the high \n     seas. Loophole was closed by both the House and the Senate \n     during deliberations on the Tax Reform Act of 1986--but was \n     dropped in conference.\n       As a result of this and other tax breaks for multi-\n     nationals, 62% of U.S. multi-national firms pay no U.S. \n     income taxes.\n\n\n       Creation of Phantom Sales Corporations--cost: $7.5 billion\n\n       Tax loophole allows exporting companies to set up phantom \n     subsidiaries that exist only on paper and exempt up to 30% of \n     their export income from U.S. taxation.\n\n\n             Billionaires' Tax Loophole--cost: $1.6 billion\n\n       Tax loophole allows billionaires to renounce their American \n     citizenship to avoid millions of dollars in taxes on income \n     and capital gains. Loophole applies to those with a minimum \n     $600,000 in unrealized gains, which generally would \n     necessitate a minimum $5 million net worth.\n       Finance Committee and full Senate closed loophole with 1995 \n     legislative action, but it was re-opened in Conference.\n       Senate voted 96-4 on April 6, 1995 to close the loophole. \n     It is still open.\n       Loophole allows an individual to enjoy all the benefits of \n     the U.S., grow rich because of them, and then renounce \n     citizenship to avoid taxes on the wealth generated in this \n     country.\n\n\n              Peanut Program Phase Out--cost: $264 million\n\n       Program introduced during the Depression to assist \n     struggling farmers by distributing poundage quotas to \n     individuals to grow and sell peanuts. Less than a third of \n     quota holders are farmers. Quotas are passed from generation \n     to generation.\n       World market price for peanuts is $350 a ton, and American \n     price is $678 a ton. Companies who use peanuts have moved \n     plants to countries where peanuts are less expensive, costing \n     U.S. jobs. Since 1990, peanut butter plants have closed in \n     Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Michigan, and New York.\n\n\n                  Mining Subsidies--cost: $280 million\n\n       Originally signed by President Grant to encourage \n     settlement of the West, the current mining law has allowed \n     the extraction of over $200 billion in mineral reserves with \n     minimal federal compensation. A company can ``patent''--or \n     buy--20-acre tracts of land at a price between $2.50 to $5.00 \n     per acre. The land then becomes available for mining or any \n     other use, with no royalties for the government.\n       Last week, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt was \n     forced to sell 110 acres of federal land in Idaho for $275. \n     The land was sold to a Danish company for $2.50 an acre, and \n     reportedly contains $1 billion of minerals.\n       Last year, prior to a moratorium put in place, a Canadian \n     firm paid $10,000 for federal land in Nevada. The land has \n     mineral value of $10 billion.\n       If the law stands, approximately 140,000 acres of public \n     lands containing more than $15 billion of publicly owned \n     minerals will be given away. One of the largest involves the \n     Jeritt Canyon Mine in Nevada. A South Africa company and FMC, \n     a U.S. corporation, propose to pay $5,080 for land with an \n     estimated mineral value of $1.1 billion.\n\n\n              Capital Gains Tax Break--cost: $57.4 billion\n\n       Capital gains tax break benefits the wealthiest 1% of the \n     population. Legislation passed by the House as part of the \n     Contract with America would expand this benefit by $31.9 \n     billion.\n\n\n         Repeal of Alternative Minimum Tax--cost: $16.9 billion\n\n       Alternative minimum tax was instituted in 1986 Tax Reform \n     Act. Major corporations, despite massive profits in an \n     expanding economy, were paying zero taxes because of their \n     artful combination of tax loopholes. Examples include:\n       DuPont--Despite $3.8 billion pre-tax profit, no taxes were \n     paid; Boeing--Despite U.S. profit of $2.3 billion, no taxes \n     were paid; and General Dynamics--Despite $2 billion pre-tax \n     profit, no taxes were paid.\n\n\n   Accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment--cost: $115.1 \n                                billion\n\n       Largest of all corporate tax loopholes are write-offs for \n     accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment.\n       Expanded as part of the 1981 Reagan tax plan, the tax break \n     was curtailed in the 1986 Tax Reform Act and the 1993 \n     reconciliation bill. Legislation passed by the House as part \n     of the Contract with America would expand this benefit by \n     $16.7 billion.\n\n\n              market promotion program--cost: $425 million\n\n       Market Promotion Program funds consumer-related promotions \n     of products through advertising campaigns, trade shows, and \n     commodity analyses on foreign markets.\n       In 1995, the Senate deleted funding, but the Conference \n     Committee restored $85 million. The House has just increased \n     1996 funding for the Program by 25%.\n       Funds are used to subsidize large companies like Miller \n     Beer, McDonald's, General Mills, and M/Mars. American \n     taxpayers spent $29 million advertising Pillsbury Muffins \n     abroad and $10 million on Sunkist oranges. One report has \n     cited $100 million in expenditures for foreign-owned \n     corporations.\n       House Majority Leader Armey: ``I wonder about our \n     commitment to deficit reduction if we cannot take Betty \n     Crocker, Ronald McDonald, and the Pillsbury Doughboy off the \n     dole.''\n       Program should target its resources to smaller companies \n     attempting to expand their markets, not large multinational \n     corporations that hardly need public assistance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Before I speak about the amendment that the Senator from \nMassachusetts just discussed, I wish to settle an issue that I \ndiscussed with my friend from North Dakota on his amendment concerning \njust exactly what CBO says the cost of that amendment is.\n  I hope that there will not be any dispute on this point. The Conrad \namendment costs money. He says it saves $63 billion. There is nothing \nin this amendment that he has before us that saves $63 billion. In \nfact, what he basically has done is add provisions to the Dole bill \nthat cost $7 billion.\n  I have the CBO estimate in my hand, and it says right here, $6.992 \nbillion is the cost over a 7-year period of time. So I hope that will \nput that to rest now as to the aspects of that amendment.\n  In regard to the amendment that is before us, the Dodd amendment, I \nwish to remind my colleagues that the Dole modification to the original \nbill S. 1120 regarding child care--offered on September 8, last week--\nprohibits States from sanctioning a single custodial parent if \nappropriate child care for a child age 5 and under is not available \nwithin a reasonable distance of the home or work site, or informal \nchild care by a relative is unavailable or unsuitable, or appropriate \nand affordable formal child care arrangements are not available.\n  So there will not be any sanctioning of any parent with a child under \nage 5 if these sort of suitable arrangements are not readily available.\n  Let me point out that S. 1120, as introduced, provided and continues \nto provide two streams of funding for child care. I think we are \ngetting the opinion from the other side that there is no concern \nwhatsoever about provisions for child care. That simply is not so. And \nthe original had provisions for child care. But to address some \nMembers' concerns, that maybe it did not go far enough, those \nprovisions I just stated were added.\n  In the original S. 1120, the current AFDC-related child care \nprovisions, like IV-A child care, transitional child care, and at-risk \nchild care, are included as part of the cash assistance block grant to \nthe States. Funding for that is $16.8 billion for each year, fiscal \nyear 1996 through fiscal year 2000.\n  The current child care and development block grant, the State \ndependent care planning and development grants, and child development \nassociate credential scholarships are folded into a separate child care \ndevelopment block grant. Funding for these is authorized for fiscal \nyear 1996 at $1 billion and such sums as necessary through the year \n2000.\n  The Dodd amendment earmarks $1 billion of the cash assistance block \ngrant for child care and provides an additional $5 billion to States \nfor child care. Furthermore, it mandates that the child care provisions \napply to children 12 and under, including prohibiting States from \napplying sanctions to those who do not fulfill their work requirements.\n  Now, it seems as if liberals refuse to recognize that the main cash \nassistance block grant and the child care and development block grant \nwill not constitute the only funding source available to AFDC children. \nOther funding sources for child care include Head Start, title 20 and \nchapter 1.\n  While liberals attack the Work Opportunity Act of 1995 as somehow \nbeing a Home Alone bill, like we have no care whatsoever for children, \nthey continue to ignore the fact that most of the JOBS participants did \nnot report receiving child care funded by AFDC day care. In fact, \naccording to the CRS, only 38 percent of all AFDC JOBS children age 5 \nand under reported receiving IV-A paid child care in fiscal year 1993.\n  The other side complains that the measures to sanction mothers who \n\n[[Page S 13171]]\n  refuse to work are punitive because they may not be able to work due to \na lack of available child care. However, this concern has been answered \nby the additional provisions offered on September 8 because the States \nwill not sanction mothers that they determine cannot obtain appropriate \nchild care. I hope we have addressed their concern satisfactorily.\n  Liberals claim that the Congressional Budget Office figures prove \nthat S. 1120 will impose an unfunded mandate on the States concerning \nchild care costs. The CBO estimates show additional costs of $280 \nmillion in fiscal year 1998, $830 million in fiscal year 1999, and $2.2 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000.\n  However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates are based on the \n1994 caseload level for all 5 years. The fiscal year 1994 caseload was \nat a historically high level due to the massive expansion of the rolls \nfollowing the Family Support Act of 1988.\n  The Republican bill provides the mechanisms to give the States the \nflexibility that is needed in order to lower costs and improve the \nquality of child care. Our bill enables States to transfer up to 30 \npercent of the available funds between the child care block grant and \nthe main cash assistance block grant. This transfer of funds will \npermit States to make the proper provisions for both low-income and \nwelfare children so that funding is available as parents shift from \nwelfare to work. The ability to transfer funds between block grants \nthen gives States the maximum flexibility to target resources where \nthey are needed.\n  We in Washington, DC, and the Congress of the United States, cannot \nexpect to pour one mold here in Washington, DC, where we are going to \nsolve all the child care problems or all the welfare problems as they \nexist in New York City or my State of Iowa in exactly the same way. We \ncannot expect a good use of the taxpayers' money to accomplish the \nmost.\n  We have to wake up to the fact in this body and in this town that our \npopulation is so heterogeneous, our Nation so geographically vast, that \nit is impossible to make these very critical decisions in Washington, \nDC, that are going to solve the welfare problems the way they ought to \nbe solved with the best use of the taxpayers' money moving people from \nwelfare to work in the process.\n  Our bill gives States the flexibility to accomplish that. The reason \nthat we give States the flexibility to do that is because so many of \nour States have shown the ability in their welfare reform legislation \nto move people from welfare to work and save the taxpayers money.\n  This legislation builds upon the success of several States, albeit \nunder waiver from the Department of HHS, to experiment, to use new \ndynamic approaches to welfare reform. But they are doing it. And we \nobserve that. We observe that States are going to do it better than we \ncan. In fact, considering the fact that 3.1 million more people are on \nwelfare now than in 1988, the last time Congress acted, it ought to \nprove to us dramatically that our efforts toward welfare reform have \nfailed.\n  Now, in addition to what I said about the 30 percent that can be \ntransferred between the block grants by the States--and that is a \nlegitimate discretion to the States--our bill says that the States can \ndetermine the proportion of funds to be allocated for child care and \nthe method of delivery. It could be cash, it could be vouchers, it \ncould be reserved spaces in designated facilities. It gives to the \nStates the method of delivery in the main cash assistance block grant, \nand the provision to improve the quality of care for children, enabling \nrelatives and religious providers to care for children without onerous \nregulatory burdens. At the same time, we hope to be able to do it by \nlowering the cost of child care.\n  Our bill strengthens current law regarding parental choice by \neliminating the registration requirements for relatives who serve as \nchild care providers as a condition of receiving a subsidy from the \nblock grant, and includes provisions requiring that referrals honor \nparental choice of child care providers. Our bill permits the States to \nprovide vouchers to recipients so they can contract for child care by \ncharitable, religious, and private organizations through a voucher \nsystem.\n  Our bill allows us to move beyond the point that Government is the \nanswer to every problem and that only Government can solve our social \nproblems. We have a number of examples that serve as a structure for \ncharitable, religious and other private organizations, with a little \nhelp through a voucher system, that are able to help solve these \nproblems in a much better way than the Government. We should not assume \nhere in Washington that Government generally is the answer to every one \nof our problems. And when we assume that Government is an answer--\nobviously, through this legislation, we are not assuming that the \nFederal Government is the only answer to every problem, but that there \nis a role for State and local governments.\n  But an obvious step beyond that is not to assume that Government, and \na Government program, is the answer, but that there are other \norganizations out there in our society--charitable, religious and \nprivate organizations--that can help, and maybe even do a better job of \nit than we in Government can do. So our bill does that.\n  Our bill also allows States to count welfare mothers as fulfilling \nwork requirements by providing child care services for other welfare \nmothers. To the other side I say, it is legitimate maybe to think in \nterms of problems that might be created, that children need to be taken \ncare of when mothers are working. But the answer to that problem might \nbe in the very neighborhood of the welfare mother who wants to go to \nwork by giving income to another welfare mother who wants to provide \nchild care in the home. This will help them move from welfare to work, \nmaybe to establish a very successful occupation and business they would \nnot otherwise be able to start.\n  So neighbor helping neighbor is one answer to this problem, as well. \nYou do not have to look just to some sophisticated organizations to \nprovide child care. Give options to the families. Give neighbors an \nopportunity to help, particularly if that neighbor is somebody on \nwelfare that wants to move to other sources of income. This gives that \nopportunity.\n  Now, under our bill, States can meet work participation rates without \nincurring major additional child care costs by moving recipients with \nolder children off the rolls and into work.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, JOBS participants tend to \nbe older and have older children than nonparticipants. The most recent \ndata available from the Department of Health and Human Services \nindicates that for 39 percent of the AFDC families, the youngest child \nwas 6 years old and over.\n  The Dodd amendment constrains State flexibility by eliminating $1 \nbillion from the cash assistance block grant and making a decision here \nin Washington, DC. It earmarks it through congressional enactment for \nchild care rather than leaving the decision to the States.\n  In addition, it appropriates $5 billion--that is in addition to the \n$1 billion I just spoke about--in Federal funds for child care grants \nover the next 5 years, even though the need for these funds has not \nbeen demonstrated.\n  Under the Republican bill, the child care block grant calls for such \nsums as are necessary in fiscal years 1997 through the year 2000. So if \nthere is a need for increased funding, then funds can be appropriated \nthrough this provision rather than locking Congress into a decision to \nspend $5 billion right now.\n  The Dodd amendment effectively provides sufficient funding for every \nparent to have child care for children 12 and under and enforces the \nentitlement by eliminating the State's ability to sanction parents who \nchoose not to work.\n  We assume that the States have the ability to make that decision, for \nchildren over 5 that they ought to have that right to make that \ndecision.\n Our bill does that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, do I control the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, you do.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nHow \n\n[[Page S 13172]]\nmuch time remains? There is a voting time. Parliamentary inquiry, we do \nnot have an allocation of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a vote set at 5 o'clock, with the \ntime divided equally. You have about 82 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield myself 10 minutes. If the Chair will notify me in \n10 minutes. If I need more time, I will yield some. I will try to stick \nto this time constraint.\n  Let me quickly respond to my colleague from Iowa before he leaves the \nfloor, if I may, on a point he has made on the earmark.\n  Senator Hatch of Utah has an amendment pending which deals with the \nearmark which I think is pretty much unanimously supported. That is, to \nearmark out of the $48 billion, $5 billion for child care. I strongly \nsupport it. I think most people do.\n  What we are talking about in the Dodd amendment is not only the Hatch \namendment, the $5 billion, but an additional amendment that we would be \nputting into the Child Care Program. The reason we do that, I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, is, in effect, to try and really assist the Dole \nproposal so that it can be done, if we try to achieve the desired goal \nhere, and that is to get as many people to work as possible.\n  Under the Dole welfare reform proposal, 25 percent of all people on \nwelfare are required, under the law, to be at work within 2 years, and \nthen 50 percent of all people on AFDC to be at work by the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, I have to be careful about numbers, but this is a \nreport that was put together on the Republican leadership plan. I will \ntell you who put this together in a minute. It is an analysis of the \nprojected numbers of people that would be required to be at work under \nthe majority leader's bill.\n  There are several columns. It goes State by State. The first column \nis the ``Projected number required in the year 2000 to participate in \nwork under the Senate Republican leadership plan.'' Go over two columns \nand it is, ``Projected number required to actually participate,'' with \na number in between, ``Projected number of leavers, combiners, and \nsanctioners that count toward participation.''\n  I do not know what that means, except that it reduces the number. It \nmust mean that people who otherwise would be exempt under the proposal, \nfor one reason or another, because it reduces the first number by \nalmost 50 percent.\n  If you take the first number, the projected number by the year 2000, \nit is in excess of 2 million people who would have to be at work by the \nyear 2000.\n  In Tennessee, the number of people is 46,000. My State of Connecticut \nis 26,000. Iowa is 17,000. If you take the Tennessee number and the \nConnecticut number, as it is reduced down, the Tennessee number \nactually gets you down to 23,400. The Connecticut number reduces from \n26,000 down to about 13,500. It is exactly in half. I do not know quite \nhow that happened. Let us just accept that number, somewhere between 2 \nand 1 million. Fifty eight thousand will have to meet that criteria.\n  Maybe someone can explain that middle column to me at some point, \nwhat a leaver and combiner is that reduces that number.\n  The point is this. It is estimated that the number of child care \nslots that will be necessary to move these people from welfare to work \nis roughly increasing the number by 165 percent. If we do not do that, \nthe States are going to be faced with penalties, a 5-percent penalty, 5 \npercent on the block grant the State would get.\n  As you calculate that, the 5-percent penalty is probably less than \nsaddling the State with the cost. I will give you the numbers of what \nis estimated State by State. I will ask unanimous consent to print this \nin the Record.\n  The estimated cost State by State related to child care alone, beyond \nwhat we presently have in the bill, would require an expenditure in \nConnecticut of $48 million. In Iowa, it is $32 million; California, \n$652 million; in Tennessee, it is $84 million, and each State goes \ndown.\n  I see my colleague from Utah. Utah is $14 million. This is what the \nStates would have to come up with, we are told, in order to meet the \nchild care requirements. Sixty-four percent of these people have \nchildren under the age of 5. You are either looking at reducing \nspending in other areas or coming up with a tax increase to meet that \nnumber. We are doing what Hatch proposed, and we are allocating of the \n$48 billion, $5 billion to child care.\n  We are going a step further by saying the demand is such you have to \nhave a resource allocation to avoid putting States in the position of \nhaving to pay the penalty because you are not able to get there unless \nthey come up with this kind of revenue increase, which I think is going \nto be difficult in many cases. Or they probably would opt for the \npenalty, given the lower cost of paying the penalty.\n  In the debate on welfare reform, we should not be in the business of \ntrying to promote penalty payments or necessarily asking States to meet \nthis criteria to come up with a tax increase on their own. What we are \ntalking about is an allocating of existing resources under the block \ngrant and additional resources to meet the demands.\n  The number is somewhat in debate, depending upon, like most things in \nthis town, when you start talking beyond the $5 billion. Everyone \nadmits beyond the $5 billion, you need more resources. We are told \nroughly it is close to $6 billion over 5 years. Others will say it is \n$3 or $4 billion, and we are roughly in that range. Depending upon what \nhappens with the numbers I outlined to begin with on how many people \nare actually moved to welfare, if it is the 2 million or the 1 million, \nthat number, that $6 or $3 billion would probably change somewhat. But \nclearly, we need some if we are going to make this work.\n  Again, I do not know anyone who disagrees with the notion that when \nyou have young children--by the way, I applaud the majority leader's \ndecision to take the exemption from 1 to 5 years. That is going to \nhelp, I believe. What it does too often is it gives people an excuse \nnot to get from welfare to work. I appreciate trying to help out those \nfamilies, but I believe our underlying goal ought to be, how do we move \npeople from public assistance to work. Not giving them a reason not to, \nbut rather, how do you achieve it, not just in economic terms, in \ndollars and cents. There is a societal benefit, in my view, that \nexceeds whatever dollars we invest or save here, that far exceeds the \nnumbers that we benefit or costs us to do this.\n  The value of work, a family at work is so much more important in many \nways than the budgetary implications. There is nothing that is more \nsalutary for a family, a neighborhood, a community than work.\n  And so while I applaud the decision to exempt these families, and \nunderstand it, we ought to be doing everything we can not to create \nexemptions but to create opportunities for work. So while I fully \nunderstand and accept the concern about an additional $3 to $6 billion \nover 5 years, Mr. President--not 1 year; over 5 years--I happen to \nbelieve that is a good investment, if we stick to our common goal, and \nthat is to do everything possible to make it possible for people on \npublic assistance to get to work.\n  There are other elements as well, the job training and so forth, the \nhealth care elements, but one of them clearly is the child care \nquestion.\n  Again, you do not have to be on welfare to understand the child care \nquestion. As I said the other day, any family in this country with \nyoung children, regardless of their income, knows of the anxiety of \nchild care, particularly if it is a single-parent family raising \nchildren or two-income earners out there. They worry about it every \nday, every week, every month, wondering about whether the child care \nwill be there next week, is it good child care, is it safe--all of \nthese questions that people worry about.\n  No one is necessarily going to have to get into the shoes of a \nwelfare recipient to appreciate the feelings of a mother or parent that \nis going off to work and wants to know where those children are. I \nmight add, Mr. President, that in fact not only is this going to help \npeople get to work, but, based on what Senator Hatch and I did a few \nyears ago on child care--by the way, we had the same qualities, \nstandards, and so forth, incorporated as part of our block grant as are \nincluded here. We happen to believe that the child care settings are a \nlot better than some of the settings we would be talking \n\n[[Page S 13173]]\nabout where some of these children would be.\n  There is another educational element here. Not every single case, but \nmost of the child care programs, church-based and community-based \nprograms, are pretty good programs. They have sliding scales and so \nforth to make it possible. All we are saying here is that to really \nmake our welfare reform program work, to really make the Dole bill \nwork, you have to have some feature to this that makes it possible for \npeople to be able to leave their homes in the morning, knowing full \nwell that their most important asset, the thing they care about the \nmost, their children, are taken care of. They are not going to go out \nthe door--and they will pay any price--particularly if they have infant \nchildren, and even 5, 5\\1/2\\ years of age, even though there are \npreschool programs, they will not leave those children unattended. They \nwill go to jail or pay fines.\n  We ought to create an environment where it is inviting to go to work, \nnot create obstacles. How do we take down the barriers? In any survey \nthat I have read over the last 5, 6 years on welfare to work, if not \nthe top reason, Mr. President, one of the top two or three reasons is \nthe absence of child care. In fact, one of the problems is that in our \nurban areas, unlike suburban areas where you get more options of child \ncare because there are a lot more people in the business of child care, \nin our urban settings, there is less of that. So the options available \nto people in our poorer areas--urban and particularly rural areas--is \nmore difficult.\n  The problems in rural America and urban America are more difficult in \ntrying to find child care settings for people. A lot of people are not \nin the business of child care, for obvious economic reasons. The \npressures are great in the areas where we find the larger \nconcentrations of people on public assistance, in our poor areas, and \nthere is not the kind of availability.\n  What we are hoping to be able to do with this amendment--and I truly \nhope it is bipartisan--is bring everyone together on this one issue. \nSenator Hatch and I did that 5 years ago in our child care program. It \nreally united a lot of people here around a common theme of trying to \neliminate one of the major obstacles of going from welfare to work--to \ncome up with a proposal that provides resources.\n  This is not an entitlement. It is not that somebody has a right to go \ninto court and demand these resources. It is truly an assistance to the \nStates that have good child care programs, that have flexibility, that \nwe are asking to do a lot. This is a mandate, a Federal law that says, \nwithin 2 years, you have to have 25 percent and, by the year 2000, 50 \npercent have to be at work, or we penalize you 5 percent of your block \ngrant.\n  Now, again, that is a mandate. All we are suggesting here is to make \nit possible for these States to achieve those goals and those numbers--\nwhether it is the 2 million, Mr. President, or the 1 million. Again, I \nwill try to sort out that number. It is somewhere in between here. \nClearly, those are going to be difficult numbers to reach. In \nCalifornia, 358,000 people are going to have to find work slots. We \nknow how difficult it is to find work for people. Here are 358,000 new \njobs we are going to have to come up with in California. The number is \n17,000 in Iowa, 102,000 in Michigan, 200,000 in New York, 104,000 in \nOhio, and 46,000 new jobs in Tennessee in the next 2 years. We all know \nof the pressures of people being laid off, losing jobs, with downsizing \nand so forth. So as we try to create new jobs and requiring people to \nmove into them, to make it possible and ease that burden of child care \nseems to me to be critically important.\n  One additional element. Again, I respect the 5-year-olds and less on \nthe exemption. But if you have four children, and three of them are \nover 5 and one is under, you are exempted because you have one child \nunder 5. So if you have three children--maybe 12, 13, and one is under \n5--you fall into the exemption category.\n  We ought to be trying, as I say, not to create a situation where \npeople say, ``How do I avoid this and continue to collect public \nassistance?'' But we ought to try to move people into that work \ncategory. Again, I respect the exemption and applaud it in some ways; I \nwelcome it as an improvement here. What I really hope, Mr. President, \nis that we can come together here in the next few hours on this \nproposal. It is not draconian or radical. It is a simple enough idea. I \nthink you build a much stronger base of support for the majority \nleader's bill with the result of the adoption of this. I think the \nPresident would welcome this, in terms of his signature. Also, I think \nit would really make it possible to reach the kind of numbers we are \ntalking about here to be entering that work force, moving away from \npublic assistance. And the tremendous value, beyond the dollars and \ncents we talk about, the value to those families and to those children, \nI think, does not show up on all these graphs and charts we talk about. \nIt is hard to put a price tag on the value of somebody at home who has \na job, and what it means to that family and neighborhoods and \ncommunities when people are working.\n  For those reasons, I urge adoption of the amendment. I thank our \ncolleague from Vermont for cosponsoring the bill. We adopted \nunanimously in the Labor and Human Resources Committee a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which concludes by saying, ``It is the sense of the \nSenate that the Federal Government has a responsibility to provide \nfunding and leadership with respect to child care.'' That is in \nanticipation of this bill coming along. And as the distinguished \noccupant of the chair is a member of that committee, I appreciated his \nsupport of that resolution. I hope that he, along with others, will be \nsupportive of the amendment pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 67 minutes on that side and 97 \nminutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I began listening to this debate several \nweeks ago with the hope that some positive changes could be made to the \ncurrent welfare system. Since then, I have spent weeks in my State \ntalking with friends and parents and members of communities about this \nissue.\n  I must admit, as we continue this debate, I have mixed feelings. I \nstill believe the Senate can achieve real welfare reform that works for \nfamilies. But I have been disheartened by the Senate's rejection of the \nwork-first amendment, because I believe that amendment reflected a \nworkable, nonpartisan, solution-oriented approach to fixing the welfare \nsystem.\n  Now we are considering an amendment that goes to the very heart of \nthe welfare debate: childcare services. Make no mistake about it, Mr. \nPresident: childcare is the key to successful welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I bring a unique perspective to this debate on the \nSenate floor. I am a mother with school-age children. I have been a \npreschool teacher, dealing with kids from all economic classes. I have \nrun parent education classes, counseling young parents to help them \ndevelop their skills as mothers and fathers in the modern world.\n  I can tell you what it's like to take a phone call from a young \nsingle mom at the end of her rope. She is burning the candle at both \nends, trying to work, worrying all day long about her kids. For this \nparent, her paramount concern is childcare; she cannot focus on doing a \ngood job without knowing her kids have adequate nourishment, \nsupervision, and care during the day.\n  Fully 34 percent of current welfare recipients have identified access \nto childcare as the single barrier between them and reentering the work \nforce.\n  To succeed in reforming welfare, we have to understand the everyday \nchallenges of everyday parents. We have to speak their language, and \nknow their issues. Only by knowing and understanding these challenges \ncan we design a welfare reform proposal that truly gives struggling \nfamilies a boost to economic stability. That, Mr. President, means we \nneed to address childcare in this bill.\n  For the past 5 months I've been participating in a unique program \ncalled Walk-a-Mile. Some of my colleagues, including Senator Simon, \nhave also taken part. Walk-a-Mile started in Washington State as a \ncollaborative effort between the University of Washington and the \nNorthwest Resource \n\n[[Page S 13174]]\nCenter for Children, Youth, and Families.\n  The program pairs a welfare recipient with an elected official, and \nthe two speak frequently on the telephone about each others' \nexperiences. I was lucky enough to be paired with June, a single mother \nof two from a Seattle suburb who survived an abusive relationship.\n  During her time on welfare, June attended school and earned a degree \nfrom evergreen State College. Her classroom time was frequently \ninterrupted, however, because her 6-year-old son Jonathan suffers from \nattention-deficit disorder, a side effect of the abuse suffered in \ntheir previous home.\n  Since earning her degree, June was divided her time between looking \nfor work and looking for childcare. She has been told by six different \ndaycare providers that her son could not be cared for, because of his \nexplosive and erratic behavior.\n  Her dilemma is a familiar one: in the absence of childcare, she \ncannot work; yet she is qualified, and eager, to work today.\n  How does this story related to the Dole bill? the pending legislation \nglosses over the childcare question, and leaves demand for childcare \nservices unmet.\n  In 1994, there were 3,000 children on waiting lists for childcare in \nmy State. Nearly 23,000 other kids received childcare services that \nwould be eliminated under the Dole bill. That adds up to 26,000 \nchildren for whom childcare is thrown into question under this bill.\n  The Dole bill would compel my State to spend $88 million in childcare \nin order to meet its work requirements. At the same time however, we \nstand to lose over $500 million in Federal funding over the same \nperiod.\n  The bill cuts current services; it severely limits Federal funding; \nand forces my State to spend more of its own scarce money. Worse, it \nstands to create an expanded, unaddressed demand for childcare. This is \na major unfunded mandate, and a major problem for Washington State.\n  Mr. President, this is not reform; this is reshuffling the chairs on \nthe Titanic.\n  If we want to move people into the work force, we should do it. I \nthink this is a very worthy and important goal. But we should be \nrealistic about what that will take.\n  As a preschool teacher, and parent education counselor, I can tell \nyou--based on firsthand experience--given the choice between work and \nkids, a parent with limited options will stay on welfare if it's the \nbest childcare option, just for the security of her family.\n  This is why the Dodd-Kennedy amendment is so important. It addresses \nthe need for childcare services, pure and simple.\n  It provides resources in a fiscally prudent, credible way through \ndirect grants to States with only one purpose: to fund childcare needs \ncreated by new work requirements. Funding levels would be set according \nto CBO estimates of the childcare demands created by the underlying \nDole bill.\n  What is the purpose of the amendment? It is not to give bureaucrats \nmore money; it is not to place more regulations on States; the sole \npurpose is to move parents into the work force.\n  I believe this is not only appropriate, but necessary.\n  Think back to my Walk-a-Mile partner, June. For people like her, the \nDodd-Kennedy amendment gives them peace of mind to invest themselves in \neducation or training programs that will equip them to move into the \nwork force, without worrying about whether their kids will be looked \nafter during the day.\n  Mr. President, I know what worries parents, and I know what scares \nthe kids. I've seen it firsthand, and I've studied it closely over the \npast 3 years.\n  We have a unique opportunity to do something concrete for real people \nin this bill. We can build a foundation for families. We can provide \nopportunity for children and their parents.\n  Mr. President, 78,000 children in my State live in poverty. Their \nparents struggle every day to make ends meet. How do we know one of \nthose kids will not be the next Einstein, or the next Cal Ripken, or \nthe next Bill Gates?\n  If we do not do our part to create a foundation to care for children \nand provide options for parents, our Nation stands to lose in the long \nrun.\n  These are the fears of moms and their children. This is why moms get \ntrapped in dependency, and why their kids look for their solutions on \nthe streets. And unless we do something to remove these fears, we will \nnot accomplish reform.\n  The Dodd-Kennedy amendment provides that foundation. The Senate must \nadopt this language, or something very close to it, if our reform \neffort is to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this \nlanguage. It is fiscally smart, and I believe it will help welfare \nparents turn the corner.\n  I urge my colleagues to consult with their States. Do the math. Ask \nyourselves what happens to children under the Dole bill, in the absence \nof better childcare provisions.\n  Ask yourself whether the work requirements are realistic in the \nabsence of strong childcare provisions. If you don't know the answer, \ntalk to someone like June, my Walk-a-Mile partner, someone with real \nexperience who understands life on the lower half of the economic \nladder in this country.\n  If you do this, I believe you will have no choice but to reach the \nsame conclusions I have: Moving welfare recipients into the work force \ncan work, but only if we do it right. We simply must address critical \nchildcare needs in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is on each side of this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 58 minutes; \nthe Senator from Utah has 96 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see both the Senator from Connecticut \nand Washington are here. We hoped to have an opportunity to debate this \nimportant measure with the leadership because it is, I think as I \nmentioned before, the most important amendment, I think, coming on \nwelfare.\n  We welcome the opportunity to make presentations. The proponent of \nthe amendment, Senator Dodd, myself, Senator Murray and others on \nFriday outlined the amendment, and again today. We want to try and have \na chance to enter into a debate on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a very excellent \naddress on related matters provided as a keynote address to the 25th \nanniversary of the Campaign for Human Development by Cardinal Bernardin \nfrom Chicago.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Story of the Campaign for Human Development: Theological-Historical \n                                 Roots\n\n                      (Joseph Cardinal Bernardin)\n\n       I am delighted to serve as Honorary Chairman of this event \n     and to welcome you to Chicago for the 25th anniversary \n     celebration of the Campaign for Human Development. I thank \n     Bishop Garland and Father Hacala for the kind invitation to \n     speak at this gathering. This is the first address I have \n     undertaken since my illness, so it is indeed good to be here \n     with you!\n       It is fitting that we are gathered here because since the \n     beginning, Chicago has been important to the Campaign and the \n     Campaign has been important to Chicago. As you may know, \n     Msgr. George Higgins of this Archdiocese wrote a Labor Day \n     message in 1969 that pointed the way to the Campaign.\n       Auxiliary Bishop Michael Dempsey of Chicago was CHD's first \n     spokesperson.\n       Msgr. Jack Egan organized the ``Friends of CHD'' in the \n     mid-1970s and for decades has been an inspiration to the \n     Campaign's work.\n       The great work of community organizing began in Chicago, \n     and Chicago has many important networks and training centers.\n       CHD enjoys a rich tradition of support here, both in the \n     form of active and enthusiastic participation by people in \n     organizations and projects funded by CHD, and in the generous \n     donations to the annual CHD collection. Again this past year, \n     despite many other urgent and worthwhile requests for \n     assistance, Catholics throughout the Archdiocese donated \n     nearly three quarters of a million dollars.\n       An anniversary is a good time to reflect on the splendid \n     accomplishments of the past and to look to the significant \n     challenges of the future. This evening, I will highlight \n     CHD's historical and theological roots and share some \n     thoughts on its importance for the future.\n       In his labor Day message in 1969, Msgr. George Higgins \n     urged the Catholic Church to make ``a generous portion of its \n     limited resources available for the development and self-\n     determination of the poor and powerless.'' A the bishops' \n     meeting that fall, the late Msgr. Geno Baroni continued to \n     lay the groundwork for this initiative by urging the bishops \n     to take up the plight of the poor in a new, significant way.\n\n[[Page S 13175]]\n\n       In response, the bishops resolved (a) to raise $50 million \n     to assist self-help programs designed and operated by the \n     poor and aimed at eliminating the causes of poverty; (b) to \n     educate the more affluent about the root causes of poverty; \n     and (c) to change attitudes about the plight of the poor. The \n     bishops were inspired by Jesus' life and mission, by almost a \n     century of Catholic social teaching, and by Pope Paul VI, who \n     had called for determined efforts to ``break the hellish \n     circle of poverty'' and to ``eradicate the conditions which \n     impose poverty and trap generation after generation in an \n     agonizing cycle of dependency and despair.''\n       As General Secretary of the National Conference of Catholic \n     Bishops at the time, I was directly involved in this exciting \n     endeavor. While enthusiasm among the bishops was high, \n     details about how the crusade would be implemented had yet to \n     be developed. As I have often noted, the bishops voted in \n     this collection and left it to me and staff to work out the \n     details! Despite the complexities involved in such an \n     enormous undertaking, I was motivated by my strong belief \n     that the idea behind what would become known as the Campaign \n     for Human Development was ``blessed from the beginning,'' and \n     was eager to get it underway.\n       Even though we had to create a program, manage a national \n     collection, and decide how to distribute millions of dollars \n     in grants--all in only a few months--we were determined to \n     make it a success. Thanks to a dedicated staff, and many \n     others, some of whom are with us this evening, the Campaign \n     did get off to a good start. Indeed, the first CHD collection \n     was the most successful national Catholic collection ever \n     taken up in the United States, raising $8 million. And we \n     received a thousand requests for grants!\n       The Campaign for Human Development has a threefold mission \n     of empowering the poor, educating people about poverty and \n     justice issues, and building solidarity between the poor and \n     non-poor, it is a remarkable expression of Catholic social \n     teaching. CHD embraces the basic principles of that teaching: \n     the God-given dignity, rights, and responsibilities of the \n     human person; the call to community and participation in that \n     community; the option for, and solidarity with, the poor.\n       Chd funds have helped organizations effectively address the \n     larger issues of the community by promoting changes in \n     detrimental laws and policies and by opening lines of \n     communication with government, banking, business, and \n     industry. According to a recent study sponsored by the \n     Catholic University of America, CHD seed\n      monies have generated billions of dollars' worth of \n     resources for underprivileged communities. That same study \n     indicates that CHD-funded projects currently benefit in \n     some way fully half of the poor in the United States!\n       CHD-funded groups have helped to shape U.S. public policy \n     and improved life for families and communities in many ways. \n     They helped enact legislation to ban redlining, require \n     mortgage information disclosure, and require reinvestment in \n     communities. They helped enact federal standards that \n     virtually eliminated ``brown lung'' disease in the textile \n     industry. They helped pass the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     and strengthen enforcement of child support.\n       However, more important than what CHD-funded groups have \n     done is how they have done it. While some political leaders \n     have lately begun to talk about ``empowerment,'' CHD has made \n     empowerment its very reason for existence. CHD has \n     successfully promoted self-determination and participation \n     for countless people.\n       One of my joys as Archbishop is meeting individuals who, \n     thanks to CHD, now share more fully in decision-making \n     processes that affect them. For example, just yesterday the \n     following 1995 CHD grants for the Chicago area were announced \n     at a press conference:\n       Chicago ACORN received $45,000 to fund the Chicago Parents \n     Organizing Project's efforts to unite parents and young \n     people to improve schools in low-income communities;\n       Chicago's Homeless on the Move for Equality received \n     $30,000 to expand its operations to serve better the needs of \n     the homeless in Chicago;\n       Illinois Fiesta Educativa of Chicago received $40,000 to \n     fund educational programs and services to Latinos with \n     disabilities; and\n       Chicago Metropolitan Sponsors, with which I have been \n     personally involved, received $116,000 to address such social \n     issues as crime, unemployment, and education in Chicago and \n     surrounding suburbs.\n       Twenty-five years, nearly $250 million dollars, and 3,000 \n     funded projects later, CHD remains a leader in community \n     organizing and education about the impact of poverty, the \n     social structures that perpetuate it, and ways to overcome \n     it. CHD has consistently taught all of us about systemic \n     injustice that limits people's ability to improve their \n     lives. It has also changed attitudes among the poor by \n     fostering self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-reliance, as \n     well as encouraging a sense of hope about being able to \n     address injustice effectively and create a better life for \n     the poor. As CHD's ``25th Anniversary Challenge'' document \n     notes, ``CHD is an unusual combination of religious \n     commitment, street-smart politics, commitment to structural \n     change, and commitment to the development of the poor.''\n       Pope John Paul II highlighted CHD's effectiveness when he \n     was in Chicago in 1979, saying, ``The projects assisted by \n     the Campaign have helped to create a more human and just \n     order, and they enable many people to achieve an increased \n     measure of rightful self-reliance.'' In a recent letter to \n     Cardinal Keeler, the President of our Episcopal Conference \n     (for whose presence this evening I am very grateful), the \n     Holy Father echoed similar sentiments of admiration and \n     respect. And in their 1986 pastoral letter, ``Economic \n     Justice for All,'' the U.S. Catholic bishops underscored \n     CHD's efforts, pointing out that: ``Our experience with CHD \n     confirms our judgment about the validity of self-help and \n     empowerment of the poor. The Campaign * * * provides a model \n     that we think sets a high standard for similar efforts.''\n       Despite CHD's successes, tragically, poverty is more \n     entrenched today than ever before in our nation's history. \n     Indeed, reducing poverty today is even more daunting than a \n     quarter-century ago because it is often exacerbated by other \n     serious, societal problems that have increased significantly. \n     Out-of-wedlock births, particularly among teens; inadequate \n     housing, health care, education, and job opportunities; lack \n     of community involvement; and most of all, the collapse of \n     family structures--all are undermining our society and making \n     it all the more difficult for people to escape from the grips \n     of poverty. Moreover, senseless violence, rampant crime, drug \n     abuse, and gang warfare dramatically and tragically diminish \n     the quality of life in many communities.\n       As a result, our country is even more divided today between \n     the ``haves'' and ``have-nots.'' There is an increased \n     concentration of wealth and political power alongside a \n     growing feeling of powerlessness among many of our citizens. \n     Rapidly developing technology, layoffs, diminishing health \n     benefits and retirement security, and more part-time jobs \n     offering little or no benefits have left the middle-class and \n     working-poor very insecure and growing more resentful toward \n     both government and the non-working poor who depend on \n     society for aid and assistance.\n       Building solidarity between the ``haves'' and the ``have-\n     nots'' is vital if we are to overcome poverty and the many \n     other problems facing our society. So, even though the \n     challenge of reducing poverty is greater today, the fact that \n     one of CHD's greatest strengths is its ability to bridge the \n     gaps--between the poor and the affluent, the powerful and the \n     powerless, workers and management--will enhance its \n     influence. However, as you and I know very well, it will \n     require much more than ``bridging the gaps.''\n       Twenty-five years ago, Msgr. Baroni emphasized this point \n     when he spoke to the U.S. bishops about the urgent need to \n     address poverty, racism, and injustice in our nation. He \n     pointed out that ``something spiritual is lacking--the heart, \n     the will, the desire on the part of affluent America to \n     develop the goals and commitments necessary to end the \n     hardships of poverty and racism in our midst.''\n       Today, for example, there appears to be a great desire to \n     address one dimension of poverty, namely, welfare reform. \n     Unfortunately, the debate about such reform seems to spring \n     not so much from an authentic concern for the poor as from \n     pragmatic concerns about the federal budget deficit and \n     taxpayers' pocketbooks. Now the federal budget and taxes are \n     realities that must be dealt with, but they should not be \n     resolved apart from a sincere and objective consideration of \n     the common good of all citizens.\n       If we are to solve these problems, then, we must shift the \n     discussion about welfare reform from a merely pragmatic or \n     myopic concern to a more fully humane concern for all. To \n     address poverty realistically and humanely involves more than \n     appealing to people on an intellectual or a political level. \n     It requires calling people to a real conversion of heart for \n     the sake of the common good, which includes the well-being of \n     the poor and needy. It means nurturing a new spirit in the \n     Church and in our nation:\n       a new spirit of compassion, generosity, and love for ``the \n     least among us'';\n       a new spirit that rejects the vicious rhetoric and the push \n     for punitive measures that is so common today and instead \n     encourages a new, determined approach to addressing the root \n     causes of poverty;\n       a new spirit that challenges those who are not poor to \n     disavow stereotypes of the poor and shatter myths that enable \n     people to look down upon the indigent;\n       a new spirit that encourages an honest and informed \n     consideration of issues in the light of human values and a \n     moral commitment; and, ultimately;\n       a new spirit that trusts in God's grace to transform our \n     hearts and to empower our communities and Church--from sin \n     and evil to love and justice.\n       There is no doubt that welfare reform is an urgent national \n     priority. No one should support policies that are wasteful or \n     counter productive, policies that perpetuate poverty and \n     dependence. Rather, such reform should aim to enhance the \n     lives and dignity of poor children and families and enable \n     them to live productive lives. Saving money in the immediate \n     future should not be the only criterion because such short-\n     term savings lay the groundwork for greater difficulties and \n     costs in the future. Remember also that welfare funds amount \n     to only 1% of the national budget. Reforms that effectively \n     punish the innocent children of unwed teenage mothers, \n     wittingly or unwittingly promote abortion, or burden states \n     to do more with less resources are not the answer.\n       The success of Campaign for Human Development clearly shows \n     that combining personal responsibility and social \n     responsibility is a potent catalyst for change, renewal, \n     success, and hope for the future. Now is the \n\n[[Page S 13176]]\n     time to demand a halt to the political rhetoric and posturing, which \n     are fueled by individual interests and those of special \n     interest groups. Now is the time for creative solutions and \n     bold strategies that invest in human dignity and potential \n     rather than scapegoat and punish the poor, further \n     exacerbating the already dire situations many poor people \n     face today. We know that true reform will not be easy, but we \n     also know that poor people, with the right kind of assistance \n     and opportunities, can make a better life for themselves and \n     can contribute to the common good.\n       So, this evening, this weekend, and as we return home, let \n     us renew our commitment to economic and social justice for \n     all by continuing to engage people in their faith life and by \n     encouraging them to put their faith into action. It we do, we \n     can and will make a difference. I am convinced that CHD \n     harbors a vast reservoir of untapped potential.\n       In a speech to students in South Africa, the late Senator \n     Robert Kennedy, said, ``Each time a man stands up for an \n     ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out \n     against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and \n     crossing each other from a million different centers of \n     energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can \n     sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and \n     resistance.'' (Senator Kennedy's widow, Ethel, is featured in \n     CHD's current radio ads, and his daughter, Kerry, now serves \n     on the USCC/CHD Committee.)\n       The Campaign for Human Development began as a ripple and \n     has become a current cascading through lives and \n     communities--bringing new opportunity in its wake. It is a \n     sign of hope for the poor and for all Americans who seek \n     justice. You, my friends, help to make that hope possible!\n       My dear sisters and brothers, let us thank God for the \n     grace of the past quarter of a century. Let us also open \n     ourselves to the inspiration and strength of the Holy Spirit \n     so that we will be able to: change hearts; face the \n     challenges and opportunities of the future; and nurture a new \n     spirit of compassion and solidarity with the most vulnerable \n     members of our society.\n       May God who has begun a good work among us bring it to \n     fulfillment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me quote from a few paragraphs of \nCardinal Bernardin in his excellent address on August 25. ``Today, for \nexample, there appears to be a great desire to address one \ndimension''--he talks in the early part of the speech about the \nproblems of poverty and welfare and the importance to eradicate, to \nbreak the hellish circles of poverty is to eradicate the conditions \nwhich impose poverty and trap generation after generation in an \nagonizing circle of dependency and despair. He could be talking about \nthe whole welfare issue we are addressing here today.\n\n       Today, for example, there appears to be a great desire to \n     address one dimension of poverty, namely, welfare reform. \n     Unfortunately, the debate about such reforms seems to spring \n     not so much from authentic concern for the poor, as from \n     pragmatic concern about the Federal budget deficit and \n     taxpayers' pocketbooks. Now, the Federal budget and taxes are \n     realities that must be dealt with, but they should not be \n     resolved apart from a sincere and objective consideration of \n     the common good of all citizens.\n       If we are to solve these problems, then, we must shift the \n     discussion about welfare reform from a merely pragmatic and \n     myopic concern to a more fully humane concern for all. To \n     address poverty realistically and humanely involves more than \n     appealing to people on an intellectual or political level. It \n     requires calling people to a real conversion of heart for the \n     sake of the common good, which includes the well-being of the \n     poor and the needy.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       There is no doubt that welfare reform is an urgent national \n     priority. No one should support policies that are wasteful or \n     counterproductive, policies that perpetuate poverty and \n     dependence. Rather, such reform should aim to enhance the \n     lives and dignity of poor children and families and enable \n     them to live productive lives.

He states it, I think, in a very \neloquent, uplifting and inspiring way. But it seems to me it is right \non target for this debate.\n  Mr. President, I will withhold the remainder of our time. We have a \nnumber of speakers who will be coming to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be evenly \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the \namendment to yield to me 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, I take the floor to make comments in \nsupport of the Dodd-Kennedy amendment that is currently pending to the \nwelfare reform bill. I do so with great enthusiasm because, like any \neffort, unless you have all the parts together you cannot accomplish \nthe ultimate goal. In welfare reform there are a number of significant \nthings that have to be done in order to pass a true reform bill. \nCongress cannot come on the floor, obviously, and pass a resolution \nthat says welfare will be over with by the year 2000 and do nothing \nelse. Any legislative effort that attacks this tremendous problem that \nwe are facing as a Nation has to be composed of a number of significant \nmeasures in order to bring these measures together to accomplish real \nreform. It is not easy. It is not going to be cheap. But it is \nabsolutely essential that we do it.\n  One of the things that we as Democrats, and I think Republicans as \nwell, agree on is that the welfare system as we know it today does not \nwork very well for those who are on it, nor does it work very well for \nthose who are paying for it. The system has generated generation after \ngeneration of people who are dependent on government help in order to \nsurvive. We in this Congress I think have an obligation to try to come \nup with a real reform bill that breaks that cycle. It is not going to \nbe easy. I think it has to be bipartisan. We have to have our \nRepublican colleagues join us when we have a good idea and I am willing \nto join them when they have a good idea. We do not have enough votes by \nourselves to pass a welfare reform bill. We simply do not have a \nmajority any longer. But I would suggest that they alone do not have \nenough votes to pass a bill that will be signed into law by this \nPresident unless we too are involved in helping to craft a measure that \nmakes sense.\n  Some have argued that the Federal Government and the States have been \ntrying to solve the welfare problem for years and it has not brought \nabout any real solution. Therefore, we are just going to give the whole \nmess to the States and let the States handle it because they are more \ninventive and have better ideas about how to solve the problem. I would \nsuggest that approach is simply too simplistic and it is not going to \nwork.\n  This problem is big enough for both the Federal Government and the \nState governments working together to try to help solve this immense \nproblem. I would suggest that State and local governments cannot solve \nit by themselves, and I would also suggest that the Federal Government \ncannot solve it by itself. Therefore, real reform has to be a coming \ntogether of the best ideas from the States and the Federal Government \nworking together to provide money both from the State level and the \nFederal level in order to try to create sufficient funds to bring about \nreal reform. \n\n[[Page S 13177]]\n\n  There are those who suggest that, no, that is not the answer. We are \njust going to send all of the problems to the States and let them solve \nit. I have said that type of an approach is sort of like those of us in \nWashington putting all the problems of welfare into a big box and \nmailing it off to the States and say, ``Here. It is yours. You solve \nit.'' That is the block grant approach. When those State \nrepresentatives and State officials open that box they are going to \nfind a lot of problems. They are not going to find enough money to help \nthem solve those problems. Therefore, it is absolutely essential, in my \nopinion, that we forge a joint venture, a partnership with the States \nand the Federal Government, to help bring about the best ideas and the \nbest solutions to this problem working in partnership.\n  The Federal Government should absolutely have to contribute money \nfrom the tax base that we have access to to help generate sufficient \nfunds to solve the problems. But the States also have to participate.\n  There are some who would suggest that the States should have no \nmaintenance of effort at all. The Federal Government will pay the whole \nbill. But we will let the States get off without having to contribute \nanything. I think that is the wrong approach.\n  Tomorrow, myself and others will be joining together to offer an \namendment dealing with State maintenance of effort, to give the States \nan incentive to match Federal money to try to create a program that \nmakes sense. I am absolutely convinced that if State officials, no \nmatter how good and honest they are, know all the money in the program \nis going to be from Washington, they are less inclined to make the \nright decisions, to spend the money wisely, if they do not have to put \nup any of their own State dollars. Therefore, I think we have to urge \nthem to participate, to maintain most of the effort they have made in \nthe past and to join with us in a partnership arrangement to in fact \nsolve this problem.\n  Let me talk specifically just for a moment about the Dodd-Kennedy \namendment. I do not think that there is a social scientist or a \nhousewife or an individual in this country, no matter what their \nprofession, who can look at the welfare problem in this country and say \nthat we can solve it without addressing the problem of child care. We \ncannot solve welfare problems in this country just by passing a law \nthat says all mothers should go to work and do nothing about the \nmothers who have small children at home, maybe 1 or 2 or 3 years old. \nWe cannot pretend that if they have to go to work without something \nbeing done to help them with their child care, that is a real solution \nto welfare. In fact, that is not only not a solution, it in fact is a \ngreater problem than we have right now. The Republican proposal \nrequires--as does ours--that by the year 2000, 50 percent of the people \nwho are now on welfare have to be in work. The Republican proposal and \nthe Democratic proposal are the same essentially on that issue. The \ndifference is how we get people to that point. The Republican proposal \ndoes not provide any additional financial assistance to pay for child \ncare. That is the real defect in that approach.\n  Our legislation, on the other hand, provides $9.5 billion in new \nfunds over the next 7 years--which is more than paid for through \nspending cuts--to provide child care so people can go to work and we \ncan have true reform.\n  If the Republican proposal is adopted without the Dodd-Kennedy \namendment, we are passing the largest unfunded mandate on to the States \nin the history of this country. We would do this at a time when the ink \nis not yet dry on the unfunded mandate legislation that so many people \ntook so much credit for adopting--which recently this Congress passed \nand we sent to the President--saying that we are not going to pass an \nunfunded mandate on to the backs of the States any longer. But this \nbill without the Dodd-Kennedy amendment is, in fact, a huge unfunded \nmandate because it tells the States, Louisiana, or Massachusetts, or \nUtah, or any State in the Union, that they have to pay for the child \ncare to put half of the people on welfare to work by the year 2000.\n But they are not going to be able to reach that goal without raising \nan incredible amount of State taxes in order to pay for the child care.\n\n  I suggest that we ought to provide child care in partnership, the \nFederal Government and the States, and that is exactly what the Dodd-\nKennedy amendment does.\n  Over the next 5 years, Health and Human Services says that about $11 \nbillion would be needed to meet the child care requirements of the Dole \nbill. The Dodd-Kennedy amendment provides those funds. The Republican \nbill does not provide those funds.\n  I heard some suggest that the States will have more money because we \nwill eliminate some of the red tape. How many times have we heard the \nargument that if you eliminate red tape, we will solve all the problems \nof Government? I have heard it time after time in the years that I have \nbeen in the Congress, both in this body and the other body that, well, \nif you eliminate red tape, the States would have enough money to do \neverything they have to do. That is a ridiculous notion. It is not \ntrue, and it is not factual.\n  This reform is going to cost us money in order to achieve the long-\nterm results. I should point out that the long-term result will be \nfinancially beneficial to society. It will be beneficial to \nindividuals. It will make them more responsible citizens, and it will \nteach them that there is no free lunch; that people have to work in \norder to be able to be successful in this country.\n  But again, it has to be a partnership. I know that my State of \nLouisiana cannot come up with the necessary funds to meet that 50-\npercent-work requirement in the year 2000. We are suffering, as many \nStates are, from the lack of adequate funding for roads and hospitals \nand health care needs and all of the other needs that a State has to \naddress.\n  I suggest that child care is not a high priority among the people who \nget paid to lobby around State legislative bodies. Therefore, unless we \nrequire some type of a financial partnership to help provide for child \ncare for mothers who are going to be required to go to work, those \nmoneys will not be provided at the State and local level.\n  The General Accounting Office recently released a research study \nwhich provided evidence of what I am saying I think in a very \ncommonsense way. Their study, entitled Child Care Subsidies Increase \nthe Likelihood That Low-Income Mothers Will Work, finds that among the \nfactors which encourage low-income mothers to work, in fact, child care \naffordability is one of the decisive ones.\n  I think we should listen to the General Accounting Office, which \ncertainly is a bipartisan and nonpolitical organization, and their \nrecommendation that we simply cannot have real reform in welfare, that \nwe will not be able to get mothers who have small children to go to \nwork, unless there is an answer to the very difficult child care \nproblem. I have occasion from time to time in my State of Louisiana to \nvisit welfare offices, to talk with groups that are trying to reform \nthe welfare system, and great progress is being made, but in every one \nof these institutions, in every one of the talks I have been able to \nengage in, availability of child care was raised as such an important \ningredient in the solution to this particular problem.\n  Unless Congress acts in a forceful and affirmative way to guarantee \nchild care funding will be available, I suggest that no matter how \nlaudatory the other provisions of the bill happen to be, it will truly \nnot be reform. What it will be is a major unfunded mandate on the backs \nof the States.\n  I do not think we can find a Governor who is going to say they want \nto have to put 50 percent of the people to work without any help from \nthe Federal Government. This is an absolutely essential, critical \namendment. Without it, the bill I think will be fundamentally flawed \nand one that should not be signed into law.\n  If we are going to do real reform, we have to recognize our \nresponsibility in participating as a Federal Government along with the \nStates and local governments to build the necessary funds to bring \nabout a real reform bill.\n  I congratulate Senators Dodd and Kennedy and all others who have \njoined with them in helping to craft this amendment. They have worked \nlong and hard and tirelessly over the years to see to it that adequate \nchild care is part of any reform package that \n\n[[Page S 13178]]\nwe will consider in this Congress. Without it, this bill will not be \nreform. It will be highly destructive and should not be signed. With \nit, it will go a long way to fundamental bipartisan reform legislation \nto which President Clinton should proudly affix his signature.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, the Republican secret plan for deep cuts \nin Medicare will finally be unveiled, we are told, this Thursday. Yet, \nonly 4 days before the announcement, the Republican disinformation \ncampaign about what their program will mean for senior citizens is \nstill in high gear.\n  Before the 1994 election, the Republicans said they were not planning \nto cut Medicare at all, but their budget resolution provides for an \nunprecedented $270 billion in Medicare cuts. After the budget \nresolution was adopted, the Republicans said the cuts would not hurt \nsenior citizens. That pledge was preposterous on its face since cuts of \nthat magnitude would obviously have a substantial impact on millions of \nelderly Americans.\n  Now our Republican friends are beginning to reveal the true impact. \nYesterday, on ``Meet the Press,'' the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives stated that the Republican plan would require the part \nB premium for Medicare to be set at 31.5 percent of program costs. He \nclaimed that this program would cost senior citizens an additional $7 a \nmonth. He also said that the premium increases under the Republican \nplan are not in any way unreasonable.\n  The facts are otherwise. According to the independent actuaries at \nthe Health Care Finance Administration, if the premium is set at 31.5 \npercent of cost as the Republicans propose, the monthly premium will go \nup to $96 a month, an increase of $37 a month compared to current law, \nnot $7. On an annual basis, seniors will have to pay an additional $442 \nin the year 2002, a premium of almost $1,200 a year, more than twice as \nmuch as they pay today. That is from the Health Care Finance \nAdministration. Those are their estimates.\n  Over the life of the Republican plan, each senior citizen will have \nto pay an additional $1,750 in Medicare premiums. Each senior couple \nwould pay $3,500 more. These numbers are approximate because they are \nbased on current projected spending under Medicare part B. They will \nundoubtedly change somewhat when the full Republican plan is finally \nlaid out to the American people. Estimates by the Congressional Budget \nOffice may even be higher.\n  However, the basic point is clear. We are not talking about senior \ncitizens paying a few dollars more for Medicare. Under the Republican \nplan, senior citizens will be asked to pay thousands of dollars more \nfor Medicare in order to fund a Republican tax cut for wealthy \nAmericans.\n  That additional burden is unreasonable and unfair, and I believe the \nAmerican people will reject the Republican plan. I urge the Congress to \ndo so as well.\n  Mr. President, these figures that I am quoting are the result of the \nHealth Care Finance Administration and their actuaries from their \nevaluation of the Republican plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13178-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13178-S13182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to my colleague from \nMassachusetts very carefully, not only on the child care amendments but \nalso on capital gains, on the so-called Republican amendment, and how \nMedicare is going to be so seriously hurt if the Republican approach is \ntaken.\n  I do not think it is a Republican approach. It is a pro-American \napproach. Right now, I do not know of anybody who does not agree that \nMedicare is in serious financial condition and faces bankruptcy early \nin the next century.\n  As of next year it starts to go broke. By the year 2002 it will be \nbroke, and 37 million Americans will be the losers. I do not know why \nwe have to make this so partisan because I have to say the Democrats \nhave basically been virtually in control of Congress for all of the \nlast 40 years, every year that Medicare has been in existence. And here \nwe are today with Medicare's financial crisis.\n  Now, rather than complaining about efforts to try to save it, it \nseems to me they ought to pitch in and help us. The fact is, if we do \nnothing but throw authorized dollars that are not there, it is not \ngoing to solve the underlining problem. And under the approach that the \nHouse Members are taking, Medicare is going to increase 6.4 percent \neach year. Not only increase 6.4 percent, but the average payment under \nMedicare is currently $4,800 a year per senior and that will increase \nto $6,700 by the year 2002.\n  Clearly, nobody is cutting Medicare. The 37 million-plus \nbeneficiaries who currently are on Medicare will continue to be taken \ncare of. And, the program will be there for the rest of us in the \nfuture. The American people understood this when they, for the first \ntime in 40 years, put Republicans in control of the House of \nRepresentatives. The American people knew that if they kept business as \nusual by keeping Democrats in control--who believe the answer to \neverything is the Federal Government--then we would never solve \nMedicare's financial situation.\n  And Medicare is soon going to be broke if it is not fixed. And the \nMedicare trustees' April 3, 1995, report on part A, the Medicare \nHospital Insurance trust fund, under the most likely scenario, would be \nbankrupt in 7 years by the year 2002. It will begin running a deficit \nas early as October 1 of next year. The average two-income couple \nretiring in 1995, according to the Trustees Report--and four of the six \nTrustees are Clinton appointees--will receive $117,000 more in Medicare \nbenefits than they paid into the Trust Fund during their working lives. \nNow, I do not have any problem with that as long as we have a fiscally \nresponsible approach to solving the problems. So Congress will save \nMedicare, not by cutting it, but by slowing its rate of growth. This is \nbased not on rhetoric but on the Congressional Budget Office analysis.\n  The Budget resolution proposes to increase total Medicare spending \nfrom $181 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $276 billion in fiscal year \n2002--an increase of $96 billion or 52 percent overall.\n  As I said, the Budget resolution proposes to increase the amount \nspent per beneficiary from $4,800 in fiscal year 1995 to $6,700 in \nfiscal year 2002. That is $1,900 per person on Medicare or a 40 percent \nincrease over that 7-year period. Congress will increase spending over \n7 years by $355 billion more than if it were held at its current level. \nThat amount of increase is equal to twice the total amount that will be \nspent on Medicare this year.\n  Who is kidding whom? It is nice to get up and harangue about the fact \nthat we have to restrain the growth of Medicare. It is not a cut; it is \na reduction in growth. We cannot just assume that Medicare is going to \ncontinue to run off the charts at 10.4 percent every year. That is \ntotally unrealistic. It would bankrupt Medicare and jeopardize the \nprogram for future generations.\n  That is why we experienced a change in congressional leadership in \nthe last election. The American people, in despair, realized that the \nonly way they will get this problem under control is to get more \nmoderate to conservative leadership in the Congress. That is what they \ndid in voting for Republicans the last time.\n  Spending, as I said, is going to increase by 6.4 percent each year \nfor the next 7 years if the Republican budget resolution proposal is \nadopted. The slowed spending rate is designed to save Medicare--not to \nbalance the budget or pay for tax cuts. If the budget were balanced \ntoday, Medicare would still be broke tomorrow. Medicare's trustees, \nthree of whom are members of the Clinton Cabinet, have \n\n[[Page S 13179]]\nmade this clear, but the President refuses to admit it. And so \napparently do others here in the Senate.\n  Medicare reform is not related to Congress' promise of tax relief for \nAmerica's middle class. Clinton's charge to the contrary is \nhypocritical. His own budget combines slow growth in Medicare spending \nwith $110 billion in tax cuts. So who is kidding whom? Let us quit \nplaying politics. Let us do what is right for Medicare and the American \npeople. We have got to restrain the growth of this program and we have \ngot to do it now. And that means, in part, some people are going to be \nmeans tested, and some of us are going to have to pay slightly more \nPart B premiums.\n  I think President Clinton and those who support him and who are \nplaying politics with this are playing politics with our senior \ncitizens' health. Rather than focus on Medicare's problems, you do not \nhear any solutions from these people who have controlled Congress for \n40 years and who will control the White House for at least another 1\\1/\n2\\ years. You do not hear any solutions from them. Rather than focus on \nMedicare's problems, its impending bankruptcy, President Clinton seems \nto want to have us focus on politics and exaggerate spending \ndifferences between his and the Republican's plan.\n  When I hear that the Republicans want to hurt Medicare so they can \nfund their tax cuts for the wealthy, who is kidding whom? If you look \nat the Republican tax cuts, they primarily benefit the middle class. So \nlet us not kid each other. And let us quit playing politics and start \nfacing the facts and work together to solve this problem while, at the \nsame time, developing prudent tax policy that encourages growth, \neconomic development, and jobs enhancement rather than encouraging the \ngrowth of Federal spending.\n  A comparison of CBO's estimate of Congress' plan and the President's \nown estimation by the Office of Management and Budget of his plan shows \nthe spending differences to be minuscule. Medicare spending will \nincrease under both the President's and Congress' plan, assuming \nCongress will pass it.\n  Let us call it the Republican plan, if you want, because right now \nthat is fair. However, there are going to be Democrats who support it \nwho are as concerned about the future of Medicare as are Republicans \nwho now know that reform is inevitable. It is apparent that Medicare \nspending cannot continue at current levels if the program is to survive \nfor future generations of Americans.\n  And what is this rhetoric that cutting taxes is to take care of the \nwealthy? Proposed tax cuts are based on responsible reasons just as the \nRepublican Medicare reform proposals are based.\n  And, in fact, President Clinton's current budget is closer to \nCongress' than it is to the first one he proposed just 4 months \nearlier. The Clinton budget would spend 7.4 percent more every year for \nthe next 7 years. Congress would spend 6.4 percent.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, also, according to the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Federal benefits spending is going to grow by 6.4 percent. \nThe difference between Congress' plan and the President's--1 percent--\nis well less than the difference between projected spending under \ncurrent law--CBO says 9.98 percent--and the President's plan, a 1-\npercent difference. Yet, we hear this rhetoric that the Republicans are \ngoing to ruin Medicare and that they are going to take money away from \nthe poor and give it to the rich. That is simply not true, and it is \ntime for those who make those allegations to become more responsible \nand to stop misleading the American people.\n  True, the Republicans restrain the growth slightly more than the \nPresident's proposal, and I think there is a case, a very important \ncase, to be made that is an appropriate thing to do.\n  The reform differences are crucial, however. Under Congress' budget, \nthe problem is identified. Medicaid will be saved, and the budget will \nbe balanced. That is the difference. The problem is identified, \nMedicare will be saved, and the budget will be balanced under the \nRepublican approach. I should say, the Republican--with moderate/\nconservative Democrats--approach to solving the problem. Reform will \nmean Medicare is not only secure for the future but strengthened with \nmore choices, less waste, and less abuse.\n  So I felt I had to make a few comments about this issue because of \nsome of the comments made by several of my dear colleagues.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, both of whom are close \nand dear friends of mine, for their kind words about my involvement in \nthe enactment of the child care development block grant. I do, indeed, \nconsider this landmark legislation. I was proud to have played a role \nin its passage, and I have to say that working with my friends, the \nSenators from Connecticut and Massachusetts, as well as Senator \nMikulski from Maryland, to accomplish this legislation was certainly \none of the highlights of my last term in the Senate.\n  I agree with the thrust of the Senator's amendment in this case. I \nagree that we need more money for subsidized child care. I do not think \nanybody can disagree with that. The figures just show we need more \nmoney, not only to enable those on welfare to get off, but also to \nenable those who are working but have low income to stay off welfare.\n  I personally believe that child care is one of the key components to \nthe reduction of welfare rolls in virtually every State. These points \nare well made, they are well taken, and I do not know many Senators in \nthe Senate who would disagree with them. I have to say that if the \ndistinguished Senators were suggesting the mere addition of funds to \nthe CCDBG, the child care development block grant, or to the child care \ncarve-out that I am suggesting in title I, I think it would be a pretty \ntempting proposition. But I have several reservations about this \napproach. I am going to keep an open mind as we debate it, but I still \nhave several reservations.\n  First, it is a separate program, a new separate program established \ncompletely apart from title I. I believe we need to delineate funds for \nchild care under the welfare program, and the reason we do is because \nif you just block grant them to the Governors, children do not vote and \nit becomes too easy to use those funds for other children's programs. \nThat is a pretty wide array of programs, some of which may or may not \nbenefit children and may or may not benefit them very much, if at all.\n  So I think we do need to delineate funds, but I do not believe the \ntwo efforts should be so completely separated that they cannot be \neffectively coordinated. I believe this is particularly important if we \nwant to reduce the strain on the CCDBG, the child care development \nblock grant, to provide child care for a welfare population at the \nexpense of services for the working poor.\n  Second, one of the primary purposes of this block-grant approach is \nto simplify things for States. We want to spend less on bureaucracy at \nall levels and more on services at all levels. So I see no reason for a \nseparate State application and a different format, which is what this \namendment does. It just adds more bureaucracy, more Federal control, \nless money, less services, even though they are adding 6 billion new \ndollars.\n  Third, while I certainly appreciate what I take to be an effort of \nflexibility, I think subsection (e) is a little too flexible. Here I \nbelieve it is appropriate to specify that the use of funds are \nexclusively for child care services, not for a whole host of other \nchild-care-related functions performed by States and localities.\n  Along this line, I would like to see some indication that parents \nwill have a full array of child care options. My amendment, which we \nwill take up later, states that ``eligible providers'' are centers, \nfamily-based or church-based.\n  Then, finally, there is the dreaded ``M'' word, and that is \n``money.'' As I stated earlier, I agree that an excellent case could be \nmade for child care funding. In fact, I will be using similar arguments \nabout the need for child care during my presentation on my amendment to \nsplit child care funding out from title I funding. I hope I can deliver \nmy statement with as much passion as the Senator from Connecticut and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts have done, because I wholeheartedly \n\n[[Page S 13180]]\nbelieve that we must enable parents to access safe, affordable child \ncare.\n  The problem that I have with a quarter-billion-dollar add-on in the \nfirst year and a ballooning of that add-on to more than $3.7 billion in \nthe year 2000 is that unless the Appropriations Committee has been \nholding out on us and has a money tree somewhere that can grow an \nadditional $6 billion between now and the year 2000, I just do not \nthink that it is very wise or even fair to authorize this money and \npretend that it is going to materialize. Sitting on the Finance \nCommittee, I have to tell you, the Finance Committee already has to \ncome up with almost $600 billion in savings over the next 5 years.\n  I think an authorization should be realistic. It creates an \nexpectation among the States, local governments, and potential \nrecipients of this child care assistance, and we should not be \npromising that which we cannot deliver, and we cannot deliver at this \ntime an additional $6 billion on top of the moneys that we have. I wish \nwe could. If we could, I would certainly be in favor of doing it.\n  For those who work on these very crucial money committees, like the \nFinance Committee, I have to tell you, there are a lot of programs that \nare going to have to pay their fair share. I wish they could all be \nfunded to the fullest degree. It is a lot more fun to spend money than \nit is to conserve, but there comes a time in everybody's life when they \nhave to conserve, where they have to live within their means, where \nthey have to try and balance budgets, and this is that time. We cannot \ncontinue on the way we are going.\n  It is not enough to believe child care is the right thing to do; we \nhave to make it happen as well. I do have these problems, among others, \nwith my friend's amendment today. It is a matter of great concern to \nme, because as everybody knows, I take a very strong and vital interest \nin child care and have from the beginning and would like to think I \nplayed a significant role in passing the Child Care Development Block \nGrant Act, which I think was long overdue.\n  I suggest to my colleagues who agree with both the Senator from \nConnecticut and me that child care is an essential component of this \nbill that they will have an opportunity later on in this debate to \nsupport a carve-out for child care within the title I block grant.\n  I have offered my amendment, and I will be bringing it up during the \ndebate. I do believe that Senators will find that the Hatch child care \namendment is more workable and more viable as an alternative in the \noverall context of this welfare reform bill.\n  That is not to disparage the efforts of my friends, because like I \nsay, if the moneys were there, if we had a reasonable chance of getting \nthose moneys, if we really go could go out and find them somewhere, \ncertainly I would be very much in favor of trying to do that.\n But I am not in favor of creating an additional program to be run by \nHHS. The purpose of this is to block grant the funds to the States and \nlet the States use less bureaucracy and get the moneys to the people \nwho really need them--they claim they can do it better, and I have no \ndoubt about that--than if we launder it through the HHS, this humongous \nbureaucracy bank that eats it up as fast as we launder it through.\n\n  I should say there are some differences between our amendments, and \nmaybe I will speak on that later. I cannot find fault with anybody who \nfeels deeply about this, arguing for this amendment. I know my friends \nfrom Massachusetts and Connecticut feel very deeply, as do I, about the \nwhole issue of child care. We fought together on this floor for it, and \nwe fought a very difficult battle, which was very costly to some of us. \nI would do it over again. But I also think we have to look at reality, \ntoo. I just plain do not want to start another separate child care \nprogram when we have one that is working very well right now, that we \nfought for and gave a lot for and have seen work well once it was \nenacted.\n  Mr. President, I feel so deeply about child care issues. I feel \ndeeply about the single heads of household--primarily women, who do not \nknow where to turn, who really cannot work because they worry about \ntheir children. I worry about latchkey children, who do not have \nanybody to supervise them at home. I worry about 6- and 7-year-olds \nwatching over babies. These are all important points.\n  I think we should carve out and make it clear that we are going to \nprotect these people who do not have votes right now, because over the \nyears, as we have been concerned about our seniors--and rightly so--the \nbulk of the money is going to seniors because they vote, and the people \nwho are being left out are children because they cannot vote. That is \nwhy I think we should have a carve-out so they have to use this money \nfor child care and for the purposes of child care. But I do not think \nwe should be sending messages that we have $6 billion when we do not. \nThere is no real reason why we are going to have it.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum--I \nwithhold that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I know there \nare others of our colleagues who want to speak on this issue. I want to \nrespond very briefly to some comments that my friend and colleague from \nUtah made with regard to the Medicare issue.\n  Of course, as the Senator from Utah knows, it is not part B of \nMedicare that is in trouble now, it is part A. That is the part of the \nMedicare system that needs focus and attention. The increase in the \npremiums that the Speaker has talked about and that is part of the \nRepublican program is in the part B program. That is important to \nunderstand right at the outset.\n  We saw earlier in the year where the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives took $87 billion over ten years out of the Medicare \npart A trust fund in order to support their tax fund program. And still \nthey continue to advocate for $245 billion in tax relief, while they \nare cutting Medicare $270 billion. So while Medicare part A is the part \nthat is in difficulty, it is part B that we are going to have the \nincreases in. But part B is not subject to bankruptcy, from a statutory \npoint of view. That is important to understand. Again, it is part B \nwhere we are going to see the dramatic increases. Under the Republican \nplan, individuals will have to pay an additional $442 in the year \n2002--a premium of almost $1,200 a year. These increases will cost \nindividuals about $1,750 more in Medicare premiums over the life of the \nprogram, which means each senior couple will pay $3,500 more.\n  I just say, in response to my friend and colleague, that it does very \nlittle good, at least to the seniors in my State, to say, well, we are \nincreasing the amounts which we are expending for you in terms of \nMedicare, but we are not increasing them to the extent to cover your \nhealth care needs, as we have in the past. And you are going to have to \npay some $3,500 more. Maybe the seniors in Utah have a different \nreaction than the seniors in Massachusetts. People have paid into the \nMedicare system; they are working families. Two-thirds of them are \nmaking less than $17,000 a year, and $3,500 is a great deal of money \nfor any family, any middle-income family and any retirees. And to say \nto the seniors, well, we are raising the expenditures on Medicare, but \nnot the amount to cover the same range of health care services to the \nextent of $3,500 to the seniors in my State. They say that is a cut.\n  Here is the final point I will make with regard to the Medicare. \nFirst of all, we find that the statement the Speaker made with regard \nto a $7 a month increase in the part B premium is absolutely wrong. \nAccording to the Health Care Financing Administration, the monthly \npremium will go up to $96 a month in the year 2002, an increase of $37 \na month, not $7 a month.\n  So it is important that seniors understand, as this debate takes \nplace, what the facts are. There is going to be up to $37 a month \nincrease, not $7 a month increase, in the year 2002 alone. And \nindividuals will pay $1,750 more over the next 7 years of the program \nand couples will pay $3,500 more. So the argument that we will be \nraising the reimbursement falls flat to the seniors of my State that \nwill be paying that much more--$3,500 more--over the next 7 years.\n  Finally, it is important in health care to understand what has been \ngoing \n\n[[Page S 13181]]\non in Medicare over the last 10 years. The fact is that Medicare, per \npatient, has not increased as much as in the private sector. We \nunderstand that. The increases in Medicare for treatment has not \nincreased as much as the cost for the treatment of those that are not \nin Medicare. The increase in the costs, therefore, are a result of the \nCongress not acting to hold costs down. And to say to our senior \ncitizens that it is just too bad that you are paying more out of your \npocket because we in Congress refuse to come to grips with the \nescalation of health care costs, I find to be an unsatisfactory way to \napproach this situation.\n  Mr. President, I daresay we will have more of a chance to deal with \nand discuss the Medicare issue. I think it is obviously an overarching, \noverriding issue, because it involves the social compact which is a \npart of Social Security. Social Security and Medicare are part of one \nsingle contract. We heard a great deal around here about how we are not \ngoing to cut Social Security, but somehow that promise did not, for \nsome reason, extend to Medicare. And now we have seen at the beginning \nof that debate, which will continue over the period of these next few \nweeks, serious misrepresentations in terms of the costs for our \nseniors. That is a disservice to the debate and discussion which needs \nto take place.\n  So, Mr. President, finally, let me just say this regarding the \nSenator's comments on the child care proposal. As the Senator from \nConnecticut and I have stated during the course of this debate, the \nprovisions in the child care and the discretionary program would not be \nlaw today if the Senator from Utah had not supported those provisions.\n  That was at a time when we had real renewed attention and focus on \nthe issues of children. It was at a time we were debating the Family \nand Medical Leave Program on which my friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, was a leader up here, as well as on the \nchild care program where, again, he, Senator Hatch, Senator Kassebaum, \nand others were the real leaders.\n  When he speaks and expresses his commitment and concern, all who have \nbeen a part of this whole process respect that.\n  The only point I make is that we are, in characterizing this \namendment, as the Senator provides $1 billion for earmarking for the \nchild care program in a way that it will work its way through the block \ngrants to the States and through the State organization, we have \naccepted that same approach in terms of the Dodd-Kennedy increase in \nfunding.\n  We are following identically the same kind of process. The difference \nis we will meet the responsibilities to the increased demand for child \ncare, we think. We all respect the approach of the Senator from Utah \nthat falls far short.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend here from Minnesota. I expect the \nSenator wants some time.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes and 22 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts that I will not use any of this time to talk about health \ncare, but I do want to associate myself with his remarks. I think we \nreally will have a nationally and historically significant debate about \nMedicare and health care policy soon which will be extremely important \nfor this Nation.\n  I hope people throughout the country are very engaged in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be included as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Kennedy-Dodd bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would provide a direct \nspending grant to States of $11 billion over the next 5 years, which is \nprecisely the amount that HHS estimates the child care would cost under \nthe Dole bill.\n  I say to my colleague from Utah and I say to the rest of my \ncolleagues, as well, that you cannot have real health care reform, as \nopposed to what I describe as reverse reform, which is what we have \nright now with the Dole bill, unless you have a commitment to family \nchild care. This amendment really invests the necessary resources.\n  Mr. President, there have been any number of different studies in \nMinnesota, and I cite one study by the Greater Minneapolis Day Care \nAssociation in 1995. I am not even going to go through all the \nstatistics because sometimes I think our discussion on the floor of the \nSenate becomes too cut and dried when we just focus on statistics.\n  The long and the short of the study is that there are many families, \nsingle-parent and two-parent families, that really are doing everything \nthey can to get on their own two feet and be able to work. The problem \nis affordable child care.\n  In cases of a single-parent family--and when we talk about welfare \nfamilies, we are talking in the main about a family with a woman as a \nsingle parent. I wish men would accept more responsibility. I know the \nChair agrees with me 100 percent on that. In the case of a single-\nparent family welfare mom, quite often the pattern over a period of \ntime is that a mother will move from welfare to workfare. But then what \nhappens is the cost of child care is so prohibitively high or it is \njust so difficult to find the child care in the first place, or the \nchild becomes sick for a week and the mother loses her job, you name \nit, that she has to then go back to welfare.\n  I am all for the welfare reform. Guess what? It is not just Senators \nthat are for the welfare reform. The citizens that are most for real \nreform as opposed to something which is punitive and degrading are the \nwelfare mothers themselves, the ones who all too many Senators have \nbeen bashing for the last week and a half.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is extremely important. If we want to \nhave the reform, we have to invest the resources into affordable child \ncare.\n  Mr. President, I noticed there is a provision now in the Dole bill \nwhich I think is interesting and I think it is relatively important, \nwhich essentially says, as I understand it, that if, in fact, the State \ndoes not allocate the money or does not have the resources for the \naffordable child care for the mother, then the mother would not be \nsanctioned by not taking a job and going into the work force.\n  That makes a lot of sense because these mothers, like all parents, \nare worried about their children.\n  By the way, Mr. President, if we have silly cutoffs like 1 year, it \ndoes not make any sense. I am a father of three children, a grandfather \nof two, going to be a grandfather of three in the next month or so, and \nI can tell you that a child at 1 year and 1 week is not exactly ready \nto clean the kitchen, do the housework, stay at home alone, et cetera.\n  The question is, what happens to these small children? The last thing \nin the world we want to do is punish children.\n  This commitment of some resources to child care goes some way toward \nmaking this real welfare reform as opposed to reformatory; that is to \nsay, something which is punitive and puts children in jeopardy.\n  The second point I want to make, Mr. President, with this provision \nthat is now in the Dole bill, is that as I see it, if this provision is \ntaken seriously, what will happen is a lot of this is just going to be \nat a standstill because as a matter of fact without the commitment of \nresources for child care, and we did not have that commitment of \nresources in the Dole bill--this amendment attempts to invest those \nresources--a lot of mothers will be in a position back in our States of \nsaying with the long waiting lists already for affordable child care, \nwithout the resources to be able to afford it, these are low-income \nwomen, they will be able to say we cannot go to work because we do not \nknow what will happen to our children, there is no affordable child \ncare for our children, in which case according to the provision in the \nbill they would not have to go into the work force.\n  There is some good news to that, because I do not think we should \ncoerce a mother into going into the work force. Taking care of children \nat home is very important work, whether it is a mother or a father. \nWithout the child care, she cannot do it. \n\n[[Page S 13182]]\n\n  On the other hand, then, the whole promise of this reform of enabling \nwelfare mothers, sometimes welfare fathers, to be able to work becomes \na promise that is never fulfilled. This amendment goes a long way \ntoward enabling us to fulfill that promise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in a minute, I cannot even do justice \nto the point I will try to make.\n  What has cropped up in this debate I think is a very interesting \nargument, which is all too often some of my colleagues will say, well, \nlook, if you have a family with an income of $35,000, maybe two \nparents, they are paying for child care, why should we talk about \ninvestment of resources for affordable child care for welfare mothers?\n  I do not know why we are paying off middle-income and moderate-income \ncitizens versus low-income women. We should focus on what is good for \nthe children.\n  The fact of the matter is our country has not made a commitment to \naffordable child care. It is a shame. This is a perfect example of \nwhere we could allocate some of the resources at the Federal level and \ndecentralize it and let all the good things happen at the community \nlevel, at the neighborhood level --be it for low income, moderate \nincome, middle income--with some sort of sliding fee scale.\n  That is really the direction we ought to go, not in the direction of \nnot investing resources in child care and therefore putting mothers in \na difficult position, and most important of all, punishing children.\n  This is a very important amendment which really kind of is a litmus \ntest as to whether we are serious about reform as opposed to \nreformatory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I might, let me inquire how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 14 minutes \nand 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. On the side of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 67 minutes and 22 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I would just inquire of my colleague from Utah if I might \ntake 5 of his minutes? I am fearful he may not be on the floor, someone \nelse may come over, and we will have run out of all of our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Should I say a few words first? Or I will be happy to wait.\n  Mr. DODD. No, go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13178-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13182-S13183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CAPITAL GAINS DEBATE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is not quite on this subject, but since \nmy friend from Massachusetts raised the issue I thought I would just \nspend a few minutes on it because it is something that is near and dear \nto my heart and I think near and dear to, really, those of a pretty \ngood majority of this body.\n  One of the worst perceptions about the capital gains debate is that \nonly the rich are going to benefit from a capital gains rate reduction. \nMy friend from Massachusetts implied that and implied that those of us \nwho are for a capital gains rate reduction are basically taking care of \nour good old rich friends. I do not have many rich friends. I have to \nsay that I was born in poverty, came up the hard way. I am one of the \nfew in this body who learned a trade, went through a formal \napprenticeship program, became a journeyman and worked in the building \nconstruction trade unions for 10 years, putting myself through high \nschool. I had to work to get through high school, college and law \nschool. So I do not think it is a matter of rich friends at all.\n  The fact of the matter is, nothing could be further from the truth \nwith regard to capital gains. In fact, Americans at all economic levels \nwill benefit from increased growth. President John F. Kennedy once \nsaid, basically while he was enacting a capital gains rate reduction \nwhich proved to be very efficacious for our country, ``a rising tide of \ninvestment lifts all boats.'' President Kennedy supported a capital \ngains cut because thousands of middle-class Americans would benefit \nfrom it.\n  In 1992, 56 percent of Federal income tax returns claiming capital \ngains--56 percent of those returns claiming capital gains--were from \ntaxpayers with incomes of $50,000 or less, and 83 percent came from \ntaxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000. Almost all of them came \nfrom people who earned less than $100,000. But, again, keep in mind, 56 \npercent came from those who earned less than $50,000. Only the rich?\n  The preferential capital gains tax benefits every American who \nbelieves in the American dream, who is willing to take a risk for a \nlong-term reward. Millions of American families that own farms or small \nbusinesses will benefit from the capital gains tax. Yes, in 1 year of \ntheir productive lives, a husband and wife may have a high income, in \nthe year they sell their family farm or small business. But that is one \nreason these statistics can be so misleading. The capital gains \ndifferential is just as much about Main Street as it is Wall Street. \nThis amendment rewards risk taking and sacrifice, and that is the right \nthing to do.\n  The opponents of the capital gains tax rate cut argue that it \nbenefits mostly the wealthiest income groups. This assertion is based \non deceptive statistics. The income figures used in these statistics \ninclude the taxpayer's entire income, which includes the capital gain. \nThis makes the capital gains tax cut appear to be a tax cut for the \nrich.\n  A far more accurate picture results when only recurring or ordinary \nincome is considered. Let me give an example. An elderly couple living \nin Cache County, UT, has been farming on land they owned for 40 years. \nThe land was purchased for $50,000 in 1950. They decided to retire to \nSt. George, UT, and thus, they sell their farm for $250,000 after \nfarming it for 40 years, having paid $50,000 for it.\n  This couple has never reported more than $35,000 of gross income on \ntheir tax returns in their life, never more than $35,000 in any given \nyear. But in the year of the sale of their farm, they report more than \n$200,000 of gross income. Are these people among the very wealthiest \nincome earners of our Nation? Of course not.\n  The Department of the Treasury statistics show that this example is \nnot just the exception, it is the rule. If capital gains are excluded \nfrom income, only about 5 percent of tax returns containing long-term \ncapital gains have incomes of over $200,000. Only 5 percent.\n  A Treasury study covering 1985 shows that taxpayers with wage and \nsalary income of less than $50,000 realized nearly one-half of all \ncapital gains in 1985. In addition, three-quarters of all returns with \ncapital gains were reported by taxpayers with wage and salary income of \nless than $50,000 in that year. So let us not kid anybody. Of course, \nthose who are wealthy will benefit, but they generally put their moneys \nback into investments or into businesses, into creation of jobs and \neconomic opportunity for others. So we should not begrudge the fact \nthat they benefit as well.\n  But a huge, huge number of middle-class people benefit from capital \ngains rate reductions not just because they themselves have capital \ngains to pay taxes on, but because they benefit from the stimulation of \nthe economy that occurs when money is rolled over and utilized in \ncreating new jobs and new job opportunities.\n  A Joint Tax Committee analysis of the years 1979 to 1983 found that \n44 percent of taxpayers reporting gains realized a gain in only 1 out \nof 5 years. This is the occasional investor, the home or business \nowner, who is realizing these gains. When we move beyond the class \nwarfare rhetoric, we find that capital gains tax cuts help working \nAmericans.\n  High capital gains taxes especially hurt elderly taxpayers. Capital \ngains for seniors average four to five times the size for capital gains \nfor younger taxpayers. In fact, in any year more than 40 percent of \ntaxpayers over the age of 60 pay capital gains taxes.\n  So, the fact of the matter is, it is deceptive to argue that capital \ngains benefit only the wealthy. They benefit everybody.\n  I believe if we cut capital gains, we will unleash some of the $8 \ntrillion in \n\n[[Page S 13183]]\nthis economy that is locked up in capital assets that people will not \nsell because they do not want to pay 28 to 39 percent in a capital \ngains tax. Once we unleash that--if we could just unleash 10 percent of \nthat money, can you imagine what a stimulation and stimulus that would \nbe to our economy?\n  Taxpayers are very sensitive to capital gains reductions. This is \nespecially true for the most affluent Americans. As a result, Americans \nwill realize many gains as soon as the rate changes. This will raise \ntax revenue, probably by an amount far above joint tax estimates.\n  Joint tax estimates are among the most conservative estimates you can \nhave. I will not go into the details on this, but we can say in the \nlast 30 years, every time capital gains rates have gone up, revenues to \nthe Federal Government have gone down from selling capital assets. \nEvery time capital gains rates have been dropped, or lowered, revenues \nto the Government have gone up. It just makes sense, especially when \nyou realize there is $8 trillion locked up in capital assets that they \nwill not sell, they will not trade, they will not move because of the \nhigh rate of taxation that we have today.\n  Let us lower that capital gains rate and benefit all Americans, but \nespecially--especially--the middle class and those earning under \n$50,000 a year who will benefit greatly from it, and get some sense \ninto this system so we push the better aspects of our system. Let us \nget rid of some of this demeaning rhetoric that literally cuts into \nthe--really cuts against what are the real facts with regard to capital \ngains and capital gains rate reductions.\n  I am very strongly for a capital gains rate reduction because I think \nit will benefit virtually everybody in our society, the poor as well, \nbecause there will be more jobs and more economic opportunity than \nbefore the rates are cut.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13182-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13183-S13199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield \n5 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I just want to put in the Record some of the comments \nfrom some of the leading church and legislative and active groups that \nhave been focusing on the welfare debate. I will include all of the \nstatements in the Record. But I would like to refer at this time to \nindividual sentences and comments that summarize their position.\n  One was from the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the \nUSA. It said:\n\n       The religious community is a major provider of center-based \n     child care. Throughout the nation, millions of children are \n     cared for every day in church-housed child care. Our churches \n     have long waiting lists of parents seeking quality care for \n     their children. We are not able to accommodate the demand \n     because the resources to expand the supply are so scarce. We \n     know this problem first hand, because the desperate parents \n     are in our congregations, as are the overworked providers of \n     child care services. Their facilities are in our buildings, \n     and our congregations are enriched by the lively presence of \n     their children.\n       We believe that it is not responsible public policy to \n     require parents to work without providing adequately for \n     their children's safety and nurture while the parents are at \n     their jobs. If the government is going to insist that mothers \n     of young children leave them to go into the workplace, then \n     the government must make it possible for the parents to do so \n     in the confidence that their children are in a safe, \n     wholesome environment. To do otherwise puts our children at \n     risk and almost guarantees that parents, preoccupied with \n     concern for the well-being of their youngsters, will not \n     perform to the best of their ability.\n\n  That is an excellent statement of the National Council of the \nChurches of Christ.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\n       NCSL has been concerned about the lack of coordination of \n     existing child care funding streams. We are interested in \n     working with you to consolidate these funds. Child care is an \n     essential component to support welfare recipients moving from \n     welfare to work and is critical for low-income working \n     families. Our experience suggests that a renewed commitment \n     to work by welfare recipients will require additional child \n     care funds above current levels.\n\n  That is the National Conference of State Legislatures; that is, \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  The American Public Welfare Association:\n\n       Current proposals in the Senate do not create a separate \n     state block grant for all child care programs. APWA supports \n     a separate child care block grant, in the form of an \n     entitlement to states, not as a discretionary spending \n     program subject to annual funding reductions. States will not \n     be able to move clients from welfare to work without adequate \n     and flexible funding to provide essential child care \n     services.\n\n  Catholic Charities:\n\n       We are very concerned that the new work requirements and \n     time limits for AFDC participation will leave children \n     without adequate adult supervision while their parents are \n     working or looking for work. The key to successful work \n     programs is safe, affordable, quality day care for the \n     children. The bill before the Senate does not guarantee or \n     increase funding for day care to meet the increased need \n     associated with the work requirements and time limits. \n     Please, support amendments by Senators Hatch and Kennedy to \n     guarantee adequate funding to keep children safe while their \n     mothers try to earn enough to support them.\n\n  The Governor of Ohio:\n\n       I would like to see the child care and family nutrition \n     block grants converted into capped state entitlements. In the \n     House bill, funding for these block grants is discretionary. \n     Key child care programs currently are individual \n     entitlements. The need for child care only will grow as \n     welfare recipients move into the workforce.\n\n  The National Parent Teacher Association:\n\n       The potential for success of welfare reform depends on \n     former recipients becoming employed an being able to meet \n     basic needs for shelter, food, health care and child care. \n     Subsidized child care for low income working parents is \n     crucial.\n\n  Every single organization that has responsibility and which has \nstudied this is and which are out on the front lines on the issue of \nwelfare reform has understood the importance of providing child care, \nand the Dodd-Kennedy amendment provides it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these documents be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNational Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA--Statement on the \n               Importance of Child Care in Welfare Reform\n\n(By Mary Anderson Cooper, Associate Director, Washington Office, August \n                                9, 1995)\n\n       As the Senate works to overhaul the nation's welfare \n     system, we urge Senators to make the well-being of those who \n     are impacted by that system their primary concern. As people \n     of faith and religious commitment, we are called to stand \n     with and seek justice for people who are poor. This is \n     central to our religious traditions, sacred texts, and \n     teachings. We are convinced, therefore, that welfare reform \n     must not focus on eliminating programs but on eliminating \n     poverty and the damage it inflicts on children (who are \\2/3\\ \n     of all welfare recipients), on their parents, and on the rest \n     of society.\n       Further, we support the goal of helping families to leave \n     welfare through employment, because we believe that those who \n     are able to work have a right and a responsibility to do so. \n     However, we also recognize that just finding a job will not \n     necessarily mean either that a family should leave welfare or \n     that its poverty will end. Since full-time jobs at minimum \n     wage yield a family income that is below the poverty line, \n     and since such jobs often do not provide health care \n     benefits, employed people trying to leave welfare may still \n     need some government subsidy in order to become self-\n     supporting.\n       Key among the kinds of help such people need is child care. \n     The Children's Defense Fund tells us that one in four mothers \n     in their twenties who were out of the labor force in 1986 \n     said they were not working because of child care problems \n     (high cost, lack of availability, poor quality or location, \n     lack of transportation, etc.). Among poor women, 34% said \n     they were not working because of child care problems.\n       The Government Accounting Office tells us that increasing \n     the supply of child care would raise the work participation \n     rates of poor women from 29 to 44 percent. For near-poor \n     women, the rates would rise from 43 to 57 percent. Thus, \n     increasing the supply of safe, quality, affordable child care \n     would help some women escape poverty while helping others \n     avoid falling into it in the first place.\n       The religious community is a major provider of center-based \n     child care. Throughout the nation, millions of children are \n     care for every day in church-housed child care. Our churches \n     have long waiting lists of parents seeking quality care for \n     their children. We \n\n[[Page S 13184]]\n     are not able to accommodate the demand because the resources to expand \n     the supply are so scarce. We know this problem first hand, \n     because the desperate parents are in our congregations, as \n     are the overworked providers of child care services. Their \n     facilities are in our buildings, and our congregations are \n     enriched by the lively presence of their children.\n       We believe that it is not responsible public policy to \n     require parents to work without providing adequately for \n     their children's safety and nurture while the parents are at \n     their jobs. If the government is going to insist that mothers \n     of young children leave them to go into the workplace, then \n     the government must make it possible for the parents to do so \n     in the confidence that their children are in a safe, \n     wholesome environment. To do otherwise puts our children at \n     risk and almost guarantees that parents, preoccupied with \n     concern for the well-being of their youngsters, will not \n     perform to the best of their ability.\n       The issue of child care has been nearly absent from the \n     congressional debate on welfare reform. Consequently, we are \n     particularly grateful to Senator Daschle for making child \n     care a key feature of his legislation. We commend him for \n     raising the visibility of this issue and look forward to \n     working with him to assure that adequate provisions for child \n     care are included in any welfare bill that is approved by the \n     Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Packwood,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Packwood: We are writing to thank you for your \n     public commitment to state flexibility as a principle in your \n     welfare reform legislation. The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL) is especially pleased by your recognition \n     of the critical role of state legislators in welfare reform \n     and other programs that serve children and families. We \n     appreciate your confidence in our ability to design programs \n     that best serve the needs in our states and urge you to \n     consider our views as you finalize your welfare reform \n     legislation.\n       We are encouraged by your endorsement of providing more \n     discretion to state decisionmakers and rejecting provisions \n     that micromanage and limit state authority to determine \n     eligibility. However, state legislators are concerned about \n     several provisions under consideration that have the \n     potential to limit state authority, shift major costs to the \n     states and violate NCSL's policy on block grants. The balance \n     of this letter specifies our concerns in six major areas. In \n     summary, we urge you to reconsider the consolidation of open-\n     ended entitlements for child protection services, work \n     requirements in the cash assistance block grant, denial of \n     benefits to legal immigrants, the absence of real protection \n     for states to respond to economic change, the consolidation \n     of child care funding, and timing to successfully implement \n     revised programs.\n       I understand that your are still considering a block grant \n     for child protection funds. State legislators believe that \n     foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments and \n     administrative funding under Title IV-E must be maintained as \n     an open-ended entitlement. Children in danger cannot be told \n     that the government ran out of money to protect them. We must \n     respond to those who turn to us as a last resort. The demand \n     for these services has not been predicted well at the federal \n     level. No one predicted the damage that HIV infection, crack \n     cocaine and homelessness would do to children's security \n     within their families. No one anticipated the resulting \n     increase in state and federal costs. Courts will decide to \n     remove children from unsafe homes and states must respond to \n     these decisions. We urge you to reject the child protection \n     block grant.\n       We are disappointed with the prescriptive work and \n     participation requirements in H.R. 4. State legislators are \n     interested in creating our own programs, not running a \n     uniform program with federally-determined program details and \n     fewer funds. We oppose federal micromanagement in the \n     definition or type or work, the role of training, minimum \n     number of hours a recipient must work, and participation \n     rates. These are precisely the decisions each state should \n     make based on local needs. We do support measurement of \n     outcomes and performance data to ensure that program goals \n     are being met.\n       NCSL strongly opposes the denial of benefits to legal \n     immigrants. The federal government has sole jurisdiction over \n     immigration policy and must bear the responsibility to serve \n     the immigrants it allows to enter states and localities. The \n     denial of benefits will shift the costs to state budgets. \n     Eliminating benefits to noncitizens or deeming for \n     unreasonably long periods will not eliminate the need, and \n     state and local budgets and taxpayers will bear the burden. \n     Denial of services to legal immigrants by states appears to \n     violate both state and federal constitutional provisions. We \n     continue to support making affidavits of support legally \n     binding.\n       NCSL supports the development of a contingency funds to \n     assist states to respond to changes in population and the \n     economy rather than a loan fund. The absence of adequate \n     protections for states with population growth, economic \n     changes and disasters is a barrier to state support of a cash \n     assistance block grant. We believe that a loan fund is not \n     sufficient assurance of federal assistance. The federal \n     government must participate as a partner in a fund that has a \n     mechanism for budget adjustment so that states are not overly \n     burdened by increased demand for services.\n       NCSL has been concerned about the lack of coordination of \n     existing child care funding streams. We are interested in \n     working with you to consolidate these funds. Child care is an \n     essential component to support welfare recipients moving from \n     welfare to work and is critical for low-income working \n     families. Our experience suggests that a renewed commitment \n     to work by welfare recipients will require additional child \n     care funds above current levels. A consolidated child care \n     fund should stand alone.\n       Finally, state legislators will need adequate transition \n     time to successfully implement revised income security and \n     related programs. States will have to modify their laws to \n     comport with new federal legislation, restructure their \n     administrative bureaucracies and revise their FY96 and FY97 \n     budgets that have been enacted on the basis of current law \n     and federal spending guarantees. We urge inclusion of a \n     provision giving states no less than one year of transition \n     time and consideration for additional time for states that \n     meet biennially.\n       We look forward to working with you throughout this \n     process. Please contact Sheri Steisel or Michael Bird in \n     NCSL's Washington Office to further discuss our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jane L. Campbell,\n       President, NCSL, Assistant House Minority Leader, Ohio.\n     James J. Lack,\n       President-elect, NCSL, Senator, New York.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  American Public Welfare Association\n\n (By Gerald H. Miller, President, and A. Sidney Johnson III, Executive \n                               Director)\n\n\n                Serious Shortfall in Child Care Funding\n\n       By increasing the number of participants required to work \n     and maintaining child care funds at the FY 94 level, current \n     welfare reform proposals in the Senate would significantly \n     hinder states' efforts to move welfare recipients into the \n     workforce. There is clear congressional intent to require \n     states to meet higher participation rates, which cannot be \n     met if child care is unavailable. CBO estimates, presented in \n     testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, indicate that \n     the child care needed to meet proposed participation rates, \n     will cost approximately 5 times the current proposed \n     allocation. Based on those estimates, states will face a \n     serious child care funding crisis.\n       Current proposals in the Senate do not create a separate \n     state block grant for all child care programs. APWA supports \n     a separate child care block grant, in the form of an \n     entitlement to states, not as a discretionary spending \n     program subject to annual funding reductions. States will not \n     be able to move clients from welfare to work without adequate \n     and flexible funding to provide essential child care \n     services.\n\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The amount of money allocated for child care is not \n     adequate given the work participation requirements in the \n     bill. Welfare reform legislation, in outlining work \n     provisions and requirements, should recognize and address \n     both programatically and financially the distinct role of \n     child care in clients' ability to obtain and retain \n     employment. Child care is an essential component for \n     successfully moving people to self-sufficiency. Moreover, no \n     work program can succeed without a commitment to making \n     quality child care available for recipients.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Catholic Charities, USA,\n\n                                                   August 4, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate takes up welfare reform, we \n     urge you to adopt provisions to strengthen families, protect \n     children, and preserve the nation's commitment to fighting \n     child poverty.\n       Across this country, 1,400 local agencies and institutions \n     in the Catholic Charities network serve more than 10 million \n     people annually. Last year alone, Catholic Charities USA \n     helped more than 138,000 women, teenagers, and their families \n     with crisis pregnancies. Because Catholic agencies run the \n     full spectrum of services, from soup kitchens and shelters to \n     transitional and permanent housing, they see families in all \n     stages of problems as well as those who have escaped poverty \n     and dependency.\n       This broad experience, along with our religious tradition \n     which defends human life and human dignity, compels us to \n     share our strong convictions about welfare reform.\n       The first principle in welfare reform must be, ``Do no \n     harm.'' Along with the U.S. Catholic Conference, the National \n     Right-to-Life Committee, and other pro-life organizations, we \n     have vigorously opposed child-exclusion provisions such as \n     the ``family cap'' and denial of cash assistance for children \n     born to teenage mothers or for whom paternity has not yet \n     been legally established.\n       We are also convinced that the idea of rewarding states for \n     reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies is well-intentioned but \n     dangerously light of the fact that the only state experiment \n     in this regard, the New Jersey family cap, already has \n     increased abortions without any significant reduction in \n     births. The ``illegitimacy ratio'' may well encourage states \n     to engage in similar experiments that \n\n[[Page S 13185]]\n     would result in more abortions and more suffering.\n       We also support Senator Kent Conrad's amendment, which not \n     only would require teen mothers to live under adult \n     supervision and continue their education, but also would \n     provide resources for ``second-chance homes'' to make that \n     requirement a reality.\n       The second principle should be to protect children. We are \n     very concerned that the new work requirements and time limits \n     for AFDC participation will leave children without adequate \n     adult supervision while their parents are working or looking \n     for work. The key to successful work programs is safe, \n     affordable, quality day care for the children. The bill \n     before the Senate does not guarantee or increase funding for \n     day care to meet the\n      increased need associated with the work requirements and \n     time limits. Please, support amendments by Senators Hatch \n     and Kennedy to guarantee adequate funding to keep children \n     safe while their mothers try to earn enough to support \n     them.\n       The third principle should be to maintain the national \n     safety net for children. We oppose block granting Food \n     Stamps, even as a state option, because the Food Stamp \n     program is the only national program available to feed poor \n     children of all ages with working parents as well as those on \n     welfare. On the whole, the Food Stamp program works well, \n     ensuring that children in even the poorest families do not \n     suffer from malnutrition.\n       We are encouraged by the fact that Senator Dole's bill does \n     not seek to cut or erode federal support for child protection \n     in the child welfare system. Proposals to block grant these \n     essential protections are ill-advised and dangerous to \n     children who are already abused, neglected, abandoned, and \n     totally at the mercy of state child welfare systems. Federal \n     rules and guarantees are essential to the safety of children.\n       The fourth principle should be fairness to all citizens. \n     Certain proposals before the Senate would create a new \n     category of ``second-class citizenship,'' making immigrants \n     ineligible for most federal programs, even after they become \n     naturalized Americans. We urge you to reject this and other \n     proposals that would leave legal immigrants without the \n     possibility of assistance when they are in genuine need.\n       The fifth principle should be to maintain the national \n     commitment to fighting child poverty. In exchange for federal \n     dollars and broad flexibility, states should be expected to \n     maintain at least their current level of support for poor \n     children and their families. We understand that Senator \n     Breaux will offer such an amendment on the Senate floor. \n     Please give it your support.\n       In our Catholic teaching, all children, but especially poor \n     and unborn children, have a special claim to the protection \n     of society and government. Please vote for proposals that \n     keep the federal government on their side.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Fred Kammer, SJ,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    State of Ohio,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                   March 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As you know, the House of \n     Representatives has completed its consideration of welfare \n     reform legislation. While I strongly support the decision \n     made by the House to convert welfare programs into block \n     grants, I am concerned that the House bill fails to provide \n     states with the flexibility needed to set our own priorities \n     and conduct innovative experiments to promote responsibility \n     and self-sufficiency. Many of my fellow Republican Governors \n     share a number of my concerns.\n       I was disappointed with the allocation formula established \n     through the Temporary Family Assistance Block Grant. It is \n     the position of the National Governors' Association that any \n     formula should allow states to use either a three-year \n     average or 1994 spending levels in determining base year \n     allocations. While the House formula includes this choice, it \n     then applies a 2.4-percent reduction factor to each state's \n     allocation. The reduction factor leaves Ohio with a base year \n     allocation of $700 million annually, which is lower than what \n     we would have received using either formula without a \n     reduction factor. Speaker Gingrich assured states he would \n     support eliminating the reduction factor. We would like to \n     work with you in the Senate to make this correction.\n       Although allowing each state to receive its most favorable \n     allocation without a reduction factor requires funding for \n     the block grant to be increased by approximately $200 million \n     nationally, it is important to remember that states are \n     making a significant financial sacrifice in supporting capped \n     block grants. If states are disadvantaged in determining base \n     year allocations, it becomes even more difficult to make the \n     increased investments in work programs necessary to move \n     individuals off welfare.\n       The House bill also does not include sufficient protections \n     for states in the event of an economic downturn. If Congress \n     replaces open-ended individual entitlements with capped state \n     entitlements, states are placed in an extremely vulnerable \n     position should the welfare-eligible population increase \n     significantly. The state and federal governments should be \n     partners in meeting the needs of expanded caseloads in \n     recessions. The House bill contains a $1 billion rainy day \n     fund designed to provide the states with short-term loans,\n      repayable with interest in three years. A loan fund does not \n     represent a partnership; instead it is a cost shift.\n       Ohio would be particularly disadvantaged in a recession due \n     to aggressive steps already taken to reduce welfare \n     caseloads. Today, 85,000 fewer Ohioans receive welfare than \n     in 1992. States that have not been aggressive in reducing \n     their welfare rolls will be better able to accommodate \n     increased caseloads. Ohio's streamlined base makes it very \n     difficult for us to absorb increased recessionary demands.\n       As part of our efforts to reduce welfare caseloads, Ohio \n     has developed the strongest JOBS program in the nation. Ohio \n     leads the nation with 33,911 recipients participating in \n     JOBS. Only California comes close to matching Ohio's \n     performance with 32,755 recipients enrolled in JOBS, and \n     California has three times as many ADC recipients as Ohio. \n     Our success with the JOBS program reflects a strong \n     investment in training and education programs. Regardless of \n     the extent of our investment, however, no work program can \n     succeed without a commitment to making quality child care \n     available for recipients. In Ohio, the state provides non-\n     guaranteed day care to families with incomes up to 133 \n     percent of the federal poverty level. The program currently \n     has an average daily enrollment of 17,800. The State of Ohio \n     is doing its part to provide child care to those in need. The \n     federal government also must meet its responsibility.\n       I would like to see the child care and family nutrition \n     block grants converted into capped state entitlements. In the \n     House bill, funding for these block grants is discretionary. \n     Key child care programs currently are individual \n     entitlements. The need for child care only will grow as \n     welfare recipients move into the workforce. My comfort level \n     with the House package would increase significantly if states \n     were guaranteed to receive a specified level of funding for \n     child care and for child nutrition services for the next five \n     years. That guarantee can only come through a capped state \n     entitlement.\n       Excessive prescriptiveness is a problem throughout the \n     House legislation. The bill's work requirements are a perfect \n     example. The federal government mandates how many hours per \n     week a federally defined percentage of cash assistance \n     recipients must participate in federally prescribed work \n     activities. In a true block grant, states would be free to \n     choose how best to allocate resources to meet goals developed \n     jointly by the federal and state governments. The \n     recordkeeping requirements in the House bill also are \n     extraordinarily prescriptive. States remain concerned that \n     our computer systems lack the capability to provide the \n     information required by the House.\n       A true block grant should also give states the ability to \n     determine their own program eligibility standards. The House \n     legislation includes a number of specific eligibility \n     restrictions. For example, cash benefits will be denied to \n     unwed minor mothers and their children. Additional children \n     born to mothers on welfare will be denied benefits. Decisions \n     like these should be left to the states. By federally \n     mandating these restrictions, the House is interfering with \n     successful state reforms. For example, in Ohio we have \n     developed a program designed to encourage minor mothers to \n     remain in school. The LEAP (Learning, Earning, and Parenting) \n     program supplements or reduces a teen mother's ADC cash grant \n     based on her school attendance to teach her that there is a \n     real value to completing her education. LEAP has led to a \n     significant decrease in the drop-out rate for this vulnerable \n     population. If the House prohibition on cash benefits remains \n     in place, the LEAP program will have to be discontinued.\n       As the Senate begins to consider welfare legislation, I \n     would be grateful for your assistance in addressing my \n     concerns. Like many other Governors, I strongly support the \n     broad outline of the House proposal, but it is important that \n     these issues be resolved successfully. As a Governor, it will \n     be up to me to implement welfare reforms in my State. I would \n     like to work with you to ensure that block grants give the \n     states the flexibility we need to implement innovative \n     reforms designed to meet the specific needs of our \n     communities. Without this flexibility, I cannot support this \n     welfare reform package.\n       While Ohio watches federal welfare reform developments with \n     tremendous interest, we have been actively pursuing a \n     statewide reform agenda. I have enclosed a summary of Ohio's \n     history of welfare reform innovation for your information.\n       Thank you for your personal consideration of my concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Parent Teacher Association, National Association \n           of Elementary School Principals, National Association \n           of State Boards of Education, National Association of \n           State Directors of Special Education, National \n           Education Association, and the Council of Chief State \n           School Officers,\n                                                   March 20, 1995.\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations, \n     representing parents, educators, principals, and state \n     policymakers, support improvements to the welfare system. We \n     believe such reforms must address the \n \n[[Page S 13186]]\n\n     fundamental quality child care needs of working as well as \n     unemployed parents.\n       We have several concerns about the impact of H.R. 999 on \n     the issues of access to and the quality of child care in this \n     country:\n       The plan reduces funding even though programs already have \n     long waiting lists of eligible families.\n       Welfare reform will increase the need for child care by \n     requiring participation in training, education, or employment \n     by mothers who currently take care of their children.\n       The potential for success of welfare reform depends on \n     former recipients becoming employed and being able to meet \n     basic needs for shelter, food, health care and child care. \n     Subsidized child care for low income working parents is \n     crucial.\n       Recent data show that quality in centers and daycare homes \n     is low, especially for infants. Cutting funding for quality \n     and eliminating standards would threaten to erode the quality \n     of care even further.\n       We know that the quality of child care for all children has \n     a significant impact on the ability of children to learn in \n     the first few years of school. When children experience \n     success in responsive, high quality programs, they learn \n     essential skills and knowledge, and their parents learn to be \n     confident partners with teachers and schools.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, Mr. President, I would just mention what we are \nreally talking about in terms of child care. We have talked about \nfigures. We talked about statistics. We talked about flow lines. We \ntalked about entitlements. What we are talking about is really the \nissue of children being home alone. This is not a joke or a big screen \ncomedy. It is a real life tragedy for American families pressed to the \nwall. Just listen to the horror stories from families that have been \nput in this awful position--and paying an unbelievable price.\n  Think about 6-year-old Jermaine James of Fairfax County and his 6-\nyear-old friend Amanda, who were being cared for by his 8-year-old \nsister Tina. When a fire broke out in their apartment, Tina ran for \nhelp, inadvertently locking the younger children in the burning \napartment. They died before the fire department could get to them. \nSandra James and her husband needed two jobs to support their family \nand still could not afford child care. They tried to stagger their \nschedules but did not always succeed.\n  Think about 7-month-old Craig Pinner of San Francisco who drowned in \nthe bathtub while his 9-year-old brother was trying to bathe him. His \nmother was working part time and participating in job training. She \nusually left the children with her family, but her car had broken down \nand she was no longer able to get them there. She was trying to find \naffordable child care but was unsuccessful.\n  Think about 4-year-old Anthony and 5-year-old Maurice Grant of Dade \nCounty. While home alone, they climbed into the clothes dryer to look \nat a magazine in a hiding place, pulled the door closed, and tumbled \nand burned to death. Their mother was waiting for child care assistance \nand generally left the children with neighbors. But sometimes these \narrangements fell through and she had to leave them home alone for just \na few hours.\n  This did not happen in Hollywood--but in Virginia and Florida and \nCalifornia and elsewhere. We must do everything in our power to avoid \nputting families in this kind of a situation in the name of reform.\n  Mr. President, I will include in the Record, if my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, has not, the waiting lines that exist in the \nStates at the present time.\n  The States face large unmet needs for child assistance, waiting \nlists, clothes, and the list goes on all the way--Alabama, 19,000 \nchildren; Alaska, 752 children; Arizona, 2,600 children; California, \n250,000 children; Delaware, over 1,000 children; Florida, 19,000; \nGeorgia, 21,000; Hawaii, 900 children are on the waiting list; Idaho, \n1,000 children waiting; Illinois, 20,000 children waiting; Indiana, \n7,900 on the waiting lists; Kansas, 1,270 on the waiting list, \nKentucky, 10,000 on the waiting list; Louisiana, 4,600; Maine 3,000; \nMaryland, 4,000; Massachusetts 4,000 statewide waiting for child care \nfor working poor families; Michigan, 12,000 last year; Minnesota, \n7,000; Missouri, 6,500; Montana, 200 children; Nevada, 7,000; and the \nlist goes on; New Jersey, 24,000; New Mexico, 6,300; New York, 23,000; \nNorth Carolina, 13,000; Pennsylvania, 7,700; Rhode Island, 972. The \nlist goes on and on with Wisconsin, 6,800; West Virginia, 13,000.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that under this particular \nbill, the Dole bill, without the Dodd amendment, we will be requiring \nthe States to have over 1 million new slots. They are not doing it \ntoday. They do not have the resources today. They do not have the money \nunder the Dole program today to do it. The Dodd amendment will provide \nthem with the resources to be able to meet that obligation, that \nobligation that is there in the States today and that will be created \nby this bill. That is what this amendment is all about and why it \nshould be supported.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me pick up on the last point that the \nSenator from Massachusetts raised. He may have made it before I walked \nonto the floor. He pointed out the waiting lists that exist in the \nStates for child care slots today, before we pass a welfare reform \nbill. There is just tremendous demand today. What we are talking \nabout--this bill, of course--is taking anywhere from 1 to 2 million \npeople and moving them over the next 5 years from welfare to work.\n  If we do not provide additional resources, then there will be \nincreased pressure on existing dollars that go to those who are getting \nthe child care today. It is worthwhile to point out that the people who \nget child care today under the child care development block grant, that \nSenator Hatch and I passed in 1990, are working poor. Those are people \nat work right now. That child care assistance makes it possible for \nthem to stay in the work force and not slip into a public assistance \ncategory.\n  The fear that many of us have here, is that without some additional \nresources, as we move people who are on welfare today to work, the \npeople out working today and staying at work, getting some of that \nassistance, those resources are going to have to be shifted in the \nState\n in order to accommodate the demands of this bill or face the penalties \nthe bill imposes on the States if the States do not move the 25 to 50 \npercent of the welfare recipients on their rolls to work.\n\n  So you are going to have the almost bizarre effect of taking people \nwho are doing what we are encouraging people to do, and that is stay at \nwork, who are marginally making enough to stay off the welfare rolls \nand pushing those people back on the rolls as we accommodate the \ndemands of the legislation to take people on the welfare rolls to work.\n  So it seems we ought not to be jeopardizing the small amount of funds \nwe have today out there assisting those families presently at work.\n  Let me emphasize a couple of points here if I can. What we are \ntalking about with this proposal is not an entitlement. This is a pool \nof resources. It does not entitle anyone to it. It merely makes the \nfunds available to the States.\n  So there are those who have said they do not believe in an \nentitlement for child care. We might otherwise disagree about that, but \nthis amendment does not create an entitlement. It merely says to Ohio, \nConnecticut, Massachusetts, divide it up based on the block grant and \nwhat it takes to make it work. Here are some additional resources to \nmake it possible for you to meet the demand, the mandate, of the \nFederal law.\n  The mandate of the bill we are about to pass says to Ohio and \nConnecticut, you must move the following percentages of your welfare \nrolls to work. And what we are saying is rather than ask Ohio and \nConnecticut to pay a penalty because they did not meet that criteria \nbecause they could not come up with the resources to pay for the child \ncare, here as a result of our mandate are some resources on the most \ncritical issue facing any State with its welfare recipients: How do you \ntake a parent that has infant children and no place to put them and get \nthem to go to work?\n  Sixty percent of all welfare recipients have children age 5 and \nunder, Mr. President. So it is unrealistic to assume those children are \ngoing to find some setting in the neighborhood or with a grandparent. \nIdeally that would be the best case, but realistically that \n\n[[Page S 13187]]\nis not going to happen in enough instances. So it is finding and \naffording child care that's the issue. The child care settings may \nvary--church-based programs, community-based programs. There is a wide \nvariety of things the States have done creatively in the child-care \nsetting area. I do not have any difficulty with that kind of \nflexibility at all. But here are resources.\n  In the absence of that, we are told that we are looking at an \nadditional cost, above the amount set aside from the block grant, which \nis the $5 billion over 5 years. In fiscal year 2000, in the State of \nOhio, the additional amount is $190 million, in the State of \nPennsylvania--I see my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania here--\n$171 million; for Connecticut, $48 million; Massachusetts, $89 million. \nThese are the numbers the States, it is estimated, will have to come up \nwith. They can cut spending. It does not mean necessarily a mandate to \nraise taxes. But that is the pool they will have to come up with to \nprovide for the child-care needs of the population that moves to work.\n  If we are mandating that--and we are; we are mandating work--why not \nprovide the States with some help to do it? That is all we are saying \nhere, a pool of money over 5 years, $6 billion.\n  Now, it is a lot of money. I know that. But if we all appreciate \nkeeping our mind on the goal of getting people to work, then we ought \nto be trying to do this in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I am not exaggerating. If we get this amendment \nadopted or something like it--and I think on the issue of the formulas, \nwhich is, I think, a minor point--and a few other areas, you could pass \nthis bill 95 to 5. We could have overwhelming, strong support coming \nout of here for a welfare reform bill, because I think all of us share \nthe common goal of getting people from welfare to work.\n  Whether that is cost savings or an investment, the value of it, I \nthink all of us appreciate, to the family, the neighborhood, the \ncommunity, is tremendously enhanced. And if child care is one of the \nmajor obstacles to moving an individual to work, because they do not \nknow where to put that child, then trying to find the way for them to \ndo it, assist the States in that process ought not to be an ideological \nbattle here. We have enough battles on that stuff. This ought not be \none.\n  So I am urging in these next 40 minutes or so that are remaining that \npeople take a good look at what this is. Understand, it is no \nentitlement, not a guarantee to anybody, merely assistance to these \nStates to be able to achieve the goal as laid out in the majority \nleader's bill, and that is to get people to work.\n  People will tell you even with adequate child care, it is going to be \nhard. You talk about some pretty heavy numbers to move from welfare to \nwork, and given the economy and downsizing and a lot of other things \nhappening, good jobs, and so forth, are not expanding in our economy. \nWe ought to be talking about that, I hope, one of these days, but \nnonetheless under the best of circumstances, it is going to be hard.\n  It seems to me we ought to be trying at least to make it possible to \nmove those people to work and not have the kind of burden on the States \nthat is laid out here with the particular costs associated with child \ncare. And as I said in response to the point that was being made by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we have already got people really trying \nhard to stay off the welfare rolls and stay at work. It would be a \ntragedy, in a way, to then have some of these people taking some of the \nresources they get, plowing them into this area and moving some of \nthese people at work and trying to stay off welfare back on those \nrolls.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah, who was here, who \nallocated me about 5 or 10 minutes of his time to make this point. I am \ngrateful to him for that.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor. We may have some additional \nMembers who show up on this issue. But I urge my colleagues in these \nnext remaining minutes here, this is a chance for us, Mr. President, to \nreally put together a bipartisan bill on welfare reform. I honestly \nbelieve that if we could adopt this amendment, and a few other things, \nwe would be looking at an overwhelming vote in favor of this welfare \nreform package.\n  That is how this body and this Congress ought to be functioning. \nPeople want us to come together. They do not want to see bickering and \npartisan battling. They would like us to find common ground. Here is a \nway for us to do it on an issue that most people really want to see us \nfocus our attention on. Here is a chance to achieve that goal in the \nnext 45 or 50 minutes. It means doing the right thing. It is truly \ndoing the right thing in terms of welfare reform and eliminating a \nmajor obstacle that people face here of moving from the rolls of public \nassistance to the independence and self-reliance of work and helping \nthem out with their kids. And those children's needs, as I said a \nmoment ago, Mr. President, ought not to be the subject of a partisan \ndebate here. We ought to be able to find the means by which we can \nassist the families to eliminate at least that question in their mind, \nassist the States as they move into this process in a way in which we \ncan do it. Resource allocation is simple enough to accommodate.\n  I again urge my colleagues to take a good look at this and come to \nthis floor, hopefully in the next 50 minutes, and cast a vote in favor \nof what I think would build a strong, strong vote of support in favor \nof the majority leader's welfare reform bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair of the time \nremaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 50 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Connecticut has 1 minute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I wanted to congratulate the Senator from Connecticut for his very \npersuasive case on behalf of the need for child care and making \nworkfare or welfare to work.\n  I do not think anyone on this side of the aisle disagrees with the \nbasic premise of his amendment, which is if we are going to have people \ngo to work, then we are going to be in some need of child care for \nworking women, single mothers. The question is, How much money are you \nwilling to put up? What will be the impact?\n  Again, we go back to the start of a lot of these programs, the \nwelfare programs back in the 1960's when they really mushroomed, and a \nlot of these programs were very well intentioned, but what happened? \nWhat were the consequences of these--I am careful not to use the word \nentitlement because I know the Senator from Connecticut says this is \nnot an entitlement. I agree. It is not an entitlement.\n But there is enough money in his bill to fill all the day-care slots \nthat are anticipated to be needed.\n\n  Well, it is not an entitlement, but it takes care of everyone who \nneeds the service. So while you know it is sort of taking away with one \nhand, saying it is not an entitlement, it is giving with the other by \ngiving all the money necessary anticipated to have the need. You can \nsay it is not an entitlement, but it is, in fact, almost a guarantee of \nchild care.\n  So, what are the consequences of this guarantee? And we talked about \nthis in some dialog on Friday. And you know, I have some concerns about \npeople on welfare getting a guarantee of sorts of child care where if \nsomeone who is a working mother gets no guarantee at all of having any \nkind of child-care support. In fact, as the Senator from Connecticut \npointed out on numerous occasions, accurately, there is a shortage of \nday-care slots available for working mothers in this country.\n  So to suggest we should provide some sort of quasi-guarantee for \nthose on welfare and not for those who are working mothers, I think, \nsets up a bad precedent, No. 1; and with the law of unintended \nconsequence you may encourage welfare dependency, at least initially, \nin some cases.\n  There are several other points I want to make. One is the money. I \nknow we sort of gloss over that around here. Mr. President, $6 billion \nis not a whole lot of money, at least if you sit on the Senate floor \nmost days you would think $6 billion is not a lot of money. But it is a \nlot of money, and it is given the fact that if you look at what is \nbeing proposed in the Republican bill that we are now amending.\n  The Republican bill over the next 7 years will allow welfare to grow \nat 70 percent over the next 7 years--70 percent. Welfare programs will \ngrow from \n\n[[Page S 13188]]\nthe year 1995 to the year 2002, 70 percent. There will be an increase \nof 70 percent in these programs. And what we are saying now is that is \nnot enough. We need another $6 billion more. Just so you understand, \nyou say, well, how much was it going to grow if we did not cut it back, \nbecause this bill does have some reduction? Well, it would have grown \nat 77 percent. So we are taking a program that was supposed to grow \nover the next 7 years and grow by 77 percent; cut it back to 70 \npercent. There are those on the other side saying, that is too tough. \nWe need to add another $6 billion more back to this fund of money.\n  If you are serious about day care, if you really think child care is \nthat important, well then, I would suggest that you confine it to the \n70-percent growth that is going to be experienced over the next 7 \nyears, $6 billion to offset the money you want to spend, not another \nquasi-guarantee or almost entitlement for child care.\n  I just think you have to pass the straight-face test around here. If \nyou really are serious about solving problems--I think we all are. We \nwant to solve the problem of child care in this bill. And I think we \nhave done some things with the Snowe amendment that goes a long way in \ndoing so. So it is now in the Dole modified bill. I think we made a \nmajor step forward.\n  If you are serious about providing and funding more dollars, do not \nsay we need to spend more. That is how we got to where we are today. \nThis bill has to fit into a reconciliation package which, by the way, \nit does not right now. It does not right now. It is over what, I think, \nthe Budget Committee wants to see in reductions in welfare. We are \ngoing to have to get more.\n  When we go to conference this bill is going to come back with less \nmoney, I suspect. The House bill was substantially under this bill. So \nit will be under this. The House bill had a 5-year year timeframe when \nthey passed the bill. And on their 5-year timeframe they had welfare \nexpenditures growing at 42 percent.\n  Now, that is at a slower rate than our 70 percent over 7 years. So \nyou are going to see we are already going to have to pull back funds. \nAnd to suggest that we should come to the floor and we can get a \ncompromise spending more money, that is how we got there and how we got \nto what the welfare system is. We have always done that, come to the \nfloor and said, ``OK. We will compromise and spend more.'' And \neverybody will be happy and pass a bill 96 to 1, passing a bill 96 to 1 \nthat perpetuates the same thing--maybe makes everybody feel good, but \nit does not solve the problem. It does not solve the problem.\n  So what we are suggesting here is that you know, we are, and I think, \ncontinuing in a dialog. I know Senator Hatch has an amendment on day \ncare that I think is a serious amendment. And we are trying to find \nsome ground to make all of our Members, not just on the Democratic \nside, but I know myself and others, I know Senator Jeffords is going to \nspeak here. We are concerned about the child care aspects of this.\n  I know Senator Jeffords supported the Snowe amendment which is now in \nthe leader's bill. I know he would like to go further. And I know there \nare other Members who would like to go further. But we have to \nunderstand we have budget constraints.\n  This is not a stingy bill that we are dealing with. Welfare spending \nwill grow by 70 percent over the next 7 years. That is not stingy. That \nis not uncaring. And to suggest that we can solve the problem and get \neverybody happy by spending another $6 billion--I suggest if we got \nthat in there there would be another $6 billion to spend in another \nprogram.\n  I would also add that Republican Governors, almost every one of \nthem--I know the majority leader has come here and said I think 29 of \nthe 30 Republican Governors in the country have come out and supported \nthe Dole substitute. They comprise roughly 80 percent of the welfare \nrecipients. The Governors of those States have within those States 80 \npercent of the Nation's welfare recipients. And what they have almost \nunanimously said to us is ``You give us the money you allocated under \nthis bill and we can do the job. We can, in fact, put people to work.''\n  You would think from the comments of some on the other side that we \nare going to require every mother who has a child under 5 to go to \nwork. I would remind the Senators who are debating this amendment that \nwhen this bill goes into effect, the initial participation rates are \nonly 30 percent. That means only 30 percent of all the welfare caseload \nhas to be in a work program. It only goes up to a maximum of 50 \npercent. So the State always has discretion to take mothers with young \nchildren and not require them to work. In fact, many Governors have \nalready told me that is exactly what they would do in most cases \nbecause of the cost, and because of the difficulty with day care.\n  But we provide that flexibility in the law. We already provide that. \nWe already say they can adjust. And the Governors say they can do it. \nAnd if you look at some of the plans that have been tried under the \n1988 act--I mentioned on several occasions the Riverside, CA, example, \nwhere what we have seen is a 14-percent reduction in food stamps, a 20-\nsome reduction--I do not have numbers in front of me--20-some percent \nreduction that goes out on AFDC, aid to families with dependent \nchildren, and a 25-percent reduction in caseload.\n  Now, that saves money. Why? Why do they save money? They require \npeople to go to work. So you can save money to provide some of that \nwork. And it was a successful program at a time when Riverside, CA, was \nexperiencing a 9 percent-unemployment rate. So it is not that there are \nno jobs. There are no jobs. Well, there are jobs, if we do some things \nlike the Dole bill does which allow you to fill some vacancies in \ncities and counties and local governments, State governments which you \ncannot under current law. If there is a vacancy in the State government \nor local government, you want to fill it with a welfare recipient, you \ncan do it. You are not allowed to hire somebody who is a welfare \nrecipient for an open position. Why? That is to protect the union \nmembership at the State and local level. They do not want people on \nwelfare to get some of those jobs. I think that is a crime. That would \nchange under the Dole bill.\n  So I mean we are doing a lot of things that will encourage--will \ncreate more job opportunities which will cause savings as we have seen \nin examples in the past, where if you have a work requirement, the \nwelfare rolls will go down. Ask Governor Thompson, Governor Engler, and \nask others who have tried it. The caseload will go down. People will \nget to work because of the requirement that is there. And they will \nsave money. And that money can be used to provide for support services \nfor those who have to remain in the program and go to the work program. \nThat is the whole basis behind what we are suggesting here.\n  I would suggest that what we have provided for again with the \nGovernors, Republican Governors lining up behind this bill, is adequate \nto fund this program, to fund the child-care programs that are \nnecessary. We have the flexibility of the States with the 50-percent \nwork participation requirement to exempt certain difficult-to-place \nmothers with young children. I mean there is a lot of flexibility in \nthis program to be able to deal with the problems. I think what we now \nhave to do is make the fiscally responsible vote. Welfare has gotten \nitself in the problem it has because we have been reluctant in the face \nof harming children or these horrible things that are going to occur, \nif we do not provide all the money for everything, all these \nentitlements. If we do not provide all these entitlements children are \ngoing to suffer.\n  All I would suggest is we provided entitlements for 25 and 30 years. \nChildren are suffering at historic levels. So if it was just money and \nentitlements there would be no suffering today. There are plenty of \nentitlements and plenty of suffering to go with it. So let me suggest \nthat maybe what we need is instead of guaranteeing everybody child \ncare, why do we not require work and say that we have to look to \nfamilies and to other kinds of networks of support to look for child \ncare, just like we have done in this country historically?\n  One of my real concerns--and this gets to be more of a philosophical \nconcern, if we--as I know the Senator from Connecticut will say we are \nnot guaranteeing, but we darn near are guaranteeing it--if you provide \nall the money for all the slots, if you do that, you run \n\n[[Page S 13189]]\ninto the problem where the Government day-care option is the first \nresort;\n that getting Government support for that day care slot is now the \nfirst choice, not the last resort. The system as it works today works \nwell. I know there are shortages of day care, but it works well in \ntargeting the mothers who need day care the most. It works well in that \nyou have to go through a very rigorous qualification procedure to be \nable to qualify for Government-assisted day care. That would probably \nnot be the case if we fully funded all these day care slots.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I note the point about the entitlement issue. I think my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania mentioned over the next 7 years there would \nbe a 70-percent increase. I believe it is flat. I do not think there is \na penny more. This is $48 billion. It is for 7 years. There is no \ninflation factor built in. I think I am correct on that, but I stand \ncorrected if I am wrong.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is right, the AFDC dollars remain flat. \nWhen I talk about the 70-percent increase, I talk about all the means-\ntested entitlement programs included in this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. As far as the AFDC----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The AFDC program is block granted at a flat level, the \nSenator is right. But, obviously, there are a lot of other support \nservices and means-tested programs that will continue to grow.\n  The point I tried to make is that with respect to AFDC, you have the \nflexibility within that program the Governors desire, saying, in fact, \nthey can save money and have money, because of the savings, available \nto support the work program.\n  In addition, you have a 50-percent work participation requirement \nwhich would give the States the flexibility to exclude a lot of the \npeople that you mentioned who have young children or maybe multiple \nyoung children, from having to go to work and the work requirement. We \ndo provide a lot of flexibility there. We think that flexibility goes a \nlong way in solving the problem.\n  I am hopeful we can look at the past to see what the future holds. \nLooking at the past and seeing all the entitlements we put in place and \nseeing all the money that we spent trying to make sure nobody is \nharmed, what we have done is make sure that nobody has been helped. \nWhat we have not done is challenge people to do more, to move forward.\n  I believe this program, with the work requirement and the \nparticipation standards we have and the flexibility given to States, \nwill do just that: challenge people to go out and work and find ways to \nprovide for themselves and their families. I think, in the long run, \nthat will be the best for everyone concerned.\n  At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we all are having a hard time with this \namendment and with this bill. We all want to see welfare reform. We all \nwant to see child care provided, and, thus, I rise in support of this \namendment because I think it will help us move in that direction.\n  We all agree that we want to see more welfare recipients in the work \nforce. We all agree that the welfare cycle must be broken. I believe \ngiving kids a good start through safe and healthy surroundings is \nessential to breaking the welfare cycle.\n  In order to become productive, self-sufficient members of society, \nkids need quality care from the very beginning of their lives, either \nfrom their parents, in the child care setting or elsewhere. And a \nquality education must be provided from the beginning of their lives. \nWhat we are talking about, though, are the resources that will be \navailable and should be available.\n  We are all tied up with the problems of the deficit and the need to \nreduce the deficit. But there are things we must consider when we go \nabout providing resources, that if we do not make resources available \nfor those things that will break the cycle, for those things which will \nallow our young children to have the possibility of breaking out of the \ncycle, sort of give the parents of the children the ability to provide \nthe child care necessary, then one important segment of breaking that \ncycle will not come about.\n  Let us take a look at the macro picture that we must have and what we \nhave to deal with so that we can recognize what the savings are from \nimproving the education of our society and, most importantly, from the \nbeginning of life, in child care to be sure these young children have \nthe opportunity to have the surroundings that will allow them to learn.\n  This chart gives us an idea of what we are losing now because we have \nserious educational problems in our country. One-half of a trillion \ndollars in GDP is lost per year because we fail to educate our people. \nThe cost to our economy is more than $125 billion, in addition to lost \nrevenues; $208 billion is lost from the result of the problems of \nwelfare. So when we are talking about $1 billion a year or more to try \nand get enough money available for child care, to give to the children, \nweigh that against what is lost.\n  In addition to that, I will have an amendment that says, hey, we have \na demand here, an important demand that says every person in training \nmust have a GED, must have a high school equivalent education. There is \nnot money for that either. So what we are going to be doing is either \ncreating a huge mandate upon the States that is unfunded or going \nforward with expectations which will not be fulfilled.\n  Let us take a look at the relationship of education to productivity, \nwhat is happening to those who do not have a good education.\n  The only people who have increased their income over the past few \nyears are professionals. This is over the last 20 years. In the last 20 \nyears, the only people who have increased their standard of living is \nat the level of master's, doctorates, and professionals. Others have \neither stayed at the bachelor level or gone down. Then take a look at \nthe comparison of what is earned by those who do not finish high \nschool: $12,800 per family. That is incredibly low and is going down in \nthe sense of percentage of income.\n  How do we break out of this? How do we provide those resources? It is \nstupid to cut back on those things which is going to increase your \ndeficit. If we do not provide the amount of money that is necessary for \nchild care, there is no chance that we are going to raise this level \nup, until you get to the area where you have a high enough standard of \nliving to survive.\n  So what this amendment tries to do is to say, ``Look, we are going to \nmake sure that our children will have an opportunity to have the kind \nof income that will bring them out of the welfare cycle, to place them \nin a position where they can earn what is necessary, to get us out of \nthe position of losing all this money we do with the welfare \nsituation.''\n  So when we talk in terms of $1 billion a year over the term of this, \nas compared to the $208 billion we are losing by the problems we have \nwith welfare, it means we are just being, really, penny wise and pound \nfoolish, and we must not do that.\n  I recognize that my time has expired. May I have an additional 2 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. So as we go forward with this welfare reform, let us \nkeep in mind some things. I do not think there is a person here or the \nHouse who does not want welfare reform, including the White House. The \nquestion is, how do we reach a consensus?\n  That is not going to be easy, there is no question about it. We have \nsome people at the extremes of the process from no welfare to all \nwelfare. But what we have to do is to try and reach that middle ground. \nWe have to make some areas where we can have a consensus, and certainly \none of those ought to be the provision of child care.\n  There is not anyone in this body who does not believe there ought to \nbe adequate child care. This amendment is the only thing which will \nbring us close to that. So, if we are going to have consensus on the \nissue of child care and if we really want to do what we are supposed to \ndo here, and that is to break through the cycle of welfare, if we are \ngoing to give the children of those in the most desperate economic \nsituations in this country the ability for them to have the education \nwhich is necessary, all the studies show if they \n\n[[Page S 13190]]\ndo not get the early preschool education, they start out at a big \ndisadvantage.\n  Let me just end up by saying one of my most unusual experiences when \nI came to the Senate was I had a group of CEO's come into my office \nwhen I was first elected to the Senate. John Akers was the head of the \ngroup, the Business Roundtable. I expected them all to say, ``We need \nto get capital gains tax relief,'' blah, blah, blah. What happened? The \nfirst thing they said was, ``We need to fully fund Head Start. We need \nto make sure there is preschool education for every one of our kids if \nwe are ever going to get our society in a position where we can be \neconomically sound.''\n Just recently, this IBM president said at the NGA, ``This Nation is in \na crisis, and if we do not start the educational process we need, this \nNation is not going to be the Nation it is today in the next century.'' \nI leave those words with you.\n\n  Here is an opportunity to make sure the young kids will have the \nopportunity to get out of the welfare cycle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to be one of the co-sponsors \nof the Kennedy-Dodd child-care amendment to the Republican welfare \nreform bill. No issue more clearly defines the differences in this \nwelfare debate than child care. Both sides have said that the goal of \nwelfare must be to move people to work, but Democrats have maintained \nthat it is not just about moving them to work, it is is about keeping \nthem on the job.\n  We want to provide welfare recipients with the tools to stay on the \njob. What the facts prove time and time again is that the most \nnecessary tool is child care for children. Child care is the No. 1 \nbarrier keeping mothers out of the work force, and one in four mothers \nbetween the ages of 21 and 29 are not working today because of child \ncare. Among welfare mothers, 34 percent are not working because of \neither inability to find reliable child care or inability to afford \nchild care.\n  No single parent can look for or keep a job without child care, and \nsingle parents make up 88 percent of the AFDC caseload. Without child \ncare, we will have no success in moving people to work and keeping them \nthere.\n  But child care is costly, and the average middle-class family spends \n9 percent of its income on child care. However, the average poor family \nspends almost 25 percent of its income on child care.\n  The Republican plan will leave four million children under the age of \nsix home alone. Today, almost 650,000 of them receive child care with \nassistance that would be eliminated under the Dole plan. In fact, the \nplan would repeal the child care guarantee passed by the Senate in \n1988.\n  If the States implement the proposed welfare reform plan, the need \nfor child care will increase by more than 200 percent by the year 2000. \nStates will need over $4 billion more a year. In Maryland, the unfunded \nmandate will amount to more than $1 million a week that Maryland \ntaxpayers will pay to cover child care costs.\n  This child care policy proves that the Republican bill does not look \nat the day-to-day lives of real people. Welfare recipients who we send \nto work will not have high-paying jobs, and will not be able to afford \nchild care.\n  Suppose a mother lives in suburban Maryland and decides to do the \nright thing. She gets an entry-level, minimum-wage job in the food \nservice industry. With this job, she is making almost $9,000 a year, \nbut gets no benefits. After taxes and Social Security, this mother \ntakes home $175 a week, but her child care costs her $125 a week. How \nis she going to pay for rent, food, clothing, and transportation costs \nwith only $50 left over a week?\n  Our Democratic Work First plan recognizes that child care is the \nvital link between leaving welfare and going to work. Our plan \nconsolidates four current programs into one expanded child care block \ngrant, eliminating duplicate paperwork and reporting requirements, and \nreducing bureaucratic structure.\n  This block grant will help provide child care for welfare recipients, \nthose transitioning from welfare to work, and the working poor. Under \nour plan, a family of four making less than $15,000 a year will be \neligible for child care.\n  On the other hand, the Republican plan forces States into an \nimpossible position. Either the State does not provide child care and \nwelfare reform fails, or they do provide child care by raising taxes \nand cutting other State programs.\n  States also can divert aid from the working poor to pay for welfare, \nbut in doing so send a perverse incentive--if you go on welfare, you \nget help; if you go to work every day and barely make ends meet, you \nnever get a break.\n  Welfare reform is about ending the cycle and the culture of poverty. \nEnding the cycle of poverty is an economic challenge, but Democrats are \nproviding the tools to overcome this challenge. The Republicans have no \nplan.\n  Ending the culture of poverty is about personal responsibility. \nDemocrats have proposed a tough plan based on tough love. It is a hand \nup, not a hand out. But Republicans have proposed a punitive plan based \non tough luck. It aims for the mother, but hits the child.\n  This debate should be about ending welfare as a way of life, and \nmaking it a step to a better life. That means real work requirements, \nwith the tools to get the job done. If we are to have a bipartisan \nframework for welfare reform, we must address the work challenge in a \nway that is real, and deals with people's day-to-day needs.\n  We must adopt the Kennedy-Dodd amendment and fix the Dole home alone \nchild care policy.\n\n               the need for child care in welfare reform\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think we can all agree on the \nfundamental goal of welfare reform. We must create a program that moves \nrecipients from welfare to work to economic self-sufficiency as quickly \nas possible. We must help replace their welfare checks with paychecks.\n  One obvious way to transform a system which encourages dependency is \nto eliminate its inherent disincentives. How? Fundamentally, you must \nmake support services--the cornerstone of long-term success in the \nworkplace--more available to low-income people who want to work. The \nlinchpin of successfully transitioning people from welfare to work is \nchild care. And the bill before us today is woefully deficient in \nproviding funding for child care services. In fact, the Dole bill does \nnot guarantee that one cent of the block grant will be spent on child \ncare.\n  That is why I strongly support the Dodd-Kennedy amendment. It \nrecognizes that no welfare reform proposal can be successful without \nproviding child-care services. And it is willing to invest in those \nservices to ensure a successful outcome.\n  Most working families feel the pinch of child-care costs. Low-income \nfamilies, which are often headed by single parents, feel the greatest \npinch, spending a quarter of their income for child care. In North \nDakota, it costs a family about $3,400 a year for child care. If a \nfamily is just scraping by at poverty level wages--$14,763 for a family \nof four--that's an awfully big chunk of your income going to pay for \nchild care.\n  This situation is all too prevalent in our society. There are too \nmany working poor families, and too many mothers trying to move from \nwelfare to work who are forced back onto the welfare rolls because \ntheir child care is too expensive or unreliable.\n  While the Dole bill does contain child-care provisions, it falls far \nshort of what is needed to help these families achieve true self-\nsufficiency and economic independence. It fails to guarantee child-care \nassistance to recipients who are moving to work, and most importantly, \nit fails to provide additional funding to meet the work requirements \ncontained in the bill--it provides less than half of current child-care \nspending and doesn't even begin to address the increased need for child \ncare created by the bill's work requirements. In short, it just doesn't \nput its money where its mouth is, and it is a recipe for disaster.\n  The ability to secure affordable child care is a decisive factor in \ndetermining whether low-income mothers can get off and stay off \nwelfare. If we want to move parents with children off of the welfare \nrolls and into work, we must pass a welfare reform bill that will \nensure that the 10 million children on AFDC will be cared for while \ntheir parents look for jobs and begin employment. \n\n[[Page S 13191]]\n\n  The Dodd-Kennedy amendment achieves that goal. To help welfare \nrecipients get and keep a job, this amendment creates a direct spending \ngrant to States with the funding levels set at HHS cost estimates of \n$11 billion over 5 years so that the child-care needs created by the \nDole work requirements are met. This grant is fully paid for--by \nearmarking $5 billion from the title 1 block grant and by cuts in \ncorporate welfare.\n  The amendment guarantees that no child will be left home alone while \ntheir parents are working, looking for work, or participating in an \neducation or training program. And it ensures that families aren't \npunished for failing to participate in job training or work programs if \nchild care is unavailable.\n  It also requires States to maintain current spending on child care--\nwithout requiring them to match additional child-care spending.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Dodd-Kennedy amendment means that \ncritical child-care services for low-income families will continue to \nbe provided under the child care and development block grant.\n  Parents who are able to work must be given the tools to do so. A \ncritical component of getting families off welfare--and keeping them \noff--is ensuring safe, adequate and affordable care for their children. \nThe Dodd-Kennedy amendment does just that, and I hope that my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Dodd-\nKennedy child-care amendment to the Republican leader's welfare bill. \nThis amendment backs up the work requirements in this bill with the \nchild care assistance necessary to meet them.\n  Caring for our children is not an issue that affects only the poor--\nall working parents need child care. As we debate the issue of how we \nare going to change the dynamic of the welfare system, it is absolutely \ncrucial that we do all we can to protect children.\n  We are trying to agree on the best way to get welfare parents, \ngenerally single mothers, into jobs and how to keep them there. A \nsingle mother should not be forced to choose between properly caring \nfor her children and going to work. And if parents are not working, \nthey cannot support their families. If my wife and I wanted to see a \nmovie, but were unable to find a babysitter for our three children when \nthey were young, then we did not see the movie. How can we expect \nparents to work when there is no one to care for their children? We \nneed to be realistic in our effort to reform the welfare system.\n  Welfare reform is not only about adults--it is about children who \nlive in poor families. These children are poor at no fault of their own \nand the U.S. Congress is punishing them by forcing their mothers out \nthe door, leaving them home without a parent or babysitter.\n  If we are going to break the cycle of poverty and change the future \nof poor people in this country, children need to be at the top of our \nlist of priorities. We need to guarantee that children will be cared \nfor in healthy, safe, supportive environments that help them to develop \nand build their self-confidence. If we do this, if we help children get \ngood child care, we can help parents keep their jobs, and then and only \nthen, will their children learn the importance of working.\n  Watching their parents come home from work at night will allow \nchildren to see the self-confidence that results from bringing home a \npay check and being self-supportive. If Congress denies low-income \nfamilies the child care assistance they need to work, then kids will be \nleft home alone. Do we want television to take over as the caregiver \nwhile parents are at work?\n  If we can give children some structure, a place where they can learn \nthe skills and values they need to stay interested in school, perhaps \nthey will work their way out of poverty and we can start breaking the \ndemoralizing cycle of poverty that has affected millions of Americans.\n  Anyone who has ever sought child care knows that it can be difficult, \nstressful, and time consuming. For many families, child care is \nunavailable and unaffordable and those that lack the economic \nresources, the time, and information, have fewer options. In many small \ntowns in Vermont, neighbors, friends, and family rely on each other to \nhelp out with each other's children. There is usually someone around \nwho can watch the children for a few hours. But not every family lives \nin that kind of supportive environment. We all need to share the \nresponsibility in meeting the needs of the children of this country. \nChildren growing up in secure, supportive environments benefits us all.\n  The Republican leader's bill will make child care even more \nunaffordable for low-income families. As it is, working poor families \nspend 33 percent of their income on child care. In sharp contrast, \nmiddle-class families spend only 6 percent of their income on child \ncare. A single mother of two living on welfare can probably expect to \nearn about $5 an hour once she is able to find a job. Child care will \ncost about $3 an hour or more for her two children which leaves her $2 \nan hour, at most, to live on and support her family--$2 an hour is not \neven enough to support one person.\n  In addition to child care, a single mother must then pay for \ntransportation to work, clothes for herself and her children, rent, \nfood, and medical costs depending on how much assistance she receives \nfrom food stamps and Medicaid. Nobody could cover those expenses on $2 \nan hour. Nobody. Welfare is the price our country pays to keep \nfamilies, single mothers and their children, together. If this Congress \nfails to require States to guarantee child care, the consequences for \nmany of these families, women and their children, will be tragic.\n  We must also remember that single mother's did not have their \nchildren alone. I certainly hope that strong child support enforcement \nwill decrease the need for Federal assistance, and move single mothers \nand their families toward self-sufficiency. These efforts alone, \nhowever, may not be enough for some families.\n  Child-care assistance for low-income working parents and those \nworking their way off of welfare is essential. I urge adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the pending \namendment and commend Senators Dodd and Kennedy for addressing one of \nthe most critical issues related to welfare reform.\n  Child care is the linchpin for achieving comprehensive welfare reform \nbecause parents must know that their children are supervised and safe \nin order to go to work. That is just common sense.\n  But the Dole amendment falls short here. First, it repeals the \nguarantee that child care must be provided in order for States to take \nwelfare recipients out of the home and put them into the workplace.\n  Second, the Dole proposal mandates that parents work, but does not \nprovide any additional support for child care. In fact, the plan \nrepeals all existing child-care funding specifically for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that welfare recipients must be required \nto work. However, if quality, affordable child care is not available \nparents will be faced with the unacceptable alternative of leaving \nchildren at home alone or in unsafe situations. That is really no \nchoice at all.\n  I have often spoken about the success of the Iowa Family Investment \nProgram. After 22 months, the Iowa welfare reform program is showing \ngood results. More people are working, the caseload is declining and \nthe cost of cash assistance is going down.\n  These results happened because the State has been investing in \neducation, training, transportation, and, of course, child care.\n  I often meet with welfare recipients, caseworkers, and other in Iowa \nregarding welfare reform. The most common concern I hear is the need \nfor child care and the need to provide more resources for this purpose. \nWe must make sure that resources are available for child care or \nwelfare reform will fail. This is a most fundamental issue.\n  The average annual cost per participant in Iowa's PROMISE JOBS \nprogram is $1,920, including $987 for child care. It is clear that \nchild care is a critical part of moving welfare recipients into the \nwork force.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senators Dodd and Kennedy for addressing the \nimportant issue of child care and welfare reform and urge adoption of \nthe amendment.\n\n[[Page S 13192]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHollings be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises Senators that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has only 1 minute and 42 seconds, and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has 14 minutes and 52 seconds. Therefore, there is \ninsufficient time for the elapse of a quorum call.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume. I \nwant to go over this amendment again and discuss it specifically for \nMembers who may be torn, as I think many are, in wanting to support \nwork and see the potential need for day care.\n  Focusing on what the amendment does, we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion from the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nMassachusetts of the concern for mothers with preschool children, that \nwe cannot allow mothers who have children 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years of age--\nand I have three children all under the age of 5 and I am keenly aware \nof the need for care for young children.\n  However, this amendment does not just pertain to young children. This \nprovides funding so that every welfare parent with children under 12 \nyears of age--12 and under, under 13--you can have an 11-year-old or \n12-year-old and you still get a funded day care slot. That is what the \namendment says. This is not just focused on children under 5.\n  We talk about being concerned for them. This is a much more expansive \nprogram. It is not just part-time child care, it is a full-time child \ncare program. It is 12 and under, full time, not just for single moms, \nnot just for single moms or dads who have children, but for married \nmothers and fathers who may be on welfare and have children. This is \nfor two-parent households as well as single-parent households. That is \nwhat the amendment says.\n  You could have a situation where you have a 12-year-old child at home \nwith two parents, and under this bill, you would get a full-time day \ncare slot paid for by the Federal Government. Would that not be nice if \nevery American who was working, the Government would pay your full-time \nchild care, and you could not even have to work under this bill.\n  So you do not have to work. You can be married, have a 12-year-old at \nhome, do not work, and the Government will pay your child care full \ntime. That is what this amendment does.\n  Now, you hear a lot of compassion on the other side about the single \nmom with the 2-year-old, but you do not hear that this is another well-\nintended bill that focuses on the hard problem. And then when you \nrealize this is a brandnew big-time expansive program, day care for \neverybody on welfare, whether you are married or not, whether you are \nworking or not.\n  I do not think that is what is being sold here on the Senate floor. I \nthink we have to look very carefully at what is in this amendment and \nhow much money it costs--$6 billion, fully funded day care slots for \nall children of married and unmarried parents, single and married \nparents, up to 12 years of age. Not the preschool kids, but up to 12 \nyears of age.\n  I think this is a real Pandora's box we have opened. This is not the \namendment that is being talked about. This is a very broad, expansive \nprogram.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator familiar with how many parents are \nwaiting for child care in the State of Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think the number is around 9,000.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 7,779 children now are on the child care \nwaiting list in Pennsylvania, many are single parents, waiting to get \noff welfare or stay off welfare.\n  I am wondering, does the Senator believe that for those who want to \nwork and can work, that there ought to at least be some help and \nassistance, either full or part time, as was included in the bill \npassed in 1988 and providing at help and assistance for hundreds of \nthousands of families?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, I say the answer is yes. I \nthink we do that in this bill. In the Dole modified bill, we believe \nthere are ample dollars available. Within the AFDC block grant, there \nwill be money available for child care.\n  You have the additional child care block grant, which is appropriated \nat $1 billion for this year and as necessary for future years. We will \nhave this debate every year, Senator.\n  We are going to have a debate on the floor of the Senate over how \nmuch money we will provide in the appropriations process for people on \nwelfare who need day care assistance. I may be back here with you, \njoining with you in having started this program in place and having \nseen the needs and heard from the Governors that we may need to \nappropriate more money in the years ahead. There is nothing that \nprohibits us from doing that.\n  But to lock in--you do not call it an entitlement, but it might as \nwell be one--to lock in a program of $6 billion right now, not just \nagain for young kids, for children under the age of 5, but for children \nup to the age of 12, for parents who are single and married, I think \nthat just goes too far.\n  I hope that my colleagues will look at the expansiveness of this \namendment, the cost of this amendment, and I think the unfairness of \nthis amendment when juxtaposed to the working family in America.\n  We are telling the working family in America that, if you want to \nraise children, fine. But you are on your own. But if you go on \nwelfare, even if you are married, we are going to provide a full-time \ngovernment day-care slot for you. I think that goes too far.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment, that we will continue to work--\nas I know the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] has talked about, and I \nknow the Senator from Vermont and others who are looking at this issue \nwill--we will continue to work to see what we can do to make sure that \npeople are not disqualified from working because of the unavailability \nof day care. That is what the Snowe amendment----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can finish--that is what the Senator's amendment \ndoes. It focuses in on the problem areas. It says, if you cannot find \nday care, and if you can show that day care is unavailable, whether it \nis just too costly, given the amount of money you receive on welfare, \nor it is not proximate to where you live, or whatever the case may be--\nand there is a laundry list of things that you can use to show the \nunavailability of day care--under the Snowe amendment that is included \nin the Dole package now, if you can show that day care is unavailable, \nyou are exempted from the work requirements.\n  That is a very important measure. Because what that does is it says \nto the State--which, I remind you, has to have, when this program is \nfinally phased in, half of the people in the program in the work \nprogram. Those people who cannot find day care remain in the \ndenominator but not in the numerator. So they are part of the base of \n100 percent, but they do not go toward the 50 percent you need for work \nparticipation. If you have a sufficient lack of day care, that is going \nto have a big effect on your ability to meet your 50 percent work \nparticipation standards.\n  We believe that will be adequate impetus, in fact more than adequate \nimpetus, to get the States to provide day-care services that are \nnecessary to get younger mothers, in particular, into the workplace. We \nthink that kind of flexibility and dynamics are better than creating \nout of the box a fully funded entitlement--or guarantee, it is not an \nentitlement--guarantee that you are going to have day care if you are \non welfare: You get day care if you have children under age 13 whether \nyou are married or not, whether you are working or not. I just think \nthat is too big of a loophole, too big of a grant. \n\n[[Page S 13193]]\nAnd I think it is an unwise move by the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that what the Senator understands the Dodd amendment \nwill do, provide day care for all children? The Senator just said that. \nIs that what the Senator understands it to do? You said it. Of course--\n--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, I will be happy to answer the \nquestion. It says on page 4 of the amendment, eligible children are--\n\n       For purposes of this section, the term ``eligible child'' \n     means an individual, who is less than 13 years of age and \n     resides with a parent or parents who are working pursuant to \n     a work requirement contained in section 404 of the Act.\n\n  So I think it is clear that those who are eligible are under 13 years \nof age, can be with a single parent or parents, which I assume means \nmarried.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And what percent in the Dole proposal would be included \nunder that requirement? What percent in the Dole proposal will not be \nso included?\n  As the Senator knows, half of those will be required to work in order \nfor the States not to be penalized. They are going to have to find \ntheir child care outside of these requirements.\n  The Senator understands that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When the Senator says this amendment is effectively \nsaying to every parent that all children will receive child care, that \nis not a fair characterization of the amendment. I mean, I think that \nis what we ought to do--but that is one fact that the Senator is wrong \non. And second, how does the Senator understand the discretionary block \ngrant? Who is eligible for that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding, if I can respond to the first point, \nis that the Senator from Connecticut has repeatedly said the formula \nwas calculated based on fully funding every welfare parent who is \nrequired to work with children under 12. That includes single parents \nand married parents. So there will be parents who will not have to work \nbecause only one of them will be required to work that will, in fact, \nget day care. I think that is a little much.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, the Dole proposal requires that \nhalf of all families on welfare participate in the work program. HHS \nestimates that half of these families will find their own child care. \nThe Dodd amendment is focused on those families that will need child \ncare assistance in order to move from welfare to work.\n  So it is not all of those. It is those that they believe--50 percent \nof the adults that otherwise would need the child care under this \nproposal.\n  Let me just ask the Senator----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, the 50 percent participation \nstandard means that 50 percent of the people in the welfare program are \ngoing to be required to be in a work program. The other 50 percent are \nnot required to be in a work program and therefore the need for day \ncare, I would assume--there would be no need for day care because they \nwould not be in a work program.\n  So, what the Dodd amendment does is provide funding for those who \nhave to work. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I am a strong supporter of the need for \nchild care to move people off of welfare into work. But second, how \ndoes the Senator understand the block grant program? Who is eligible \nfor the discretionary block grant program?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Under the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, just under the existing program, the $1 billion that \nis existing under the discretionary program. Who is eligible for that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Before I answer that question, how much time is there \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes 20 \nseconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 24 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we have another 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will put a unanimous consent in, and then I will be \nhappy to respond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote on or in relation to \nthe Dodd amendment occur at 5:15 p.m. today, notwithstanding the \nprevious order, with the time between now and 5:15 equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is, under the current proposal, that \nmoney is a block grant to the States with the States' discretion to \nprovide those funds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The existing discretionary block grant program, who is \nparticipating in that program today? The program originally created by \nSenators Dodd and Hatch.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know the answer to that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. See, this is part of the problem, Mr. President, using \nthese characterizations loosely. That program is targeted to low-income \nworking families. It provides $1 billion and 700,000 families \nstruggling to make ends meet and stay off welfare. It has been \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats alike. The idea, under these \nproposals, is to assist those who are making the minimum wage, who \nstill receive the $13,000 for the family and still cannot afford the \nchild care they need to get by.\n  The Senator mentioned earlier that he is concerned about trying to \nprovide some help and assistance to working poor families. I hope then \nhe opposes diverting these essential resources away from working poor \nfamilies as is encouraged by the Dole bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time, I just think, \nwithin the existing AFDC block grant, there are funds available, that \nare currently available under the AFDC program, for child care. Those \nfunds would continue to be available if the State should so desire to \ncreate a program to provide assistance for people on welfare in \naddition to the block grant funding. So what we do is provide State \nflexibility to be able to use those funds as the State sees fit, which \nis in keeping with what this side of the aisle was trying to do, which \nis for the States to be able to design, we believe, better programs \nthan a Washington-based program.\n  Again, I think throughout this dialog we found that, in fact, this \nprogram is an expansive, new--I will not use the term ``entitlement'' \nbecause there is not an entitlement in the law --but it fully funds \nevery slot that is necessary. I know that is not an entitlement because \nyou cannot go in there and go to court and say I am entitled to this \nmoney. But the money is there. Anyone who has a child under the age of \n13, one or two parents, will be able to get fully funded government day \ncare, a full-time day-care slot.\n  Again, it is the option of first resort, not last resort. If you look \nat the money the Senator from Massachusetts was just talking about, the \nblock grant funding, and he talks about how many working families are \nwaiting for this assistance, it is not the option of first resort. You \nhave to look at family and neighbors and friends. That, I would think, \nwould still be--it is harder. But I think we have done enough to say \nthat families are not important in this country or that fathers are not \nimportant in this country, to continue to provide money to replace \nexisting social networks and just say the Government will do it. You do \nnot need the father's money.\n You do not need a father around anymore. We will pay the father's \nmoney. That is what AFDC is for and all these other programs. You do \nnot need grandparents or cousins. We will have a fully funded \nGovernment day care slot for you. We do not need family support. What \ndoes that mean? That is not necessary. We will continue to isolate you \nfrom your surroundings. I think that is harmful. I think guaranteeing \nsomething up front is harmful in the long run. It may sound good, but \nit will continue to destroy the fabric and culture of our society where \nwe used to be interdependent. And because the Government is now coming \nin and doing everything for you, you have become this island unto \nyourself.\n\n  I think it is a very sad state in our communities. And we will only \nadd to that with this program.\n  I hope we do not accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains? I see the leader \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts has \n9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I have 3 minutes? \n\n[[Page S 13194]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have listened to my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania. I listened to him describe the Dodd amendment. I have \ndifficulty understanding his interpretation. There are 60 percent of \nwelfare mothers today who have children 5 years of age or younger. \nUnder the most recent modification, they would not be sanctioned for \nfailure to participate in the work program. It is clearly better for \nparents to stay home than to leave their children home alone, but what \nabout the great number of those individuals who want to work, would \nlike to work, could work, will work, and are just looking for the \nopportunity and the child care they need to enable them to work. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania says, ``Well, we are not going to be punitive \nto them.'' Well he is right, the most recent modification is better \nthan the original bill, but it is not enough.\n  The final point that I want to mention again is what the National \nCouncil of Churches says with regard to this. I have read it. They \nbelieve we need increased access to child care. The National Conference \nof State Legislatures, bipartisan, believes that we need additional \nchild care. The American Public Welfare Association thinks we need \nadditional child care. The Catholic Charities talk about it. They think \nwe need additional child care, and the list goes on. The National \nParent-Teachers Association agrees.\n  These are groups that are operating programs for children every \nsingle day, talking with parents and listening to their concerns. They \nare on the frontlines, and this is what their conclusion is.\n  Our amendment will promote work and protect children. It will improve \nthe lives and the livelihoods of millions of American families. That is \nwhy I think the amendment is needed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leadership time for \nwhatever time I may consume to speak in behalf of the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his excellent comments and for the leadership \nthat he has shown on this issue throughout this debate, and certainly \nthe Senator from Connecticut, the senior Senator, Senator Dodd, for his \nwork in bringing us to this point this afternoon. His leadership and \nthe effort that he has invested in this issue for many years is \nillustrative of the contribution that he has made on a number of issues \nrelating to children. And this is perhaps the most important \ncontribution of all.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has indicated, you \nsimply cannot have welfare reform if you do not address the issue of \nchild care adequately. There can be no doubt that it is the linchpin \nbetween welfare and work. Why? Because 60 percent of AFDC families have \nchildren under 6. Why? Because, in many cases, those same families \ncannot find adequate day care, cannot afford day care even if they can \nfind it, and have great anxiety about leaving their children \nunattended.\n  I do not care whether it is one parent or two parents. If we want \nthem to go out and work, if we want them to go out and get the skills \nnecessary so they can work--time after time they have told us, and time \nafter time virtually every social organization has indicated--you have \nto find a way to take care of their children. That is what this \namendment does. It says in a meaningful way we are going to create a \npartnership. We are not going to tell you who to take your children to. \nWe are not going to create some new governmental system to do it. We \nare simply going to give you the means by which you can find the best \nway to take care of your children.\n  This will affect every single welfare family. You have to have a \nchild to be on welfare, period. You do not meet the definition if you \ndo not have a child.\n  Child care enables mothers to go to work, to have the confidence to \nleave their home. Parents cannot accept their responsibilities as \nparents if they leave their children at home alone without any \nsupervision, without any care, without any knowledge of what is going \nto happen to their children, especially at those early ages.\n  Let me address another point that was raised in this most recent \ncolloquy. It is not just the child who is under the age of 4 or 5 and \nnot yet ready to go to school that we ought to be concerned about. What \nhappens to those children who are going to school, who come back in the \nmid to late afternoon to a home without a parent, without anybody to \ntake care of them through the end of the day? What happens to them? \nWhat kind of supervision, what kind of care, what kind of nutrition, \nwhat kind of attention are they going to get? This amendment addresses \nthat concern. It is not just a concern for those who are under the age \nof 6 and not able to go to school. We have to be equally as concerned \nwith those children who come home in the afternoon and have no \nsupervision, especially in those early ages.\n  Families below poverty spend almost 30 percent of their income on \nchild care, Mr. President. Nonpoor families only spend about 7 percent \nof their income on child care. There is no secret why low-income \nfamilies are not capable of addressing the need for child care in their \nown families.\n  Child care costs in the District of Columbia can run as high as $150 \nto $175 per week. The average monthly benefit for an AFDC recipient is \nless than $400. So we are asking many parents today to spend more in 1 \nmonth on child care alone than they receive in AFDC. Obviously, Mr. \nPresident, it is an incredible impediment for many people.\n  So what happens is that most people today are relegated to finding \nother ways of ensuring that their children are cared for. They depend \non relatives who may or may not be reliable or informal arrangements \nthat may or may not work on a daily basis. A job requires reliable \nchild care, and often that is very hard to find.\n  So in many cases, Mr. President, parents are simply forced to make \ndo. And all too often, unfortunately, they do not make do. All too \noften they are forced to rely on low-quality care.\n  We believe that quality child care is too important to child \ndevelopment to leave those children home alone or to make a way somehow \non a day-to-day basis with relatives or families or people in the \nneighborhood to care for their children. Studies show that the first 3 \nyears of life in some ways are the most critical of all. Quality care \ncan clearly change the lives of children today. Quality care can truly \ngive kids a head start. Quality care can relieve parental stress and \ngive people the confidence they need to walk out of that door and go to \ntheir job, go on and achieve meaningful job skills, and do so with the \nknowledge that they can be a productive, cohesive, and successful \nfamily when the work is done.\n  Mr. President, that is all we are asking. Let us give families an \nopportunity to be families. Let us give them the opportunity to be \nstrong families. Strength is defined in part by how strong the children \nare, by how nourished, how educated, how guided, how attended, and how \ncared for they are.\n  The Republican plan, frankly, is nonexistent in this regard. It is \nnice to have all the nice sounding rhetoric, but the fact is you have \nnothing if you do not put resources next to it. There are no resources \nin the Dole bill. It is estimated that the Dole bill in its current \nform is underfunded by almost $11 billion in the area of child care.\n  So there is no assurance that the children of single mothers will be \nadequately cared for. As the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nhas said over and over, the Home Alone bill is not what this piece of \nlegislation ought to be.\n  The modification made by the majority leader last week does not \naddress this concern. In fact, it only exacerbates the problem. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has alluded to, the bill prohibits States \nfrom sanctioning mothers with children under 6. That may be good in \nsome cases. But that is not the real issue. That does not help mothers \nbecome self-sufficient. It is a de facto exemption from the work \nrequirement.\n  We do not want to exempt mothers, and we do not want to exempt States \nthat do not provide the resources. We want States to provide the \nresources so that mothers will have the tools and the opportunities \nthey are going to need.\n  Mr. President, the Dole bill in its current form will exempt 60 \npercent of those who are eligible for welfare today. Why? Because 60 \npercent of AFDC mothers have children under 6. \n\n[[Page S 13195]]\nAs the Dole bill is written, it will exempt any mother among that 60 \npercent that cannot find or afford child care.\n  States already had to pay for day care. It was an unfunded mandate, \nbut they were required to pay it or exempt mothers and take a 5-percent \ncut in the block grant. The likelihood now is even greater that the \nbill has virtually no value in terms of putting people to work or \nproviding child care.\n  So that is why this amendment is so important. This amendment says a \nnumber of things. First of all, it says we cannot expect parents to \nwalk out that door, achieve the desired goals of this bill--that people \neither acquire skills or acquire a job--if they have to leave their \nchildren at home alone.\n  Second, it provides the resources necessary to make this happen. We \nensure, not only that States are going to establish the mechanisms by \nwhich to provide those services, but that States are going to have the \nresources to see that that happens.\n  Third, the Dodd-Kennedy amendment is tough on work but not on kids. \nWe require able-bodied adults to work or to prepare for work. We ensure \nthat when they do, we are going to enter into a partnership with them \nto see that their children are cared for. We guarantee that child care \nassistance is provided, and we do so not by exempting the mothers with \nchildren who cannot find day care, but by helping them find the child \ncare they need to allow them to work in the first place.\n  It is very clear. The adoption of this amendment is the linchpin to \nwelfare reform. We are not going to get it without child care. We are \nnot going to get it without the level of resources required to provide \nmeaningful child care. We are not going to get it simply by exempting \nmothers who have no other recourse but to stay at home because child \ncare is not available.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric in this debate. The most important \nthing we can do to change rhetoric to real action is to pass this \namendment, to provide the resources, to provide the mechanisms, and, \nmost importantly, to provide mothers the confidence that they can be a \nfamily when they come home from work at night. This investment in \nchildren is as important to kids as it is to mothers, as it is to the \nsystem itself. It deserves our support, and I hope Republicans will \njoin us in the passage of it as we take up the vote momentarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 5 \nminutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Their time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes and seven seconds on the \nminority side.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back all of his time? Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Democratic leader just spoke. Does anybody on that side \nwish to be heard on this?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to recognize the Senator from Washington \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I just want to say that the abstractions \nwith which we deal with issues like this here are very different from \nthe reality on the streets.\n  On my way back here from Seattle today, I read a long and fascinating \narticle in the New York Times about the cultural differences among \nvarious kinds of gangs in the city of Los Angeles. The reporter reports \non the particular ethos of black gangs, of Asian gangs, and of Hispanic \ngangs. In Los Angeles, the Spanish gangs account for most of the street \nmurders, in the number of hundreds every year, but they do have a \nstrong sense of family. And the principal part of the story is about a \n15-year-old gang member with a 17-year-old girlfriend who has a 1-year-\nold child by this gang member.\n  If I may, I will share the last two paragraphs of that story with \nyou, Mr. President.\n\n       ``He's always staying home now,'' Tanya said hopefully. \n     ``He doesn't want to miss nothing. He's saying, `Can't you \n     just leave the baby with me. I'll watch the baby and you go \n     to school.''\n       Dreamer is still only school age--\n\n  He is 15.\n\n     Tanya acknowledged, but the young family expects to be \n     financially secure. Her mother receives Federal assistance to \n     care for her through Aid to Families with Dependent Children. \n     And now, Tanya said, she will also receive AFDC assistance to \n     care for her own daughter, who is named Josefina.\n\n  So here we are subsidizing gangs and gang warfare in Los Angeles. \nThat is why we need to pass this bill. That is why we need to deal with \nreality.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I just want to remind Members what this amendment does. \nThis is not an amendment targeted at preschool children, to provide \nsingle mothers support for preschool children. Children aged 12 and \nunder are eligible for a full-time guaranteed day care slot under this \nproposal, under the Dodd amendment including two-parent families. Not \njust single mothers but two-parent families also qualify for a full-\ntime day care slot. It also has a 100-percent maintenance-of-effort \nprovision in this bill on the States.\n  This is a throwback to some of the ideas that we were debating for \nthe past 2 decades. This is not in a new direction. This is not the \ndirection we should take if we are going to reform the welfare system \nand get people back to work and get back to self-sufficiency.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Dodd amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, first of all, just in response \nto my friend from Pennsylvania, we say with regard to children that \nthey should not be penalized if there are two parents. In fact, we \nought to be encouraging that. And second, for after-school programs, it \ndoes not mean all-day child care, people in school. Obviously, it does \nnot apply in those cases.\n  However, let me get back to the central point, Mr. President, if I \ncan, in conclusion. We all want to see people move from welfare to \nwork, and assist in that process. Every survey that has been done over \nthe last decade has indicated that one of the major obstacles of people \nmoving from welfare to work is the absence of child care.\n  Sixty percent of all AFDC recipients have children age 5 and under. \nIf we are truly committed to moving people from welfare to work and we \nwant to assist States in that process, we must provide adequate funds \nfor child care. Because this bill mandates a 25-percent work \nrequirement in 2 years, and 50 percent by the year 2000--we set that as \na mandate in this bill--we should assist States in making that happen. \nAll this amendment does is provide the assistance in a pool of money.\n  It is not an entitlement. It does not guarantee anybody anything. \nMerely on a proportional basis based on the block grant, it says to the \nStates, ``Here is a pool of money to assist you in providing those \nfamilies that you are moving from welfare to work with child care.''\n  Everyone knows that any effort to go from welfare to work, with \ninfant children, that does not provide for child care will fail. And \nall of us do not want to see that happen.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that we come together. This is an \nauthorization--authorization. Money will have to be appropriated. If \nthe numbers are less, then appropriate to less. But let us not try to \ndivide over this issue that has united us in the past. Let us see if we \ncannot here find some common ground.\n  I happen to believe, Mr. President, we would pass welfare reform 95-5 \nif we would adopt the Dodd amendment on child care. We could end the \nacrimony. We could have a good welfare reform bill. We could assist our \nStates. And we could move people from welfare to work. Let us not miss \nthis opportunity, for once, to come together in this Congress on an \nissue this critical and this important to the American public.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I urge a \n``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the Dodd amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays. \n\n[[Page S 13196]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question recurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas, Mrs. Kassebaum.\n  There are 4 minutes of debate, evenly divided.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Kansas, [Mrs. Kassebaum], is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2522\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, first, I would like to ask for the \nyeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I will reiterate why I believe this \namendment is important.\n  Mr. President, I, too, feel strongly about the importance of child \ncare. In order to make our welfare reform effort successful, I could \nnot support the measure that we just voted on because I felt it was an \namount of money that could not be sustained and was not offset in a way \nthat I felt would be successful.\n  The rationale for my amendment is briefly three parts. It creates a \nunified system of child care at the State level, with one State plan. \nIt is not an effort to, in any way, intrude on the infringement of one \ncommittee over another. It is my idea that a consolidation of these \nefforts is important, and it provides one set of regulations, rather \nthan a two-track system. So it does not transfer jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee child care program to the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee. But it does set up a single system through \nwhich child care is handled. It prevents families from experiencing \ndisruptions in their child care since their eligibility is no longer \ntied to specific program requirements, that is, AFDC. Instead, \neligibility is based on a family's income, through a sliding fee scale \nthat the State determines. As parents earn more, they make a greater \ncontribution for child care assistance.\n  I feel it is very important that low-income families can be able to \nmove off of welfare rolls and yet still be able to maintain some \nsupport for child care. It preserves the limited funding for child care \nfor low-income working families, many of whom rely on this assistance \nto stay off of the welfare rolls. For example, for a family of two \nearning minimum wage, average yearly child care costs consume 47 \npercent of the household gross income. That is a significant amount, \nMr. President. I believe families do need some support because it is \nthe children that we do have to protect in this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] and the \nSenator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

The question--the Senate will please be in \norder.\n  The question is on the amendment No. 2523, offered by Senator Helms. \nThere are 4 minutes evenly divided. Who yields the time?\n  The distinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do not believe I can talk over the \nvarious discussions going on.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator is \nright. He is entitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n  Mr. FORD. The Chair can call names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, instead of making remarks, I have prepared \na sheet that is on every Senator's desk that explains, or refutes in \none or two cases, suggestions about what this amendment does or does \nnot do.\n  Let me go down the list. First, the question and then the answer.\n  How much of the taxpayers' money will this amendment save? \n\n[[Page S 13197]]\n\n  CBO says it will save $5.68 billion over 7 years.\n  What are the work requirements under the Helms amendment? And by the \nway it is cosponsored by the distinguished occupant of the chair, Mr. \nFaircloth, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Grams of Minnesota, and \nMr. Shelby of Alabama. What are the work requirements under the Helms \namendment?\n  Food stamp recipients must work a total of 40 hours over a 4-week \nperiod before receiving benefits.\n  Question. Are temporarily unemployed people denied food stamps?\n  No, community service will count as work.\n  Are work requirements in the Helms amendment stronger than in the \nDole amendment? And, incidentally Senator Dole supports the Helms \namendment.\n  Yes. The Dole amendment allows recipients to receive food stamps for \na full year and requires only 6 months of work to qualify.\n  Will pregnant women be denied food stamps?\n  No, there are millions of pregnant women who went to work this \nmorning. But if and when they are unable to work they can and will get \nfood stamps when qualified.\n  Will retired people be denied food stamps?\n  Of course not. Citizens over 55 are exempt from the work \nrequirements.\n  How many individuals does the Helms amendment target?\n  It targets the 2.5 million able-bodied individuals who refuse to \nwork.\n  Exempted by this amendment are children under 18, parents with \nchildren, parents with disabled dependents, mentally or physically \nunfit, and all who are over 55.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the dilemma with the Helms amendment is \nvery simple. That is in many communities throughout the country there \nare not volunteer programs. There are not work programs that people \ncould take up. In some cases, there are not jobs.\n  Frankly, the problem is the amendment affects able-bodied people who \nare temporarily laid off, as people sometimes are in this country, \nduring recessions or during closing of factories or economic change. It \ndoes not really give a very good opportunity for those people to \nqualify for food stamps.\n  USDA estimates 700,000 people would be affected. By and large, these \nare people, often with long work records, who temporarily have bad \nluck.\n  In my judgment, the amendment has the merit of trying to tighten up \nthe food stamp situation but it does so at the expense of able-bodied \nAmericans who should not be penalized.\n  I encourage the Senate to defeat the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is true that this amendment by itself \nwould save money. But you could also say that if we had an amendment \nthat totally did away with the food stamp program that would save even \nmore money.\n  Basically what this says is you could be somebody who has worked in \nthe plant for 15 years, you paid your taxes, you are an upright citizen \nwho paid for the programs and everything else, and if that factory, the \nlargest employer in the area, should suddenly close, and you cannot \nfind a job within 30 or 31 days later and if you are looking for food \nstamps you are not going to get them because you have not worked in the \nlast 30 days. This is far too punitive. It is going to make it \nextremely difficult, as the senior Senator from Indiana said, for those \nwho have been employed who because of a disaster or a plant closing or \nsomething else are out of a job. It goes much too far.\n                       food stamp work amendment\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Helms \nand Faircloth to offer this amendment to the welfare reform bill. This \namendment is based on the simple notion that recipients of public \nassistance should give something in return for their benefits. To not \nrequire work for welfare, is to promote irresponsibility, which is \nultimately harmful to the recipient.\n  This amendment is straightforward. It states that those recipients of \nfood assistance, who are able-bodied, do not have any dependents, and \nare between the ages of 18 and 55, must work for an average of 40 hours \nper month in order to receive their food assistance.\n  Some critics might point out that the Dole amendment already has work \nrequirements for Food Stamp recipients. However, those work \nrequirements do not begin until 6 months after the person begins \nreceiving food assistance. Workfare programs should resemble the \nprivate sector to the greatest extent possible, and I do not know of \nany business which pays its employees for 6 months before the employee \never begins working. Our work requirement is structured identically to \nprivate sector employment: wages--or benefits in this case--are paid \nafter the service is rendered. This will promote personal \nresponsibility and self-sufficiency.\n  Finally, one of the main benefits of work requirements is that they \nare a humane way of screening people off of welfare who do not belong \non the rolls. Many people receiving benefits which are now free, will \nopt to pursue other options they currently have in the private sector \nif they are faced with even a minimal work requirement. If they have no \nsuch options, they will be able to continue to receive benefits in \nexchange for community service. However, CBO has estimated that this \nwork requirement will save taxpayers $5.5 billion over 7 years, due to \na decrease in the food stamp rolls of more than 1 million individuals. \nThis will free up money to be used on people who are in genuine need, \nwho have small children, and who have no employment options in the \nprivate sector.\n  Again, this amendment does not affect anyone with small children, or \nanyone who is disabled or elderly. It is carefully targeted at those \nwho are the most likely to be able to move into the private sector.\n  Mr. President, this is a responsible amendment, and one I hope my \ncolleagues will support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against the \namendment offered by the senior Senator from North Carolina.\n  Let me be clear. I am for reform of the Food Stamp Program. I am \nwilling to toughen up work requirements. I am for elimination of fraud. \nThat is why Democrats included reforms in our welfare reform.\n  We include increased civil and criminal forfeiture for grocers who \nviolate the Food Stamp Act. We require stores to reapply for the Food \nStamp Program so that we make sure that fraud is not taking place. We \ndisqualify grocers who have already been disqualified from the WIC \nProgram. We encourage States to use the electronic benefits transfer \nprogram and we allow them to require a picture ID. We require able-\nbodied people who are between 18 to 50 to work after a period.\n  The fight here is over food, not fraud. This amendment would say to \nworkers in my State and States across this country that if you are a \nvictim of a plant closing, you won't get any food stamps unless you go \nout and work. This amendment is tough on new mothers. Under this \namendment, if you are about to have your first child and for some \nreason you lose your job, you are cut off from food stamps unless you \nwork. Cut off at the most critical time in life for good nutrition. \nThis amendment doesn't recognize that some areas are hit by high \nunemployment. This proposal fails to realize that we do have \nrecessions.\n  In a time when we denounce mandates to the States, this is exactly \nwhat the proposal does--it mandates further costs. This amendment \noffers no funding to help these workers find work or create jobs. It is \nassumed that State and local governments can do this on their own. \nState and local governments will have to enforce these new Food Stamp \nrequirements at the very time they are reinventing their welfare \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I am for welfare reform including the Food Stamp \nProgram. I am not for denying help to those who truly need it and that \nis what this amendment does. I urge my \n \n[[Page S 13198]]\n\ncolleagues to vote this amendment down so we can get on to real reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from North \nCarolina. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] and the \nSenator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent as to how we \nmay proceed. It has been worked out and cleared by the Democrats. There \nwill be no more votes tonight.\n  Unfortunately, we could not get anybody to offer an amendment, but we \ndo have an agreement the Senator from California and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota will offer amendments and votes will occur tomorrow.\n\n\n                 Orders for Tuesday, September 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand in recess until 9 a.m. Tuesday, \nSeptember 12, 1995, and the Senate immediately resume consideration of \nH.R. 4, the welfare bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. there be 10 minutes \nfor debate on the pending Conrad amendment No. 2529, to be followed \nimmediately by a vote on or in relation to the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that following disposition of the Conrad \namendment, there be 4 minutes equally divided in the usual form on the \nFeinstein amendment No. 2469, to be followed immediately by a vote on \nor in relation to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that following disposition of the Feinstein \namendment, Senator Breaux be recognized to offer his amendment \nconcerning maintenance of effort; that the time prior to 12:30 p.m. be \nequally divided in the usual form and a vote occur on or in relation to \nthe Breaux amendment at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues on both \nsides, I think there are a couple hundred amendments pending. We did \nnot dispose of very many today. It is my understanding there are about \n19 cleared on this side. And we hope we might be able to dispose of \nthose this evening if they can be cleared on the other side. They are \nboth Democratic and Republican amendments, and not controversial, as I \nunderstand it.\n  I have not seen the amendments myself. But I think we have \nindicated--at least I have indicated, and I think the Democratic \nleader, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, \nagrees--we ought to complete action on this bill Thursday, that on \nFriday take up the State, Commerce, Justice appropriations bill, and \neither complete action on that Friday--the chairman would like it \nFriday or Saturday, that bill, because we do need to complete action on \nthe remaining appropriations bills and go to conference and send them \ndown to the President before October 1.\n  And so there is a lot of pressure on us to get the work done. We \nstill have the six appropriations bills to do. Two or three will take \nsome time. A couple of them may go rather quickly. So I would suggest \nthat we have got a lot of work to do in a rather short time.\n  I know that some of my colleagues will have problems in the first \nweek in October because of religious holidays. And we want to \naccommodate everybody, try to accommodate everybody, as we should. But \nhopefully we will have the appropriations bills done, so it will be \neasier to accommodate those who have particular concerns in that area.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to cooperate with the managers on each \nside so we can complete action on this bill on Thursday evening.\n  I will be sending a cloture motion to the desk. In fact, I will do it \nright now.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I have three pending amendments that I would be \nprepared to take up after the Breaux amendment has been disposed of, \nand if it is appropriate, if you would amend your unanimous-consent \nrequest to take up the three 4Moseley-Braun amendments thereafter.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Did you want 1 hour?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. An hour would be sufficient.\n  Mr. DOLE. For each one?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. One hour for all three.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think now that we have two Democratic amendments pending, \nour hope would be that we take up the Ashcroft amendment, the Shelby \namendment, and then the amendments of the Senator from Illinois, if \nthat is satisfactory.\n  I do not know how much time they are going to take. So we would be on \nyour amendments by about 4:30.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is there time on the Aschroft amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. One hour on Ashcroft; 1 hour on Shelby; and 1 hour on \nyours, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Why do we not ask for that now?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would request, immediately after disposition of the \namendments from the Senator from Illinois, an amendment offered by \nSenator Bumpers and myself be the next Democratic amendment. And we \nhave agreed to a time agreement of 2 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. DOLE. I want to first make certain we satisfy the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. If I may, I would like an hour on my side on my \nthree amendments. And if that would mean an hour--that would be 2 hours \ntotal on the three amendments that I have.\n  Mr. DOLE. OK. Let me just make this consent request, that following \nthe disposition of the Breaux amendment--the vote will occur at 2:15--\nthen we consider the Ashcroft amendment, 1 hour equally divided in \nreference to food stamps; followed by a Shelby amendment in reference \nto food stamps, 1 hour equally divided; followed by three amendments by \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, 2 hours \nequally divided; followed by----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  \n[[Page S 13199]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Senator from Florida would be understanding, I \ndo not know that we could get a time agreement at this point. But in \nthe sequence, he would come after the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would modify my request for unanimous consent just to \nbe in sequence after the Senator from Illinois and settle at a later \ndate the question of time.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the only point I would make--I am not certain we \ncould do that. We do not want to get to one amendment at 5 o'clock \ntomorrow and be on it for the rest of the day.\n  If I could get consent, before I move to the Graham amendment, on the \nprevious three amendments, Ashcroft, Shelby--no time agreements.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. And I say to \nmy friend, the majority leader, there are some that are very involved, \nand the floor manager here understands that very well. We have not been \nable to check about the time limits on food stamps.\n  If we could do sequence, then work out the time agreements after \nthat, I think that would be best. But as far as agreeing to a time as \nit relates to these amendments, it would be very difficult for us to do \nit at this time unless we could get all of those Senators that are \ninvolved and interested in the particular amendments that are going to \nbe brought forward.\n  We are talking about basically six amendments here, and one of them \nyou cannot give a time agreement on; one you have the time agreement \nfor an hour on the three; but then that does not include time in \nopposition, so 2 hours. I would be put in a very untenable position to \nhaving to object.\n  I see the minority leader is here, the Democratic leader is here now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is OK.\n  Mr. President, I will just modify my request.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, I must say we still have a couple hundred amendments \npending. I do not want to get carried away that we are making progress \nif we take up four amendments, five.\n  Mr. FORD. They are major, though.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would ask the following sequence: Following disposition \nof the Breaux amendment, Senator Ashcroft be recognized to offer an \namendment on food stamps; following disposition of that amendment, we \nhope to get a time agreement, and that the Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby, be recognized to offer an amendment on food stamps; \nfollowing disposition of that amendment, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, be recognized to offer three \namendments with a 2-hour time agreement, 1 hour on each side; followed \nby the Graham-Bumpers amendment on formulas, as I understand it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is right.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object. Might I ask the majority \nleader a question?\n  Mr. Majority Leader, there is no time agreement yet as to when this \nbill has to be disposed of, is there?\n  Mr. DOLE. No. But it is my hope, and I hope the hope of the \nDemocratic leader, that we finish it Thursday. Otherwise, I think we \nwill go the reconciliation route. We could be here on this for the next \n3 weeks, and we have six appropriations bills to pass. We have got some \npeople pressing for a recess in October. And we want to try to \naccommodate people, but sometimes we have to accommodate the work at \nhand. And there is a lot of work at hand.\n  For 49 hours we have been on this bill. It is a very important bill. \nBut this will take us into tomorrow evening, even this agreement--one, \ntwo, five, six, seven, eight, nine amendments, which will get us to \nsometime tomorrow evening. That would still only leave 200 left. That \nmay be progress; not in my book.\n  I will send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  First, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the view just expressed by the \nmajority leader. I think we have made some progress. We have a long way \nto go. I know that some of the amendments that have been offered are \nduplicative amendments, so there is probably a much shorter list than \n200.\n  I think we can make a real good-faith effort tomorrow and see if we \ncannot accommodate both sides in not having votes on all of these. I \nthink if we can work with the managers and accept some of these \namendments, it would be very helpful as well.\n  There are two other amendments, at least I will just put our \ncolleagues on notice, on the Democratic side. I would like the \nLieberman amendment and the Kennedy amendment having to do with work as \nour next two amendments, regardless of whether they are part of the \nunanimous-consent agreement or not. I think it would be helpful for \nDemocrats on our side at least to know what the sequencing will be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the amendment to strike the training aspects of \nthe welfare proposal; basically, the Kassebaum training programs that \ndeal with dislocated workers, the workers that would be covered under \nNAFTA, GATT, defense downsizing, corporate restructuring, environmental \nconsiderations, an amendment that would be used to strike those \nprovisions from the Dole bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Any time agreements?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We would be glad to work out a reasonable time, and I \nwill be glad to talk with others who are the cosponsors and Senator \nKassebaum and make a recommendation to the leaders tomorrow and try to \nget that in prior to the time of the cloture vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just say for my colleagues, we have two Republican \namendments, and then we have three amendments from Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun and then the amendment of Senators Graham and Bumpers. I \nassume following that there would be a Republican amendment, and then \nwe can accommodate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The next two Democratic amendments following those would \nbe the two I just mentioned.\n  Mr. DOLE. I also want to say, as I indicated earlier, since the \nleader is on the floor, there are a number of amendments that have been \ncleared on this side, and if they can be cleared on the other side--I \nthink there are a total of 19--that would be a sign of progress, too. \nAs I understand, they are amendments from Republicans and Democrats. \nThey are not controversial. They probably would not have been cleared. \nThat would be a sign we are making progress, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will add Senator Domenici's \namendment on family cap to the sequencing when he is finished.\n  Mr. DOLE. Following the Graham-Bumpers amendment, how much time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At least an hour on my side; maybe an hour on the other \nside.\n  Mr. DOLE. They may want to check that. I can seek agreement but not \ngive a time agreement. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be \nsequenced in after Graham-Bumpers, but we cannot get an agreement on \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13183-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13199-S13200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition, and I \nspeak to amendment No. 2469, which was earlier offered, which has to do \nwith the growth formula provided for in this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be added as a cosponsor to \nthe legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me try to be succinct as to how \nthis amendment would change the Dole bill. Essentially what the Dole \nbill does, as drafted, is present a growth fund for the next 5 years of \n$877 million. It then submits a formula under which that growth fund is \ndisbursed. The formula would provide funds only to 19 States. You \ncannot convince me that only 19 States are going to grow in terms of \npoor families in this Nation.\n  So what I have tried to do is come up with a fair formula that \nmeasures the growth of poor families. The House bill has a formula in \nit which measures the growth of people and then applies that to this \nbill. Ours is very similar to the House, with one distinction, and the \ndistinction is that it would use the census data to count the increase \nin poor families to determine how the growth money is spent. The House \nuses the census data to count the increase in the general population. \nThen, the way in which the growth money is spent is simply: The \npercentage of growth is divided into the overall total growth. In that \nway, every State is accommodated, and the growth funds are distributed \nto each state proportionate to its share of the total growth.\n  Specifically, it would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to publish every 2 years data relating to the incidence of \npoverty. The methodology employed mirrors title 13 of the United States \nCode, section 141(a) of the census statute, and as I have said, is the \nsame as the House welfare reform bill. So people should know that what \nwe are doing is simply following the way the census produces the \nmaterial, under current law, and then empowering the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to disburse funds according to the results of \nthat data, and proportionate to each state's share of the total growth \nin poor people.\n  There is no additional cost associated with this amendment.\n  I would like to add that all States are being held harmless; in other \nwords, no State's grant would be reduced if that State experiences a \ndecline in poor population. According to the present population \nprojections, four States are expected to experience an actual decline \nof population. They are Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode \nIsland. These States are all held harmless in this amendment.\n  If, of course, the projections prove wrong and those States do \nexperience an increase, because no one can actually predict future \ngrowth, they will receive their fair share of the growth formula.\n  If I may, I would like to contrast this with the approach taken in \nthe underlying bill. Eight hundred seventy-seven million dollars over 5 \nyears is authorized in this bill to accommodate growth. As I said, only \n19 States are funded with this growth formula. Under the Dole bill, the \n19 States receive automatic additional funding, 2.5 percent of their \n1996 grant, in each of fiscal years 1997 to 2000 if, one, their State's \nwelfare spending is less than the national average level of State \nspending and, two, their rate of population growth is greater than the \nnational average population growth.\n  For reasons which are unclear, certain States are deemed as \nqualifying if their level of State welfare spending per poor person is \nless than 35 percent of the national average level of State welfare \nspending per poor person in fiscal year 1996.\n  So Federal taxpayers are being asked to spend almost $1 billion over \n5 years in the name of growth.\n But, in fact, the result is that States that, until now, have spent \nless than the average level of State spending in assisting their poor \nwill now be subsidized by taxpayers from all 50 States. I think that is \nplain wrong. The State with the greatest growth--and that is \nCalifornia--is significantly disadvantaged because its funding is \nfrozen for the next 5 years. I have distributed a letter with our \nproposal, with the Dole-Hutchison formula in it and with the \ndifference. So there are three charts on everyone's desk tonight so \neverybody can look up their State.\n\n  Certainly, the 19 States recognized in the Dole bill--and I know \nSenator Hutchison will comment on this--will be cut back somewhat so \nthat everybody could have a fair share of the growth fund based on the \nactual growth of poor people in their State as determined by the Bureau \nof the Census. What could be fairer than that? If in the census you \nachieve more people, the growth fund is there to give you your percent \nshare of the total growth fund.\n  So I will yield the floor for the moment. I know Senator Hutchison \nwould like to debate this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be managing the time on this \namendment for our side. Mr. President, I want to lay out exactly what \nmy amendment does, or my formula, the Dole-Hutchison formula, does. \nSenator Santorum is going to have to leave in 7 minutes, so I would \nlike to ask him to speak for 2 or 3 minutes, and then I will lay out \nthe parameters of the Dole-Hutchison formula so that everyone \nunderstands why it is the fairest formula.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding.\n  As I discussed the other night, I want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Texas for working diligently in coming up with this formula. It is \na fair formula. On the surface, it sounds like the Feinstein formula is \nfair because it is based on growth in poverty population.\n  What the Feinstein formula ignores is how we got to the allocation in \nthe first place. In other words, how did we get to today? It is based \non not how many poor children there are in California, Pennsylvania, or \nNew Mexico; it gets to the State today based on how much the State of \nCalifornia ponied up, as did the States of Texas and Pennsylvania. As a \nresult, you have States like California--and Pennsylvania being another \none and New York--who had large welfare contributions. They put up a \nsubstantial State match. As a result, they got more Federal dollars. If \nyou put up more State money, you got more Federal money. So you had \ncertain States who were more generous with their welfare--or more \nprogressive, some would say--and put up more dollars.\n  Well, now the match is gone. There is no longer a match required \nunder the Dole substitute, the bill we are going to pass. So to suggest \nthat we should now take a formula based on what a State match was and \napply that in the future, based on what the growth in the poverty \npopulation is, already gives those States that had high State matches \nan artificial advantage in the first place.\n  So what the Hutchison formula tries to do is say--starting at this \ninequity, because the Hutchison formula holds every State harmless and \nsays that, from there on, we are going to have the States who get less \nper child under current law get more money over time to equal out what \nthe Pennsylvanias and Californias and New Yorks get. So her growth \nformula targets the low-benefit States that are growing and allows them \nto catch up with these Federal dollars.\n  It is fair in the sense that these are block granted funds and there \nis no match required anymore. California does not want to spend a penny \non this. They will not anymore because we have a 75 percent maintenance \nof effort. But California can reduce their contribution, which would be \na lot more to their State budget than Mississippi's reduction in their \nwelfare contribution. So they have a lot more flexibility under the \ncurrent law. There is no match requirement except to the extent of the \n75 percent maintenance of effort. \n\n[[Page S 13201]]\n\n  This is a fair way to make up the difference over a period of time. \nAs Senator Hutchison will very articulately tell you, they are still at \nthe short end of the stick because the per child expenditure for a \nchild from California, New York, or Pennsylvania will still be less \nafter 7 years than they will be in taxes, even though it is a block-\ngranted formula. We try to make up this inequity. I congratulate her \nfor her tenacity in dealing with this issue. This was the toughest \nissue to deal with. Any time you try to figure out how the money is \nallocated, you get all sorts of parochial interests that jump to the \nfloor. She was able to stick in there and handle it and bring people \ntogether. It is one of the principal reasons this bill is on the floor \nand in shape to pass the Senate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes of our time. \nI want to start by thanking the Senator from Pennsylvania. I appreciate \nall of his efforts on this bill. He is one of the first people who \nunderstood the balance in the formula.\n  Mr. President, this formula is very carefully balanced. That is why \nit is fair. The challenge we had was to make a fair formula in a \ntotally reformed welfare system with a 5-year block grant.\n  Now, here was the problem. You have high-welfare States that gain in \nthe beginning because they are block granted for 5 years. These are \nStates that have put more into their welfare spending and therefore \nhave gotten more out. A State that has put more in has also gotten more \nFederal matching funds. Therefore, they have gotten more total AFDC \ndollars. Now, you have low-benefit States that have not put up as much \nmoney. My State is 35th in per capita income and may not have been able \nto put up as much. So they have gotten fewer Federal dollars.\n  In we come with welfare reform. Now we are going to lessen the State \nrequirement. We will have no State requirement at all in the last 2 \nyears of this 5-year plan. So we have to reform the formula as well, to \nkeep the low-benefit States that are growing from being in a desperate \nsituation. So the challenge was not to take from anyone, but to allow \nthese low-benefit, high-growth States to be able to win in the end, so \nthat they march toward parity.\n  If I can say one thing about this formula, it is that we have a goal \nof parity at some point in the future. I would like to be at parity \ntoday; so would Senator Domenici, so would Senator Nickles, and so \nwould Senator Gramm. We would like to be at parity right now. But even \nafter 5 years, our States will not be at parity. But we know that we \nhave to make accommodations so that everyone can feel that they have \ngained something from welfare reform. So we are willing to move slowly \ntoward parity, which should be the goal of this country--for every poor \nperson to have the same basic general grant in welfare. My solution, \nthe Dole-Hutchison formula, does exactly that.\n  Some have said that food stamps make up for inequity. This is not \ntrue. If you put AFDC and food stamps together, which gives you the \nfairest picture, even after 5 years with the Dole-Hutchison formula, \nhere is what you have. The higher welfare States like California that \nare frozen still get more than their percent of the poverty population \nin Federal dollars at the end of 5 years. California will get 14.41 \npercent of the Federal dollars under my formula, whereas, they have \n14.1 percent of the poverty population. So they will be getting $141 \nmillion more than their actual share of the poverty population. Because \nthey are frozen at the higher level, they are going to be big winners \nin the beginning, and they will still not be losers at the end.\n  Hawaii, for instance, will have double its poverty population in \nFederal benefits. New York will have 9.94 percent of all the Federal \nAFDC dollars, whereas it has 7.6 percent of the poverty population. \nMassachusetts will get 1.99 percent of the Federal dollars, whereas, it \nhas 1.7 percent of the poverty population. Michigan will get 4.16 \npercent of the dollars, whereas, it has 3.6 percent of the poverty \npopulation.\n Washington State will get 1.96 percent of the total Federal dollars \nwhereas they have 1.5 percent of the poverty population.\n\n  Now, these are States that are going to be frozen at the higher \nlevels. That is why these States win even though they are frozen. If \nyou take their Federal dollars frozen plus their food stamps they still \ncome out ahead of their poverty population percent.\n  Now, what is wrong with the Feinstein amendment? Let me say that the \nFeinstein amendment, she has done her homework. I admire the Senator \nfrom California very much. Here is what is wrong with this amendment. \nIt redistributes the growth even to high-benefit States so they get a \ndouble advantage. They get a high Federal benefit in the beginning and \nthey get the growth.\n  So what happens? They increase in poverty requirements, which are an \nincentive to even the high-welfare States to continue having growing \npoverty statistics.\n  The second thing that is wrong with the Feinstein amendment is parity \nwill never be reached. We will never reach the goal in this country to \nhave general parity across the Nation of all of the AFDC grants.\n  Let me give some examples of the difference between the Dole-\nHutchison formula and what Senator Feinstein's formula would do to the \npoor States.\n  California receives $1,016 per poor person now. Alabama receives $148 \nper poor person, and yet under the Feinstein amendment Alabama will \nlose $11 million more under her formula than they would get under mine \nbecause they will grow under mine because they are poor.\n  Arkansas, $137 per poor person as compared to $1,016 from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The 6 minutes of the Senator \nhas expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to be extended 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining on her \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me finish this thought, and I want \nto yield the floor to Senator Domenici for 2 minutes.\n  We have the poor States that will continue to lose under the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The third thing that is wrong with the Feinstein amendment is that it \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine poverty \nestimates by means of sampling, estimation, or any other method that \nthe Secretary determines will produce reliable data.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is a hole as big as a Mack truck. Who knows \nwhat the formula might be? We just cannot live with that. We must have \nsomething that we can count on that will not be jiggered or changed \nover the years, to be considered fair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield the Senator from New \nMexico 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Senator Hutchison, let me just say we actually should call the new \nformula in the Dole amendment not the Dole-Hutchison but the Hutchison-\nDole.\n  I commend the Senator also for the tremendous job done in trying to \ncreate parity and what I perceive to be fairness. I have great \nadmiration for anybody that tries to get more for their State. \nObviously, I admire the distinguished Senator from California for \ntrying to get more for California.\n  Essentially, to just give an example, California and New York each \nstart off with more Federal spending per poor person than New Mexico, \nTexas, Alabama, and Virginia combined. Let me put it one more time, \njust taking California. California starts off with more Federal \nspending per poor person than New Mexico, Texas, Alabama, and Virginia \ncombined.\n  Now, if we are going to have a formula that perpetuates that \ndisparity, then why would we from States like New Mexico, Texas, \nAlabama, Virginia, and many others, want to be part of this change in \nour Federal Government's approach to the welfare system? Why we would \nwant to join and put our States and our poor people in a perpetual \ninferiority position--not a little bit, but a dramatic difference.\n  The Senator from Texas has stated the difference. We will never catch \nup.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas did not come up with a formula \nthat would take from the rich States, the States that have harvested \nthe program so well. We did not decide in our work together--I worked \non it with you, the Senator from New Mexico worked with you--to take \nfrom them. \n\n[[Page S 13202]]\n\n  We just said do not continue to leave the poorer States in a \nperpetual state of disparity beyond any recognition. There will be a \nwelfare program in New Mexico under this that will be one-third of that \nin New York. My State will lose $23 million. It is one of the hardest \nhit States. There are many more like it.\n  I say to the Senator from California, good luck on getting things for \nCalifornia but on this one, this formula will not work because it is \nnot fair. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Dole substitute to H.R. 4 authorizes \na supplemental appropriation of $878 million over fiscal years 1997 \nthrough 2000 to be allocated to certain States in addition to the funds \nthey would receive under the temporary assistance for needy families \nblock grant. States qualify for the supplemental funds if one, total \npopulation--not just poor population--growth in fiscal year 1996 is \nabove the national average and State welfare expenditures per poor \nperson are at or below 50 percent of the national average, or two, \nState welfare expenditures per poor person are at or below 35 percent \nof the national average, regardless of population growth.\n  States have a one-time opportunity to qualify in fiscal year 1997. If \nthey do, they will receive a 2.5-percent increase in their block grant \nfunding each year, 1997-2000, regardless of whether they continue to \nmeet the eligibility standards in subsequent years. Likewise, States \nthat fail to qualify in fiscal year 1997 are excluded from receiving \nany of the supplemental funds even if they were to quality later. The \npractical effect of the provision would be to boost cumulative funding \nin 19 so-called growth States--but not California--by 10.4 percent. The \nremaining 31 States, including New York, would be held harmless; their \nallocations under the main block grant would remain frozen through \nfiscal year 2000, Not surprisingly, fully two-thirds of the Senators \nwho represent the winner States are Republicans.\n  Mr. President, there are major flaws with this provision that makes \nme wonder just how serious its proponents are. First, general \npopulation growth is not a reliable proxy for an increase in a State's \nshare of the growth of poor people who qualify for welfare benefits. \nMany rapid-growth States attract new residents precisely because their \neconomies are strong and work opportunities are good. It is entirely \npossible that a State experiencing rapid growth due to economic \nexpansion could see its share of poor people decline. Conversely, a \nslow-growing Rustbelt State could see its share of total population \ndecline but its share of poor people eligible for welfare increase.\n  The second problem is that supplemental fund will be made available \nonly to those growth States whose State expenditures per poor person \nare at or below 50 percent of the national average. And then there is \nthe curious provision that rewards nongrowth States if their State \nexpenditures per poor person are at or below 35 percent of the national \naverage.\n  A State could have a large share of childless working or elderly \npoor. These individuals would dilute per capita welfare expenditures \neven though they would not be welfare recipients. More importantly, are \nnow about to enter the business of rewarding States who will not spend \ntheir own resources on their own poor people? Are we going to start \npunishing States that do commit their own resources by reallocating \nscarce Federal funds away from them? I will have much more to say on \nthis subject when we take up the formula amendment the senior Senator \nfrom Florida has offered. Suffice it to say at this point that I will \nnot stand by and allow our Federal system to be wrecked in one fell \nswoop.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment is identical to the provision in the \nbill the House passed pertaining to supplemental block grant funds. \nEach State's annual share of the supplemental block grant, if any, \nwould be proportionate to its share of the increase in the number of \npoor people nationwide. New York, theoretically, could be eligible for \nsupplemental block grant funds.\n  The Feinstein amendment requires the Census Bureau to update and \npublish data relating to the incidence of poverty for each State, \ncounty, and local school district unit of government every 2 years, \ncommencing in fiscal year 1996 and authorizes an annual appropriation \nof $1.5 million for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, I support the Feinstein amendment, but it does have \ntwo flaws. First, an increase in the number of poor people--while \nbetter than the proxy used in the underlying substitute--still is not a \nprecise proxy for an increase in the number of poor people who would be \nwelfare beneficiaries. Once again, low-income men and women without \ndependent children and the elderly poor, for instance, would not be \nAFDC recipients but would count in the population tallies that \ndetermine whether a State qualifies for the supplemental block grant. \nMore importantly, while updating poverty data more frequently is a \ndesirable public policy goal, which I support, statisticians are not \nconfident yet that accurate subcounty counts are possible in any \ncontext other than the decennial census.\n  Collecting data more frequently typically will harm slow-growing \nStates like New York when the data sets are plugged into allocation \nformulas. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that poverty data do not \nreflect regional or State-by-State differences in the cost of living. A \nfamily of our just above the poverty threshold living in New York City \nis demonstrably worse off than a family of four just below the \nthreshold living in rural Mississippi. Research indicates that \ndifferences in the cost of living can be as great as 50 percent.\n  Each year, in collaboration with the Taubman Center for State and \nLocal Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, I publish \na document entitled ``The Federal Budget and the States'' that details \nthe flow of funds for the previous fiscal year. Aficionados of the \nreport know that I refer to it as the ``Fisc.'' I send a copy to each \nSenator every summer and hope that my colleagues read it. At any rate, \nthe most recent edition of the Fisc contains, for the second year, the \n``Friar/Leonard state cost of living index,'' which is named for its \ncocreators, my coauthors, Monica E. Friar, an indefatigable research \nassistant, and Professor Herman B. Leonard, academic dean of the \nteaching programs and Baker Professor of Public Finance at the Kennedy \nSchool. If we were to apply the Friar/Leonard index to subnational \npoverty statistics, we would find that New York's 1992 poverty rate \njumps from the 18th highest rate nationwide to the 6th highest.\n  One of the amendments I offered last, Friday would require the Census \nBureau to develop cost of living index values for each of the States--\nat a minimum, and at the sub-State level, if practicable--and apply \nthose values to the national poverty threshold in determining the \nnumber of poor people for each State. The index value for the United \nStates would be 100. A State such as New York might have a hypothetical \nindex value of 106 while Mississippi might have an index value of 94. \nApplying the index values for the two States to the national poverty \nthreshold would increase the income limit and hence the number of poor \npeople in New York and decrease the income limit and the number of poor \npeople in Mississippi.\n  Earlier this year, a National Academy of Sciences [NSA] panel of \nexperts released a congresssionally commissioned study on redefining \npoverty. The report, edited by Constance F. Cirro and Robert T. \nMichael, is entitled ``Measuring Poverty: A New Approach.''\n  According to a Congressional Research Service reviews,\n\n       The NAS panel (one member among the 12 member panel \n     dissented with the majority recommendations) makes several \n     recommendations which, if fully adopted, could dramatically \n     alter the way poverty in the U.S. is measured, how Federal \n     funds are allotted to States, and how eligibility for many \n     Federal programs is determined. The recommended poverty \n     measures would be based on more items in the family budget, \n     would take major noncash benefits and taxes into account, and \n     would be adjusted for regional differences in living costs.\n       . . . Under current measures the share of the poor \n     population living in each region in 1992 was: Northeast: \n     16.9%, Midwest: 21.7%, South: 40.0%, and West: 21.4%. Under \n     the proposed new measure, the estimated share in each region \n     would be: Northeast 18.9% Midwest: 20.2%, South: 36.4%, and \n     West: 24.5%.\n\n\n[[Page S 13203]]\n\n  The CRS report, ``Redefining Poverty in the United States: National \nAcademy of Science Panel Recommendations,'' was written by Thomas P. \nGabe.\n  Mr. President, despite the flaws I have just mentioned, the Feinstein \namendment is enormously superior to the underlying provision, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the senior \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to extend that 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think I only have--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This would be 90 seconds in addition.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I get 4 \nmore minutes because I have two other speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the Senator from Florida if he would yield \nwithout losing any of the time for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2575, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be modified. It is an amendment on my part to \nconform the amendment on the family cap to the Dole amendment as \noffered.\n  My previous amendment was in anticipation of the amendment. This just \nmakes it conform with the Dole amendment. I ask that it be filed as \nsuch and take the place of my previously filed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       Strike the matter inserted in lieu of the matter on page \n     49, line 20, through page 50, line 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(c) State Option To Deny Assistance for Children Born to \n     Families Receiving Assistance.--At the option of the State to \n     which a grant is made under section 403 may provide that the \n     grant shall not be used to provide assistance for a minor \n     child who is born to--\n       ``(1) a recipient of assistance under the program funded \n     under this part; or\n       ``(2) an individual who received such benefits at any time \n     during the 10-month period ending with the birth of the \n     child.\n                           Amendment No. 2469\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise just to put the Senate on notice \nthat this is not the only alternative to the formula that we will have \nan opportunity to consider during the debate on the welfare reform \nbill.\n  There will be other amendments that will be offered by Senator \nBumpers, others, and myself tomorrow which go to the more fundamental \nissue.\n  That fundamental issue is that not only as the Presiding Officer has \ncorrectly pointed out have we changed the status quo by no longer \nrequiring a local effort, and therefore continuing a formula whose \nnumbers were predicated on that effort, is irrational.\n  We go beyond that. We impose new obligations on the States, \nparticularly in the areas of child care and preparation for work. We \nare going to be requiring essentially the same obligation from each of \nthe 50 States with enormously different amounts of Federal resources in \norder to reach those obligations. There are some States that will have \nto spend over 80 percent of their Federal money in order to meet the \nnew Federal mandates. Other States can reach those Federal mandates \nwith 40 percent or less of the Federal money.\n  So I suggest this is not just an issue of allocating money between \nTexas, California, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Florida, or the other \nStates. It goes to the fundamental issue of: Can we achieve the result \nthat this bill is intended to achieve, which is to assist people \nthrough appropriate State action to move from welfare dependency to the \nindependence of work?\n  My suggestion is that we will not be able to achieve that objective, \nand therefore I urge the amendment as offered by my good friend, the \nSenator from California, be defeated and, frankly, that tomorrow we be \nprepared to engage in a very fundamental debate about how we are going \nto allocate resources that, in my opinion, is critical to whether this \ngoal of welfare to work is attainable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I appreciate what she is trying to accomplish. But under her formula, \nas I calculate it, California would receive fully 20 percent of the \nsupplemental amount already appropriated in the bill. Under the \nHutchison formula, not a single State would lose any block grant \nfunding but there is an adjustment for those particularly high growth \nStates and States that are well below the national average on the \nreceipt of Federal funds for welfare spending.\n  Everybody has a different formula which helps them. Senator Feinstein \nis only trying to help her constituents.\n  But if we get bogged down in a welfare formula fight, there is a good \npossibility that welfare reform could be derailed in the Senate.\n  Realizing that, a group of Senators early on, under the leadership of \nSenator Hutchison, came up with a formula that, in a small way, begins \nto recognize the need to distribute welfare funds in a more equitable \nmanner.\n  The point is this: States that are currently well below the national \naverage in receipt of Federal funds and State welfare spending and \nStates that will experience higher than average growth in population \nshould receive a greater share of the ``growth'' formula. The Hutchison \nformula accomplishes this by giving States that meet these criteria a \n2.5-percent increase per year in block grant funding starting in fiscal \nyear 1997. Under this formula, no State loses any block grant funding \nand 17 States with particular needs get an increase. So, in States like \nMississippi, where AFDC payments are the lowest in the Nation, a small \nstride will be made toward allocating funding in a way that treats poor \nchildren more equitably. And, in States like Arizona, where population \ngrowth is expected to be well above the national average over the next \n5 years, a small movement toward equity in funding distribution is also \nachieved.\n  The Feinstein amendment, on the other hand, is based solely on \nincreases in incidences of poverty. That will upset the balance that \nwas achieved earlier on the funding formula.\n  It is based solely on increases in poverty--which can be a built-in \nincentive for States to keep people in poverty in order to receive \nincreases in Federal funding.\n  It will reward States like California and New York, which already \ntake a huge chunk of the Federal pot with even additional Federal \ndollars. Under the Feinstein amendment, 20 percent of the supplemental \namount already appropriated in the bill will go to California. This is \nnot fair.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, California's spending per person in \npoverty will remain well above the national average while Arizona will \ncontinue to hover around the national average. And, under Feinstein, \nother States like Mississippi and Texas, will not even reach the \nnational average in spending by the year 2000.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, States that are poor and growing will \ncontinue to be poor and growing without the necessary 10.4 percent \nincrease that the Hutchison formula would provide. California, which \nalready receives three times more in Federal funding per poor child--\n$1,016 per child--than a child in Arizona--$361 per child--will receive \na much larger increase than Arizona.\n  Since there will no longer be a Federal/State match required in \nwelfare spending under the Dole welfare bill, there must be a movement \ntoward equity in Federal welfare funding to the States. We cannot \nexpend all of our resources in just a few States.\n \n[[Page S 13204]]\n\n  The Hutchison formula is a very fair formula and I urge my colleagues \nto reject the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to say this formula would \nnot have come about without Senator Kyl and Senator Mack, who is the \nnext speaker and I want to yield the remainder of my time tonight to \nSenator Mack from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute and 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Hutchison formula has been \ninappropriately referred to as a ``supplemental'' grant to States. This \nis a misleading characterization of the additional moneys provided in \nthis legislation. It implies that certain States have been able to \nnegotiate a sort of slush fund or bonus for themselves unfairly.\n  In reality the Hutchison formula in the underlying legislation begins \nto chip away at historical inequities between States due to the Federal \nGovernment's present system of awarding AFDC moneys.\n  This debate is and should be about equity.\n  The Feinstein amendment not only undermines an honest attempt to \nprovide some equity and parity between States but it does so in a way \nthat in essence rewards States for increasing the number of people \nliving in poverty each year.\n  This policy, Mr. President, runs counter to the welfare reform bill's \ngoal of encouraging States to get people off welfare and into work. Any \nincentives that we create to reward States for reducing their welfare \ncaseloads would be nullified by Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  The Hutchison formula provides funds for States which have been \nhistorically below the national average of Federal welfare spending and \nat the same time experiencing an above average population growth. These \nqualifiers appropriately identify those States with the most need and \nbegins to move those States, albeit modestly, toward parity.\n  California currently receives $1,016 per person living in poverty \ncompared to the $363 Florida receives per poor person living in \npoverty. Under the Hutchison formula, in the year 2000, Florida will \nstill not reach parity with California--Florida will only be receiving \nabout $400 per person living in poverty. Yet the Feinstein amendment \nwill give California $160 million additional over the next 5 years.\n  Providing States like California with additional money, when they \nalready receive more Federal dollars per recipient than almost any \nother State--does not mean equity to me. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the underlying bill and vote against the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for as much time \nas I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. She has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In deference to my opponents on this issue, and I \nvery much respect them, there is really a difference in viewpoint here.\n  Let me explain where I am coming from. For more than a half a \ncentury, the way the Federal allocation has been determined has been \nbased on a State determination of benefit level, so a State decides \nwhat its cost of living is, how much it needs to sustain a poor family, \nand sets that amount. And then the Federal Government matches that \namount.\n  Suddenly, what is being said, as I hear it, is those States that had \nlow benefit levels or what amounts to a very low maintenance of effort \nare now going to be rewarded with a growth fund. California's grant is \n$607 a month because California decided that the basic cost of living \nnecessary for a family was at least that. And California would put up \none half of it. If a State like Alabama, for example, decides that they \nonly want to put up $164, then the Federal Government only matches a \npercentage of that amount.\n  Where the arguments made on the other side of the aisle do not ring \ntrue to me is only 19 States are benefited in the Dole bill with the \ngrowth fund. That means any other State that has growth is not going to \nget any money under this bill.\n  In the Feinstein amendment, 28 States have a net benefit over the \nlanguage. Let me tell you which they are and what the additional annual \namount is, over and above the Dole bill, by the fifth year.\n  Alaska, $2,029,000; California, $64,922,000; Delaware, $1,217,000; \nHawaii, $2,840,000; Idaho, $289,000; Illinois, $9,062,000; Indiana, \n$6.627 million; Iowa, $2.164 million; Kansas, $3.381 million; Kentucky, \n$4.058 million; Maryland, $6.763 million; Michigan, $5.275 million; \nMinnesota, $5.816 million; Missouri, $4.058 million; Nebraska, $1.758 \nmillion; Nevada, $2.488 million, New Hampshire, $812,000, New Jersey, \n$5.545 million; New York, $1.217 million; North Dakota, $135,000.

Estimates prepared by CRS based on financial data on AFDC and related programs from the Department of   \n  Health and Human Services [DHHS] and poverty and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.                 \n\n\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. These tables show how 28 States would gain as a \ndifference between what the Dole bill would give and what this \namendment would provide. For the most part, many of these are States \nwith a higher benefit level. These States have decided they were going \nto spend what they needed to spend to have a poor family be able to \nexist in their States. What I object to about the Dole bill is that a \nState is locked out because a State has had a high benefit level and a \nmaintenance of effort and has been willing to provide for their people. \nNow, they are frozen out of the growth fund.\n  California, the biggest State, with the most poor people: there is \nnothing in the growth fund for California. And the reason that is being \ngiven is, well, you do not deserve any money because you fund half of \n$607 a month from California taxpayers to support poor people. So, \nbecause California and these 27 other States have had a higher \nmaintenance of effort, and said we are going to fund poor people, \nsuddenly they are left out of any growth fund.\n There is no hold harmless. They are left out. They are locked out, and \nthat is what I object to in this language.\n\n  You can come to California, or any high cost-of-living State, and \nattempt to live. And it is very much tougher. This is the way the \nformula has been figured now for over a half century--based on a state \nmatch. The Hutchison formula is a stark change from that. But it is a \npenalty. And it says if you have funded your poor people in the past, \nas a State, you are now not going to figure into the growth formula.\n  So let me say another thing. The House of Representatives in its \nwisdom has passed a formula which is straight across the board based on \ngrowth in a State. The only difference in what they did and what I am \nsuggesting we do is base it on growth of poor people. If a State wants \nto support their poor population, I think that is fine. If they do not, \nwhat we are saying, if the Hutchison language is accepted, is, \ntherefore, the Federal Government should reward them for not doing it \nby providing a growth fund for them. And I frankly cannot agree as \nsomeone who has participated in local government helping make some of \nthese decisions. I simply cannot agree that that is the fair way to do \nit.\n  So we have presented this. Again 28 States benefit, I have given the \namounts. Twenty-two States lose money in this way.\n  But I believe it is fair. It is based on a census as ratified by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield my 33 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2501\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last week I offered an amendment that is \ndesigned to give States greater authority to crackdown on welfare \nfraud.\n  This amendment would allow States to intercept Federal income tax \nrefunds in order to recover overpayments of welfare benefits due to \nfraud or error.\n  This technique, called tax intercept, would be used as a measure of a \nlast resort against former welfare recipients who defraud the system. \nOriginally, welfare was designed as a transitional program to help \npeople become self-sufficient.\n Many families find themselves \n \n[[Page S 13207]]\n\n\nin circumstances beyond their control and legitimately need temporary \nhelp. However, as we all know, far too many individuals abuse the \nsystem, making public assistance a way of life. This amendment is \ndesigned to crack down on the persistent fraud problems that plague our \nwelfare system.\n  It is estimated that welfare overpayments represent about 4 percent \nof payments paid by AFDC, food stamp, and Medicaid programs. Many of \nthese overpayments are due to deliberate fraud. This type of abuse is \nan insult both to hard-working taxpayers who struggle daily without \nGovernment assistance as well as families on welfare who play by the \nrules.\n  Currently, a similar tax intercept is reducing fraud successfully in \nthe Food Stamp Program in 32 States. My amendment would create a \nsimilar model for AFDC. It is also designed to protect taxpayer \nprivacy.\n  Just as important, my amendment would save States at least $250 \nmillion, enabling them to use the savings for those who truly need \nassistance. The most recent estimate of this proposal was done in 1992, \nwhen the United Council on Welfare Fraud estimated that States could \nsave $49 million per year. If a similar analysis were done today, I \nexpect the savings from my amendment would be even greater.\n  I am pleased this amendment will be accepted. It means getting tough \non the cheats who abuse our welfare system.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Bryan be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my colleague for his cosponsorship and support \nand leadership in this area.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining with Senator \nPressler as a cosponsor on this amendment to provide States the option \nto use the IRS Federal income tax refund intercept process to try to \nrecapture AFDC-type benefit overpayments.\n  Some years ago, Congress provided for an IRS Federal income tax \nintercept process to be used to help retrieve child support payment \narrearages. When an individual is in arrears on his or her child \nsupport payments, the IRS refund intercept allows the State to notify \nthe IRS of the arrearage. If the individual is to receive a Federal \nincome tax refund, the IRS can intercept the refund. Rather than having \nthe tax refund go directly to the individual, the refund amount is \nintercepted and paid toward the child support arrearage.\n  As I know a number of my colleagues have also done in their home \nStates, I have spent significant time this year visiting welfare \noffices in both northern and southern Nevada. During those visits, I \nspent a significant amount of time listening to welfare eligibility \nworkers. It surprised me to learn from these eligibility workers that \nState welfare agencies did not have the authority to notify the IRS to \nintercept Federal income tax refunds to try to recapture benefit \noverpayments for AFDC-type cash assistance.\n  My experience in spending time with those who are actually involved \nin the welfare program, who administer it on a day-to-day basis, has \nbeen enormously helpful to me. They have helped explain some of the \ncomplexities in our welfare system, some of its inconsistencies and \nsome of its frustrations that welfare workers experience when our best \nintended policies are hopelessly inconsistent, or when they find their \nhands tied because of some nonsensical rule that requires them to do \ncertain things.\n  This is why I am particularly pleased to join on as an original \ncosponsor of the Pressler-Bryan amendment. This amendment provides an \nanswer to one of those frustrations. When benefit overpayments are made \nin AFDC-type cash assistance programs under this bill, State welfare \nagencies will now have the IRS refund intercept process available to \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, many times welfare recipients who receive benefit \noverpayments, and most frequently this occurs in the AFDC program, are \nable to walk away knowing they are not going to have to repay the \nbenefit overage. Those individuals essentially have been unjustly \nenriched as a result of a fraudulent overpayment made to them. When \nthey later qualify for a Federal income tax refund, the States are \npowerless to try to intercept that refund, and recapture the money \nrightfully due the State.\n  Under the amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota and \nmyself, we now add a new category to cover those individuals who have \nreceived benefit overpayment by reason of their fraud, or for whatever \nreason the circumstances led to the overpayment. Now States are \nempowered, through the IRS, to intercept any tax refund check that \nwould otherwise be paid to that welfare recipient. And as the Senator \nfrom South Dakota has pointed out, the amount of savings to the \ntaxpayers is enormous. This amendment makes a lot of sense. Expanding \nthe IRS refund intercept process to AFDC-type benefit overpayments \nmakes common sense, and allows all States greater flexibility in the \nadministration of the welfare system.\n   I applaud the Senator for his leadership and associate myself with \nhis comments on this important amendment. This is the kind of \nbipartisan work that I am delighted to participate in, and which can \nhelp make this welfare reform proposal workable for the States.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If we could deal with this amendment, it has been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of amendment 2501.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2501.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nconsidered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2501) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13200-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, it takes no rocket scientist to be aware \nthat the U.S. Constitution forbids any President to spend even a dime \nof Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and \nappropriated by Congress--both the House of Representatives and the \nU.S. Senate.\n  So when a politician or an editor or a commentator pops off that \n``Reagan ran up the Federal debt'' or that ``Bush ran it up,'' bear in \nmind that the Founding Fathers, two centuries before the Reagan and \nBush presidencies, made it very clear that it is the constitutional \nduty solely of Congress--a duty Congress cannot escape--to control \nFederal spending.\n  Thus, it is the fiscal irresponsibility of Congress that has created \nthe incredible Federal debt which stood at $4,962,703,726,882.93 as of \nthe close of business Friday, September 8. This outrageous debt--which \nwill be passed on to our children and grandchildren--averages out to \n$18,838.51 for every man, woman, and child in America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13207-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 13208]]\n\n\n        WELCOMING HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA TO WASHINGTON, DC\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I welcome to Washington today one of the \nmost honorable and respected leaders of our time, His Holiness the \nDalai Lama.\n  His Holiness is a historical rarity, someone who has devoted his \nentire life to finding a peaceful solution to an overwhelmingly \ndifficult political problem with an often belligerent foe. China \ninvaded Tibet in 1949, under the banner of ``peaceful liberation,'' but \nthe presence of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet since then has \nbeen neither peaceful nor liberating. The Tibetan people continue to \nsuffer repression under the too-often violent control of an outside \npower. But the Dalai Lama's response has been unswervingly one of \nseeking a peaceful solution to Tibet's conflict with China. His \nHoliness' courage and leadership is widely respected in Tibet and has \nassuredly prevented the Tibetans from staging a violent uprising or \ninsurgency, the response that suppressed people without such moral \nleadership often take.\n  In accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, His Holiness showed the \nworld how all-encompassing his call for peace and compassion was when \nhe said he felt no ``anger or hatred toward those who are responsible \nfor the immense suffering of our people and the destruction of our \nland, homes, and culture. They too are human beings who struggle to \nfind happiness and deserve our compassion.'' How rare in today's \nworld--or in the history--to find a leader willing to see the human \nface of his or her enemies and to offer compassion in response to \noppression. He argues not for retribution but for recognition that \nthoughtfulness and benevolence towards others is in every individual's \nself-interest, and ultimately is essential for relations in an \nincreasingly interconnected world. His call for people to accept that \nwe are a ``global family'' and recognize that actions we take to hurt \neach other or damage the world we live in--such as acts of war or \npollution--ultimately harm us as well, is a model for global \ninteraction at the end of the 20th century.\n  We can learn much from the teachings of this ``simple monk.'' I urge \nmy colleagues to meet him at a coffee the Foreign Relations Committee \nis hosting in his honor tomorrow afternoon. Come meet the leader whose \nmoral courage and commitment to nonviolence has put him in the ranks of \nleaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mohandas Ghandi. While His \nHoliness' visit to Washington is short, I hope his lessons will live on \nin the minds of us all.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13208-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE RETIREMENT OF REAR ADM. JACK E. BUFFINGTON CEC, USN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that on Friday, \nSeptember 15, 1995, Rear Adm. Jack E. Buffington, Civil Engineer Corps, \nU.S. Navy, will retire after 34 years of honorable and distinguished \nservice.\n  Since September 1992 he has served as the commander, Naval Facilities \nEngineering Command, and chief of civil engineers. As the senior civil \nengineer in the Navy he was responsible for planning, design, and \nconstruction of naval facilities around the world. On Capitol Hill he \nis best known for his role in developing and executing the Navy's \nMilitary Construction Program. As such, he has testified before \ncongressional committees and ensured that members and their staffs have \nfully understood the requirements of the Navy's construction program.\n  Previously he served as the commander, Pacific Division, Naval \nFacilities Engineering Command, and commander, Naval Construction \nBattalions, U.S. Pacific Fleet. Prior to that he was assigned as the \ndirector, Shore Activities Division for the Chief of Naval Operations. \nHis public works assignments included duty at the New York Naval \nShipyard; the Public Works Center, Subic Bay in the Philippines; the \nU.S. Naval Academy; and as commanding officer, Public Works Center, \nNorfolk, VA. Assignments managing Navy construction contracts in the \nfield included duty in New Orleans, LA, and Bethesda, MD.\n  Rear Admiral Buffington is best known however for his devotion to the \nSeabees of the Naval Construction Force. His Seabee assignments \nincluded duty in Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 9 as company \ncommander on Okinawa, on a detail in Alaska, and as officer in charge \nof a Seabee team in Vietnam. Later he served as executive officer, \nNaval Mobile Construction Battalion 4, deployed to Okinawa and Rota, \nSpain. The highlight of his career was probably his tour as commanding \nofficer, Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 1, homeported in Gulfport, \nMS. Under his superb leadership NMCB 1 was awarded the Best of Type and \nthe coveted Peltier Award as the top Seabee battalion in the Navy. He \nlater went on to serve as commander, Naval Construction Battalions, \nU.S. Atlantic Fleet, where he was in charge of Seabees working in \nEurope, Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. There is nothing in \nthe Seabee world which Rear Admiral Buffington has not done, and done \nsuperbly. As a result he is affectionately known throughout the fleet \nas Seabee Jack Buffington.\n  Rear Admiral Buffington is a native of Westville, OK, and a graduate \nof the University of Arkansas where he received his bachelor of science \ndegree in civil engineering. He later attended the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology where he received his master of science in civil \nengineering. Rear Admiral Buffington is the son of Maxine Buffington \nand the late Ernest Buffington of Westville, OK. He is married to the \nformer Robin Bush of Lakeland, FL. He and Robin have two daughters: \nShawn who is married to Kurt Lohrmann, and Kelly, who is married to \nBrian Corey.\n  My State of Mississippi is home to one of the two remaining Seabee \nbases in this country. I know firsthand the important mission they \nperform with unparalleled professionalism. Under Jack Buffington's \nleadership, the Navy's Seabee legacy has grown and flourished. Mr. \nPresident, I take this opportunity to personally pay tribute to a \nsuperb naval officer, true gentleman, and a good friend, Rear Adm. Jack \nBuffington. As he begins the next phase of his life, I wish him fair \nwinds, following seas, and godspeed in all of his endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13208-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13208-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13208-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1404.

A bill entitled the ``Native Alaskan Subsistence Whaling \nProvision''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      the native alaskan subsistence whaling provision act of 1995\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing \nlegislation that Senator Murkowski and I introduced last session that \nwould provide tax relief to Alaska Native whaling captains to help \nensure that they are able to continue their centuries-old tradition of \nsubsistence whaling. This bill would amend section 170 of the Internal \nRevenue Code to provide a charitable deduction to those native captains \nwho organize and support traditional native whaling activities for \ntheir communities. Since there was no revenue bill last year, this \nlegislation did not go through. I hope that it can be considered in the \nreconciliation process this year.\n  Let me tell you why I think this legislation is important. For \nthousands of years the Inupiat and Siberian Yupik Eskimos from the \ncoastal villages in northern and western Alaska have hunted the bowhead \nwhale. The bowhead whale, and the activities related to the traditional \nsubsistence hunt of the whale, are a vital part of the cultural and \nreligious traditions of these Native Alaskan communities. The whale \nmeat and muktuck, which is blubber and skin, from a successful hunt are \ndistributed by the whaling captains to their communities to help ensure \nthe survival of the village throughout the long winter months. In many \ninstances, a successful hunt is the lifeline of these coastal villages.\n  By tradition, each whaling captain is required to pay all of the \ncosts associated with the subsistence hunt out of his personal funds. \nThis includes the cost of providing the boats, fuel, gear, weapons, \nammunition, food, and special clothing for their crews, then storing \nthe meat until it is used. The whaling captain incurs significant \nexpenses in carrying out these activities--averaging $2,500 to $5,000 \nper captain per year. Even though the captain pays these expenses out \nof his personal funds, tradition dictates that the captain must donate \na substantial portion of the whale to the village in order to help the \ncommunity to survive. Each captain retains a portion for personal \nconsumption, but does not benefit financially from the capture of the \nwhale.\n  In recent years, native whaling captains have been treating their \nwhaling expenses as a deduction against their personal Federal income \ntax because they donate the whale meat to their communities, and \nbecause their expenses have skyrocketed due to the increased cost of \ncomplying with Federal and international requirements for hunting \nbowhead whales. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has \nruled that the native whaling captains are not entitled to deduct these \nexpenses as charitable contributions on their personal income tax \nreturns. This has caused an\n extreme financial burden to the whaling captains, whose average annual \nhousehold income is less than $45,000. Currently, five cases are in the \nappeals process.\n\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would amend section 170 \nof the Internal Revenue Code to allow Native Alaskan subsistence \nwhaling captains to deduct their expenses for whaling activities for \nthe community. It would apply retroactively to currently pending tax \nrefund claims and tax years for which the statute of limitations has \nnot expired.\n  I believe this deduction is necessary and justified for a number of \nreasons. First, the whaling captains donate their personal fund to \nsupport an activity that is of immeasurable cultural, religious, and \nsubsistence importance to the Inupiat and Siberian Yupik communities. \nSecond, if the donations of the whaling captain were made to the \nInupiat Community of the North Slope [ICAS], Alaska Eskimo Whaling \nCommission [AEWC], or the communities' participating churches instead \nof directly in the form of food, gear, ammunition, and other \nessentials, they would be tax deductible. The ICAS, a federally \nrecognized tribe, and the AEWC, a 501(c)(3) corporation, are the two \norganizations that are responsible for the preservation of Native \nAlaskan subsistence whaling. The effect of denying a tax deduction \ndirectly to the whaling captains penalizes these Native Alaskans from \nadhering to traditional religious and cultural requirements for the \nsubsistence whale hunt.\n  I would note that the subsistence hunt is carefully regulated by the \nInternational Whaling Commission [IWC] and the U.S. Department of \nCommerce. Local regulation of the hunt is vested in the Alaska Eskimo \nWhaling Commission [AEWC] under a cooperative agreement with the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Acknowledging that \nwhaling, more than any other activity, fundamentally underlies the \ntotal way of life of these communities, the IWC permits the Native \ncommunities to land up to 51 bowhead whales a year. The IWC has \nestablished this quota based on exhaustive documentation of the \ncultural and subsistence need of the whaling villages for each one of \nthese whales.\n  The whaling community has a very good working relationship with these \norganizations, and provides the IWC and NOAA with annual detailed \naccounts of bowhead whale activity. The North Slope Borough of Alaska \nspends approximately $500,000 to $700,000 annually on bowhead whale and \nother Arctic marine research and programs in support of the IWC's \nefforts.\n  The legislation that I have introduced today will incur a very small \nrevenue loss to the Treasury. The cost of this legislation based on the \nexistence of 150 whaling captains is estimated at $230,000 per year. I \nexpect the cost will be significantly less because not every captain \noutfits a crew each year.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and I welcome their support \nof this provision which will help to ensure that the native whaling \ncaptains can continue to carry the centuries-old traditional \nsubsistence whaling hunt for the coastal villages of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN \n                   EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF NATIVE ALASKAN \n                   SUBSISTENCE WHALING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to charitable, etc., contributions and \n     gifts) is amended by redesignating subsection (m) as \n     subsection (n) and by inserting after subsection (l) the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(m) Expenses Paid By Certain Whaling Captains in Support \n     of Native Alaskan Subsistence Whaling.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In the case of an individual who is \n     recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission as a \n     whaling captain charged with the responsibility of \n     maintaining and carrying out sanctioned whaling activities \n     and who engages in such activities during the taxable year, \n     the amount described in paragraph (2) (to the extent such \n     amount does not exceed $7,500 for the taxable year) shall be \n     treated for purposes of this section as a charitable \n     contribution.\n       ``(2) Amount described.--The amount described in this \n     paragraph is the aggregate of the reasonable and necessary \n     whaling expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year \n     in carrying out sanctioned whaling activities.

A bill to designate the reservoir created by Trinity Dam in \nthe Central Valley project, California, as ``Trinity Lake,'' and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      the trinity lake act of 1995\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which \nproposes to change the name of Clair Engle Lake in northern California \nto Trinity Lake. Clair Engle Lake is the largest body of recreational \nwater in Trinity County. Every year, thousands of recreational users \nfrom all over California and the area come to the lake to fish, boat, \nhike, and camp.\n  Since the reservoir was created by the building of the Trinity Dam, \nlocal citizens have referred to the lake as Trinity Lake. This usage \nhas been widely adopted by almost all of the general public as well as \nby Federal, State, and local officials. In fact, this widespread usage \nhas become the cause of confusion for visitors and tourists, and has \nhad a negative economic impact on the lake community.\n  My legislation would end this confusion by changing the name of the \nlake to what it is known as by residents of the area. My legislation is \nsupported by the Trinity County Board of Supervisors as well as the \nBureau of Reclamation. I also am pleased to be working with \nRepresentative Wally Herger who has introduced similar legislation in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. DESIGNATION OF TRINITY LAKE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The reservoir created by Trinity Dam in \n     the Central Valley project, California, and designated as \n     ``Clair Engle Lake'' by Public Law 88-662 (78 Stat. 1093) is \n     redesignated as ``Trinity Lake''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, \n     document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to \n     the reservoir referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     considered to be a reference to ``Trinity Lake''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Public Law 88-662 (78 Stat. \n     1093) is repealed.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13209-2", "month": "09",

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 232. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation \n\n[[Page S 13220]]\n     of ballistic and cruise missiles is significant and growing, both \n     quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense \n     systems can deny potential adversaries the option of \n     escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United \n     States forces, coalition partners of the United States, or \n     allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed \n     with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational \n     and technical advantages of the United States and its \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated that (A) the missile proliferation trend is toward \n     longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) \n     North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile \n     capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years, and (C) \n     although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile \n     threat to the continental United States is not forecast \n     within the next 10 years there is a danger that determined \n     countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \n     the near future and with little warning by means other than \n     indigenous development.\n       (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of \n     effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, \n     as well as against cruise missiles, can reduce the incentives \n     for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing \n     missile capabilities.\n       (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic \n     missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, \n     the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and \n     nonstrategic defense, has changed because of technological \n     advancements and should be reviewed.\n       (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which was \n     one of the major philosophical rationales for the ABM Treaty, \n     is now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar \n     world in which the United States and the states of the former \n     Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate \n     Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (7) Theater and national missile defenses can contribute to \n     the maintenance of stability as missile threats proliferate \n     and as the United States and the former Soviet Union \n     significantly reduce the number of strategic nuclear forces \n     in their respective inventories.\n       (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures alone are inadequate for \n     dealing with missile proliferation, and should not be viewed \n     as alternatives to missile defenses and other active and \n     passive defenses.\n       (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude \n     deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at \n     a single site, the United States is currently prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense system capable of \n     defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii \n     against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible affordable and operationally \n     effective theater missile defenses capable of countering \n     existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment a multiple-site national \n     missile defense system that: (i) is affordable and \n     operationally effective against limited, accidental, and \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the territory of \n     the United States, and (ii) can be augmented over time as the \n     threat changes to provide a layered defense against limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense systems \n     specified in section 235; and\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty, subject to \n     consultations between the President and the Senate;\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system.\n       (4) improve existing cruise missile defenses and deploy as \n     soon as practical defenses that are affordable and \n     operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles;\n       (5) pursue a focused research and development program to \n     provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;\n       (6) employ streamlined acquisition procedures to lower the \n     cost and accelerate the pace of developing and deploying \n     theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, and \n     national missile defenses;\n       (7) seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not \n     feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-only form \n     of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability; and\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     subtitle C of title II of this Act through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy \n     established in section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a top priority core theater missile defense program \n     consisting of the following systems:\n       (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with a first unit equipped \n     (FUE) in fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, \n     with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability \n     in fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability \n     (IOC) no later than fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To \n     maximize effectiveness and flexibility, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall ensure that core theater missile defense \n     systems are interoperable and fully capable of exploiting \n     external sensor and battle management support from systems \n     such as the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), \n     the Army's Battlefield Integration Center (BIC), air and \n     space-based sensors including, in particular, the Space and \n     Missile Tracking System (SMTS).\n       (c) Termination of Programs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall terminate the Boost Phase Interceptor (BPI) program.\n       (d) Follow-on Systems.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     develop an affordable development plan for follow-on theater \n     missile defense systems which leverages existing systems, \n     technologies, and programs, and focuses investments to \n     satisfy military requirements not met by the core program.\n       (2) Before adding new theater missile defense systems to \n     the core program from among the follow-on activities, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing--\n       (A) the requirements for the program and the specific \n     threats to be countered;\n       (B) how the new program will relate to, support, and \n     leverage off existing core programs;\n       (C) the planned acquisition strategy; and\n       (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost and \n     budgetary impact.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than the date on which the \n     President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report detailing the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the guidance specified in this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date for each system described in \n     subsection (a), the report required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 235. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement the policy established in \n     section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall develop an \n     affordable and operationally effective national missile \n     defense system to counter a limited, accidental, or \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attack, and which is capable \n     of attaining initial operational capability (IOC) by the end \n     of 2003. Such system shall include the following:\n       (1) Ground-based interceptors capable of being deployed at \n     multiple sites, the locations and numbers of which are to be \n     determined so as to optimize the defensive coverage of the \n     continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars and space-based sensors, \n     including the Space and Missile Tracking system, the mix, \n     siting and numbers of which are to be determined so as to \n     optimize sensor support and minimize total system cost.\n       (3) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n       (b) Interim Operational Capability.--To provide a hedge \n     against the emergence of near-term ballistic missile threats \n     against the United States and to support the development and \n     deployment of the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense shall develop an interim \n     national missile defense plan that would give the United \n     States the ability to field a limited operational capability \n     by the end of 1999 if required by the threat. In developing \n     this plan the Secretary shall make use of--\n       (1) developmental, or user operational evaluation system \n     (UOES) interceptors, radars, and battle management, command, \n     control, and communications (BM/C3), to the extent that such \n     use directly supports, and does not significantly increase \n     the cost of, the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a);\n       (2) one or more of the sites that will be used as \n     deployment locations for the objective system specified in \n     subsection (a);\n       (3) upgraded early warning radars; and\n       (4) space-based sensors.\n       (c) Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined \n     acquisition procedures to--\n       (1) reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the national missile defense system specified in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) ensure that any interim national missile defense \n     capabilities developed pursuant to subsection (b) are \n     operationally effective and on a path to fulfill the \n     technical requirements and schedule of the objective system.\n       (d) Additional Cost Saving Measures.--In addition to the \n     procedures prescribed pursuant to subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall employ cost saving measures that \n     do not decrease the operational effectiveness of the systems \n     specified in subsections (a) and (b), and which do not pose \n     unacceptable technical risk. The cost saving measures should \n     include the following:\n       (1) The use of existing facilities and infrastructure.\n       (2) The use, where appropriate, of existing or upgraded \n     systems and technologies, except that \n\n[[Page S 13221]]\n     Minuteman boosters may not be used as part of a National Missile \n     Defense architecture.\n       (3) Development of systems and components that do not rely \n     on a large and permanent infrastructure and are easily \n     transported, emplaced, and moved.\n       (e) Report on Plan for Deployment.--Not later than the date \n     on which the President submits the budget for fiscal year \n     1997 under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report containing the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date in subsections (a) and (b), \n     the report shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a) or (b). The report shall also describe the \n     specific threat to be countered and provide the Secretary's \n     assessment as to whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n       (3) An analysis of options for supplementing or modifying \n     the national missile defense architecture specified in \n     subsection (a) before attaining initial operational \n     capability, or evolving such architecture in a building block \n     manner after attaining initial operational capability, to \n     improve the cost-effectiveness or the operational \n     effectiveness of such system by adding one or a combination \n     of the following:\n       (A) Additional ground-based interceptors at existing or new \n     sites.\n       (B) Sea-based missile defense systems.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n\n     SEC. 236. CRUISE MISSILE DEFENSE INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall undertake \n     an initiative to coordinate and strengthen the cruise missile \n     defense programs, projects, and activities of the military \n     departments, the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to ensure that the \n     United States develops and deploys affordable and \n     operationally effective defenses against existing and future \n     cruise missile threats.\n       (b) Actions of the Secretary of Defense.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that--\n       (1) to the extent practicable, the ballistic missile \n     defense and cruise missile defense efforts of the Department \n     of Defense are coordinated and mutually reinforcing;\n       (2) existing air defense systems are adequately upgraded to \n     provide an affordable and operationally effective defense \n     against existing and near-term cruise missile threats; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense undertakes a high priority \n     and well coordinated technology development program to \n     support the future deployment of systems that are affordable \n     and operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles, \n     including cruise missiles with low observable features.\n       (c) Implementation Plan.--Not later than the date on which \n     the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a detailed plan, in unclassified and classified \n     forms, as necessary, for carrying out this section.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LIMITING THE PLACING OF \n                   UNITED STATES FORCES UNDER UNITED NATIONS \n                   COMMAND OR CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the President has made United Nations peace operations \n     a major component of the foreign and security policies of the \n     United States;\n       (2) the President has committed United States military \n     personnel under United Nations operational control to \n     missions in Haiti, Croatia, and Macedonia that could endanger \n     those personnel;\n       (3) the President has committed the United States to deploy \n     as many as 25,000 military personnel to Bosnia-Herzegovina as \n     peacekeepers under United Nations command and control in the \n     event that the parties to that conflict reach a peace \n     agreement;\n       (4) although the President has insisted that he will retain \n     command of United States forces at all times, in the past \n     this has meant administrative control of United States forces \n     only, while operational control has been ceded to United \n     Nations commanders, some of whom were foreign nationals;\n       (5) the experience of United States forces participating in \n     combined United States-United Nations operations in Somalia, \n     and in combined United Nations-NATO operations in the former \n     Yugoslavia, demonstrate that prerequisites for effective \n     military operations such as unity of command and clarity of \n     mission have not been met by United Nations command and \n     control arrangements; and\n       (6) despite the many deficiencies in the conduct of United \n     Nations peace operations, there may be occasions when it is \n     in the national security interests of the United States to \n     participate in such operations.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should consult closely with Congress \n     regarding any United Nations peace operation that could \n     involve United States combat forces, and that such \n     consultations should continue throughout the duration of such \n     activities;\n       (2) the President should consult with Congress prior to a \n     vote within the United Nations Security Council on any \n     resolution which would authorize, extend, or revise the \n     mandates for such activities;\n       (3) in view of the complexity of United Nations peace \n     operations and the difficulty of achieving unity of command \n     and expeditious decisionmaking, the United States should \n     participate in such operations only when it is clearly in the \n     national security interest to do so;\n       (4) United States combat forces should be under the \n     operational control of qualified commanders and should have \n     clear and effective command and control arrangements and \n     rules of engagement (which do not restrict their self-defense \n     in any way) and clear and unambiguous mission statements; and\n       (5) none of the Armed Forces of the United States should be \n     under the operational control of foreign nationals in United \n     Nations peace enforcement operations except in the most \n     extraordinary circumstances.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``United Nations peace enforcement \n     operations'' means any international peace enforcement or \n     similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n     Security Council under chapter VII of the Charter of the \n     United Nations; and\n       (2) the term ``United Nations peace operations'' means any \n     international peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, \n     or similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n     Security Council under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of \n     the United Nations.\n\n     SEC. 1062. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES \n                   FROM BALLISTIC MISSILE ATTACK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles presents a threat to the entire World.\n       (2) This threat was recognized by Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry in February 1995 in the Annual Report to the \n     President and the Congress which states that ``[b]eyond the \n     five declared nuclear weapons states, at least 20 other \n     nations have acquired or are attempting to acquire weapons of \n     mass destruction--nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons--\n     and the means to deliver them. In fact, in most areas where \n     United States forces could potentially be engaged on a large \n     scale, many of the most likely adversaries already possess \n     chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, some of these same \n     states appear determined to acquire nuclear weapons.''.\n       (3) At a summit in Moscow in May 1995, President Clinton \n     and President Yeltsin commented on this threat in a Joint \n     Statement which recognizes `` . . . the threat posed by \n     worldwide proliferation of missiles and missile technology \n     and the necessity of counteracting this threat . . . ''.\n       (4) At least 25 countries may be developing weapons of mass \n     destruction and the delivery systems for such weapons.\n       (5) At least 24 countries have chemical weapons programs in \n     various stages of research and development.\n       (6) Approximately 10 countries are believed to have \n     biological weapons programs in various stages of development.\n       (7) At least 10 countries are reportedly interested in the \n     development of nuclear weapons.\n       (8) Several countries recognize that weapons of mass \n     destruction and missiles increase their ability to deter, \n     coerce, or otherwise threaten the United States. Saddam \n     Hussein recognized this when he stated, on May 8, 1990, that \n     ``[o]ur missiles cannot reach Washington. If they could reach \n     Washington, we would strike it if the need arose.''.\n       (9) International regimes like the Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, while effective, cannot by \n     themselves halt the spread of weapons and technology. On \n     January 10, 1995, Director of Central Intelligence, James \n     Woolsey, said with regard to Russia that `` . . . we are \n     particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, chemical, \n     and biological materials as well as highly enriched uranium \n     or plutonium, although I want to stress that this is a global \n     problem. For example, highly enriched uranium was recently \n     stolen from South Africa, and last month Czech authorities \n     recovered three kilograms of 87.8 percent-enriched HEU in the \n     Czech Republic--the largest seizure of near-weapons grade \n     material to date outside the Former Soviet Union.''.\n       (10) The possession of weapons of mass destruction and \n     missiles by developing countries threatens our friends, \n     allies, and forces abroad and will ultimately threaten the \n     United States directly. On August 11, 1994, Deputy Secretary \n     of Defense John Deutch said that ``[i]f the North Koreans \n     field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of \n     Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''.\n       (11) The end of the Cold War has changed the strategic \n     environment facing and between the United States and Russia. \n     That the Clinton Administration believes the environment to \n     have changed was made clear by Secretary of Defense William \n     J. Perry on September 20, 1994, when he stated that ``[w]e \n     now have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based \n     not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather on \n     another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''.\n       (12) The United States and Russia have the opportunity to \n     create a relationship based on trust rather than fear.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     all Americans should be protected from accidental, \n     intentional, or limited ballistic missile attack.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal information systems are critical to the lives \n     of every American.\n       (2) The efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal \n     Government is dependent upon the effective use of \n     information.\n       (3) The Federal Government annually spends billions of \n     dollars operating obsolete information systems.\n       (4) The use of obsolete information systems severely limits \n     the quality of the services that the Federal Government \n     provides, the efficiency of Federal Government operations, \n     and the capabilities of the Federal Government to account for \n     how taxpayer dollars are spent.\n       (5) The failure to modernize Federal Government information \n     systems and the operations they support, despite efforts to \n     do so, has resulted in the waste of billions of dollars that \n     cannot be recovered.\n       (6) Despite improvements achieved through implementation of \n     the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, most Federal \n     agencies cannot track the expenditures of Federal dollars \n     and, thus, expose the taxpayers to billions of dollars in \n     waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n       (7) Poor planning and program management and an \n     overburdened acquisition process have resulted in the \n     American taxpayers not getting their money's worth from the \n     expenditure of $200,000,000,000 on information systems during \n     the decade preceding the enactment of this Act.\n       (8) The Federal Government's investment control processes \n     focus too late in the system lifecycle, lack sound capital \n     planning, and pay inadequate attention to business process \n     improvement, performance measurement, project milestones, or \n     benchmarks against comparable organizations.\n       (9) Many Federal agencies lack adequate personnel with the \n     basic skills necessary to effectively and efficiently use \n     information technology and other information resources in \n     support of agency programs and missions.\n       (10) Federal regulations governing information technology \n     acquisitions are outdated, focus on paperwork and process \n     rather than results, and prevent the Federal Government from \n     taking timely advantage of the rapid advances taking place in \n     the competitive and fast changing global information \n     technology industry.\n       (11) Buying, leasing, or developing information systems \n     should be a top priority for Federal agency management \n     because the high potential for the systems to substantially \n     improve Federal Government operations, including the delivery \n     of services to the public.\n       (12) Structural changes in the Federal Government, \n     including elimination of the Brooks Act (section 111 of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949), \n     are necessary in order to improve Federal information \n     management and to facilitate Federal Government acquisition \n     of the state-of-the-art information technology that is \n     critical for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     Federal Government operations.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

Mr. President, my good friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Florida, Bob Graham, joins me today on this \noccasion to honor one of the greatest football players of all time, Lee \nRoy Selmon.\n  Lee Roy Selmon was born on October 20, 1954 in Eufaula, OK to Lucious \nand Jessie Selmon. He played football at Eufaula High School before \nearning a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma in 1972. He led the \nSooners to the national championship while earning a number of post-\nseason individual awards. He was selected to the All Big Eight \nConference team his junior and senior years. He was also selected a \nConsensus All-American and won both the Outland and Lombardi trophies \nfor best collegiate lineman.\n  In 1976, he became the first draft pick in the history of the Tampa \nBay Buccaneers' organization. The Bucs selected Lee Roy not only for \nhis outstanding football ability, but also for his extraordinary \nleadership and work ethic.\n  Lee Roy played each game with tremendous tenacity, both physically \nand mentally. Despite the fact that he was consistently being double \nand triple teamed throughout his illustrious 10-year career, he still \nregistered an amazing 78\\1/2\\ sacks. His inspirational play was \ninstrumental in guiding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their only NFC \nChampionship game appearance in 1979. He went on to play in six \nconsecutive Pro Bowls, earn three All-Pro selections and win the NFL \nPlayers Association's NFC Defensive Lineman of the Year Award.\n  Lee Roy's rare combination of strength, speed and agility transformed \nthe way in which future players would play his position.\n  On July 29th of this year, Lee Roy was inducted into the Pro Football \nHall of Fame. In doing so, he became the first Buccaneer to accomplish \nthis feat. Lee Roy on his induction stated, ``It's more than a dream \ncome true because I never dreamt it. I'm very humbled by it and very \nthankful for it. I guess sometimes when you don't dream things \nyourself, then other people have bigger dreams for you.''\n  Lee Roy's accomplishments are not limited to his play on the \ngridiron. Since his retirement in 1984, he has remained active in local \ncommunity efforts.\n  Lee Roy has always approached his off the field endeavors with the \nsame tenacity that characterized his play on the field. He was chosen \none of America's Ten Outstanding Young Men by the United States Jaycees \nand selected Kiwanis Citizen of the Year for Florida's west coast.\n  Currently, Lee Roy serves as an associate athletic director at the \nUniversity of South Florida, where he has been the driving force behind \nUSF's efforts to field an intercollegiate football team.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for us, as United States Senators from \nthe great State of Florida, to recognize a man that is revered by many, \nrespected by many more, and well-liked by all. Lee Roy Selmon; a hero \nin every sense of the word.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13306-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13306-S13307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO VALORIE J. WATKINS, REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR SENATOR LARRY \n                                 CRAIG\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding staff member of mine, Valorie J. Watkins who has served \ndiligently as my regional director in eastern Idaho over the last \nseveral years.\n  Valorie's tenure as a congressional staff member has been long and \ndistinguished. She has worked in the U.S. Congress for close to 25 \nyears but now moves on to another position as director of alumni \nrelations at Idaho State University in Pocatello, ID.\n  I have enjoyed working with Valorie over the years. Her leadership, \ninsightful recommendations, and attitude toward serving others have \nbeen indispensable to my responsibility of effectively serving the \ngreat people of the State of Idaho.\n  Valorie was born in Pocatello, ID. A long time resident of eastern \nIdaho, she \n\n[[Page S 13307]]\ngraduated from Pocatello High School and received her degree from Idaho \nState University in 1966.\n  In 1966 as a bright-eyed and enthusiastic graduate of Idaho State \nUniversity, she left Pocatello and boarded a plans for Washington, DC \nand arrived in our Nation's capital without having yet obtained a job. \nShe was quickly hired by the Democratic Congressman from Idaho, Compton \nWhite Jr. After Congressman White's defeat in 1966, she immediately \ncame on board Republican Congressman George Hansen's staff. From 1967 \nto 1969 Valorie proved to be an outstanding staff member for the \nCongressman and excelled in this capacity. In 1969 she returned with \nher husband Bill to Pocatello and became a teacher in the local school \nsystem and was involved in local education issues.\n  In 1973, her knowledge and work experience helped her to land a \nposition as district director with one of the great leaders of Idaho, \nmy predecessor, Senator James A. McClure. In this capacity she came to \nbe well respected and looked upon for advice by Senator McClure. She \nworked for Senator McClure until his retirement in 1991.\n  Valorie Watkins' work for the people of Idaho is earmarked by her \nastute ability to keep in close contact with constituents by being \ninvolved in her community. She served in many capacities over the years \nin Pocatello; she has done a immense amount of work with the Greater \nPocatello Chamber of Commerce, serving on over eight committees, \nincluding serving as a member of the board of directors from 1993 to \n1996. She has been heavily involved in the Soroptimist International of \nPocatello, from which she received several awards and also served as \nits president from 1993 to 1994.\n  In the 16 county region of which she oversaw, Valorie has come to be \nwell respected by many leaders on both sides of the political isle. \nValorie has traveled throughout southeast Idaho to small communities \nlike Preston, Montpelier, Soda Springs, and Malad and gained the \nrespect of many Idahoans because of her help. Many leaders have sought \nher help and advice, including mayors, city councilman, county \ncommissioners, educators and administrators, and Idaho State \nrepresentatives. She is also well respected by many of the Federal \nGovernment agency heads in the area, and has worked closely with some \nof those individuals to resolve trying cases.\n  Whenever southeast Idahoans have sought help from my office with a \nproblem with a Federal agency, they most likely have found it with \nValorie Watkins. In a more memorable and recent incident, Valorie took \nthe lead in my office's involvement with Tom Johansen, a Pocatello \nscrap metal dealer who was brought into the national spotlight when he \nunknowingly bought several thousand tons of sensitive nuclear hardware \nand blueprints from the Department of Energy at an auction. Valorie's \ninvolvement with the case and persistence played a part in forcing the \nDOE to provide an equitable resolution in what might have otherwise \nbeen a disaster for Mr. Johansen.\n  Valorie's service to the people of Idaho I believe can be summed up \nfrom an editorial written by the editor of the Preston Idaho Citizen, a \nlocal small town newspaper in eastern Idaho:\n\n       Over the years while Valorie was an aid to Senator Jim \n     McClure and to Senator Larry Craig, she has been a wonderful \n     intermediary for just about anyone who had a challenge that \n     concerned the Federal Government. She is one of the most \n     personable persons that we know and we have been so grateful \n     for her listening ear and her assistance in cases where there \n     has been a need for contact with the Federal Government. \n     Valorie Watkins is most approachable. . . . We see her move \n     as a gain for Idaho State University and a loss for Senator \n     Larry Craig!\n\n  And so, Mr. President, as Valorie brings to a close her long and \nproductive career in service to the people of Idaho and this Nation, I \nwish her and her husband Bill nothing but the very best wishes for \nhappiness and prosperity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13306-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday morning, I had the pleasure of \nappearing on ``Face the Nation,'' an always engaging experience. One of \nthe subjects we covered in our wide-ranging questions and answers was \nthe role of religious groups, in particular the Christian Coalition, in \ncontemporary politics.\n  During the course of our discussion, I commented on the fact that the \nRepublican Party welcomes the participation of people of all faiths, \nand I disagreed with those who see something ominous or irregular in \nwhat is sometimes called the religious right. These are, in fact, good \npeople who are rightly concerned about the security of their homes, the \nsafety of their children, and the future of family life in America.\n  Both parties need the participation of people like that. Moral and \nethical concerns should not be the singular property of either party. \nThat is what I was trying to convey in my comments concerning religious \nAmericans and the Democratic Party. I meant to express the hope that \nour fellow citizens, whose religious beliefs lead them to advocate \nschool prayer, engage in home-schooling, or oppose abortion, could feel \nequally at home on either side of the political fence.\n  I did not mean to imply, and I regret it if my comments suggested \notherwise, that the Democratic Party is without religious members. That \nof course is not the case. Neither party has a monopoly on faith, \nalthough, judging from the results of the 1994 elections, the GOP does \nseem to have a better track record with miracles.\n  I want to assure my colleagues, as well as the national television \nviewing audience of ``Face the Nation,'' that I have the greatest \nrespect for the diversity of faith represented within both Republican \nand Democratic ranks. And I close with the observation that, during the \nnext 2 months or so, as the Senate deals with the hardest, toughest \nissues of the day, both sides of the aisle here will need our share of \nprayers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13307-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I returned from a 6-day \ntrip to China, during which time I spent more than 20 hours in meetings \nwith top-level Chinese officials, including 4 hours with the President \nof the country, Jiang Zemin, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, and senior \nForeign Ministry officials.\n  We held wide-ranging discussions on a number of important issues in \nthe United States-China relationship, including several issues which \nhave caused the most serious strain between our two countries since \nrelations were established in 1979.\n  I believe that these talks were informative and constructive for both \nsides. And I would like to share with my colleagues some of the major \nelements of those discussions and my observations as a result of this \ntrip. I first met the President of China while I was mayor of San \nFrancisco. In 1979, the first of my 9 years as mayor, I forged a sister \ncity relationship with Shanghai, the first such relationship between an \nAmerican and a Chinese city.\n  Jiang Zemin became mayor of Shanghai in 1985. And we became good \nfriends as we negotiated agreements and overseas projects between our \ntwo cities. As partners in this endeavor, we vowed to shrink the vast \nPacific Ocean that divides us into a small river across which \ncommunication, trade and an exchange of ideas could easily flow.\n  That was 10 years ago. Jiang Zemin is now President of China, and he \nleads a nation of 1.2 billion people. Over the last 20 years, I have \nvisited China many times and spent a great deal of time studying its \npeople, its culture, and its political dynamism. I have talked with \nChina scholars and read avidly about this complicated country and its \nrich 5,000-year history.\n  Few nations rival China's strategic importance to the United States. \nChina is the largest country in the world, one of the largest \neconomies, one of only five declared nuclear powers, and a permanent \nmember of the United Nations Security Council.\n  The cold war Soviet axis of power has dissolved in the last 5 years, \nand as Russia struggles with democracy and works to regain its military \nand economic stability, China's emerging presence will most certainly \nshape the balance of power in Asia and in the world.\n  I wrote to President Jiang on July 11 and expressed my deep concern \nabout the state of United States-China relations. Issues that divide \nthe United States and China today have increasingly prevented a \nproductive exchange of views. And the detention of human rights \nactivist Harry Wu, now an American citizen and resident in my State, \nhad effectively blocked all lines of communication between our two \ncountries.\n  In my letter, I offered to come to China to discuss the case of Mr. \nWu and other matters. President Jiang wrote back and accepted, saying \nhe would welcome my visit to Beijing. My husband and I left on August \n17 for Beijing and Shanghai. We met privately with President Jiang for \n2 hours and then were joined by Senator and Mrs. Johnston for dinner \nwith the President.\n  Our discussions with President Jiang were very frank and candid on \nmatters pertaining to relations between our two countries, particularly \nthe issues of Taiwan, the recent visit of Lee Teng-hui, and the \ndetention of Harry Wu.\n  I delivered a message to President Jiang from President Clinton that \nhe would be most appreciative of any assistance that the Chinese \nPresident could provide in the matter of Harry Wu, that Mr. Wu's \nrelease would remove an obstacle of communication between the United \nStates and China, and that President Clinton looked forward to meeting \nwith Jiang Zemin to chart a new and mutually beneficial course for \nSino-American relations.\n  President Jiang sent an emissary to me on the morning of my departure \nfrom Shanghai with the message that Harry Wu would be released, quite \npossibly before I left China later that day, which did, in fact, happen \njust that way. As I left from the Shanghai airport, I saw the Air China \nflight that was being held for Harry Wu, who was right then on a flight \nfrom Wuhan, although I did not know it for sure at that time.\n  With the status of Mr. Wu resolved, the United States, and President \nClinton in particular, now have a historic opportunity to chart the \ncourse of United States-China relations into the 21st century.\n  This will not be an easy road. China and the United States have many \ndifferences in culture, in our political systems, in our economic and \nlegal structures. However, what many Americans may not understand is \nthat today we also have many common interests. But the opportunity to \nbridge our differences and build on our common interests is wholly \ndependent upon dialogue, something sorely lacking at this time.\n  At this moment the United States and China have no ambassadors in \neach other's country, although I understand that this situation will \nnow be partially remedied with the announcement that Ambassador Li \nDaoyu will soon return to Washington.\n  One example of the effect of a lack of diplomatic communication is \nthe visit of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in \nJune. Although, as a U.S. Senator, I understood that there is no more \nimportant policy for China than the status of Taiwan as part of China, \nI and other Senators voted to allow the visit. I never heard from China \nthat what we considered to be a personal visit by an alumnus of an \nAmerican university would cause such a rift in our relations, and I was \nstunned by the intense reaction of the Chinese officials.\n  President Jiang told me that he learned of the decision to allow Lee \nTeng-hui's visit by reading it in a newspaper. The Chinese were, in \nturn, stunned by the insensitivity and lack of communication from the \nUnited States on what they saw as a major shift in policy toward their \ncountry, particularly since they were assured as late as mid-May that \nU.S. policy would be to refuse such a visit.\n  In an action that further convinced China that they were seeing an \nemboldened Taiwan, the day Lee Teng-hui left for the United States, \nTaiwan held joint military army, navy and air force exercises off the \ncoast of China.\n  Also, Lee Teng-hui broached a Two Chinas Policy in a speech at \nCornell, further inciting Beijing. And no one should think that Beijing \ndid not take this seriously. All of this may have been avoided with \nconsistent and frank dialogue between Beijing and Washington.\n  Reopening and strengthening diplomatic channels of communication is \nbut one, albeit critical, step in building a new relationship with \nChina. As important as what we seek from China in the way of human \nrights, open markets and Democratic reform is how we communicate \nideals. Americans have a tendency to tell China what to do instead of \ntrying to understand what China needs and how it is to China's \ninterests to do some things. And it is time that we learned that this \nwill not be the most effective method of encouraging change in China.\n  Much has changed in China since I first visited in 1979. People speak \nmuch more freely. Consumer goods from China and all over the world are \navailable more than ever before. The standard of living is up. And \nprivatization of formerly Government-controlled industries is taking \nhold. When I was there 2 years ago, only 8 percent of the industries \nwere in private hands. Now 20 percent are either in joint venture or \nprivate hands, about 40 percent controlled by the central Government, \nand 40 percent in state cooperatives. A Western-style marketplace in \nthe form of an economic democracy is, in fact, taking place.\n  The question we must ask ourselves is, Can an economic democracy \nexist long term without a social democracy following? I believe the \nanswer to that is no. But make no mistake, China today is a Communist \ncountry. But by encouraging open markets and privatization of \nindustries, we are exposing China to democracy in a much more effective \nmanner than by calling for it on the front pages of our newspapers or \nby \n\n[[Page S 13309]]\nmaking threats we cannot afford to carry out.\n  The effects of China's move to a free market economy can already be \nfelt in Chinese social life. Shanghai television, for example, has had \nprograms that include a show similar to America's ``All in the \nFamily,'' which ran for 180 episodes, with the Chinese version of \nArchie Bunker, a stodgy Communist Party official, something I never \nthought I would see.\n  Also, there is a ``60 Minutes'' type Shanghai program that exposes \nGovernment institutions to questioning--unique in the context of \nChina's long and complicated history.\n  I believe we will witness even greater changes in the next decade, \nwhich can bring China even closer to the West.\n  China's legal system and concept of individual rights is still \nprimitive by western standards. I believe that the most consequential \ninfluence on the human rights situation in China will be the evolution \nof an independent judiciary and the development of a new set of civil \nand criminal laws.\n  Today in China, judges are not independent, either from individual or \nparty persuasion, and there is no real criminal statute on the books to \nmake it a crime to interfere with a judge. So this needs change.\n  China has asked for help in the evolution of its legal system. The \ndevelopment of due process of law, which in this country guarantees \nthat no one can be picked up by the Government in the middle of the \nnight and simply disappear, is something that is going to make a huge \ndifference in China, and a new civil and criminal code could go a long \nway toward meaningful human rights advances.\n  While I was in China, the China daily front page carried articles \nsaying that China welcomed help in evolving a new system of civil and \ncriminal codes. This could go much further in securing major human \nrights advances, constitutionally and legally, than any rhetoric in \nthis country.\n  Those in the West who care should utilize this opportunity in a \nsensitive way to bring many of the virtues of a western legal system to \nChinese attention. I believe it is the most significant thing we can do \nlong term.\n  There are those in this country, I believe, who are unconsciously \npushing Sino-American relations into an adversarial position, \nreminiscent of the days of the Soviet Union. The world was, in a sense, \nmuch simpler then: Two major conflicting powers, with smaller nations \nlining up in each camp. This was good for weapons sales, it repressed \nmany smaller national and ethnic rivalries which are now emerging in \nthe form of civil wars, and it provided a clear role for China as a \nmajor geopolitical buffer.\n  Those days, however, are gone. China has emerged from these changes \nas a booming economy with the highest rate of economic growth in the \nworld, gradually reducing centralized control of its economy and \nopening its doors to western entrepreneurship and thought.\n  All one has to do is contrast Russia today and China to see how \ncentralized control in China has been gradually reduced, keeping \nstability, opening up entrepreneurship, creating an economic democracy \nand doing it in a much more successful way. So I believe that how \nAmerica develops its relationship with China is critical for world \npeace and stability.\n  Ever since President Nixon traveled to China in 1972, the United \nStates has maintained a one-China policy. It has been the foundation of \nSino-American relations. That policy essentially says that there is \nonly one China and Taiwan is part of China, and it recognizes the \nPeople's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.\n  This policy was stated in the 1972 Shanghai communique, the 1979 \njoint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and the \n1982 United States-China joint communique. The one-China policy was and \nis essential to United States-China relations. It remains essential \ntoday.\n  If China has any doubts about our commitment to this policy, our \nability to conduct normal relations with China will be severely \ncurtailed. For China, the question of Taiwan is an issue of \nsovereignty, and we must understand it as such.\n  Taiwan has developed well, even within these constraints and, in \nfact, Taiwan interests have the largest dollar amount of investment on \nmainland China. Communication has been established and a special \nacross-the-straits initiative has been developed under the leadership \nof another friend and former Shanghai mayor, Wang DaoHan and Tang Shu \nBei, former consul general in San Francisco.\n  The one-China policy has been beneficial for all three parties: China \nand the United States have been able to pursue a normal diplomatic \nrelationship, while Taiwan has become economically strong and \nprosperous. Meanwhile, Taiwan and China have both encouraged the \ndevelopment of extensive economic and cultural ties across the Taiwan \nStraits.\n  There are many issues still to resolve with China, as we develop our \nrelationship in the post-cold-war era. Consistent and open dialog is \nkey.\n  President Jiang told me of an old Chinese proverb: When water flows, \nthere will be a channel.\n  I truly believe that President Clinton now has the unique opportunity \nto craft a new course which can result in a stable and secure Asia, \nfree of nuclear proliferation, a serious commitment to arms control, \nand one that sees China takes its rightful place as a leading nation at \nthe world table.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13308-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13309-S13312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FCC/SPECTRUM/PUBLIC BROADCASTING REFORM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, as chairman of \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I have made \ntelecommunications policy reform my top priority for the 104th \nCongress. I am quite proud of the swift progress made to date, \nincluding the sweeping Senate passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications \nCommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  As I indicated before we left for the August recess, as significant \nand necessary as S. 652 is for our country's economic and social well-\nbeing in the 21st century, it is only one item in my overall plan for \ntelecommunications policy reform.\n  Today, I would like to take a few minutes to briefly discuss two \nadditional areas of telecommunications reform I intend to pursue \nthrough the remainder of the 104th Congress: Spectrum reform and public \nbroadcasting reform.\n  Regarding spectrum policy reform, there was a recent essay by William \nSafire in the New York Times entitled ``The Greatest Auction Ever. Get \nTop Dollar for the Spectrum.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that William Safire's article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times Mar. 16, 1995]\n\n                       The Greatest Auction Ever\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--They all laughed at the economist Milton \n     Friedman when he suggested a generation ago that the Federal \n     Government auction off broadcast licenses, instead of giving \n     them away to political favorites.\n       The last laugh is his; last week, in the greatest auction \n     in history, bidders for wireless places on a tiny fragment of \n     the broadband spectrum committed nearly $8 billion to the \n     U.S. Treasury.\n       And that's only the beginning of the taxpayer's bonanza in \n     the sale of our valuable thin air.\n       Remember all the talk, eight years go, of high-definition \n     television, the Japanese invention that was supposed to force \n     us all to replace our 200 million TV sets? U.S. \n     manufacturers, with antitrusters' blessing, formed a ``Grand \n     Alliance'' to match the Japanese advance.\n       Along came an unexpected scientific breakthrough. We \n     leapfrogged the analog (feh!) competition into the brave new \n     digital world. This not only produces a knock-your-socks-off \n     picture but expands each TV channel into five or six wireless \n     channels for video, audio, computer data transmission, \n     telephones and every form of communication short of mental \n     telepathy.\n       Broadcasters smacked their lips at the bonanza. ``Advanced \n     television is not just about pretty pictures anymore,'' \n     F.C.C. chairman Reed Hundt told Edmund Andrews of The Times, \n     one of the few reporters on top of this story. ``It's about \n     the digitization of television and a huge range of new \n     services.''\n       It's as if one old oil well gave birth to six new gushers. \n     Broadcasting lobbyists have descended on Congress and the \n     F.C.C. to insure ``flexibility''--that is, to exploit \n     exclusively \n\n[[Page S 13310]]\n     all the new technology, and to charge viewers for the ``ancillary and \n     supplementary'' services.\n       Even if accompanied by payment of rent to the Government, \n     the exclusive arrangement sought by broadcasters would be an \n     outrageous taxpayer ripoff.\n       What is the digitized, divisible channel worth? Senate \n     Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler gave a hint in an \n     op-ed piece last week, suggesting that noncommercial \n     licensees had a huge hidden asset: ``Public broadcasting \n     stations could rent, sell or make use of the additional \n     channels for other telecommunications and information \n     services.''\n       Based only on current uses, which are primitive, the market \n     value of the VHF, UHF, cellular, broadband and narrowband \n     spectrum ranges around $120 billion.\n       But in the near future, your television set will combine \n     with your computers and telephone and fax machine into a \n     single unit you can hang on the wall or fold up in your \n     pocket. That's soon--possibly in the next Presidential term.\n       I've seen not-for-attribution estimates that the market \n     value of the digitized spectrum in that onrushing era will \n     be--hold your breath--a half-trillion dollars, give or take a \n     hundred billion.\n       Before rushing into any giveaway, or any long-term \n     exclusive rent-away, we need extended, wide-open, thoroughly \n     debated hearings to make certain of three outcomes:\n       First, we want a guarantee of spectrum competition. The \n     criterion to determine competition must be scrupulously \n     economic, not jiggered by the Government to introduce sexual \n     or racial or ethnic or ideological favoritism. An appeals \n     court yesterday stayed the F.C.C. from holding auctions that \n     favored minority fronts.\n       Next, we want a holdback of certain rights. For example, we \n     can solve the campaign finance dilemma justlikethat by \n     putting a right-of-way in the deed setting aside air time, \n     online time and direct E-mail advertising for candidates, \n     which could be used or traded or sold by them in election \n     campaigns.\n       Finally, we want top dollar for our public property. That \n     means a series of Friedman-style auctions. After the \n     purchases, sophisticated risk-takers and their banking \n     backers can enhance the value of their property at no cost to \n     the taxpayer and with great benefit to the consumer.\n       Where should the spectrum-sale money go? Toward reduction \n     of the crushing national debt. By recognizing our hidden \n     asset of the spectrum, Americans can ride the wave of the \n     future.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, a major priority for the 104th Congress \ninvolves giving American private enterprise a fuller and fairer chance. \nRight now, we just have too many rules and too many of them just do not \nmake any sense. Remember, bad rules are not just expensive and foolish, \nthey represent far more than a dead-weight loss for the economy; they \nare obstacles to progress.\n  One of the challenges we face today concerns channels that have been \nearmarked for advanced television. Not only has the FCC set aside a \nsignificant number of channels for the broadcast television industry, \nit has also placed severe restrictions on additional uses of those \nchannels.\n  Mr. President, technologically speaking, these channels could be used \nto provide extensive new and competitive offerings, in addition to more \nTV. Due to advances in digital technology, they could be used for new \nmobile radio services, for wireless loops that could make the local \ntelephone business more competitive, and for many other services as \nwell.\n  Legally speaking, however, these channels currently are dedicated to \none specific use: High-definition television, or HDTV. In effect, the \nWashington bureaucracy has defined and limited the future. The \nbureaucrats, not consumers of the marketplace, have decided what new \ntechnology will be offered, where it will be offered and how it will be \noffered. It is time to revisit these regulatory decisions. If \nbroadcasting is the best and highest use of those channels, let the \nmarketplace make that decision.\n Once the best use for these channels is determined, how should the \nlicenses be allocated? Again, let the market decide. Consumer choice \nand preference will quickly choose who best deserves the licenses \nassociated with the new channels.\n\n  I thus intend to work toward several changes in the FCC's advanced \ntelevision broadcasting plan. All of these changes are geared toward \nunleashing creative powers, not smothering them with FCC rules. \nTherefore, our committee is considering allowing everyone--broadcasters \nincluding--to bid for the right to develop these channels. That bidding \nprocess can be carried out through spectrum auctions. At the same time, \nhowever, we want to guarantee the winning bidders have sufficient \ncommercial and operational flexibility. In other words, they must be \ngiven the discretion to make what they think is the best use of those \nchannels to meet consumer demand and increase consumer choice.\n  I will chair a Senate Commerce Committee hearing concerning this very \ntopic tomorrow. Earlier this year several newspaper articles, including \nan excellent piece by William Safire, which I ask to be included in the \nRecord following my remarks, characterized the FCC's HDTV plan as ``a \nbillion dollar giveaway.''\n  At a July 27th Commerce Committee hearing, Henry Geller, former FCC \nGeneral Counsel and NTIA Administrator, testified that giving \nbroadcasters an additional six megahertz would be a ``national \nscandal.'' A number of organizations across political lines recently \nhave come out against giving free spectrum to the broadcast industry \nand support auctioning the advanced television spectrum. Not \nsurprisingly, the television broadcast industry strongly opposes \nauctioning spectrum which the FCC proposes to give away to them for \nfree.\n  But beyond the special interest arguments, let me tell you, Mr. \nPresident, why this proposal is especially important. It is important \nbecause it plays right into another major priority for the 104th \nCongress--stimulating economic growth.\n  The great thing about communications technology is that it is such a \npowerful catalyst for growth. Engineers and economists talk about \ncommunications as a leverage technology. Experts point out it is both \ndemand-inducing and cost-reducing at the same time. That is, at the \nsame time advances in communications technology make it possible to \nencourage consumption and investment, they also make it possible for \nbusinesses to keep costs in line. This keeps America competitive.\n  Mr. President, some of the best economists in the world work for the \nJapanese Government. They have actually quantified how communications \nfosters economic growth. Their calculations show that for every dollar \nwe invest in communications, we get almost 3 dollars of growth. That is \nwhy telecommunications industries are so important.\n  You cannot improve and expand communications services, however, if \nthe basic building blocks--like the radio spectrum--are locked up in \nsome regulatory backwater. You cannot improve and expand communications \nservices, if the people who develop innovative ideas are artificially \ndenied the ability to move their product to market.\n  Getting more spectrum into the hands of more people with more and \nbetter ideas on how to use it is a critical\n objective. Beyond bringing new and exciting technologies to the \nconsumer, it also is an excellent way in which to contribute toward the \nnew jobs, new services, and new investment opportunities this country \nneeds.\n\n  This leads to public broadcasting policy reform regarding spectrum.\n  Such a bold, forward looking approach on spectrum policy reform also \ncreates an opportunity to reinvent and privatize public broadcasting. \nTo borrow a phrase from my good friend, Vice President Al Gore, we need \nto reinvent the way we finance public broadcasting in this country.\n  Ever since President Johnson's administration and the heyday of the \nGreat Society, we have relied on taxpayer funds, channeled through the \nWashington-based bureaucracy at the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. Over the past few decades, literally billions of dollars \nin appropriations have flowed through Washington back to the public \nbroadcasting stations.\n  Federal funds successfully have built a nationwide public \nbroadcasting system that enjoys wide support. Viewers such as myself \nhelp stations with annual membership dues and other contributions. \nCorporate underwriting contributes significant programming support. At \nthe same time, Federal financing funneled through a Washington \nbureaucracy has created a public broadcasting system not necessarily in \ntouch with most Americans. Today the public broadcasting system is \nmature. It now must be allowed to evolve.\n  Why? One very good reason is that with today's crushing national \ndebt, all \n\n[[Page S 13311]]\nFederal spending must come under careful scrutiny. Unfortunately, when \nI first raised the issue of privatizing public broadcasting, no one in \nthe public broadcasting establishment seemed to hear what I was saying. \nI was accused of trying to kill Big Bird and Barney.\n  Fortunately, public broadcasting is beginning to look at realistic \noptions for survival in a budget deficit conscious world. I am \nencouraged by these efforts and look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure public broadcasting continues to serve public \nneeds.\n  Should we reexamine the charter CPB was given in 1967? I think we \nshould. As I mentioned earlier, today public broadcasting is a mature \nsystem. There are still some regions which are not served, but the vast \nmajority of Americans receive one--if not several--public radio and \ntelevision stations. Efforts to consolidate and increase efficiencies \nshould be encouraged. At the same time, reaching under-served areas of \nour Nation must remain a primary objective of any reinvented public \nbroadcasting system.\n  What about programming? Today's competitive marketplace has made the \nmarket failure rationale for public funding obsolete in some respects. \nCable television network services including the Discovery Channel, the \nHistory Channel, Arts & Entertainment, the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, \nand others provide quality, educational and artistic programming once \nthought only available on public\n television. At the same time, I believe most Americans want more \nquality children's and educational programming available over free TV. \nThe great promise of broadcasting to educate and uplift our children \nand our citizens has not been realized. Too much violence and tawdry \nprogramming dominates the public's airwaves.\n\n  Children's and educational programming should be the primary, if not \nsole, focus of taxpayer support for public television programming. \nPublic radio also should be helped to flourish.\n  At the same time, American taxpayers cannot afford to continue the \ninefficiencies in the current system. Because of historical accident, \nPBS and National Public Radio, for example, have separate distribution \nnetworks. I understand PBS actually has more audio capacity on its \nsystem than NPR. However, CPB has no power to make PBS and NPR \nconsolidate and realize these efficiencies. Congress does. We should \naccept that responsibility and reinvent public broadcasting to provide \na meaningful and quality legacy for our children.\n  We also need to provide public broadcasting with a baseline of \nsupport. An excellent model already exists for how a baseline of \nsupport can be continued in an industry while providing the flexibility \nnecessary to allow the industry to evolve, improve its product, and \nexpand its services. We have accomplished the kind of privatization of \nFederal functions I am talking about in other areas--with, for \ninstance, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, the Student Loan \nMarketing Association--Fannie Mae and Sallie Mae. We can and should do \nthe same for public broadcasting.\n  We can accomplish the goals I have laid out by establishing a new \nprivatized entity to provide public broadcasting baseline support. We \ncan get the seed money necessary to carry out this initiative through \nthe spectrum auction process. The fundamental goal should be to \nprivatize the financing process and to empower broadcasters and public \nbroadcasting organizations besides just those that exist in \nWashington--inside the Beltway.\n  This approach would pay a number of public policy dividends. It would \nprovide public broadcasting with a financial baseline of support. That \nis, this year's, or next year's, financing would not be subject to the \nvagaries of the Washington appropriations process. That, in turn, would \nhelp stations plan. Among other things, public broadcasters would not \nhave to continuously lobby Washington to get the support they need. \nThey could bank on continued support. Not all the money for the initial \ncapitalization, moreover, would have to come from Washington. The \nbusiness community, foundations, and others would be encouraged to \nparticipate.\n  Financial experts currently are working out how much seed capital \nwould be required. Indeed, I will chair a second Commerce Committee \nhearing this week in which we will take testimony from an investment \nbanker at First Boston on how to move forward with this capitalization \nidea.\n  At the same time, and as a way of ensuring the continued success of \npublic broadcasting, we need to change some of the restrictions on \npublic broadcast stations. This can be controversial. Nobody wants to \nsanction unfair competition between tax-exempt public broadcasters and \nthe private sector's commercial broadcasters. But there are safeguards \nthat can be established.\n  One of the concepts that has been around for years is that of limited \nadvertising. Numerous public broadcasting organizations in Europe \nalready have commercials, clustered at natural program breaks. Limited \nadvertising represents a significant source of revenue for public \nbroadcast stations. It also represents a source of funds that may be \npreferable to the current situation in which companies basically \nproduce and underwrite the programs run on public broadcasting. \nAdvertising revenue tends to come without the content strings that \nprogram underwriting inevitably entails.\n  Privatization means relying more on private, individual effort, less \non a Washington handout. It also ensures decisionmaking can take place \nat a level much closer to the particular consumer in the particular \nmarket. In any country as big and diverse as the United States, that is \nespecially important. A one-size-fits-all approach virtually never \nworks well in our society.\n  My thinking regarding public broadcasting is consistent with the \napproach this new Congress has taken in other areas. One of the \ncornerstones of most of the sound welfare reform proposals, for \ninstance, is the concept of block grants and State and local \ndecisionmaking. The thinking there is that local authorities are in the \nbest position to manage these issues wisely, and Washington can assist \nthem in addressing their State and local needs.\n  Privatizing public broadcast financing would accomplish much the same \nobjective. It would cut the Washington umbilical cord--or should I say \nstraitjacket--and vest decisionmaking--plus the money and resources \nneeded--with the stations and people at the local level. It is they, \nafter all, who provide the service to the American public.\n  Mr. President, the simple theme running through each of the reform \nideas I have spoken of today is the fundamental principle that we do \nnot want the Washington bureaucracy determining what is possible and \nwhat is going to be allowed.\n  Let me conclude with an excellent example of what telecommunications \npolicy reform means at a practical level for my home State of South \nDakota and other areas of the often forgotten West. I am referring to \nan article in Investor's Business Daily last August 31st. That is the \nnew Wall Street Journal competitor, incidentally, which makes an effort \nto provide news, especially financial news, that is important to people \nout West.\n  The newspaper reported on a new communications technique that could \nrevolutionize farming--a vitally important part of South Dakota's \neconomy. It is called ``site-specific'' or ``precision'' farming.\n  Having grown up on a family farm, I find the technology fascinating. \nFirst, soil moisture and crop yield sensors are spotted in fields. \nThese sensors can narrow acres and acres of land down to as little as \n20 foot squares. These censors then interact with the new Global \nPositioning Satellite network. The system feeds information back to \ncomputers on the farm. This information give farmers the kind of \nprecise information they need to target fertilizer, irrigation, and \nother services.\n  The approach radically reduces operating costs. It helps the \nenvironment by reducing leaching and stream run-off. It is the kind of \nsmart farming we need in this country to maintain our global \ncompetitiveness. Mr. President, it is possible only because of the \nmarriage of computers and communications.\n  Now, Mr. President, do you honestly believe the inside-the-Beltway \ncrowd would ever have thought of this? I doubt it. It took innovative \nentrepreneurs to identify and fill a market need. What if the \nWashington bureaucracy had set up a system of rules that \n\n[[Page S 13312]]\nkept communications channels from being used for ``site-specific'' \nfarming? Its promise and all that means to the farming sector and the \nAmerican economy as a whole would never have been realized. I ask \nconsent the ``Investor's Business Daily'' article be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Americans are great and diverse thinkers. \nUnfortunately, not enough of that original thought and invention takes \nplace in the big gray stone government buildings that sit around \nWashington. What we need to do is to try to unleash American ingenuity. \nAt a minimum, we need to make sure we do not block it. I will continue \nto fight to make sure we do not--whether it is thought the \ncomprehensive telecommunications reform bill, spectrum policy reform or \npublic broadcasting reform.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say I think it is time that we \nfundamentally think about spectrum policy reform in this country. I \nthink we must think about the taxpayers.\n  The Commerce Committee has been charged to raise $17 billion, give or \ntake a few half billion. Indeed, we are told that we are supposed to \nround everything off to a half-billion dollars. So, having grown up on \na farm in South Dakota and being told to round things off, in my \nresponse to a half-billion dollars, that is quite a change from the \nkind of money that I usually think about in my life.\n  In any event, the new potential uses of the spectrum of the property \nof the American people--as William Safire says, they should be \nauctioned off. How else will we do it? The auction system has been used \nsuccessfully for some of the earlier spectrum that we have auctioned \noff.\n  We now have this complicated matter where the broadcasters propose to \nmigrate from the spectrum they are on, the analog, to the UHF and \ndigital, and they say that at some point they will give back the \noriginal spectrum, although some say that when the time comes that will \nnot happen.\n  What we are proposing here is not to take anything away from them, \nnot to take anything that they feel they may have paid for in terms of \nlicenses to stations. What we are proposing is merely to auction the \nnew uses of the spectrum, and the American taxpayers have a great \ninterest in this. It is billions of dollars.\n  I propose that we use a small portion of that to capitalize public \nbroadcasting and to set up a privatized base, and they would then be \ncut free from annual appropriations. We could eliminate the \nheadquarters, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and many of the \nstations will testify this week that they would like that approach. We \ncould do that without spending any appropriated taxpayers' money.\n  So we need to have some innovative thinking. We also need to think \nabout reinventing many areas. As Mr. Safire quotes in his article, he \nquotes me as saying in the public broadcast area there is much spectrum \nand many overlapping jurisdictions where the taxpayers could be saved a \ngreat deal of money.\n  I know that anyone who makes proposals along these lines will be \ncriticized by both the broadcasters and some in the public broadcasting \narea. In fact, I am sure the broadcasters will strongly oppose--I know \nthey are strongly opposed to what I am trying to do.\n  The people inside the beltway here in public broadcasting are \nstrongly opposed. They are strongly opposed to changing anything.\n  The stations have formed a coalition, that they want to change, and \nthey would like to see this. The people out in the country in public \nbroadcasting would like to see the change.\n  So, Mr. President, we stand at a crossroads with this spectrum \nreform. It is something that sounds like Greek to the average citizen, \nbut the average taxpayer has a great interest in it. We have a \nresponsibility to stand up to special interests and to auction off \nthose portions of the spectrum that will provide new uses and will \nprovide billions of dollars for the taxpayers of this country.\n  It will provide the basis for the Commerce Committee's reconciliation \nresponsibilities, and it will provide our country with a more \ninnovative and a better future. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Plows, PC's, Satellite Dishes\n\n                            (By Ira Breskin)\n\n       As computer power drops in price, a new way to farm called \n     site-specific or precision farming is taking off.\n       Precision farming lets growers take into account the unique \n     features of each field, without boosting cost much. Paycheck \n     usually takes about a year.\n       ``Farmers used to farm fields,'' said David Franzen, a soil \n     expert at North Dakota State University in Fargo. ``Now they \n     farm locations in fields.''\n       Within five years, about half the 150,000 major grain \n     farmers in the Midwest will use the approach, says Harold \n     Reetz, Midwest director of the Potash and Phosphate \n     Institute.\n       About 10% to 15% do now, he says. Most started this year or \n     last. Sugar beet growers also are strong proponents.\n       ``Interest among farmers is stronger than we anticipated,'' \n     Reetz said. ``It helps us deal with the variability that is \n     out there.'' Among these are big differences in soil found \n     across a large farm.\n       The goal is to make the land more productive by using just \n     the right amount of costly fertilizer and pesticide for each \n     field or even part of a field down to a 20-foot section. \n     These inputs now are blended to meet average regional \n     conditions.\n       Fully outfitted farmers need high-tech yield monitors, crop \n     moisture sensors and a satellite receiver, all mounted on a \n     tractor. Personal computers and special analytical software \n     usually is bought separately or provided by a consultant. \n     Farmers also can buy special gear for applying field \n     nutrients.\n       ``The one thing that makes site-specific farming work is \n     the computer processing power that is available today,'' said \n     Steve Koep, marketing manager at privately held Ag Chem \n     Equipment Co. in Minnesota, Minn. The company makes a 20-ton-\n     capacity precision fertilizer applicator that costs about \n     $250,000.\n       Site-specific farming ``minimizes cost and maximizes \n     production,'' said Ron Phillips, a spokesman for the \n     Fertilizer Institute in Washington.\n       The environment also gains. By making better use of \n     nutrients, farmers reduce leaching, runoff into streams and \n     soil erosion. Pesticide use often is cut.\n       Most farm chemical suppliers back site-specific farming \n     because it helps them provide value-added service, says Jim \n     Egenreider, regulatory affairs director at the Agricultural \n     Retailers Association in Washington.\n       ``For (farm) cooperatives, it's a wash,'' said Cheryl \n     Kohls, an agronomy equipment specialist with Conex-Land \n     O'Lakes Services, a co-op in St. Paul, Minn.\n       Farmers may use less fertilizer in one area but more in \n     another. And even if co-ops do sell fewer chemicals, many \n     also supply soil testing and other services needed for \n     precision farming.\n       About half the time, farmers get exacting field maps so \n     they can receive the most precise results. Farmers use a \n     plow-mounted device to record signals from an orbiting \n     satellite, part of the Global Positioning System.\n       New ``differential correction'' signals have boosted \n     precision farming. They unscramble and orient the GPS \n     satellite signal to a known, fixed point, ensuring accuracy.\n       The receiver is used to map the field on a grid. \n     Separately, crop yield and moisture data are taken from \n     sensors on the tractor when farmers harvest crops. The field \n     maps and crop data later are correlated on a PC.\n       Demand for GPS hardware is strong, says Colin Stewart, a \n     sales rep for Satloc Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., a major supplier. \n     The company's backlog now is four to six weeks.\n       Other data also may be matched up to the maps. In Britain, \n     for instance, farmers can quickly assess weather conditions \n     by retrieving recent photos of cloud formations taken by a \n     weather satellite. The British Metrological Office offers \n     these photos for a $750-a-year license fee and $7.50 a frame. \n     Photos are shipped to PC's via phone lines.\n       Even without weather photos, farmers gain. By overlaying \n     and analyzing crop and soil data from their fields, they can \n     pinpoint where yields are falling short.\n       ``Yield monitoring is like a report card,'' said Koep. ``It \n     tells you how you did.''\n       Farmers can buy the receiver-yield monitor and analytical \n     software for less than $8,500. The satellite signal runs \n     about $500 a year.\n       Using the data to improve yields usually means hiring an \n     expert who relies on still more high-tech equipment to \n     correlate data and figure out why the yields are low. The \n     experts analyze soil samples and field features, again using \n     the satellite to get precision positions. They then offer \n     prescription. Topography and location of drainage systems are \n     taken into account.\n       Treatments are straightforward. Farmers vary the use of \n     additives over a large field, seeking maximum efficiency.\n       They may rely on precision applicators with tracking \n     equipment. But some, armed with the new data on their fields, \n     will fall back on institution and their old application gear \n     when putting this information to use.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/11/senate-section/article/S13309-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13312-S13313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
