Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of S. 1061, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1061) to provide for congressional gift reform.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       McCain modified amendment No. 1872, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 1874 (to amendment No. 1872), to \n     permit reimbursement for travel and lodging at charitable \n     political events.\n       Lott amendment No. 1875 (to amendment No. 1872), to change \n     the maximum total value of gifts that can be accepted from a \n     single source in 1 year from $50 to $100.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1874\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 10 minutes of debate on the Murkowski amendment No. 1874.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the two amendments that we are going to be \nvoting on early this morning really go to the heart of the efforts that \nwe are making to reform gifts. And those issues are the recreational \ntrips and the meals and the tickets which are given to Members of this \nbody.\n  So while we have narrowed the differences significantly--and we \nhave--we still are confronted with the really principal issues which \nhave brought us to this point; and that is the recreational travel, the \ngolf outings, the ski trips, and the tennis trips that are provided as \nso-called charitable travel but which is a significant recreational \nbenefit to us. As a matter of fact, this travel is defined as \nsubstantially recreation. That is the first amendment that we will be \nvoting on. It is the Murkowski amendment, which will be to allow that \nkind of recreational travel to Members of this body to be reimbursed by \nprivate interests for that travel.\n  What the public has seen and read and heard about are these trips \nthat we are offered also benefit a charity. There are two beneficiaries \nof these trips. A charity benefits when we show up, and we benefit by \nbeing given a couple of days and nights and fancy lodging, and being \ngiven fancy meals and being paid the transportation to get there. That \nis a substantial gift to Members. Yes, a charity also benefits. But the \nprice that we pay to benefit the charity is the diminution, the \nreduction of the public confidence in this institution by the benefit \nthat is received by Members from this recreational travel, which is \nsignificant. It is like a paid vacation that we are given at the same \ntime there is a charitable contribution that is also made by the \ncorporate sponsors. And we should give it up. We simply should give it \nup. It has reduced public confidence in this institution.\n  We have transcripts of television shows that are available to Members \nto read if they want to see what this looks like to the general public.\n  So I hope we will defeat the Murkowski amendment, which is the first \namendment that we will be voting on this morning.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, good morning. My colleagues, good \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that we are going to be voting on very \nshortly provides the same rules for transportation and lodging in \nconnection with charitable events as the bill provides for political \nevents. That is all it does. It just conforms the two--political vis-a-\nvis charitable events.\n  Mr. President, much of this debate has been about public perception, \nthat somehow we in Washington are being bought and sold by lobbyists, \nPAC's, and so forth; if we spend a weekend at \n\n[[Page S 10846]]\na charitable event which includes lobbyists, that somehow we become \npolluted with corruption, or so goes the myth. There have been \ntelevision programs directed at this. But at the same time, there is \nnothing wrong with Members of this body receiving lobbyist money paying \nfor Senators' meals, Senators' lodging, Senators' transportation at a \npolitical fundraiser in Hollywood, in Florida, and you name it.\n  I ask, Mr. President, are we going to sell that bill of malarkey to \nthe American public? I do not think so. It is OK for a lobbyist's money \nto pay us for travel to fundraisers and PAC's but it is not OK for \nlobbyist money to be used for travel to an event that will benefit \nbreast cancer screening or poor children in need of medical attention.\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply provides that Senators would be \npermitted to be privately reimbursed for the costs of lodging and \ntransportation in connection with a charitable fundraising event, \nonly--and I repeat ``only''--if the Senate Select Committee on Ethics \ndetermines that participating in the charity event is in the interest \nof the Senate and in the interest of the United States.\n  I think we have a clear choice. Do we want to establish the same \nlodging and transportation rules for charitable fundraisers as we have \nfor political fundraising, or do we want to make it harder, harder to \nraise money for worthy charities?\n  The inconsistency here is an obvious one. The rule says as proposed \nin the compromise that there will be no reimbursement for charity \nevents if it is associated with recreation. Yet, make no mistake about \nit, Mr. President, the loophole is this: You can have a political \nfundraiser for yourself, reimburse Members for travel to that political \nfundraiser and you can have a charity event, too, and have the proceeds \ngo to the charity.\n  Let us not kid ourselves. What is the source of funds for these \nevents? The source of funds is the same groups, the politicians, \npolitical action committees, the PAC's, and so forth.\n  Now, I had intended to offer another amendment which would have \nrequired Members to pay out of their own pocket for travel and lodging \nfor political events like they propose now for charity events. I \ndecided not to pursue that because in reality that belongs in the \ncampaign reform effort which is going to be underway at some point in \ntime, and I intend to pursue it at that time.\n  We are not kidding ourselves. We are not kidding the American public. \nWe are simply involved in a bit of a charade here. A significant \nportion of it is worthwhile. This reform is needed. As far as \neliminating reimbursement for travel and lodging associated with \ncharitable events and still allowing for political events when the \nfunds came from the same source is the hypocrisy the Senator from \nAlaska wants to point out and wants to remind all Members as they look \nat how they are going to vote on the Murkowski amendment.\n   I encourage them to recognize that significant difference. Members \ngo out, establish a political event, reimburse other Members for travel \nand transportation. The source of the funds comes from the PAC's and \nthe lobbyists. And they can put on a charity event with it. Perhaps \nthat is what the membership wants. But I suggest the American public is \ngoing to question whether we have gone all the way here or whether we \nhave left a loophole.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alaska has \nexpired. The Senator from Michigan has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know we went through this last \nnight in, I think, rather extensive debate. A Senator certainly can \nattend charitable events, no question about it. The issue is the \nrecreational travel. What this vote is about is just one issue, and the \nissue is this: It does not serve this institution well, it does not \nserve any of us as individual Senators well, when lobbyists pay for \nSenators and their spouses or their family to go on weekend golf, \ntennis, skiing, or fishing trips. It is inappropriate. We ought not to \nbe taking these gifts. People in the country do not think it is right. \nWe should not think it is right, and I certainly hope that this \namendment by the Senator from Alaska will be voted down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute 2 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will reserve that.\n  Is there any time remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the other side. \nThe Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me conclude by saying this is one of the two issues \nthat has brought us to this point. This recreational travel is a \nsignificant gift to us. Yes, there is also a benefit to the charity, \nbut it is the gift to us which is the issue under our gift rules.\n  If we are going to significantly change the way we do business, this \nis one of the two areas where we must make a change, the so-called \nrecreational travel. The charities have great appeals. They should be \nsupported; they can be supported, but they must not be supported in a \nway which undermines public confidence in this institution. And that is \nthe issue which we will be voting on with the Murkowski amendment. It \nis the public confidence in this institution, the gifts which we get, \nwhich is the issue.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated. I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, under the previous \norder, the question occurs now on agreeing to amendment No. 1874 \noffered by the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski]. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 339 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pryor\n     Roth\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Inouye\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Stevens\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1874) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment numbered 1875 offered by the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Debate on the amendment is limited to 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have come this far on gift reform, and \nwe should not turn back now on one of the central issues which are the \ntickets and the meals.\n  Mr. President, we have now made a significant decision in the area of \ngifts. \n\n[[Page S 10847]]\nWe have come a significant way. Now we must not turn back. We really \nmust address the question of the tickets and the meals.\n  We cannot be bought for $100, $50, or $20. I do not think we could be \nbought for $1 million.\n  If we will give up the tickets and the meals, the way we have now \ngiven up the recreational travel, we can contribute something. We can \ngive something of immeasurable value to this democracy of ours. We can \nadd to public confidence in our democratic institutions.\n  This public confidence has been eroded. We can help to restore it, if \nwe will now take this step which basically addresses the tickets and \nthe meals.\n  The executive branch has a $20 gift rule and a $50 total that anyone \ncan give. This would follow the executive branch rule. If they can live \nunder it, I believe we also can live under it. I hope this amendment is \ndefeated.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in support of the amendment, I yield our 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, so that he can \nmake a statement on this, in support of this amendment.\n  We will vote to see if we have any vestiges of self-respect left.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 3 minutes of my 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the issue before the Senate, I think, is very, very \nclear. Mr. President, and my colleagues, this legislation, make no \nbones about it, makes major, dramatic changes in how we are going to \nconduct the daily lives of Members of this body.\n  Essentially, today, meals are exempt from any kind of a gift ban or \nlimitation. We all have meals and lunches with our constituents and \nwith people who do business here in Washington. Essentially, those \nevents are exempt from any ban today.\n  This legislation, for the first time, says meals are going to be \nincluded. If that meal costs $21, Members will find themselves before \nthe Ethics Committee, answering a charge that they have violated this \nrule.\n  I say to my colleagues that is not sound policy. The Ethics Committee \nhas a lot of work to do. They should not be going over lunch tabs and \ndinner tickets, to make sure that the tab, the tax, and the tip, does \nnot somehow add up to $21.\n  That is what the McCain-Wellstone bill provides for. I suggest that \nwe, I think, are smarter than that. Our constituents are smarter than \nthat.\n  Every year in my State of Louisiana, the Shreveport Chamber of \nCommerce comes up. They have a luncheon. They invite Senator Johnston. \nThey have a dinner. They invite myself. Next year, they will reverse \nthe order. That meal is probably going to cost more than $20. They are \nhaving that meal for us to talk about things of interest to that city \nand my State.\n  Every year the Louisiana Municipal Association comes up and takes us \nout to dinner. That meal is going to cost more than $20.\n  I suggest to the Members of this body, as it has been said so many \ntimes before, we are not going to be bought for $21. We have to be \nreasonable. We have to be practical. If we vote like our constituents \nwant us to vote, a $21 meal is not going to make the difference.\n  Our legislation simply says $50 for a gift limitation. You cannot \ntake it when it adds up to over $100 in a year. Therefore, a meal that \nis $50--a lunch, a dinner, anything under that--is not prohibited. If \nyou add $51, that is prohibited. The maximum would be $100 in a year.\n  Some say Members go to dinner every night for 365 days and they could \ngive you $18,000 a year. If anybody goes to dinner with the same person \nevery night for 365 some days, I suggest they are idiots and should not \nbe in the Senate in the first place.\n  Under their legislation, Members could go every night for $20 and \nspend $7,350. Is that all right? Are we playing games with our self-\nrespect, our ability to know what is right and what is wrong? And more \nimportantly, to allow our constituents to know what is right and what \nis wrong.\n  I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, recently I was along with some of my \ncolleagues and was invited to hear the President of France at a one-\ntable luncheon at the French Embassy on the subject of Bosnia \nprincipally; to the British Embassy, to hear Douglas Hurd, the Foreign \nMinister of Britain, speak about foreign matters in general. Both were, \nI thought, very important dinners. Both would clearly have exceeded the \n$20. Would this be prohibited under the $20 rule?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Any gift Members receive that is over $20, that includes \na meal, would be prohibited under the legislation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take 1 minute to get the \nattention of my colleagues on an argument that was made last night, and \nhopefully not many were here.\n  That was this suggestion that my friend from Louisiana made that a \nSenator could go out every night for a whole year and rack up $18,000 \nin bills under this amendment. That is technically true. Of course, as \nthe Senator from Louisiana pointed out, it is technically true that \nunder the alternative Members could rack up $7,000 in bills.\n  The point I want Members to know is that anybody who did that would \nhave a serious case before the Ethics Committee. The fact that it might \nnot be a technical violation of the rule does not mean that it is \nproper conduct. It would be clearly improper conduct.\n  Some of the major cases that we have had here in the Senate in the \nlast few years have not been technical violations of the rules. They \nstill have been major cases. That was the case in the Keating case. It \nis the case with some of the charges against the Senator from Oregon--\nnot technical violations of the rules, but still a very serious case.\n  I want Members to know that anybody who tried to exploit this rule, \nin this way, would be in very, very, serious trouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The other \nside has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, a very serious mistake of fact has been \nmade on the floor about the bill. The last two speakers said under our \nbill you could take up to $7,000 a year. That is absolutely false. \nUnder our bill, the most you could take from one individual is $50, the \nexecutive rule. Under the amendment here, it would be at least $18,500 \nfor, obviously, a wrongdoer. That is a fact.\n  The difference is that the current McCain provision has an aggregate \nlimit and the provision provided by the other side on this has no \naggregate. So one person, several times a day, could give up to $50 a \nday and that does not count. And there is no aggregation. That is a \nfact. That is exactly the difference between the two, and any other \nsuggestion means somebody has not read the difference between the \namendments.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could just get the attention of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, let me just emphasize what the Senator from Wisconsin \nsaid. Fact No. 1 is that people in the country just think it is \ninappropriate when it comes to the meals and the tickets. They think we \nshould let go of it. And we should, if we want to restore confidence.\n  Fact No. 2, this amendment says that you can go out for a meal or you \ncan take a ticket or whatever, and as long as it is under $50 you can \nkeep receiving the same gift from a lobbyist in perpetuity. There is no \nlimit. There is no $100 limit.\n  Senators, you cannot tell people we are making a reform, you cannot \ntell people we are putting an end to this practice, with this kind of \nhuge loophole. It is not credible. It will not work. This amendment is \ndeeply flawed and is not a reform.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is really all about, this entire \nlegislation \n\n[[Page S 10848]]\nis about establishing confidence. I do not think there is any doubt the \nAmerican people do not believe we live like they do. I do not think \nthere is any doubt that the confidence and esteem in which we are held \nis not at the level that we want it to be.\n  I believe if this amendment is agreed to, the perception will be that \n$50 a day, unrecorded, unaggregated, will indeed be a privilege that \nmost Americans do not enjoy.\n  It is not really much more complicated than that. As the Senator from \nMichigan pointed out, can Senators be bought for $20 or $50 or $100 or \n$200? That is not the argument here. The argument here is whether we \nwill live like the rest of the American people do, and that, for most \ncitizens, is not the ability to receive as much as $50 a day in some \nkinds of benefits.\n  We believe the original legislation is far more appropriate. There \nare those who would argue for zero dollars. I believe what we have \ncrafted is the appropriate method and I do not believe this is about \nbuying and selling of Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1875\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \namendment 1875, offered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 340 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Hatfield\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n  So the amendment (No. 1875) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE.

The Senator is correct. May we have order. \nSenators will please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. May we \nhave order in the Senate.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know order when I see order in the Senate, and we do \nnot have it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is no better way \nto describe it. We know it when we see it.\n  May we have order, please. The Senators on my right, find another \nplace to converse. The Senators over here, please find another place.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the gavel has only been broken once, and it \nwas replaced with a new gavel. And it might be well perhaps even to \nbreak it again. When the Chair calls for order, the Chair should be \nrespected. I know we are all prone to talk a little bit. We like to see \nour colleagues during the rollcalls. I do the same thing. But if the \nChair will crack that gavel and let us know that the Chair wants order, \nhe should have it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair).\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the bill before us today, S. 1061, is \ndesigned to strengthen the standing rules of the Senate regarding the \nacceptance of gifts by Members and staff. Accordingly, it is meant to \nconfront the public's perception that Members of the Senate can somehow \nbe influenced for the price of a lunch. That is really pretty silly, \nbut nevertheless that may be the perception. I, for one, do not believe \nthat to be true. But perception, as we all know, is sometimes \noverpowering.\n  Indeed, Marie Antoinette may never have actually said, ``Let them eat \ncake,'' but the fact remains that, in 1793, the people of Paris \nbelieved that Marie Antoinette said, ``Let them eat cake.'' So, let us \nnot be fooled. Perception matters, and, whether we like it or not, it \nmust be dealt with.\n  It is to that end, the righting of public perception, that I am \noffering this amendment. Quite simply, my amendment states that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates--as the Senate is doing in relation to itself in the pending \nmeasure--should review and reevaluate its gift rules, including the \nacceptance of travel and travel-related expenses, and that those \nregulations should cover all judicial branch employees, including \nmembers of the Supreme Court.\n  Like the legislative branch, the judicial branch of Government cannot \nafford to be seen in the eyes of the public as anything less than \nimpartial and unbiased. The great tenet of our judicial system, that \nall Americans enjoy ``equal justice under the law,'' cannot be brought \ninto question if we are to maintain a society based on the rule of law. \nTherefore, if it is important for the men and women who make the laws \nto be above reproach--and it is important--then it only makes sense \nthat it is equally important for the men and women who interpret those \nlaws to be similarly above reproach.\n  In truth, one could argue that it is even more important for the \njudiciary to undertake a reevaluation and strengthening of its rules \nsince the very individuals addressed in this amendment are people who, \nonce confirmed by the Senate, retain lifetime tenure. Federal judges do \nnot stand for reelection every 2 years or every 6 years as do Members \nof the House and Senate. On the contrary, unless they are impeached in \nthe House and convicted in the Senate, Federal judges may hold their \npositions for life, health permitting. Their behavior and their moral \nauthority as adjudicators of great issues are not subject to a public \nvote of confidence.\n  Mr. President, public acceptance and support of the decisions of our \ncourts depends entirely on an independent and impartial judiciary. The \ndecisions of the Federal courts must not be tarnished by even the \nslightest hint of impropriety, because the men and women who sit in \njudgment are charged with deciding the most momentous questions--\nquestions that go to the very heart of our liberties. They decide \nquestions involving freedom of\n speech and freedom of religion under the first amendment. They protect \nour constitutional rights to due process, our rights of privacy, and \nour rights to the pursuit of happiness in a free and open society. And \nthey adjudicate controversies, the impact of which may mean millions or \neven billions of dollars to the individuals and corporations involved. \nBecause of that authority and extraordinary power, the judicial branch, \nmore so than even the other two branches of government, must hold and \nretain the utmost confidence of the American people.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there have been reports that some \nmembers of our Federal courts have availed themselves of trips \nsponsored and paid for by a corporation that was involved \n\n[[Page S 10849]]\nin litigation in those courts. I am going to read now from a March 5, \n1995, newspaper story that appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nconcerning this matter. And for the benefit of my colleagues, I have \nhad placed on every Senator's desk a copy of this news article. I urge \nSenators to read the article and they will understand the importance of \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Minneapolis Star Tribune article was written by \nSharon Schmickle and Tom Hamburger.\n  The headline is: ``West and the Supreme Court; Members accepted gifts \nand perks while acting on appeals worth millions to Minnesota firm.''\n  And it reads as follows:\n       ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' These words, chiseled above \n     the huge bronze doors of the Supreme Court, promise that its \n     justices will be impartial.\n       Yet some parties who asked the court to review their claims \n     against West Publishing Co. now wonder if they received equal \n     treatment. The reason: Since 1983, West has treated seven \n     Supreme Court justices to luxurious trips at posh resorts or \n     hotels.\n       None of them saw the trips as reason to disqualify \n     themselves from considering whether to hear five cases \n     involving their host. In each of the five instances, the \n     justices declined to review a lower court's decision, leaving \n     intact a decision in favor of West.\n       The odds already were against West's opponents, because the \n     high court each year agrees to hear fewer than 200 of the \n     5,000 or so requests for review.\n       Two of the West cases involved key copyright issues. And \n     two cases were placed on lists indicating they were actively \n     discussed at the justices' weekly conference.\n       All justices refused interviews, but two--Antonin Scalia \n     and Lewis Powell, who's now retired--said in written \n     responses that they saw nothing wrong with accepting expense-\n     paid trips to attend meetings for what they regard as a \n     worthy purpose. ``That company [West] has been of great \n     importance to the legal profession and to legal scholars,'' \n     Powell wrote in response to the Star Tribune's inquiry.\n       Here's a review of the justices' trips and the West-related \n     cases the Supreme Court considered:\n\n\n                                  1983\n\n       Byron White set the pattern for other justices. He accepted \n     an invitation to serve on a committee to select the winner of \n     the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished\n      Service to Justice Award, a prize sponsored by West \n     Publishing Co. The other committee members were Devitt and \n     Judge Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Each committee member was to serve for two years.\n       The committee could have reviewed candidates in St. Paul, \n     where Devitt lived, or on the East Coast, where White and \n     Tjoflat worked. Instead, they conducted their February \n     meeting at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas in Palm Springs, \n     Calif. It's an appealing place--a four-star resort with \n     tennis courts and 27 holes of golf--and West picked up the \n     tab. The trip gave White, a former All-America halfback, a \n     chance to have a reunion with his old football coach, Johnny \n     (Blood) McNally, who lived nearby. Spouses were invited.\n       West's CEO--\n\n  Chief executive officer--\n\n     Dwight Opperman, also attended the retreat, although he did \n     not sit in on selection-committee meetings.\n\n\n                                  1984\n\n       The group considered going to Florida for its second \n     meeting. But after consulting White, Devitt wrote to \n     Opperman--\n\n  The CEO for West Publishing Co.--\n\n     ``He said his wife was not too enthused about Florida. We \n     discussed San Diego, but I pointed out to him that that place \n     is not a warm spot in January or February.''\n       California was selected. ``Dwight Opperman--\n\n  West's CEO--\n\n     has made a reservation for the 1984 meeting at Marriott's Las \n     Palmas Hotel in Palm Springs (same as last year),'' Devitt \n     wrote to White. In the same letter, he said, ``Dwight wants \n     to have Johnny Blood McNally and his wife join us for \n     recreation as before.''\n       McNally, a graduate of St. John's in Collegeville, Minn., \n     coached White when he played for the Pittsburgh Steelers. \n     Devitt wrote McNally, inviting him and his wife to join the \n     group for ``social affairs.''\n       A couple of weeks after the trip, paid for by West, White \n     wrote to Devitt: ``As usual, it was a pleasure to be with you \n     even if your golf was intolerably good.''\n       Another Supreme Court justice also benefited that year. \n     Chief Justice Warren Burger was chosen to receive a special \n     award from the Devitt committee. He donated his $10,000 prize \n     to an organization that promotes interest in the law.\n       Lewis Powell succeeded White on the Devitt panel. ``Caneel \n     Bay is a place my wife Jo and I always have hoped to visit,'' \n     Powell wrote in a 1984 letter to Devitt.\n       Opperman--\n\n  West Publishing Co.'s CEO--\n\n     began scheduling a fall meeting at the exclusive resort on \n     St. John in the Virgin Islands.\n       Within weeks of the suggestion, Opperman wrote to the \n     justice, saying the meeting would take place at Caneel Bay. \n     He promised to send resort brochures and invited the Powells \n     to stay overnight in Miami the day before the committee was \n     to meet. The letter reminded Powell: ``The Devitt Committee \n     travels first class, of course.'' And it said, ``I will send \n     you a check for the air fares right away and will reimburse \n     you for incidental expenses as you advise me.''\n       After the trip, Powell wrote to Devitt, sending a copy to \n     Opperman, suggesting the next meeting be held at the Breakers \n     Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. He\n      said it is ``on the water, superior facilities, and \n     affording many interesting things to do and places to \n     see--particularly for our ladies.''\n\n\n                                  1985\n\n       Back in Washington, Powell and White received a list of \n     cases that included the name ``West Publishing Co.'' during \n     their closed-door conference meetings at the Supreme Court.\n       Patrick Beary, who ran a one-man law office in Queens, \n     N.Y., had decided to press a libel complaint against West to \n     the nation's highest court. Beary wrote his own briefs for \n     the case that had been thrown out by judges in lower courts. \n     A federal appeals panel ruled that West had accurately \n     published a court decision involving Beary and that such \n     activity was protected by law. Beary claimed his libel case \n     raised constitutional questions requiring the high court's \n     review.\n       Beary's petition was placed on the list of requests the \n     justices decided to discuss, suggesting that at least one \n     justice wanted to consider it. However, it was rejected for \n     reasons that aren't known because the court's conferences are \n     secret.\n       At the time, Beary understood the rejection. Now that he \n     knows about the trips, he's not so sure. ``The justices who \n     went on these trips may have swayed their fellows on the \n     court not to hear the case, you know. I am entitled to my day \n     in court and I didn't get it,'' he said.\n\n\n                                  1986\n\n       Three months after the court rejected Beary's petition, it \n     was time for Powell and his wife to head to the next Devitt \n     committee meeting, at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, a \n     hotel where double-occupancy rooms currently go for $290 to \n     $455. They joined the Devitts, Ninth Circuit Judge James \n     Browning and two West executives and their wives.\n       After the January meeting, Powell wrote Opperman [West's \n     CEO]: ``It was obvious that Jo and I enjoyed the gathering \n     last week of the Devitt Award Committee group.'' He went on \n     to praise the work of the committee, then added, ``I was most \n     favorably impressed by [West vice president] Gerry \n     Cafesjian.'' In June, Powell wrote Devitt telling how much he \n     enjoyed photos taken by Cafesjian and mailed to him after the \n     trip. ``We had several chuckles and the pictures brought back \n     the warmest memories,'' the justice wrote.\n       Less than three weeks later, West's name again surfaced \n     before the court.\n       West had resisted paying more than $160,000 in back taxes, \n     interest and penalties that the city of Phoenix was trying to \n     collect. It was a ``business-privilege'' tax that the city \n     routinely imposed on business activity conducted within its \n     limits. A West employee assigned to represent the company in \n     Arizona worked out of his Phoenix home, seeking orders and \n     answering questions about West's products. West argued that \n     most of its business in Arizona was conducted by direct mail \n     and that it did not actually operate an office in the city.\n       An Arizona appeals court agreed with West and the Supreme \n     Court declined to\n      hear the case. Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizona \n     native, removed herself from the vote on the city's \n     petition.\n       A few weeks later, Powell and White received an unexpected \n     invitation from West. Although their two-year terms on the \n     Devitt committee had expired, Opperman invited the justices \n     to attend a special ``advisory committee meeting.''\n       Through an exchange of letters, they decided to meet in \n     January at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel, Calif. The \n     resort, which sites on a 200-foot bluff overlooking the \n     Pacific Ocean, has an 18-hole golf course.\n       A handwritten note by Devitt indicates that during the \n     Saturday-through-Tuesday gathering, only Monday morning was \n     devoted to committee meetings. The rest of the schedule \n     listed ``free'' time, golf and dining.\n\n\n                                  1987\n\n       On Jan. 23, only days before Powell and White departed for \n     the California resort, the court met to consider another \n     request that it hear a case against West. It is a case that \n     has meant more to West than any other in recent history.\n       The dispute involved Mead Data Central Inc., an Ohio \n     company that had jumped into electronic publishing and \n     threatened West's standing as a leading legal publisher. The \n     court opinions in Mead's computerized databases referred to \n     page numbers in West's law books. West had gone to court \n     claiming copyright infringement and a federal judge in \n     Minnesota had ordered Mead to stop using the numbers until \n     the lawsuit was settled. Though preliminary, the order \n     signaled that West's chances of winning the dispute were \n     good.\n       After losing an appeal in the Eighth Circuit, Mead turned \n     to the high court. For West and Mead, millions of dollars \n     were riding on the decision. But the potential impact reached \n     further. If the court decided to \n\n[[Page S 10850]]\n     hear the case, it also could lay the groundwork for other publishers \n     who were rushing into electronics.\n       Neither White nor Powell disqualified himself from \n     participating in the decision, through Powell apparently \n     thought about it. The papers of the late Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall, on file at the Library of Congress, show that \n     Powell apparently considered disqualifying himself, telling \n     the clerk of the court in a letter: ``Following discussion of \n     this case at Conference today, I concluded it was unnecessary \n     for me to remain `out'. Therefore please disregard my letter \n     to you of January 22.''\n       On Jan. 27, the court refused to hear Mead's appeal and \n     ultimately the companies negotiated a secret settlement, \n     reportedly requiring Mead to pay fees to West.\n       On week after that decision, Powell and White joined \n     Oppeman, another West executive and former committee members \n     for the ``advisory'' session at the California resort. And as \n     they departed, Justice William Brennan, who had also \n     participated in discussions of Mead vs. West, prepared for \n     his own trip at West expense.\n       William Brennan and his wife, Mary, flew to Hawaii for the \n     next Devitt committee gathering. They were greeted on \n     February 7, 1987, by the Oppermans, Devitt and Fifth Circuit \n     Judge Charles Clark at the Kahala Hilton in Honolulu.\n       Brennan's first encounter with the Devitt panel had come in \n     early 1986, in the form of a letter of invitation from \n     Devitt.\n       ``We would very much like to have you serve on the \n     committee,'' Devitt had written. ``I feel sure you will enjoy \n     it. In the past we have met for several days at the time of \n     the Supreme Court mid-winter break in late January or early \n     February. We have met in Palm Springs on two occasions [and] \n     in the Virgin Islands . . . It makes for a nice break from \n     the routine, and the responsibilities are not too burdensome \n     . . . The ten of us make for a small congenial group. The \n     arrangements are made and cared for by Mr. Opperman.''\n       After Brennan's trip to the Kahala Hilton, Powell wrote to \n     Devitt: ``Bill Brennan returned from your recent meeting with \n     great enthusiasm and approval of the work of the committee. \n     His delightful wife Mary was equally enthusiastic.'' And Mary \n     Brennan wrote Devitt on Supreme Court notepaper saying: \n     ``Bill and I wanted you to know how very much we enjoyed \n     being with you in Hawaii. We had a great time, didn't we.''\n       That summer, the Brennans and Oppermans had dinner together \n     in Rochester, Minn., while the justice was getting a checkup \n     at the Mayo Clinic. While in Rochester, they discussed plans \n     for the next Devitt panel meeting. Brennan wrote Devitt \n     shortly afterward: ``February 6-9 is open for Mary and me and \n     we can't wait.''\n\n\n                                  1988\n\n       The Brennans traveled to Naples, Fla., in February for the \n     next Devitt committee meeting, staying at the Ritz-Carlton.\n       Brennan apparently was asked to recruit Chief Justice \n     William Rehnquist to serve on the panel the following year. \n     But Rehnquist declined, Brennan reported, calling it \n     ``wonderful duty but in his special relationship with the \n     judges of the district courts and the court of appeals he \n     thinks his service might be regarded as inappropriate.'' \n     Brennan concluded his letter to Opperman saying: ``Have you \n     anyone else in mind?''\n       Sandra Day O'Connor was invited to join the Devitt \n     committee after three of the five recent West-related \n     petitions came before the court.\n       She accepted the invitation in a letter to Devitt saying: \n     ``My colleagues have reported that it is a most pleasant task \n     carried out in a delightful setting.'' She declined Devitt's \n     invitation to suggest a meeting place.\n       California was chosen and Opperman wrote to O'Connor saying \n     he would enclose ``a brochure about the hotel which is one of \n     the nation's finest.'' He reminded her that ``the Devitt \n     Committee travels first class'' and that he would meet the \n     justice and her husband, John, when they disembarked from \n     their flight to the West Coast.\n\n\n                                  1989\n\n       The Ritz-Carlton hotel in Rancho Mirage offers luxurious \n     accommodations near some of the country's finest golf courses \n     and the Devitt committee met there from Jan. 28-31. Devitt \n     had set up advance golf reservations--with 10 a.m. tee\n      times--for himself and the O'Connors, Sunday at the Mission \n     Hills Resort and Monday at the Desert Island Country Club.\n       At the Ritz-Carlton, Devitt received a handwritten note \n     from a member of West's team outlining the plans: The group \n     would meet at the Club Lounge each evening at 5:30. At about \n     6, a limo would take them to dinner. The business meetings \n     were listed as ``Time to be determined.'' On Sunday and \n     Monday mornings, O'Connor and Devitt were scheduled to depart \n     for the golf course at 9:30.\n       After the California meeting, O'Connor wrote to Devitt on \n     Feb. 14: ``The Devitt Awards Committee meeting was such a \n     pleasant experience. I truly enjoyed the break from my \n     routine and the chance to join you on the links.''\n       Before long, it was time to start planning the next \n     meeting, to be held at the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles, \n     described in a promotional brochure as ``DISCREET. UNHURRIED. \n     PRICELESS.''\n       ``I re-read the brochure about the fancy hotel,'' Devitt \n     wrote to O'Connor in December. ``I'm sure we will have a good \n     time there. Dwight Opperman and I talked about it at lunch \n     yesterday.''\n       About the time he wrote the letter, Donna Nelson, an \n     assistant state attorney general in Austin, Texas, was \n     writing the next petition the high court would receive asking \n     it to hear a case against West.\n       For decades, West had published the statutes of Texas and \n     some two dozen other states under an arrangement that was \n     welcomed by state officials. But the harmonious relationship \n     ended in 1985, when West tried to use copyright claims to \n     block a competitor. Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox set out \n     to challenge West's copyright claims in court. Nelson was \n     assigned to write the briefs arguing that access to the law \n     belonged to the people of Texas, not to a private company.\n       West didn't claim it owned the words in the law. But it \n     claimed rights to the arrangement, numbers and titles of the \n     various sections in the law. Without those elements, the law \n     would be inaccessible, Texas argued.\n       Federal judges at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed \n     with a Texas judge who had granted West's request that the \n     case be dismissed. When Nelson argued the case, one of the \n     appeals court judges asked her, ``Did West do something to \n     make you mad?'' Texas wasn't planning to publish the laws \n     commercially and didn't have an ``actual controversy'' with \n     West, the appeals judges ruled.\n       What was never disclosed to Nelson was that one of the \n     three appeals court judges, John Minor Wisdom, had been a co-\n     winner of the Devitt award four months before the panel \n     issued its ruling against Texas. West had presented him with \n     $15,000 at a ceremony in New Orleans.\n       Nelson wasn't surprised when the Supreme Court rejected her \n     petition for an appeal. But five years later--after learning \n     from the Star Tribune that a circuit judge had accepted the \n     cash award and justices had accepted expensive trips from the \n     state's opponent--Nelson said: ``That just breaks my heart. \n     That's awful.''\n                                  1990\n\n       Five days after the court rejected the Texas petition \n     (apparently without disqualification by any member), O'Connor \n     flew to Los Angeles to meet Opperman, Devitt and the others \n     at the Bel Air Hotel.\n       After the trip, Devitt wrote to O'Connor: ``We were all \n     very happy to have John [her husband] with us at Bel-Air. He \n     is a wonderful Irishman.''\n       Later, O'Connor wrote to Devitt telling him ``it was a \n     great treat'' to serve on the award committee and sent him \n     photographs of the visit to California.\n       When she filed the financial disclosure forms judges are \n     required to complete each year, she didn't report the West-\n     paid trip. When the Star Tribune inquired about the form, \n     she--\n\n  Justice O'Connor--\n\n     said through a court spokeswoman that it was an oversight and \n     that it will be corrected.\n       John Paul Stevens got his invitation to serve on the Devitt \n     committee in February. ``I feel sure you will enjoy it,'' \n     Devitt wrote to Stevens. Stevens responded by telephone, \n     according to Devitt's handwritten notes, saying he wanted to \n     meet in Florida.\n       That spring, Opperman wrote Stevens asking whether the \n     justice and his wife, Maryan, preferred golf or tennis. \n     Stevens wrote back: ``It was most thoughtful of you to \n     accommodate us. In response to your inquiry, we are both \n     interested in tennis and golf.''\n\n\n                                  1991\n\n       Stevens, his wife and other committee members met with the \n     West executives in January at the Ritz-Carlton in Naples. \n     Judge William J. Holloway Jr., who also attended, said judges \n     were provided with suite accommodations courtesy of West. A \n     receipt shows that Devitts' room charge was $700 a night.\n       Meanwhile, in Washington, the court had received a fifth \n     request to hear a case against West. Arthur D'Amario, a \n     photographer from Rhode Island, had an altercation with \n     security guards outside a rock concert at the Providence \n     Civic Center and was convicted of simple assault. When his \n     appeal was denied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, West \n     received a copy of the opinion as part of the material it \n     routinely gathers for its books.\n       D'Amario tried to stop West from publishing the opinion, \n     alleging it was libelous and would infringe on his privacy \n     rights. Lower courts had ruled that they could not enjoin \n     West from publishing an official court decision. D'Amario \n     petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n       D'Amario did not know until last month that justices \n     considering his case had been entertained by West. ``I think \n     they have a duty to notify the petitioner of a conflict of \n     interest like this whether or not they think that the \n     potential conflict affects their judgment,'' he said. ``If I \n     had known this, I might have raised an ethics complaint at \n     the time.''\n       D'Amario's petition came before the court's conference two \n     months after Stevens returned from the Florida trip. The \n     justices denied the petition on\n      March 18.\n       D'Amario's petition marks the end of the requests the court \n     has received since 1982 to hear cases against West. But the \n     trips continued.\n       In May, Devitt wrote Stevens about plans for the January \n     1992 meeting of the committee. ``We will probably meet either \n     in some \n\n[[Page S 10851]]\n     Caribbean spot or on a boat trip out of some Florida port.''\n\n\n                                  1992\n\n       Indeed, they did find a warm port. Stevens and his wife \n     joined the committee for a January meeting in Nassau, the \n     Bahamas, at Paradise Island Resort & Casino.\n       Another judge on the committee, Holloway of the 10th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals in Oklahoma City, reported on his \n     disclosure form that West provided ``lodging, food, \n     entertainment and miscellaneous courtesies.''\n       Devitt died March 2. Few records about the committee \n     meetings after his death are available.\n\n\n                                  1993\n\n       Antonin Scalia was the next justice to make a West-paid \n     trip.\n       In January 1993, Scalia and his wife attended a Devitt \n     committee meeting in Los Angeles, according to his financial \n     disclosure form. Scalia had written to Devitt in August 1991 \n     that he and his wife, Maureen, ``look forward to a warm \n     meeting place--though we will leave the selection to you.''\n       Scalia did not list a value for the trip. However, another \n     judge attending that session, Seventh Circuit Court Judge \n     William Bauer, listed the value of the three days of West-\n     sponsored lodging and travel at $7,700.\n\n\n                                  1994\n\n       The Star Tribune was unable to determine where the Devitt \n     committee met to make its decisions in 1994.\n\n\n                                  1995\n\n       Anthony Kennedy is the newest justice to join the Devitt \n     committee. He attended his first meeting as a panelist in \n     January at the posh Four Seasons hotel in New York City.\n       Kennedy joined the group after the court decided against \n     hearing appeals in the Texas and D'Amario cases, and no West \n     cases have come before the court since then.\n       Kennedy declined to release his correspondence concerning \n     the Devitt committee. But Richard Arnold, chief judge of the \n     Eighth Circuit, released letters he received from Opperman \n     describing arrangements for the meeting:\n       ``The committee and spouses usually eat dinner as a group. \n     If there is some restaurant you especially want to try let me \n     know,'' Opperman wrote to Arnold in October.\n       ``There will be time for the theater and museums. I would \n     like to know your interests so we can accommodate them.''\n       The official business of the committee was taken care of in \n     two three-hour meetings during the trip that lasted Jan. 22-\n     25, Arnold said.\n\n  Mr. President, what we have here appears to be convincing evidence \nthat West Publishing, through its chief executive officer, was \nproviding free trips to members of the Federal judiciary, many times to \nthe poshest of resorts, at the same time that West was involved in \nlitigation before those courts. In instance after instance, as this \nstory has documented, it appears that the impartiality of the judiciary \ncould have been called into question, thus undermining the confidence \nwhich the American people place in that branch of government.\n  Let me stress here that I do not believe any Federal judge, any more \nthan any Member of Congress, is easily susceptible to influence as a \nresult of travel taken in connection with an awards-selection \ncommittee. But just as the bill now before the Senate is meant to \naddress very real concerns with regard to the public's perception of \nthe legislative branch, so, too, my amendment is meant to encourage the \nJudicial Conference to address such concerns within the judicial \nbranch.\n  For those Senators who may not be familiar with the rules and \nregulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference, let me quote \nbriefly from section 5 of those regulations. That section, dealing with \nthe acceptance of gifts, states, in part:\n\n       A judicial officer or employee shall not accept a gift from \n     anyone except for a gift incident to a public testimonial, \n     notes, tapes, and other source materials supplied by \n     publishers on a complimentary basis for official use or an \n     invitation to the officer or employee and a family member to \n     attend a bar-related function or an activity devoted to the \n     improvement of the law, the legal system, or the \n     administration of justice.\n\n  My concern, Mr. President--especially in light of the newspaper \narticle I have just read--and thus the basis for my amendment, is that \nthe language in section 5 of the regulations of the Judicial Conference \nmay allow too much latitude and thus jeopardize the appearance of \nimpartiality of the judiciary.\n  If we agree that there is a crisis of confidence in this country \nregarding the most sacred institutions of our Government, and that that \ncrisis must be addressed, then I think we must agree that no branch of \nGovernment can ignore the challenge to look inward and reevaluate its \nrules of conduct--not the legislative branch, not the executive branch, \nand certainly not the judicial branch. We must all accept the \nresponsibility for addressing public perception by strengthening our \ninternal rules in an effort to put very valid concerns about improper \nconduct to rest, however unfounded those concerns may be. Mr. \nPresident, my amendment will say to the Federal judiciary that it, too, \nshould join the legislative and executive branches in undertaking that \ntask.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1878 to Amendment No. 1872\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to the \n     regulation of the acceptance of gifts by the judicial branch)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which I now \nsend to the desk. I ask that such time as I have already used be \ncharged against the time under my control on the amendment, reserving \nonly 5 minutes for my further control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1878 to amendment No. 1872.\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . GIFTS IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States should review and reevaluate its \n     regulations pertaining to the acceptance of gifts and the \n     acceptance of travel and travel-related expenses and that \n     such regulations should cover all judicial branch employees, \n     including members and employees of the Supreme Court of the \n     United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the news article to which I have referred, March 5, 1995, \nMetro Edition, Minneapolis Star Tribune, so that the Record will show \nthat I have read the article word for word, offering no interpretations \nof it on my part, with the exception of, from time to time, \nreidentifying a name for clarification for the reader or listener.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Mar. 5, 1995]\n\n  West and the Supreme Court; Members Accepted Gifts and Perks While \n           Acting on Appeals Worth Millions to Minnesota Firm\n\n                (By Sharon Schmickle and Tom Hamburger)\n\n       ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' These words, chiseled above \n     the huge bronze doors of the Supreme Court, promise that its \n     justices will be impartial.\n       Yet some parties who asked the court to review their claims \n     against West Publishing Co. now wonder if they received equal \n     treatment. The reason: Since 1983, West has treated seven \n     Supreme Court justices to luxurious trips at posh resorts or \n     hotels.\n       None of them saw the trips as reason to disqualify \n     themselves from considering whether to hear five cases \n     involving their host. In each of the five instances, the \n     justices declined to review a lower court's decision, leaving \n     intact a decision in favor of West.\n       The odds already were against West's opponents, because the \n     high court each year agrees to hear fewer than 200 of the \n     5,000 or so requests for review.\n       Two of the West cases involved key copyright issues. And \n     two cases were placed on lists indicating they were actively \n     discussed at the justices' weekly conference.\n       All justices refused interviews, but two--Antonin Scalia \n     and Lewis Powell, who's now retired--said in written \n     responses that they saw nothing wrong with accepting expense-\n     paid trips to attend meetings for what they regard as a \n     worthy purpose. ``That company [West] has been of great \n     importance to the legal profession and to legal scholars,'' \n     Powell wrote in response to the Star Tribune's inquiry.\n       Here's a review of the justices' trips and the West-related \n     cases the Supreme Court considered:\n\n\n                                  1983\n\n       Byron White set the pattern for other justices. He accepted \n     an invitation to serve on a committee to select the winner of \n     the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished\n      Service to Justice Award, a prize sponsored by West \n     Publishing Co. The other committee members were Devitt and \n     Judge Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Each committee member was to serve for two years.\n       The committee could have reviewed candidates in St. Paul, \n     where Devitt lived, or on the East Coast, where White and \n     Tjoflat worked. Instead, they conducted their February \n     meeting at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas in Palm Springs, \n     Calif. It's an appealing place--a four-star resort with \n     tennis courts and 27 holes of golf--and West picked \n\n[[Page S 10852]]\n     up the tab. The trip gave White, a former All-American halfback, a \n     chance to have a reunion with his old football coach, Johnny \n     (Blood) McNally, who lived nearby. Spouses were invited.\n       West's CEO, Dwight Opperman, also attended the retreat, \n     although he did not sit in on selection-committee meetings.\n\n\n                                  1984\n\n       The group considered going to Florida for its second \n     meeting. But after consulting White, Devitt wrote to \n     Opperman: ``He said his wife was not too enthused about \n     Florida. We discussed San Diego, but I pointed out to him \n     that that place is not a warm spot in January or February.''\n       California was selected. ``Dwight Opperman has made a \n     reservation for the 1984 meeting at Marriott's Las Palmas \n     Hotel in Palm Springs (same as last year),'' Devitt wrote to \n     White. In the same letter, he said, ``Dwight wants to have \n     Johnny Blood McNally and his wife join us for recreation as \n     before.''\n       McNally, a graduate of St. John's in Collegeville, Minn., \n     coached White when he played for the Pittsburgh Steelers. \n     Devitt wrote McNally, inviting him and his wife to join the \n     group for ``social affairs.''\n       A couple of weeks after the trip, paid for by West, White \n     wrote to Devitt: ``As usual, it was a pleasure to be with you \n     even if your golf was intolerably good.''\n       Another Supreme Court justice also benefited that year. \n     Chief Justice Warren Burger was chosen to receive a special \n     award from the Devitt committee. He donated his $10,000 prize \n     to an organization that promotes interest in the law.\n       Lewis Powell succeeded White on the Devitt panel. ``Caneel \n     Bay is a place my wife Jo and I always have hoped to visit,'' \n     Powell wrote in a 1984 letter to Devitt.\n       Opperman begun scheduling a fall meeting at the exclusive \n     resort on St. John in the Virgin Islands.\n       Within weeks of the suggestion, Opperman wrote to the \n     justice, saying the meeting would take place at Caneel Bay. \n     He promised to send resort brochures and invited the Powells \n     to stay overnight in Miami the day before the committee was \n     to meet. The letter reminded Powell: ``The Devitt Committee \n     travels first class, of course.'' And it said, ``I will send \n     you a check for the air fares right away and will reimburse \n     you for incidental expenses as you advise me.''\n       After the trip, Powell wrote to Devitt, sending a copy to \n     Opperman, suggesting the next meeting be held at the Breakers \n     Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. He\n      said it is ``on the water, superior facilities, and \n     affording many interesting things to do and places to \n     see--particularly for our ladies.''\n\n\n                                  1985\n\n       Back in Washington, Powell and White received a list of \n     cases that included the name ``West Publishing Co.'' during \n     their closed-door conference meetings at the Supreme Court.\n       Patrick Beary, who ran a one-man law office in Queens, \n     N.Y., had decided to press a libel complaint against West to \n     the nation's highest court. Beary wrote his own briefs for \n     the case that had been thrown out by judges in lower courts. \n     A federal appeals panel ruled that West had accurately \n     published a court decision involving Beary and that such \n     activity was protected by law. Beary claimed his libel case \n     raised constitutional questions requiring the high court's \n     review.\n       Beary's petition was placed on the list of requests the \n     justices decided to discuss, suggesting that at least one \n     justice wanted to consider it. However, it was rejected for \n     reasons that aren't known because the court's conferences are \n     secret.\n       At the time, Beary understood the rejection. Now that he \n     knows about the trips, he's not so sure. ``The justices who \n     went on these trips may have swayed their fellows on the \n     court not to hear the case, you know. I am entitled to my day \n     in court and I didn't get it,'' he said.\n\n\n                                  1986\n\n       Three months after the court rejected Beary's petition, it \n     was time for Powell and his wife to head to the next Devitt \n     committee meeting, at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, a \n     hotel where double-occupancy rooms currently go for $290 to \n     $455. They joined the Devitts, Ninth Circuit Judge James \n     Browning and two West executives and their wives.\n       After the January meeting, Powell wrote Opperman: ``It was \n     obvious that Jo and I enjoyed the gathering last week of the \n     Devitt Award Committee group.'' He went on to praise the work \n     of the committee, then added, ``I was most favorably \n     impressed by [West vice president] Gerry Cafesjian.'' In \n     June, Powell wrote Devitt telling how much he enjoyed photos \n     taken by Cafesjian and mailed to him after the trip. ``We had \n     several chuckles and the pictures brought back the warmest \n     memories,'' the justice wrote.\n       Less than three weeks later, West's name again surfaced \n     before the court.\n       West had resisted paying more than $160,000 in back taxes, \n     interest and penalties that the city of Phoenix was trying to \n     collect. It was a ``business-privilege'' tax that the city \n     routinely imposed on business activity conducted within its \n     limits. A West employee assigned to represent the company in \n     Arizona worked out of his Phoenix home, seeking orders and \n     answering questions about West's products. West argued that \n     most of its business in Arizona was conducted by direct mail \n     and that it did not actually operate an office in the city.\n       An Arizona appeals court agreed with West and the Supreme \n     Court declined to\n      hear the case. Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizona \n     native, removed herself from the vote on the city's \n     petition.\n       A few weeks later, Powell and White received an unexpected \n     invitation from West. Although their two-year terms on the \n     Devitt committee had expired, Opperman invited the justices \n     to attend a special ``advisory committee meeting.''\n       Through an exchange of letters, they decided to meet in \n     January at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel, Calif. The \n     resort, which sits on a 200-foot bluff overlooking the \n     Pacific Ocean, has an 18-hole golf course.\n       A handwritten note by Devitt indicates that during the \n     Saturday-through-Tuesday gathering, only Monday morning was \n     devoted to committee meetings. The rest of the schedule \n     listed ``free'' time, golf and dining.\n\n\n                                  1987\n\n       On Jan. 23, only days before Powell and White departed for \n     the California resort, the court met to consider another \n     request that it hear a case against West. It is a case that \n     has meant more to West than any other in recent history.\n       The dispute involved Mead Data Central Inc., an Ohio \n     company that had jumped into electronic publishing and \n     threatened West's standing as a leading legal publisher. The \n     court opinions in Mead's computerized databases referred to \n     page numbers in West's law books. West had gone to court \n     claiming copyright infringement and a federal judge in \n     Minnesota had ordered Mead to stop using the numbers until \n     the lawsuit was settled. Though preliminary, the order \n     signaled that West's chances of winning the dispute were \n     good.\n       After losing an appeal in the Eighth Circuit, Mead turned \n     to the high court. For West and Mead, millions of dollars \n     were riding on the decision. But the potential impact reached \n     further. If the court decided to hear the case, it also could \n     lay the groundwork for other publishers who were rushing into \n     electronics.\n       Neither White nor Powell disqualified himself from \n     participating in the decision, though Powell apparently \n     thought about it. The papers of the late Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall, on file at the Library of Congress, show that \n     Powell apparently considered disqualifying himself, telling \n     the clerk of the court in a letter: ``Following discussion of \n     this case at Conference today, I concluded it was unnecessary \n     for me to remain `out'. Therefore please disregard my letter \n     to you of January 22.''\n       On Jan. 27, the court refused to hear Mead's appeal and \n     ultimately the companies negotiated a secret settlement, \n     reportedly requiring Mead to pay fees to West.\n       One week after that decision, Powell and White joined \n     Opperman, another West executive and former committee members \n     for the ``advisory'' session at the California resort. And as \n     they departed, Justice William Brennan, who had also \n     participated in discussions of Mead vs. West, prepared for \n     his own trip at West expense.\n       William Brennan and his wife, Mary, flew to Hawaii for the \n     next Devitt committee gathering. They were greeted on Feb. 7, \n     1987, by the Oppermans, Devitt and Fifth Circuit Judge \n     Charles Clark at the Kahala Hilton in Honolulu.\n       Brennan's first encounter with the Devitt panel had come in \n     early 1986, in the form of a letter of invitation from \n     Devitt.\n       ``We would very much like to have you serve on the \n     committee,'' Devitt had written. ``I feel sure you will enjoy \n     it. In the past we have met for several days at the time of \n     the Supreme Court mid-winter break in late January or early \n     February. We have met in Palm Springs on two occasions [and] \n     in the Virgin Islands . . . It makes for a nice break from \n     the routine, and the responsibilities are not too burdensome \n     . . . The ten of us make for a small congenial group. The \n     arrangements are made and cared for by Mr. Opperman.''\n       After Brennan's trip to the Kahala Hilton, Powell wrote to \n     Devitt: ``Bill Brennan returned from your recent meeting with \n     great enthusiasm and approval of the work of the committee. \n     His delightful wife Mary was equally enthusiastic.'' And Mary \n     Brennan wrote Devitt on Supreme Court notepaper saying: \n     ``Bill and I wanted you to know how very much we enjoyed \n     being with you in Hawaii. We had a great time, didn't we.''\n       That summer, the Brennans and Opper- mans had \n     dinner together in Rochester, Minn., while the justice was \n     getting a checkup at the Mayo Clinic. While in Rochester, \n     they discussed plans for the next Devitt panel meeting. \n     Brennan wrote Devitt shortly afterward: ``February 6-9 is \n     open for Mary and me and we can't wait.''\n\n\n                                  1988\n\n       The Brennans traveled to Naples, Fla., in February for the \n     next Devitt committee meeting, staying at the Ritz-Carlton.\n       Brennan apparently was asked to recruit Chief Justice \n     William Rehnquist to serve on the panel the following year. \n     But Rehnquist declined, Brennan reported, calling it \n     ``wonderful duty but in his special relationship with the \n     judges of the district courts and the court of appeals he \n     thinks his service might be regarded as inappropriate.'' \n     Brennan concluded his letter to Opperman saying: ``Have you \n     anyone else in mind?''\n       Sandra Day O'Connor was invited to join the Devitt \n     committee after three of the five recent West-related \n     petitions came before the court.\n\n[[Page S 10853]]\n\n       She accepted the invitation in a letter to Devitt saying: \n     ``My colleagues have reported that it is a most pleasant task \n     carried out in a delightful setting.'' She declined Devitt's \n     invitation to suggest a meeting place.\n       California was chosen and Opperman wrote to O'Connor saying \n     he would enclose ``a brochure about the hotel which is one of \n     the nation's finest.'' He reminded her that ``the Devitt \n     Committee travels first class'' and that he would meet the \n     justice and her husband, John, when they disembarked from \n     their flight to the West Coast.\n\n\n                                  1989\n\n       The Ritz-Carlton hotel in Rancho Mirage offers luxurious \n     accommodations near some of the country's finest golf courses \n     and the Devitt committee met there from Jan. 28-31. Devitt \n     had set up advance golf reservations--with 10 a.m. tee\n      times--for himself and the O'Connors, Sunday at the Mission \n     Hills Resort and Monday at the Desert Island Country Club.\n       At the Ritz-Carlton, Devitt received a handwritten note \n     from a member of West's team outlining the plans: The group \n     would meet at the Club Lounge each evening at 5:30. At about \n     6, a limo would take them to dinner. The business meetings \n     were listed as ``Time to be determined.'' On Sunday and \n     Monday mornings, O'Connor and Devitt were scheduled to depart \n     for the golf course at 9:30.\n       After the California meeting, O'Connor wrote to Devitt on \n     Feb. 14: ``The Devitt Awards Committee meeting was such a \n     pleasant experience. I truly enjoyed the break from my \n     routine and the chance to join you on the links.''\n       Before long, it was time to start planning the next \n     meeting, to be held at the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles, \n     described in a promotional brochure as ``DISCREET. UNHURRIED. \n     PRICELESS.''\n       ``I re-read the brochure about the fancy hotel,'' Devitt \n     wrote to O'Connor in December. ``I'm sure we will have a good \n     time there. Dwight Opperman and I talked about it at lunch \n     yesterday.''\n       About the time he wrote the letter, Donna Nelson, an \n     assistant state attorney general in Austin, Texas, was \n     writing the next petition the high court would receive asking \n     it to hear a case against West.\n       For decades, West had published the statutes of Texas and \n     some two dozen other states under an arrangement that was \n     welcomed by state officials. But the harmonious relationship \n     ended in 1985, when West tried to use copyright claims to \n     block a competitor. Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox set out \n     to challenge West's copyright claims in court. Nelson was \n     assigned to write the briefs arguing that access to the law \n     belonged to the people of Texas, not to a private company.\n       West didn't claim it owned the words in the law. But it \n     claimed rights to the arrangement, numbers and titles of the \n     various sections in the law. Without those elements, the law \n     would be inaccessible, Texas argued.\n        Federal judges at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     agreed with a Texas judge who had granted West's request that \n     the case be dismissed. When Nelson argued the case, one of \n     the appeals court judges asked her, ``Did West do something \n     to make you mad?'' Texas wasn't planning to publish the laws \n     commercially and didn't have an ``actual controversy'' with \n     West, the appeals judges ruled.\n       What was never disclosed to Nelson was that one of the \n     three appeals court judges, John Minor Wisdom, had been a co-\n     winner of the Devitt award four months before the panel \n     issued its ruling against Texas. West had presented him with \n     $15,000 at a ceremony in New Orleans.\n       Nelson wasn't surprised when the Supreme Court rejected her \n     petition for an appeal. But five years later--after learning \n     from the Star Tribune that a circuit judge had accepted the \n     cash award and justices had accepted expensive trips from the \n     state's opponent--Nelson said: ``That just breaks my heart. \n     That's awful.''\n                                  1990\n\n       Five days after the court rejected the Texas petition \n     (apparently without disqualification by any member), O'Connor \n     flew to Los Angeles to meet Opperman, Devitt and the others \n     at the Bel Air Hotel.\n       After the trip, Devitt wrote to O'Connor: ``We were all \n     very happy to have John [her husband] with us at Bel-Air. He \n     is a wonderful Irishman.''\n       Later, O'Connor wrote to Devitt telling him ``it was a \n     great treat'' to serve on the award committee and sent him \n     photographs of the visit to California.\n       When she filed the financial disclosure forms judges are \n     required to complete each year, she didn't report the West-\n     paid trip. When the Star Tribune inquired about the form, she \n     said through a court spokeswoman that it was an oversight and \n     that it will be corrected.\n       John Paul Stevens got his invitation to serve on the Devitt \n     committee in February. ``I feel sure you will enjoy it,'' \n     Devitt wrote to Stevens. Stevens responded by telephone, \n     according to Devitt's handwritten notes, saying he wanted to \n     meet in Florida.\n       That spring, Opperman wrote Stevens asking whether the \n     justice and his wife, Maryan, preferred golf or tennis. \n     Stevens wrote back: ``It was most thoughtful of you to \n     accommodate us. In response to your inquiry, we are both \n     interested in tennis and golf.''\n\n\n                                  1991\n\n       Stevens, his wife and other committee members met with the \n     West executives in January at the Ritz-Carlton in Naples. \n     Judge William J. Holloway Jr., who also attended, said judges \n     were provided with suite accommodations courtesy of West. A \n     receipt shows that Devitts' room charge was $700 a night.\n       Meanwhile, in Washington, the court had received a fifth \n     request to hear a case against West. Arthur D'Amario, a \n     photographer from Rhode Island, had an altercation with \n     security guards outside a rock concert at the Providence \n     Civic Center and was convicted of simple assault. When his \n     appeal was denied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, West \n     received a copy of the opinion as part of the material it \n     routinely gathers for its books.\n       D'Amario tried to stop West from publishing the opinion, \n     alleging it was libelous and would infringe on his privacy \n     rights. Lower courts had ruled that they could not enjoin \n     West from publishing an official court decision. D'Amario \n     petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n       D'Amario did not know until last month that justices \n     considering his case had been entertained by West. ``I think \n     they have a duty to notify the petitioner of a conflict of \n     interest like this whether or not they think that the \n     potential conflict affects their judgment,'' he said. ``If I \n     had known this, I might have raised an ethics complaint at \n     the time.''\n       D'Amario's petition came before the court's conference two \n     months after Stevens returned from the Florida trip. The \n     justices denied the petition on\n      March 18.\n       D'Amario's petition marks the end of the requests the court \n     has received since 1982 to hear cases against West. But the \n     trips continued.\n       In May, Devitt wrote Stevens about plans for the January \n     1992 meeting of the committee. ``We will probably meet either \n     in some Caribbean spot or on a boat trip out of some Florida \n     port.''\n\n\n                                  1992\n\n       Indeed, they did find a warm port. Stevens and his wife \n     joined the committee for a January meeting in Nassau, the \n     Bahamas, at Paradise Island Resort & Casino.\n       Another judge on the committee, Holloway of the 10th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals in Oklahoma City, reported on his \n     disclosure form that West provided ``lodging, food, \n     entertainment and miscellaneous courtesies.''\n       Devitt died March 2. Few records about the committee \n     meetings after his death are available.\n\n\n                                  1993\n\n       Antonin Scalia was the next justice to make a West-paid \n     trip.\n       In January 1993, Scalia and his wife attended a Devitt \n     committee meeting in Los Angeles, according to his financial \n     disclosure form. Scalia had written to Devitt in August 1991 \n     that he and his wife, Maureen, ``look forward to a warm \n     meeting place--though we will leave the selection to you.''\n       Scalia did not list a value for the trip. However, another \n     judge attending that session, Seventh Circuit Court Judge \n     William Bauer, listed the value of the three days of West-\n     sponsored lodging and travel at $7,700.\n\n\n                                  1994\n\n       The Star Tribune was unable to determine where the Devitt \n     committee met to make its decisions in 1994.\n\n\n                                  1995\n\n       Anthony Kennedy is the newest justice to join the Devitt \n     committee. He attended his first meeting as a panelist in \n     January at the posh Four Seasons hotel in New York City.\n       Kennedy joined the group after the court decided against \n     hearing appeals in the Texas and D'Amario cases, and no West \n     cases have come before the court since then.\n       Kennedy declined to release his correspondence concerning \n     the Devitt committee. But Richard Arnold, chief judge of the \n     Eighth Circuit, released letters he received from Opperman \n     describing arrangements for the meeting:\n       ``The committee and spouses usually eat dinner as a group. \n     If there is some restaurant you especially want to try let me \n     know,'' Opperman wrote to Arnold in October.\n       ``There will be time for the theater and museums. I would \n     like to know your interests so we can accommodate them.''\n       The official business of the committee was taken care of in \n     two three-hour meetings during the trip that lasted Jan. 22-\n     25, Arnold said.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record, ``Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates under title III of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 Concerning \nGifts.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRegulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States Under Title \n         III of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 Concerning Gifts\n\n       Authority: Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, \n     Sec. Sec. 301 and 303, 103 Stat. 1716, 1745-1747 (1989), as \n     amended by Pub. L. No. 101-280, amending 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7351 \n     and adding new Sec. 7353 to 5 U.S.C. These regulations are \n     promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     under the authorities of 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7351(c), \n     7353(b)(1) and (d)(1)(C).\n       Sec. 1.  Purpose and Scope.\n       (a) These regulations implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7351 and \n     7353, which prohibit the giving, solicitation, or acceptance \n     of certain gifts by \n\n[[Page S 10854]]\n     officers and employees of the judicial branch and provide for the \n     establishment of such reasonable exceptions to those \n     prohibitions as the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     finds appropriate.\n       (b) Nothing in these regulations alters any other standards \n     or Codes of Conduct adopted by the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States.\n       (c) Any violation of any provision of these regulations \n     will make the officer or employee involved subject to \n     appropriate disciplinary action.\n       Sec. 2.  Definition of ``Judicial Officer or Employee.''\n       In these regulations, a ``judicial officer or employee'' \n     means a United States circuit judge, district judge, judge of \n     the Court of International Trade, judge of the Court of \n     Federal Claims, judge and special trial judge of the Tax \n     Court, judge of the Court of Veterans Appeals, bankruptcy \n     judge, magistrate judge, commissioner of the Sentencing \n     Commission, and any employee of the judicial branch other \n     than an employee of the Supreme Court of the United States or \n     the Federal Judicial Center.\n       Sec. 3.  Definition of ``Gift.''\n       ``Gift'' means any gratuity, entertainment, forbearance, \n     bequest, favor, the gratuitous element of a loan, or other \n     similar item having monetary value but does not include: (a) \n     modest items of food and refreshments, such as soft drinks, \n     coffee and donuts, offered for present consumption other than \n     as part of a meal; (b) greeting cards and items with little \n     intrinsic value, such as\n      plaques, certificates, and trophies, which are intended \n     solely for presentation; (c) rewards and prizes given to \n     competitors in contents or events, including random \n     drawings, that are open to the public.\n       Sec. 4. Solicitation of Gifts by a Judicial Officer or \n     Employee.\n       (a) A judicial officer or employee shall not solicit a gift \n     from any person who is seeking official action from or doing \n     business with the courts (or other employing entity), or from \n     any other person whose interests may be substantially \n     affected by the performance or nonperformance of the judicial \n     officer or employee's official duties, including in the case \n     of a judge any person who has come or is likely to come \n     before the judge.\n       (b) A judicial officer or employee shall not solicit a \n     contribution from another officer or employee for a gift to \n     an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an \n     official superior, or accept a gift from an officer or \n     employee receiving less pay than himself or herself. This \n     paragraph does not prohibit a judicial officer or employee \n     from collecting voluntary contributions for a gift, or making \n     a voluntary gift, to a official superior for a special \n     occasion such as marriage, anniversary, birthday, retirement, \n     illness, or under other circumstances or ordinary social \n     hospitality.\n       Sec. 5. Acceptance of Gifts by a Judicial Officer or \n     Employee, Exceptions.\n       A judicial officer or employee shall not accept a gift from \n     anyone except for--\n       (a) a gift incident to a public testimonial, books, tapes, \n     and other resource materials supplied by publishers on a \n     complimentary basis for official use, or an invitation to the \n     officer or employee and a family member to attend a bar-\n     related function or an activity devoted to the improvement of \n     the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice;\n       (b) a gift incident to the business, profession or other \n     separate activity of a spouse or other family member of an \n     officer or employee residing in the officer's or employee's \n     household, including gifts for the use of both the spouse or \n     other family member and the officer or employee (as spouse or \n     family member), provided the gift could not reasonably be \n     perceived as intended to influence the officer or employee in \n     the performance of\n      official duties or to have been offered or enhanced because \n     of the judicial employee's official position;\n       (c) ordinary social hospitality;\n       (d) a gift from a relative or friend, for a special \n     occasion, such as a wedding, anniversary or birthday, if the \n     gift is fairly commensurate with the occasion and the \n     relationship;\n       (e) a gift from a relative or close personal friend whose \n     appearance or interest in a case would in any event require \n     that the officer or employee take no official action with \n     respect to the case;\n       (f) a loan from a lending institution in the regular course \n     of business on the same terms generally available to persons \n     who are not officers or employees;\n       (g) a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms \n     and based on the same criteria applied to other applicants; \n     or\n       (h) in the case of a judicial officer or employee other \n     than a judge or a member of a judge's personal staff, a gift \n     (other than cash or investment interests) having an aggregate \n     market value of $50 or less per occasion, provided that the \n     aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any \n     one person under the authority of this subsection shall not \n     exceed $100 in a calendar year;\n       (i) any other gift only if:\n       (1) the donor has not sought and is not seeking to do \n     business with the court or other entity served by the \n     judicial officer or employee; or\n       (2) in the case of a judge, the donor is not a party or \n     other person who has come or is likely to come before the \n     judge or whose interests may be substantially affected by the \n     performance or nonperformance of his or her official duties; \n     or\n       (3) in the case of any other judicial officer or employee, \n     the donor is not a party or other person who has had or is \n     likely to have any interest in the performance of the \n     officer's or employee's official duties.\n       Sec. 6. Additional Limitations.\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5, no gift may be \n     received by a judicial officer or employee in return for \n     being influenced in the performance of an official act or in \n     violation of any statute or regulation, nor may a judicial \n     officer or employee accept gifts from the same or different \n     sources on a basis so frequent that a reasonable person would \n     be led to believe that the public office is being used for \n     private gain.\n       Sec. 7. Disclosure Requirements.\n       Judicial officers and employees subject to the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 and the instructions of the Financial \n     Disclosure Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United \n     States must comply with the Act and the instructions in \n     disclosing gifts.\n       Sec. 8. Advisory Opinions.\n       The Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States is authorized to render \n     advisory opinions interpreting Title III of the Ethics Reform \n     Act of 1989 (5 U.S.C. 7351 and 7353) and these regulations. \n     Any person covered by the Act and these regulations may \n     request an advisory opinion by writing to the Chairman of the \n     Committee on Codes of Conduct, in care of the Administrative \n     Office of the United States Courts, Washington, D.C. 20544.\n       Sec. 9. Disposition of Prohibited Gifts.\n       (a) A judicial officer or employee who has received a gift \n     that cannot be accepted under these regulations should return \n     any tangible item to the donor, except that a perishable item \n     may be given to an appropriate charity, shared within the \n     recipient's office, or destroyed.\n       (b) A judicial agency may authorize disposition or return \n     of gifts at Government expense.\n\n\n                               commentary\n\n       All officers and employees of the judicial branch hold \n     appointive positions. Title III of the Act thus applies to \n     all officers and employees of the judicial branch. However, \n     the Judicial Conference has delegated its administrative and \n     enforcement authority under the Act for officers and \n     employees of the Supreme Court of the United States to the \n     Chief Justice of the United States and for employees of the \n     Federal Judicial Center to its Board. For this reason, the \n     definition of ``judicial officer or employee'' does not \n     include every judicial officer or employee whose conduct is \n     governed by Title III. For purposes of Title III and\n      these regulations, employees of the Tax Court and the Court \n     of Veterans Appeals are employees of the judicial branch.\n       These regulations do not repeal the gift provisions of the \n     Codes of Conduct heretoforce promulgated by the Judicial \n     Conference. The scope of the gift provisions of the Codes \n     exceeds that of these regulations and the statute, however, \n     in that they impose certain responsibilities on an officer or \n     employee with respect to the receipt of gifts by members of \n     the officer's or employee's family residing in his or her \n     household.\n       Section 5 of these regulations is based upon Canon 5C(4) of \n     the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.\n       Reimbursement or direct payment of travel expenses, \n     including the cost of transportation, lodging, and meals, may \n     be a gift and, if so, its acceptance is governed by these \n     regulations. A judge or employee may receive as a gift travel \n     expense reimbursement for the judge or employee and one \n     relative incident to the judge's attendance at a bar-related \n     function or at an activity devoted to the improvement of the \n     law, the legal system, or the administration of justice. A \n     report of the payment of travel expenses as a gift or \n     otherwise may be required on the Financial Disclosure Report.\n       A judge covered by the Judicial Councils Reform and \n     Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 (28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 332(d)(1), 372(c)) who violates these regulations \n     shall be subject to discipline as provided in that Act. Any \n     other judicial officer or employee who violates these \n     regulations shall be subject to discipline in accordance with \n     existing customary practices.\n\n\n                                 Notes\n\n       1. The ``Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States Under Title III of the Ethics Reform Act of \n     1989 Concerning Gifts'' were adopted on May 18, 1990, by the \n     Judicial Conference, through its Executive Committee.\n       2. On August 15, 1990, the Judicial Conference, through its \n     Executive Committee, amended these regulations to implement \n     the prohibition against gifts to superiors as required by the \n     Ethics Reform Act of 1989, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7351.\n       3. At its March 1991 session, the Judicial Conference \n     amended these regulations to include procedures for \n     requesting advisory opinions from the Committee on Codes of \n     Conduct interpreting Title III and these regulations.\n       4. These regulations were amended by the Judicial \n     Conference at its September 1991 session to cover the Tax \n     Court and the Sentencing Commission, exclude compensation for \n     teaching received by senior judges from the 15% cap on \n     outside earned income, and make certain minor technical \n     corrections.\n       5. The Judicial Conference amended these regulations at its \n     March 1992 session to cover judges and employees of the Court \n     of Veterans Appeals.\n     \n[[Page S 10855]]\n\n       6. At its September 1994 session, the Judicial Conference \n     renumbered these regulations and revised them to include a \n     new definition of the term ``gift;'' a new section 4(a) \n     prohibiting the solicitation of gifts; revised sections 4(b), \n     5(b), and 6 incorporating general limitations on the \n     acceptance of gifts; a new section 5(h) permitting most \n     employees to accept gifts of minimal value; and a new section \n     9 regarding the return or disposal of gifts that may not \n     properly be accepted.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Stevens, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1879.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the substitute amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n                   ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, on behalf \n     of the Senate, may accept a gift if the gift does not involve \n     any duty, burden, or condition, or is not made dependent upon \n     some future performance by the United States. The Committee \n     on Rules and Administration is authorized to promulgate \n     regulations to carry out this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1879) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, the next item on the agenda, I believe, is \nthe so-called Rockefeller amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. I have been advised that Senator Rockefeller will not offer \nthat amendment. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nand the time assigned to it be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1880\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] is recognized to offer an amendment on which \nthere shall be 1 hour of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President and my colleagues, many of whom I know have travel \nplans, I think we have now come to a very good, solid agreement so I do \nnot think we will need an hour for debate. I think we can do this in \njust a few minutes.\n  The amendment that I am sending to the desk makes a great deal of \nsense. What we are going to do in this amendment is we will have--this \ngoes back to a debate we had just about an hour ago in this Chamber.\n  Anything under $10 is de minimis, and that does not count toward the \naggregate. Then anything above $10 counts toward what will be an \naggregate limit that Senators cannot go beyond, in terms of receiving \nmeals or any kind of gift from any lobbyist or other special interest. \nLikewise, we can keep the $50; anything over $50 cannot be accepted.\n  So, Madam President, I think we are back on the reform track. The \nconcern that some of us had about the prior amendment--and frankly, I \nsay this to my good friend from Louisiana, I think this was more just a \nmisunderstanding--we did not really see an aggregate limit and saw it \nas being very open-ended, in which case gifts could be given and gifts \ncould be received in perpetuity, as long as they were under $50. This \nmay have been an honest confusion. Now we have an amendment that brings \nus together. It sets some very reasonable standards. I know the Senator \nfrom Arizona wants to speak. I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 10856]]\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. McCain and Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1880.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike paragraph 1(a) and insert in lieu there of the \n     following:\n       ``1. (a)(1) No Member, officer, or employee of the Senate \n     shall knowingly accept a gift except as provided in this \n     rule.\n       ``(2) A Member, officer, or employee may accept a gift \n     (other than cash or cash equivalent) which the Member, \n     officer, or employee reasonably and in good faith believes to \n     have a value of less than $50, and a cumulative value from \n     one source during a calendar year of less than $100. No gift \n     with a value below $10 shall count towards the $100 annual \n     limit.'' No formal recordkeeping is required by this \n     paragraph, but a Member, officer, or employee shall make a \n     good faith effort to comply with this paragraph.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for this amendment, and it is very important. It is a very, \nvery important amendment because, basically, it aggregates. So, \ntherefore, I think my friend from Minnesota will agree with me, the \nultimate effect is we have gone from the original bill, which was a \n$20-$50 to $50 and $100 with aggregation. So there has been an \nincrease, not one that the sponsors of this legislation supported, but \nfar, far different--far, far different--from the amendment that was \nadopted which allowed someone to take 49.99 dollars' worth every day \nfrom the same person. Now that can happen twice.\n  I think it strengthens the bill dramatically, and I appreciate the \nfact that the Senator from Minnesota uses his amendment for this, \nbecause it makes a significant change in this bill as to how it would \nhave looked with the passage of the Lott amendment. I want to thank the \nSenator from Minnesota for that. I am glad it is going to be accepted \non both sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator \nfrom Michigan needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me congratulate the Senator from \nMinnesota and all the others who have worked on this amendment. Those \nof us who opposed the Lott amendment saw two problems with that \namendment. First, was the limit of $50 was too high. We preferred the \nexecutive limit branch of $20.\n  The second problem with the Lott amendment that we saw was that it \nallowed unlimited gifts under $50, because under $50 did not count \ntoward the aggregate. That was the second big problem that we saw with \nthe Lott amendment.\n  The Wellstone amendment cures the second problem, and I want to thank \nthe Senator from Mississippi and others who have worked on this matter. \nWe have tried to work through most of the problems, and we really \nsucceeded. We did a lot of good work in the last few days. We solved \nalmost all the problems--not quite all--and we created a few for \nourselves as well. But nonetheless, I think this represents significant \nprogress.\n  I want to, again, thank the Senator from Minnesota--the Senator from \nArizona has worked so, so hard on this whole bill--for improving the \nLott amendment in this way.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin needs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am not new to the legislative \nprocess. I am new to the Senate. I have been a legislative officer for \n13 years. I have gotten used to the ups and downs. I never thought I \nwould experience a situation where we lost and then realize we actually \nwon. I just went through that.\n  I was very disappointed in the last vote because of the reasons I \nstated. The original McConnell suggested amendment would have allowed \nup to $100 a day from the same source. So we came up with a figure \npotential of $36,500. Senator McConnell did reverse his position on \nthat and cosponsored the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I assume the Senator is familiar with \nthe legislative process around here. We often begin for purposes of \nnegotiation. I will say, continuing to meet on the first product is not \ninconsistent with the spirit of bipartisanship, with which we have come \nto conclusion.\n  We have a good bill everybody can feel proud to have participated in. \nI think we proceeded with the best sense of bipartisanship. As Senator \nByrd indicated yesterday, it seems to me that we need a little bit more \nof that around here. I think it would be good for all of us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My purpose in rising is to indicate how pleased I am in \nhow the bipartisan process has worked its way. I merely want to be \nclear, because there were some representations made about our proposal \nabout an hour ago that were just plain wrong. I want to make sure the \nRecord is clear.\n  We have now reached agreement in this body on aggregation, that there \nshould be an aggregated total of $100. I would have preferred $50. In \nfact, I would have preferred zero, as we have in Wisconsin.\n  The key change now achieved, the only real exception to that, is the \namount under $10 is not counted. That is a huge difference between not \ncounting everything under $50, at least back in my home State. It would \nbe nearly impossible for someone to gain in this system, to have to run \naround and get a gift for under $10.\n  Let me say, I do not believe anybody in this body would ever do \nanything like that or has done anything like that. I just think the \nAmerican people want to see a set of rules that they can look at and \nsay on their face, guaranteed, this will not happen.\n  I am very pleased. I want to thank the Senator from Mississippi, and \nothers, as well as, of course, Senator Wellstone for coming to this \nconclusion. I believe it does bring us at least 90 percent of the way \ntoward the ultimate reform that ought to occur.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to point out the Senator from Kentucky has been an \nactive participant in all the negotiations. We appreciate his efforts \nand comity and accommodations. He, and others mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, deserves great credit for showing a spirit of \ncompromise. We know how strongly held his views are.\n  There is no doubt a week ago, I say to my friends, no one believed we \nwould be where we are today. It took a great deal of compromise on the \npart of the original sponsors of the bill and also on the part of the \nSenator from Kentucky, as well as others and, of course, the great \nfacilitator, the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I hope the record is clear that this was a bipartisan effort, \nalthough it is still fraught with a significant amount of controversy.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my understanding is we have strong \nsupport. We are just going to voice vote this. I believe that the vote \non the individual gifts was a mistaken vote, because we did not have \nthe aggregate limit. I think that was a loophole we did not want to \nhave.\n  We have come together now. That is what matters. I thank Senator \nMcCain. It has been really fascinating working with the Senator from \nArizona, and that is the way I describe it. It has been an experience I \nwill write about in my journal. I appreciate working with him.\n  I thank Senator Levin, who perhaps has the most knowledge about these \nissues on reform and has been at this as long as anybody in the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg for his fine work, and certainly my \ncolleague from Wisconsin. I love having him as a colleague in the \nneighboring State of Wisconsin. Also, Senator Breaux, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Lott, the majority leader.\n  We have now come together. We are ready to vote on this. I am very \nproud \n\n[[Page S 10857]]\nof what I think is a reform bill that is going to make a real \ndifference.\n  I yield the floor and hope we move to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did the Senator yield back the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we yield back the remainder of our time on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1880) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized to offer an amendment, on which there will be 35 minutes \nfor debate.\n  Mr. DOLE. I withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I think it is very important that \neveryone recognize the significance of what we in the Senate are doing \nby reforming the rules by which Members of the Senate may accept gifts. \nI strongly support a fair and workable gift reform bill and hope very \nmuch that the House of Representatives will see fit to swiftly pass \nsimilar legislation.\n  The Senate need not and will not wait for the House of \nRepresentatives to act. We, upon passing this bill, will pass a Senate \nresolution amending the rules of the Senate to reflect the new gift \nprovisions. What I want to touch on very briefly is the significance of \namending the Senate rules. The amending of our rules represents a \nsignificant act. While some have suggested that we must and can only \nenact legislation to achieve reform, and while I intend to support such \nlegislation, the fact is that we in the Senate will have achieved real \ngift reform when we pass a resolution amending our rules. The rules of \nthe Senate, and of the House of Representatives, are full legal \nauthorities promulgated under the express grant of power of article I, \nsection 5 of the U.S. Constitution. Because we are acting from a direct \ngrant of constitutional authority, these rules are for all intents and \npurposes ``laws.''\n  I emphasize this point because while the great weight of \nconstitutional authority has long endorsed the significance, the power, \nand the role as law of the rules of the Senate and the House, a few \nrecent court decisions have seemed to go against this overwhelming \nweight of authority. But no aberrational decisions of the lower courts \nshould change in any way the fact that by amending the rules of the \nSenate we are acting under our constitutional grant of authority and we \nare taking a significant step having the full force and effect of law.\n  Madam President, I am pleased that this legislation is before us \ntoday, and I support its passage.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, recent polls have shown that public \napproval of Congress is dismally low. The American people have tired of \nwhat they perceive as business as usual in Washington. A politician has \nceased to be a word to describe a political leader, but instead it \nembodies a perception of Members of Congress who pander to special \ninterest and are steeped in corruption. It saddens me to think that the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world and the very bedrock of our \ndemocracy is held in such ill repute. While I do not think gifts \nnecessarily translate into influence peddling by special interests, we \nneed to avoid all appearances of impropriety if we are serious about \nregaining the public trust.\n  Our business as legislators is invalid and inconsequential if we \ncannot command the respect of the people we serve. The Lobbying \nDisclosure Act of 1995 and the Senate gift rule reforms will not wholly \nrestore the public's confidence in the institution in which we serve, \nbut I believe they take significant steps in the right direction. The \nstatus quo is not sufficient, and I am encouraged by the bipartisan \nsupport for these measures. I have adopted a gift ban for myself, and I \nwelcome the extension of a similar policy to the entire Senate.\n  The time has come for the reforms proposed in these two pieces of \nlegislation. We must be guided by the premise that the public's trust \nand confidence are more important than anything else. This bill \neliminates many appearances of impropriety and it enables us to make \nstrides at restoring the people's faith in democracy.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, there is no question that we need gift and \nlobbying reform. I believe every Member of the Senate agrees on that \npoint.\n  But let us not fool ourselves. The impact of any gift reform bill we \nadopt--both substantively and in terms of public perception--will be \nminimal. I say this because of my firm conviction that the need for \ngift reform is utterly dwarfed by the need to clean up our campaign \nfinance system. If we ban gifts without adopting campaign finance \nreform, a senator would not be allowed to accept a $51 dinner from an \nindividual, but during the dinner that individual could hand the \nSenator a check for $1,000. I hope that once we complete this debate, \nwe will go on to campaign finance and adopt real reform for the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope that in adopting gift reform legislation we don't become so \nhidebound by rules and regulations that it becomes difficult to do our \njobs. In going about their every-day business, Senators should not \nconstantly be asking ethics attorneys to decipher what is and what is \nnot allowed. Careers should not rise or fall on the answers to a never-\nending parade of nit-picking questions. That would be unfortunate and \nunfair.\n  Instead of engaging in a picayune debate over a suffocating code of \nconduct, I wish we could have a full-blown discussion about the concept \nof personal responsibility in the Senate and in society at-large. This \nis a principle that unfortunately has eroded over the years, in part \ndue to the growth of rules and ethics codes governing every aspects of \nour lives. These rules are all well-intentioned, and many of them are \nneeded. But they have had the unintended consequence of allowing us to \npass the buck when we face moral dilemmas large and small. Instead of \nconsulting our consciences, we call the ethics officer. Instead of \ntaking responsibility for our actions and their results, we hide behind \nthe opinions of attorneys and experts.\n  I believe that individual Senators know how to judge right from wrong \nin their dealings with lobbyists and others. I believe Senators should \nbe accountable to their consciences and to their constituents--not to a \ncode of rules and regulations.\n  My pledge has always been that I do nothing in my conduct as a \nSenator that I cannot explain to the people of Connecticut. I think \nthat is a rigorous, fair and accountable standard to which we should \nall adhere.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, as I stated when the Senate acted on gift \nban legislation last year, we have ventured into the treacherous shoals \nof self-regulation.\n  I am supporting the bill, as indeed I have always supported reforms \nthat will benefit the Senate as an institution. But I support this bill \nwith somewhat muted enthusiasm.\n  In passing this bill, we are responding once again to the public's \nperception of the political process and the public's presumption of \nwhat our standards and motives may be.\n  These perceptions and presumptions must be dealt with, to be sure, \nbut I for one find them to be often inaccurate and frequently \ndemeaning. And the proposed remedies usually are unduly intrusive.\n  We should be under no illusion, I believe, that public perceptions, \namplified by media attention, can be neutralized or satisfied by \nlegislative fiat.\n  In the final analysis, the only way to change or disprove public \nperceptions and presumptions is for each of us to demonstrate integrity \nin all our actions.\n  Guidelines and rules are helpful, to be sure. But it seems to me that \nthe best guidelines are the simplest.\n  I am troubled by the fact that the legislation we have passed does \nnot meet the test of simplicity. It includes 23 exceptions and \nexemptions, covering ten pages of the bill, each of which is subject to \nexpanded interpretation and challenge.\n  I regret, also, that the bill imposes rigid dollar limits, which \nwhile more reasonable than originally proposed, still seem unduly \nrestrictive. I was pleased to support the Lott amendment raising the \nceiling on aggregated giving, but the subsequently adopted threshold \nfor aggregating seems unreasonably low. \n\n[[Page S 10858]]\n\n  The legislation of course does have redeeming features. One of the \nmost significant, to my mind, is the prohibition on acceptance of \nelaborate and luxurious recreational trips at lobbyists' expense.\n  And the basic intent of the legislation certainly is praiseworthy, \nnamely to remove extraneous and improper influence, when it does occur, \nfrom the legislative process.\n  Finally, I would applaud the fine sense of compromise that prevailed \nin winning approval of the legislation without time consuming and \nacrimonious debate. For that, the Senate and the Nation are better off.\n                vote on amendment no. 1872, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the substitute amendment \noffered by Senator McCain, No. 1872.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before that, I am just going to spend 30 \nseconds to clarify a point on the request of Senator Johnston, if I \nhave time. He has asked a question about hospitality at an embassy, at \na chancellery. I wanted to assure him and the body, at his request, \nthat the personal hospitality exception is intended to cover such \nhospitality at embassies and chancelleries.\n  Madam President, I want to pay particular tribute to Linda Gustitus \nand Peter Levine of my staff.\n  Night after night, week after week, month after month, they \nsuccessfully pulled ideas into workable solutions in both lobby reform \nand gift reform. What a week of political reform these two great \nstaffers helped produce. How much this Senate and this Nation and I \npersonally owe them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McCain \namendment No. 1872.\n  The amendment (No. 1872), as modified, as amended, was agreed to.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair announces that S. 1061 is \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, the American people sent us a message last \nNovember. A lot of us might prefer to think that message was directed \nto the executive branch alone. But part of that message was directed to \nCongress. The American people want a Congress accountable to them, and \nthem alone. The American people want us to rein in our appetites and to \ntake the steps necessary to correct the perception that Congress \nsuffers from an arrogance that shields it from the dramatic changes \nsweeping this country.\n  I am pleased that we have responded, and I am pleased that we have \ndone so in a bipartisan manner. The very first legislation passed in \nthis Congress was a requirement that Congress would henceforth live \nunder the same laws that apply to everyone else. We have begun the hard \ntask of living under a balanced budget just like most Americans do \nevery day. Several days ago, we passed the next installment on reform \nlegislation, legislation which reformed the way lobbyists do business \nin our Nation's Capital.\n  And, today, we have passed the next congressional reform package, one \nwhich directly confronts the concerns many Americans might have about \nhow we conduct our business. Now, I think in most cases the problem of \ngifts to Members is one of perception. But I think respect for the \ninstitution of the Senate\n demands that we take the extra steps necessary to ensure that \nperceptions do not become reality. We have done that today.\n\n  I have in the past made clear that if it was necessary I would be \nprepared to eliminate all gifts--I do not go out to dinner with \nlobbyists. But I do not think anyone around here has cornered the \nmarket on integrity and the bipartisan package before us is a good \nbalance of the need for reform and the need for common sense.\n  We certainly do not intend to place Members in the awkward position \nof refusing a gift of nominal value when addressing, say, the local \nKiwanis Club, and situations like these are addressed in a reasonable \nway by this bipartisan package. If these reforms turn out to be \ninsufficient, then we will tighten them up further.\n  I want to pay tribute to those on both sides of the aisle who worked \nso hard to resolve very real differences--Senators McCain and Levin, in \nparticular, who worked so hard to resolve these differences.\n  I would like to thank Senator Lott for heading up a bipartisan task \nforce that produced this gift reform package. He and his assistant, \nAlison Carroll, did a superb job. And, finally, I would like to thank \nSenator McConnell, who was ably assisted by Melissa Patack, \n\n[[Page S 10859]]\nfor his leadership on yet another tough issue.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10858-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   PRESIDING OFFICER NOT BOUND BY PRECEDENCE ON APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I might say to all Senators that the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the State Department revitalization bill \nat 2 p.m. on Monday.\n  Any rollcall votes will not occur prior to 6 p.m on Monday.\n  I might also say that somebody who wants to debate only the State \nDepartment bill can do so this afternoon if they cannot be here Monday. \nIt might be a good opportunity for opening statements which they want \nto make, or some statement about some amendment and a discussion about \none of their amendments.\n  I have also visited with both the minority Democratic whip and the \nDemocratic leader. And I think we should put all Senators on notice \nthat there probably will be a Saturday session a week from tomorrow.\n  We have a lot to do. We would like get out of here as quickly as we \ncan in August. We are not going to make the August 4 recess, but \nbeginning maybe sometime later in August.\n  That is what we will know for certain on Monday. But I want to put \nSenators on notice that there could be a Saturday session on August 5. \nSo all Senators should be on notice.\n  It is my hope that we will be on with the welfare reform maybe late \nFriday night and, if we should get bogged down on the State Department \nrevitalization bill and unable to get cloture on the bill itself, if it \nseems likely we will not get cloture on the second, then I think we \nwould move to the DOD authorization bill where I understand that could \nbe finished in perhaps 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  Upon completion of that, it would be my intention to try to work \nout--in fact, before we complete--if we can work out some dual-track \nprocedure, which we have done in the past, where we consider \nappropriations bills after a certain time each day because the \nappropriators are very anxious that we complete at least six \nappropriations bills before we start the recess. We have completed two. \nI understand one conference has been completed on the legislative \nappropriations. We will take up the conference report next week.\n  Energy and water is available now. But there are some problems we are \ntrying to work out. There may be as many as three others before Tuesday \nor Wednesday of next week.\n  So I just say to my colleagues that on Monday there will be no votes \nuntil 6 p.m., but I assume there will be votes at 6 p.m., and then we \nare in for probably long nights and maybe a Saturday session next week. \nAnd we will be in all of the following week.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority \nleader for giving us the advance notice so that we can make \narrangements for Saturday, August 5, and expect to be here to debate \nand vote on Saturday. Then we would be back at 9 o'clock probably on \nMonday, and continue our effort, whether it is welfare reform or \nwhatever the distinguished majority leader wishes to bring up.\n  I thank him for giving us this advanced warning. I think all have \nexpected that Saturday, August 5, would be used. And I think it is a \nwise use of time by letting us out tomorrow and then coming back.\n  So I thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, we are now in the period of morning business in which \neach Senator has 5 minutes. Is that is correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10859-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10859-S10860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOBBYING REFORM AND GIFT BAN\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as we finish up on the important piece of \nlegislation, the lobbying reform and the gift ban, I want to take a \nminute to thank the many people who worked to produce a significant \nstep toward restoring confidence in this institution.\n  And it clearly would not have been possible without the leadership of \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  I want to thank him for placing his confidence in me to chair the \nworking group--a task which I shared equally with my cochair Senator \nLevin, and whom I want to extend a special thanks, along with his most \ncapable staff. Our job was made infinitely more easy by the \nconsiderable amount of hard work, time, and effort the working group \nand their staffs dedicated to making this process work. That group \ninclude Senators Wellstone, Feingold, Lautenberg, Rockefeller, Breaux, \nDodd, and Reid. And I offer my thanks and congratulations for a job \nwell done to them and their staffs.\n  I also want to commend my colleague, the Majority Whip Trent Lott, \nwhose leadership and hard-working staff helped bring cooperation and \nclosure to this issue. Because of the hard work of all of these people, \nI think we now have a piece of legislation that all who participated in \ncan be proud of and will have a stake in.\n  Before I close, I do want to say that this reform is a step in--not \nan end to--the process of reforming Congress and of making this an \ninstitution that inspires confidence and pride from all Americans.\n  Tickets to a concern, a ball game, or an occasional lunch or dinner \nraise the \n\n[[Page S 10860]]\neyebrows of our constituents, and lower our esteem in their eyes. And \nthat is inexcusable. But, the true role and influence of special \ninterests on Congress is not determined by these gifts. Rather, the \ntrue role and influence of special interests on Congress lies with the \nfinancial contributions that Members of Congress receive for their \ncampaigns.\n  If we use our successes on lobbying reform and the gift ban as a \nsubstitute for campaign reform, then we will have failed.\n  The practice of raising unlimited amounts of money through \nfundraisers hosted by corporations and lobbyists, distinguishes us from \nthe executive branch. That branch of Government could never justify \nsuch an act, and neither should we.\n  Yet, the majority of Members of this body participate in the never-\nending ritual of chasing after special interest money. And despite our \nsuccess on lobbying reform, despite our success on gift ban, this money \nchase is the true impediment to the independence of our elected \nofficials.\n The effort to restrict the gifts a Member may or may not receive is \nvital but incomplete. With or without gift reform, Congress will \ncontinue to be diminished in the eyes of the public until we pass \ncomprehensive campaign reform.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to let our efforts on \ngift and lobbying reform be a hollow gesture but, rather, the \npredecessor to comprehensive reform and to fully securing the respect \nand trust of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that I might proceed for 2 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10859-7", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BABY PEREGRINE FALCON AT THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, a week ago last Tuesday, July 18, the \nWashington Post had a very exciting article about the return of the \nperegrine falcons to the Washington area and the birth of a male \nperegrine falcon baby chick at 75 feet high on a window ledge of the \nNational Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Northeast Washington.\n  This is exciting news for those of us interested in the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the return of some of these species that have been so \nendangered in our society.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the things that led to the near demise of \nthe peregrine falcon was the use of DDT and other pesticides which have \nnow been banned. Because of the prevalence of those pesticides, \nparticularly DDT, there were only 100 known pairs of peregrine falcons \nleft east of the Mississippi, but they are making their comeback. I \nwish to pay tribute not only to the Endangered Species Act, not only to \nour action in banning DDT, but the work of other areas such as the \nWorld Center for Birds of Prey which is located in Boise, ID, where \nraptors such as the peregrine falcon are brought together and the \nbreeding takes place, and then they are put out in various parts of our \ncountry to live in the natural environment.\n  So this is exciting news. There are plenty of people who trash the \nEndangered Species Act, but I think it is important to bring to the \nattention of the public where that act has been successful as in this \ninstance of the return of the peregrine falcon.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Missouri for permitting me \nto go ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post entitled ``And Baby Falcon Makes Three'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 1995]\n\n And Baby Falcon Makes Three--Finding D.C. to Their Liking, Peregrine \n                      Pair Produce a Rare Addition\n\n                            (By D'Vera Cohn)\n\n       Washington may have no skyscrapers, but now it's got \n     something else that is a symbol of a big city: A rare \n     peregrine falcon hatched here this year, the first in memory.\n  It's a boy!\n       Few creatures inspire the awe that peregrines do. They are \n     the world's fastest birds, zooming for prey at speeds up to \n     200 miles an hour. Kings used the hooded falcons for hunting. \n     And they are still so scarce, after pesticides nearly wiped \n     them out, that only 100 known pairs live east of the \n     Mississippi River.\n       Peregrines are making a comeback in some cities, but they'd \n     never been known to produce young in the District. They love \n     heights--in the wild they nest on cliffs. Could it be that \n     Washington's stubby skyline didn't present the right \n     circumstances for romance?\n       Now, it seems, height isn't everything.\n       A pair of peregrines took up residence this spring on the \n     ledge of a small round window about 75 feet up the National \n     Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, at Fourth Street and \n     Michigan Avenue NE. In April, church workers spotted a white \n     downy chick.\n       ``The baby in the nest would come to the edge and squawk,'' \n     said Jan Bloom, secretary to the rector. One of the parents \n     ``would get breakfast and come back. . . . We'd see them on \n     the roof pecking at what they'd caught.''\n       Peregrines, the size of large crows, are killing machines. \n     They knock down smaller birds with their strong claws, then \n     finish them off with a bite to the nape.\n       The people at the shrine didn't give away their secret. But \n     Washington's birding world had an inkling something was going \n     on, somewhere.\n       For the last two winters, a pair of peregrines had been \n     seen killing pigeons at a church on Thomas Circle in \n     Northwest Washington. This year, one began giving food to the \n     other, the avian equivalent of a bachelor offering a diamond \n     engagement ring. Then, as spring arrived, they vanished.\n       Every rumor about where they'd gone triggered a search. A \n     brood seen atop a downtown building turned out to be \n     kestrels. Birders checked Washington National Cathedral, \n     assuming they must be in a tall place nearby. Nothing.\n       Then, one day in June, Deborah Ozga spotted three birds \n     flying around the National Shrine. She heard the pulsing \n     scream of a bird of prey. Thinking the three were hawks, she \n     returned with binoculars and a bird book.\n       Ozga, who heads the chemistry and physics libraries at \n     Catholic University next to the church, was stunned when she \n     realized what had flown into the neighborhood.\n       ``I knew that to see them was something pretty special,'' \n     she said. ``This book I was reading said they can see a mouse \n     from a mile and a half away.''\n       She reached Erika Wilson, who tapes the weekly ``Voice of \n     the Naturalist'' phone report that local birders rely on for \n     good sightings.\n       ``As soon as she convinced me she had peregrines, I jumped \n     in my car and went out there,'' Wilson said. ``I think this \n     is so neat!''\n       One reason for her joy is that Washington seemed the \n     exception among big cities in not having baby peregrine.\n       Thanks to a captive breeding program that began two decades \n     ago, the species is recovering so well that federal officials \n     began the process this month of removing the peregrine falcon \n     from the endangered list.\n       There's been a breeding pair in Baltimore since the late \n     1970s, nesting on a skyscraper. New York City has more than a \n     half-dozen pairs. Even some smaller cities such as Roanoke \n     have them.\n       The Chesapeake region--from the Blue Ridge to the bay--has \n     more than two dozen peregrine pairs, according to Craig \n     Koppie, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     in Annapolis.\n       When he went out to see the birds at the National Shrine \n     last week, Koppie spotted the young falcon catching insects. \n     Then he watched it dive across Michigan Avenue--swooping \n     through morning rush-hour traffic--going after a smaller \n     bird. (Best viewing is in the morning, especially in hot \n     weather.)\n       All the evidence isn't in, but Koppie believes that the \n     parents are the Thomas Circle peregrines. Despite their name, \n     which means ``wanderer,'' peregrines that live in this region \n     often stay in a territory encompassing a few miles.\n       Saturday, Koppie used a pigeon lure to trap the young \n     falcon in a net. He banded it for identification, so \n     scientists can monitor how it's doing. He checked it for \n     parasites and pronounced it in good health.\n       Then, as mother falcon watched, he released the young bird \n     into the air.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question that this body will soon address in a \nformal sense is a question that has been titled welfare reform.\n  In our debate, we will hear a lot about numbers. We will hear about \nhow much the system costs, about the share of the Nation's output that \nit occupies. But this debate, properly understood, is not a debate \nabout numbers. It is a \n\n[[Page S 10861]]\ndebate about lives, the lives of people who are trapped in the web of \nthe Washington-knows-best, one-size-fits-all welfare system, the lives \nof the people who are welfare's casualties.\n  Today, we have a welfare system that was designed with the best of \nintentions but has given to the poor the worst of all possible worlds, \na world of despair where no future is seen, a world of no opportunity \nwhere advancement is virtually inconceivable, a world of no family, no \nsupport, no nurturing or care from loved ones, a world in which people \nare raised by welfare and fed through food stamps but they are starved \nof nurture and they are deprived of hope. The results of this kind of \nsystem are very frequently tragic.\n  It is my intention in the days and weeks to come to highlight this \nhuman side of the welfare system. I wish to share some situations that \ntell us the real tragedy of welfare. Some of the cases are of children \nwho have been killed or neglected. Some are testimonies of people who \nare trapped in the system. But all of the stories are real, all have \nbeen documented in the mainstream press, and they are all stories which \nwe should remember as we debate the statistics and the numerics of \nwelfare, for we must remember the human costs of welfare.\n  For 30 years and more, we have been told that all we need to do is \nspend more money. We have been told that we would be able to solve the \nproblems we faced if we simply had enough resources. We have been told \nthat Government, particularly Washington, has all the answers. We have \nbeen told that Washington knew best how to help.\n  The facts are in. The evidence is conclusive, and it points to the \nfallacy of the argument, for today there are more people in poverty \nthan ever before. There are more children being abused and killed. \nThere is less hope and opportunity for those who are trapped.\n  I wish to share with you some case stories that illustrate this and \nthat should motivate us to change the way we address the problem of \nthose who need hope and need opportunity and who need our assistance.\n  I wish to share with you a rather shocking story today, an atrocious \nstory of Ariel Hill. Hers is the body that lies in this casket that is \nbeing lowered into the ground in this picture on my left. It is a \ntragic picture.\n  According to the reports in the Chicago Tribune, Ariel came into the \nworld on Christmas Eve of 1992, 1-month premature. She was the second \nof twin children. Her parents were 22-year-olds who had dropped out of \nhigh school and did not have jobs. Her mother had her first child as a \nteenager. Her father grew up on welfare. Ariel had three other siblings \nin diapers at the time she was born. There were three other diapered \nchildren in the family. They lived in a squalid, roach-infested, one-\nbedroom apartment in public housing, isolated from friends and \nrelatives.\n  When police entered the home, dirty clothes and scraps of food were \nstrewn about, giving the apartment the stench of decaying garbage. Both \nof the parents used drugs. The main source of income was the $900 per \nmonth in public aid checks and the food stamps they used to purchase \ntheir meals.\n  When the investigators went into the apartment, they found the \nwelfare dollars for each child listed on a scrap of paper. It is a \ntragedy when the human resource of this Nation, the future of America, \nis valued in terms of its capacity to claim welfare benefits. This was \na family trapped in a system without hope, without future, without a \nway out.\n  Ariel died on May 12, 1993, less than 6 months after she was born. \nHer body, weighing less than 7 pounds, had been malnourished and \nscalded under hot tap water. Ariel's parents were punishing her by \nrefusing to feed her, starving her 5-month-old body. This program of \npunishment finally peaked on May 11; 30 hours later she was dead.\n  According to court testimony, Ariel's mother was awakened by the \ndaughter's crying that afternoon. Ariel needed to be changed. Her \nmother was so angry at being interrupted in the afternoon that she put \nthe infant in the sink and began to burn her with hot water.\n  Police sources later told the Tribune that Ariel's mother was so \nupset because she was having difficulty keeping up with her \nresponsibilities as a mother. She had not had much sleep in the last \nfew days, the officer said, with five kids and all. As Ariel was in the \nsink under the hot water, her twin brother, Adrian, began to cry in the \nother room, and Ariel's mother left to look after Adrian, leaving the \ninfant in the hot water for approximately 5 minutes. The mother \nbelieved that Adrian was healthier because he was a better baby.\n  By the time she returned, Ariel's skin had been badly burned and was \nbeginning--well, her mother put hot butter on the wounds but did not \nseek medical attention because she did not want to deal with the \ndivision of family services. It was not until the next evening that \nAriel's mother and father noticed that Ariel was no longer breathing, \nand they called 911.\n  When Ariel was rushed to the Children's Memorial Hospital, she was \npronounced dead on arrival. According to experts, her injuries were \nlikely aggravated by her malnutrition, perhaps to the point where she \nwas unable to cry. Ariel also was found to have bruises around her eyes \nand on her forehead. One of the examiners said there was nothing to \nher, absolutely nothing to her at all.\n  According to the Tribune, at her funeral, Ariel's body was covered in \na light pink dress and bonnet. Her casket was small enough to fit in \nthe little red wagon that she was too young to play with.\n  Mr. President, in the days and the weeks ahead, there will be those \nin the Senate who will take to the floor and argue that what we need is \nto reform the current system.\n  I submit to you that unless we want tragedies like this, we need to \nreplace the current system, not reform it. We rearranged the deck \nchairs on this welfare Titanic in 1988, and the skyrocketing record of \nwelfare participation and tragedies, such as this one, indicate to us \nthat reformation is not enough. This is no time for half measures. This \nis a time to focus on those in need and to realize that Washington \nnever has had the answers and probably never will.\n  What we need to do is to move people from hopeless governmental \ndependence to hopeful economic independence, from the grasp of a \nperverse system of Government programs to the embrace of the loving and \ncaring communities and the limitless opportunities of America.\n  Our welfare system has been weighed in the balances and found \nwanting. The prisoners in the war on poverty have been the poor \nthemselves. We must revamp this system so thoroughly that reform cannot \ncharacterize the way we treat it. It has to be replaced. It has to be \nreplaced with a system that will allow for the States to have full \nfreedom to implement remedies that will reduce this problem, that will \nslow illegitimacy instead of grow illegitimacy. It has to be reformed \nin a way that will stop the incentive for additional births, \nillegitimate births, and the continuing payment of more and more for \nthose who will bring individuals into the culture with less and less \nresponsibility.\n  Our effort to save ourselves from the human tragedy that the casket \nof Ariel in this picture represents has to be a good-faith effort that \nconfesses that it is time to let the States and communities tailor \nprograms to meet the real needs of America. As I indicated earlier, \nover the next week or so, I will be talking about the welfare system \nand the fact--undeniable fact--that it is so badly broken that it is \ntragically destroying the lives of citizens of this land.\n  Welfare should be a hand up, it should be a way of moving from one \nstanding to another. It should not be a way of ensuring that an \nindividual trapped in a system stays there not just for his or her \nlife, but condemns future generations to a similar existence of tragedy \nand pain.\n  If America has a virtue, it is a virtue of opportunity, it is a \nvirtue of hope. We must make sure that the welfare revisions, the \nreplacement of this welfare system in which we will engage in the days \nahead, always includes the components of opportunity and hope, those \nwhich have been so desperately missing, those which are all too \nfrequently buried as the mistakes of welfare are dealt with under the \ncurrent system.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  \n[[Page S 10862]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, after listening to my colleague on the \nsubject of welfare reform, I hope that in the coming days we can have \nan interesting, thoughtful debate about welfare reform on the floor of \nthe Senate. Much of what he described as a remedy I would support. It \nis, I suppose, useful to describe the failure of the welfare system \nthrough the image of a casket, a symbol of a system that does not work.\n  There are many pictures that one can use to describe the current \nwelfare system. The only disagreement I have with the previous speaker \nis the notion that somehow the difficulty with this system is that it \nis administered by the Federal Government. As most of us in this \nChamber know, the current welfare system is largely administered by the \nStates and locally. There is plenty wrong with it. That's why we have \non our side of the aisle in the Senate constructed a welfare reform \nplan that I think makes a lot of sense. It is called Work First.\n  I say to all those who come to the floor to talk about welfare reform \nand the need for a crusade against teenage pregnancy and a whole series \nof other reforms that we must embrace in the Congress, that we should \nalso understand our responsibilities when the appropriations bills come \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  Yesterday, I saw the results of a bill which would cut nearly one-\nthird of the funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of \nIndian Affairs is an agency of the Federal Government that can learn a \nfew things about good administration and effective use of taxpayers' \ndollars. But as a result of where I think spending cuts have been \nproposed in some of the appropriations bills, especially with respect \nto native Americans, we will see some of the most vulnerable people in \nthis country suffer some of the largest budget cuts.\n  I can bring a picture to the floor today of a young woman from Fort \nYates, ND, who at age 3 was placed in a foster home by a caseworker who \nwas handling 150 separate cases. She went to a home which had never \nbeen previously inspected by the caseworker and, as a result of going \nto a home where alcoholism and parties were the norm, this young girl \nduring a drunken party was beaten so severely that hair was pulled out \nof her head by the roots. Her arm was broken. Her nose was broken. This \nis a 3-year-old young girl consigned to a foster home by a caseworker \nwho was handling 150 cases and could not bother or did not have the \ntime or the money or the resources to check the homes she was sticking \nyoung children in.\n  I say to somebody who wants to talk about reform in this system, to \nsomebody who believes that one caseworker ought to be able to handle \n150 cases, you are consigning the children in those cases to the kind \nof harm that occurred to this 3-year-old, physical harm from which she \nwill probably never fully recover.\n  Look into the eyes of Tamara someday and see what was visited upon \nthis young lady, because there was not enough money to hire the two, \nthree, or four caseworkers to check the houses in which they were going \nto put these kids.\n  When we talk about welfare reform, we talk about our obligations to \npeople and then say we do not have enough money for social workers to \ntake care of kids, that is not much reform, in my judgment. We say we \ncannot afford to enroll kids in Head Start, and that we cannot find \nenough money for WIC. Part of reforming this system is also to \nunderstand our obligation to kids and our obligation to some of the \nmost vulnerable people in this country.\n  I can show you an office in this country where there are stacks of \npaper on the floor this high of reported abuses against children, of \nsexual and physical abuse, that have never been investigated--not even \ninvestigated. There are reports that a 3-year-old or a 5-year-old or a \n7-year-old has been sexually abused that have not even been \ninvestigated. Why? Because they do not have people to go out and \ninvestigate.\n And so, today, a 5-year-old is probably at a home where a previous \nreport has been made of sexual violations against this child or of \nphysical abuse against this child. This child is at risk today and \nevery day because somehow there is not enough money to pay a social \nworker to go out and investigate the reports.\n\n  Any country as good as this country, that can afford to find the \nresources to have caseworkers and investigators to help protect \nchildren who are living in the grip of poverty in this country and who \nare living in the saddle of fear, and in some of the circumstances that \nI have seen and I think others have seen, has something wrong if its \npriorities do not include full protection for these children. In any \ndiscussion about reform of our welfare system and in any discussion \nabout our obligations as they relate especially to appropriations bills \nthat come to the floor, I hope will include a full discussion among \nthose of us who have different thoughts about our obligations. I hope \nto be an active participant, because I have some very strong feelings \nabout what is wrong in this country. We will find many areas of \nagreement. But to talk about reform and then deny the basic resources \nnecessary to hire caseworkers to protect the lives of children who are \ngripped by fear and poverty and live day-to-day fearing for their \nsafety is not a priority that I share. I believe the priority must be \nfor us to decide that it matters, we care, and we will do something \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, we will soon begin discussing specific proposals on \nhow to reform the Medicare system. I do not know exactly when we will \ndiscuss them. I heard the majority leader discussing the schedule a few \nmoments ago. I intend to say to him in a meeting with my colleagues \nsoon that I am not very impressed with the schedule. He has an \nenormously difficult job, and I understand that. But if you are trying \nto raise a family and work in the U.S. Senate and find that at 8, 9 \no'clock every night, you do not know whether there are going to be more \nvotes, in my judgment, there is a better way to do things. I hope we \ncan find a schedule that allows us to do our work in the Senate and \nstill participate in family life, as well. That is a subject for \nanother time and one that a number of us hope to talk to the leadership \nabout on both sides of the political aisle.\n  When we talk about the issue of Medicare in the coming days --I was \nnoticing today, on the 30th anniversary of the Medicare bill, that the \nnewspaper, USA Today, has an ad by the Republican Party in it. It says, \n``Too Young to Die.'' There is a tombstone on the ad. ``Medicare 1965-\n2002.'' It has a Medicare pledge called The Republican Pledge to Save \nMedicare. It says, ``If Clinton lets Medicare go bankrupt, you can keep \nyour existing coverage, but only for 7 years. If Clinton lets Medicare \ngo bankrupt, you can keep your own doctor for only 7 years.'' It goes \non at great length. This from a party, 97 percent of whom did not \nsupport Medicare in the first place. They always opposed Medicare. They \nfought to the death here to try and prevent a Medicare Program from \nbecoming a part of our law in this country. Now, on the 30th \nanniversary, most of them want to love it to death.\n  Thirty years later, has Medicare worked? You ask some 75-year-old \nperson who has new knees, or a new hip, or who has had cataract surgery \nand is not consigned to blindness or a wheelchair, or who has had open \nheart surgery. Ask them whether Medicare has worked and if they are \nfree from the fear of whether they will have health care when they grow \nold.\n  Ninety-seven percent of our senior citizens are covered with health \ncare coverage. I am proud of that. Before Medicare, less than half of \nthe senior citizens had access to health insurance. Now, almost all of \nthem do. Is that an accident? No, it is not. It is because people in \nthis Chamber in years past had the vision to say we ought to put \ntogether a system that frees senior citizens from the fear of when they \nreach the advancing age of lower income and more health problems, frees \nthem from the fear that they may not be able to get medical help \nbecause \n\n[[Page S 10863]]\nthey do not have the money. We put together a Medicare Program. I was \nnot here then. But I salute those who led the fight for it in the face \nof opponents that called it socialism, total socialism.\n  Well, it is not socialism that the Republicans say they now support \nMedicare. It is a Medicare Program of which I am enormously proud.\n  This country spends too little time celebrating its successes. We \nhave had a lot of successes. We spend most of our time talking about \nfailures and what is wrong. The Medicare Program is a success. I am \nproud to be a part of the political party that fought for it in the \nface of enormous opposition to create it, and I am proud to be a part \nof the party that this week celebrates its 30th birthday. Does it have \nsome problems? Yes. There are 200,000 new Americans who become eligible \nfor Medicare every single month. That is the graying of America. There \nare more elderly in America every month. Health care costs are \nincreasing for everything, including for Medicare.\n  So, there are some financial problems. But the majority party in \nCongress has, coincidentally, said in their budget plan for this \ncountry this year that they want to have a substantial cut in Medicare \nfunding that is almost equal to the cut they proposed in taxes. Now, \nthey propose that we have what is called a middle-income tax cut of \nroughly $270 or $250 billion. They propose almost an identical cut for \nthe Medicare Program. The so-called middle-income tax cut is an \ninteresting one. The only details we have of the tax cut comes from the \nHouse of Representatives. It goes like this--and it would not surprise \nanybody, I suppose--families under $30,000 a year get $120 a year in \ntax cuts; families over $200,000 a year get a tax cut of $11,200 each \nyear. It looks to me like that is kind of a ``cake and crumbs'' tax \ncut--cake to the rich, crumbs to the rest. That is not surprising. We \nhave seen that year after year from the majority party.\n  But it seems to me that if you have a program that works, that is \nsuccessful, for whom we now celebrate 30 years of success, like the \nMedicare Program, to suggest substantial cuts in Medicare funding that, \ncoincidentally, equal the proposals to cut taxes, mostly for the \nwealthy, we do not do this country any major favor.\n  It seems to me that what we ought to do is evaluate our successes and \nfind ways to strengthen them, not weaken them. There are those who say \nMedicare turns 30, but it may not live to see 37, and the Republicans \nare the ones who will save Medicare. I say: Look at the record. Who \ncreated Medicare? Who has supported Medicare? Who will nurture Medicare \nwell into the future as a safe, solid, and financially solvent program?\n  I have a piece of copy from something called Luntz Research Companies \nby the Republican pollster, Frank Luntz. It says, ``Everything You \nWanted To Know About Communicating.'' It was not sent to us. It was \nsent to the Republicans. It is about a 10-page missive on how they \nshould communicate to our country about Medicare. It says, ``Seniors \nare very pack oriented, and are very susceptible to following one very \ndominant person's lead.'' And then for page after page it says, ``You \nmust appear to be bipartisan.'' It does not say you should be. It says, \n``You must appear to be bipartisan.'' Page after page is instructing \nRepublicans how to deal with this Medicare problem. What problem?\n  The problem is they are proposing a very substantial cut in Medicare \nthat is almost exactly the same size as the tax cuts they proposed for \nthe wealthy. It is a problem because senior citizens, I think, in most \ncases, are scared to death that a program that they think is successful \nand they have relied on, that has freed them from fear of growing old \nand not having health care coverage, is about to be dismantled by some \nwho carelessly tell us their real interests. We have some around here \nwho still say that we ought not have the Medicare Program, that we \nshould go back to the ``good old days'' when half of senior citizens \nhad no health care coverage at all. They do not quite say it that way, \nbut that slips out from time to time. That is their philosophy. They \nthink Government, essentially, should not do anything.\n  Again, there are 10 pages or so of discussion about exactly how to \ntalk your way out of this situation. It says, ``For too many seniors it \nwill be the last word that ultimately sways them.'' So make sure you \nare the last person who talks to them, because that is who they will \nbelieve. You know, all of us have stories about our constituents--\nsenior citizens who we have met, and whose life is substantially \nimproved by this program of which I am very proud.\n  I recall a woman from Mandan, ND. I was at a town meeting in that \nsmall community in my home county. She stood up, and she must have been \nin her midseventies. She said, ``I have a new knee and a new hip. I had \ncataract surgery. I want to tell you, I feel like a million dollars.'' \nSomebody else in the crowd said, ``Well, maybe you cost $1 million.''\n  Not quite. These medical procedures are not that expensive. I thought \nto myself, is it not remarkable? If this woman had even come to a \nmeeting 50 years ago, she would have been there in a wheelchair and \nwould not have been able to see much because her knee was gone, her hip \nwas gone, and she had cataracts. Now, through the modern miracles of \nmedicine, she feels like a million dollars.\n  First of all, this is a remarkable case of breathtaking achievement, \nattributable to the men and women of vision in our country in the \nmedical field who produce these miracles--things that we had never \nbefore expected to be done. Then the Medicare Program provides access \nto that new treatment for America's senior citizens. It is remarkable.\n  I think most would agree that what we have done in this country in \nmedicine, generally, and for senior citizens through the Medicare \nProgram, is an extraordinary thing. We ought not decide at this point \nto weaken those kinds of things that represent successes in America.\n  I want to say again something I have said, I suppose half a dozen \ntimes, that people are tired of hearing. It is important. We have so \nembraced in this country talk about failure and talk about what does \nnot work and what is wrong and scandal, that we just are not willing to \ntalk about success.\n  It is why, for days, I have talked during the regulatory reform \ndebate about air and water. The air and the water in this country is \ncleaner than it was 20 years ago. We now use twice as much energy in \nAmerica than we did 20 years ago. We doubled our use of energy. Yet, we \nhave cleaner air, cleaner rivers, cleaner streams, cleaner lakes.\n  Now, why would that be the case? Would it be because those who were \npolluting America, the big polluters, decided one day to just turn off \ntheir chimneys and to stop throwing chemicals into rivers, and to stop \nblowing pollution into the air because they just decided it would be \ngood business? No, that is not why.\n  It is because we put in place regulations that say you cannot \npollute. Clean air and clean water are important to Americans. It is \nimportant to our health. It is important to this Earth. You have to \nstop polluting. That is what we said.\n  Maybe we ought to celebrate a bit that we are successful after 20 \nyears. Go back to the 1970's and the first Earth Day, and what you \nwould find is a notion that we are consigning ourselves to a future of \nincreasingly dirty air and increasingly dirty water, and there is not a \ndarned thing anybody can do about it.\n  The Hudson River was set on fire, so we had the prospect and the \nsight of a river burning. Why? Because it was so terribly polluted that \nyou could set it on fire. You could light the water.\n  Back in the 1970's, the notion was that things are so bad, they will \nget worse, and there is nothing we can do. Twenty years later, we \ndoubled our use of energy, and those rivers are cleaner and the air is \ncleaner.\n  There are those who stand up and say, ``the Federal Government cannot \ndo anything right. We hate the Federal Government. Turn it all back to \nthe States.'' Some say, ``let's block grant the food stamp program. \nSend it back to the States.'' Apparently, hunger is not a national \npriority anymore for some. Some of what the Federal Government has done \nhas been enormously successful. We ought to understand that.\n  One part of that is Medicare. That is why I came to the floor today, \nto talk about the Medicare Program. We will \n\n[[Page S 10864]]\nhave a fight. That is what democracy is about--debate. We will have a \ndebate about the future of these programs, including Medicare. It is a \ndebate I look forward to.\n  We must fix Medicare with respect to its financial solvency for the \nlong term. That is not a fence that you cannot get over. It is, in my \njudgment, not a difficult thing to do. But we should not, in ways that \nsome suggest, continually try to weaken a program that works so well.\n  No one, in my judgment, should lament the fact we are having this \nkind of debate about whether we spend money on the Medicare Program, \nwhether we give a tax cut to Donald Trump, whether we build star wars--\nall of which are proposed. No one should lament that. The political \nsystem is constructed to have that kind of a debate in our country.\n  President Kennedy used to say, ``Every mother kind of hopes that her \nchild might grow up to be President, as long as they don't have to get \ninvolved in politics.'' The irony is that the political system is a \nsystem in which we debate these issues of the day for our country and \nits future.\n  I look forward to the coming weeks as we debate the future of \nMedicare. I hope that this full-page ad in USA Today, with a tombstone \nfor Medicare, in which the Republicans pledge to save Medicare--a \npolitical party that opposed it with every bit of their breath and \nenergy 30 years ago--I hope this represents a determination by the \nRepublicans to join us and say Medicare should be available for the \nlong term for America's elderly who need it, not with less coverage and \nhigher costs, but instead with good coverage at modest cost, with a \nprogram that celebrates America's success.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week marks the 30th anniversary of \nMedicare--the Health Care Program that currently serves 4 million \ndisabled Americans and about 33 million elderly Americans.\n  Anniversaries are normally a time for celebration. But, this 30th \nanniversary is a time of great concern.\n  As we all know, the Medicare trustees, three of whom are members of \nthe President's Cabinet, have warned us that, at best, Medicare has \nonly seven more anniversaries left before going bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, I believe one of the most important responsibilities \nof this Congress is to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare so that \nit does not go bankrupt and will continue to be there for Americans for \nthe next 30 years, and the 30 years beyond that.\n  Before I look to the future, however, I want to take just a minute to \nlook to the past.\n  When Medicare was debated in Congress in 1965, I voted against it.\n  And there are those at the Democrat National Committee who seem to \nbelieve that vote is either proof that I am out to gut Medicare, or \nthat it disqualifies me from participating in this debate.\n  I only wish they would devote as much energy to the search for \nsolutions to Medicare's current fiscal crisis, as they do to \nquestioning the motives of others.\n  My vote against Medicare was not a decision I made lightly. I knew my \nvote would lead to a round of criticism. But in the end, I voted \nagainst the legislation for several reasons.\n  The first reason was because I had concerns that we would be \nestablishing an entitlement for many Americans who truly were not in \nneed of Government assistance. We all know that by their very nature, \nentitlements are designed to grow. And, as we have seen over the past \n30 years, the Medicare entitlement has done precisely that.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, the House Ways and Means \nCommittee predicted that the part A portion would cost $9 billion in \n1990. Needless to say, they were wrong. By 1974, we were spending $9 \nbillion--just 8 years after Medicare's passage. This year, Medicare \npart A will cost $158 billion--58 times the amount it cost in its first \nyear.\n  Second, I was concerned that this growing entitlement would be \nfinanced either through higher taxes or deficit spending, and that both \nof these options would compromise the futures of generations to come. \nAgain, by 1974, the tax rate to finance the program was already twice \nthe initial projection.\n  And the third factor behind my vote was that I shared many of the \nconcerns articulated by the then President of the American Medical \nAssociation, Dr. Leonard Larson, who said:\n\n       The administration's medical care proposal, if enacted, \n     would certainly represent the first major, irreversible step \n     toward the complete socialization of medical care. The bill \n     does not provide insurance or prepayment of any type, but \n     compels one segment of our population to underwrite a \n     socialized program of health care for another, regardless of \n     need.\n\n  Mr. President, the AMA at that time put forward an alternative \nproposal, called Eldercare, which I supported.\n  I must say as I look back on that day in 1965 and on the weeks before \nthe debate, and I have gone back to check the Congressional Record and \nsome of the statements made by my colleagues, Elder Care had many more \nbenefits than Medicare. We covered prescription drugs in Elder Care, \nwhich are still not covered today under Medicare.\n In addition, that plan would have cost less because it took into \naccount the beneficiaries' ability to pay.\n\n  Would Medicare be in better shape today had my concerns been \naddressed at its creation? I believe it would. And I also believe that \nif nothing is done and Medicare goes bankrupt, the American public will \nnot look back at 1965 to decide where to fix blame--they will look back \nto 1995.\n  So, where do we go from here?\n  Mr. President, we cannot turn back the clock. But, we can learn from \nthe past. And, that means doing what is necessary to improve Medicare \nso that it can move successfully into the 21st century.\n  Despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House and the Democratic \n\n\n[[Page S 10865]]\ncommittee, Republicans, including myself, do not support cutting \nMedicare. We recognize the need for Medicare's growth, and our historic \nbudget resolution allows for an annual growth rate of 6.4 percent. \nUnder this agreement, Medicare spending will top $1.6 trillion over the \nnext 7 years. In addition, the trust fund's solvency will be ensured \nthrough the year 2005.\n  Mr. President, Republicans are also interested in creating more \nchoices for Medicare beneficiaries. Fee-for-service health care may be \ngreat for some, and they should be able to keep that if they choose. \nBut, there are other options out there now that may offer more benefits \nbut are unavailable to Medicare beneficiaries. I would like to see \nthese\n choices extended to all Americans.\n\n   Mr. President, the committees of jurisdiction in the House and \nSenate are currently working reconciliation legislation, that will \ninclude proposals to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare. As \nrequired by the budget resolution passed by Congress, this plan must be \nreported out of committee by September 22.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle, however, have requested the \ndetails of this legislation be made available before the August recess.\n  While we like to accommodate our colleagues as much as we can around \nhere, the fact of the matter is that this is an extraordinarily \nimportant piece of legislation that cannot be slapped together a month \nahead of schedule. The chairmen of the committees of jurisdiction have \nassured me that their staffs will work throughout August to give this \nbill the careful attention it deserves.\n   Mr. President, we have solicited ideas from the White House since \nApril, when we first received the Trustee's report. Unfortunately, we \nhave had no response, which was made our job that much more \nchallenging.\n  But, as I said before, that does not alter our determination--I think \nit also includes many of my colleagues on the other side, I would \nhope--to preserve, improve, and protect the Medicare Program so that it \nwill continue to be there for those who rely on it today and for those \nwho will do so for many years in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10864-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10865-S10866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nHISTORICAL HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MARINE CORPS IN THE KOREAN WAR: ED PETSCHE \n                        AT THE CHOSIN RESERVOIR\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I wanted to rise today to make some short \nremarks here on the floor about a special person in Toledo, OH. It is \nEdwin F. Petsche, who was in my office just a couple of days ago. I \nremarked about him on the floor of the Senate yesterday. It had been my \ngreat honor to award him a Purple Heart that was long overdue. Ed \nPetsche took part in the withdrawal from the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, \nback about 45 years ago, and had never received that Purple Heart. I \nmentioned it in passing yesterday in connection with our remarks about \nthe dedication of the Korean War Memorial. I will say more about Ed \nPetsche in just a moment. But let me just briefly set the stage.\n  In the annals of Marine Corps history there are some things that \nstand out: Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, raising of the flag on Mt. \nSuribachi, and a number of events, and notable times of combat in \nvarious wars. You cannot compare one with another, for they all \nrequired great sacrifice. But I wanted to pay attention to this \nparticular moment and set the stage for what happened out there. The \ndedication this week of the Korean War Memorial is a time for all \nAmericans to reflect upon the sacrifices of our many veterans of that \nconflict--Ed Petsche and many others.\n  Many younger Americans are hearing this week for the first time the \nnames of Korean cities and campaigns that were household words in \nAmerica almost a half-century ago. The name of one geographical area in \nKorea will remain forever enshrined in the pantheon of Marine Corps \nhistory and that is the Chosin Reservoir.\n  In late October 1950, the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized operations \nnorth of the 38th parallel in Korea.\n  Maj. Gen. O.P. Smith's spirited 1st Marine Division began to drive \nnorth toward the Yalu River in an effort to destroy completely the \nNorth Korean People's Army.\n  On November 2, 1950, the 7th, 5th, and 1st Marines moved out, in that \norder, from Hamhung, following a treacherous mountain route toward the \nChosin Reservoir, the site of a large hydroelectric facility in \nnorthern Korea. By midnight the marines were in heavy contact with the \nChinese 124th Division, as the People's Liberation Army had just \nentered the war to assist the struggling North Koreans.\n  The 7th and 5th Marines continued their advance through both light \nand heavy enemy opposition, and were concentrated at Yudam-Ni by 27 \nNovember, while the legendary ``Chesty'' Puller's 1st Marines took \npositions along the route. The full weight of the veteran 100,000 to \n120,000 man Chinese 9th Army Group then fell upon the marines. The \nChinese attacked during the night in temperatures approaching 20 \ndegrees below zero, cutting the main supply routes, and isolating the \nmarines into four close perimeters. Although the vastly outnumbered \nmarines held their ground, the situation was very, very grave.\n  On December 1, General Smith ordered a breakout from the reservoir, \nwhich he termed an ``attack in a different direction.''\n  They went into retreat. They were surrounded. In any direction they \nwent they contacted the enemy. So it truly was an attack in a different \ndirection.\n  They were supported by the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing that flew and \nflew and flew nearly 4,000 sorties during the entire operation--4,000 \nsorties. The 1st Marine Division blasted its way through seven Chinese \ndivisions and finally reached safety at Hungnam by December 12.\n  At the Chosin Reservoir, there was somewhere around 15,000 Americans \ninvolved. And out of that I think there were 13,000 casualties listed--\nin 10 days there were 13,000 casualties either dead or wounded during \nthat advance back to Hungnam.\n  The Chosin Reservoir campaign cost the marines over 4,400 battle \ncasualties, including killed and wounded, and uncounted cases of \nfrostbite and pneumonia. The Communist Chinese forces had suffered a \ncatastrophe, however. The best count ever made was that there were some \n25,000 Chinese communist dead--25,000 dead as they came out.\n  Well, I read that to set the stage for Ed Petsche, and to show that \nthis was tough close combat. He was bayoneted. That is hand-to-hand \ncombat. This is not shooting at people remotely with rockets and with \nmissiles, or things like that. He was bayoneted, and left for dead; \ntossed on a pile of soldiers and left there for dead. And it may have \nbeen lucky that the temperature was so cold because it was said that \nthe temperature froze the wounds on parts of his body and maybe \nprotected them a little bit from having become infected any more than \nthey were. But he was still alive and was groaning. Someone heard his \ngroans, rescued him and got him out. And they finally got him some \nattention and got him out of there.\n  That is the preface to saying that when he was in the hospital in \nJapan, Ed, for some reason, never had the record set straight that \nwould have gotten him his Purple Heart.\n  I wanted to give that little background because some 45 years later, \nEd Petsche and his children and grandchildren were in my office a \ncouple of days ago.\n  And I was honored on behalf of the Commandant to present to him his \nbelated Purple Heart. And it was indeed an honor.\n  We lost a lot of people in Korea. And I know that we have made a huge \neffort with regard to Vietnam to make sure that the POW/MIA count, the \nbodies and the missing people there--that their records are brought to \nlight and that their remains are brought back, even now 20-some years \nafter the end of the Vietnam war.\n  In Korea there are some 8,000 that are still missing that we do not \nhave records on, and do not have their remains. I know the President \nindicated a couple of days ago that he thought that we should be \npushing to get a better accounting of what happened to those people in \nKorea.\n  I would also note in passing that we still have some 78,000 missing \nMIA's out of World War II.\n  Ed Petsche came so close to being one of those who died in Korea. But \nhe survived, luckily, and has received his \n\n[[Page S 10866]]\nrecognition, although too many years too late.\n  I guess to those whose loved ones still remain in Korea, whose \nremains were never brought back, I am reminded of the lines by Rupert \nBrooke in a book of poems called ``The Soldier.'' He was an Englishman, \nand wrote about those who represented England in foreign fields and \nwars, and places all over the world. And sometimes their bodies were \nnot brought back. He stated his belief this way, and I think it should \napply to some of the ways we can look to some of our people too. He \nsaid:\n\n       If I should die, think only this of me, that there is some \n     corner of a foreign field that is forever England.\n\n  And I guess I would look the same way for our own people, the 8,000 \nwho never came back, who never even had records on them brought back \nfrom Korea. With all the 54,000 dead that we had in Korea, many did not \ncome back.\n  I guess I would say the same thing to our people, that they died, but \nthink only this of them, that there is that corner of a foreign field \nin Korea that is forever America.\n  Wherever they fell becomes a part of this country, whether it is \nlegal on the international boundary chart or not.\n  Ed Petsche represents the people who were out there. He was lucky. \nAlthough he came so close to death that he was tossed on a pile of \nsoldiers and left for dead, he still survived and came back.\n  Out of that campaign, where he and the others came out of the Chosin \nReservoir and came down to Hungnam, there were 17 Congressional Medals \nof Honor and 70 Navy Crosses awarded in just that one 10-day advance.\n  It is hard to believe the terrible things that they went through, not \nonly the enemy and so many casualties all over the place. Almost the \nwhole force became casualties; 13,000 casualties out of the 15,000 \nforces involved with 4,400 dead, as I indicated a little while ago.\n  So it is these things that we remember during this week of \ncommemoration regarding what happened in Korea so many years ago.\n  I wanted to pay special tribute to Ed Petsche because he represents \nthe best of the people we sent out there. He was 19 years old at the \ntime, and almost died out there, but came back, and was never \nrecognized for his action. And I can say very truly it was indeed a \ngreat, great honor to be able to present the Purple Heart to him, \nalthough it was some 45 years later.\n  It was a pleasure to meet his family. We wish him the very best and \nwe are glad that finally the ``Forgotten War,'' as it has been called \nall through the years is forgotten no more. It has a memorial that will \ncommemorate forever, or will memorialize here in Washington forever, \nthe sacrifices that were made by people like Ed Petsche.\n  I am honored to be able to pay him tribute on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the Senator from \nOhio on that very moving and fine presentation, particularly this week \nwhen we are honoring the Americans who fought in Korea in a far-away \nplace but, as the Senator pointed out, a place that will always be in \nthe memory of Americans for the sacrifice of so many of our troops from \nall of the services.\n  I might note to the Senator from Ohio that I received some time ago a \ngift, a small gift but a very meaningful gift, from a survivor of \nChosin. It is a belt buckle to be worn on a western belt, and that is \nwhat I always remember when I wear that belt. It reminds me always of \nthe sacrifices that were made by those at Chosin, and it is something \nwe should never forget. Certainly the Korean War Memorial will now help \nus to remember that very fine hour in American history despite the \ncasualties, the suffering and sorrow that attend it. So I compliment \nthe Senator from Ohio on his very fine remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10865-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10866-S10867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATIONAL DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to address a defense subject, \ngiven the fact that the Senate is likely to take up the defense \nauthorization bill next week. I am going to include in my remarks a \nreference to North Korea. So, in a sense, the comments of the Senator \nfrom Ohio and all of those who have remarked on the sacrifices of \nAmericans in Korea now 40 years ago, 45 years ago in some cases, have a \nbearing on what we are doing with our national defenses today and some \nof the issues we will be debating in connection with the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Specifically, what I wish to address for a few minutes today is the \nimplication of a recent CIA report which warned us that about 20 \nnations by the end of this century will have the capability to deliver \na weapon of mass destruction far beyond their borders through the \nmissile delivery system, a ballistic missile delivery system that is \neither being indigenously produced in these countries or is being \nacquired by purchase from another nation and that that threat is a very \nreal one not only for U.S. forces deployed abroad but also for our \nallies and eventually, not too long after the turn of the century, for \nthe continental United States itself.\n  In the Persian Gulf war, fully 20 percent of the United States \ncasualties were as a direct result of the Scud missile attacks by the \nIraqis. As a matter of fact, the single largest number of American \ncasualties was 28 in one Scud missile attack on a barracks in Saudi \nArabia. So this is not a threat that is hypothetical or in the future. \nIt has already occurred to American troops in this decade. And yet too \nmany have been blind to the reality that this is an emerging threat, \nthat the ballistic missile with a warhead of mass destruction, either \nnuclear, chemical, or biological or even high explosives, is the weapon \nof choice of the dictators and would-be aggressors around the world \ntoday. Fully half of those 20 nations that the CIA report refers to are \neither in the Middle East or in Southeast Asia, and clearly our \ninterests and our allies' interests are implicated in those regions of \nthe world.\n  North Korea is a good case in point, particularly since our focus has \nbeen on Korea this week. One of the reasons that our policy with \nrespect to North Korea has been so touchy, so tentative is because \nNorth Korea today possesses a very real threat to literally millions of \nSouth Koreans and several thousand Americans in Korea.\n  Today, in just a matter of hours, North Korea could kill thousands of \npeople in Seoul, Korea, because that is how close Seoul is to the reach \nof the North Korean guns, their long artillery. Ballistic missiles are \nsimply a much more robust system than long artillery, and the impact \ncan, of course, be much more devastating, but the analogy is very true.\n  One of the reasons that we are not tougher on North Korea today, that \nwe cannot dictate the terms to North Korea, that we cannot tell them to \nstop producing weapons grade plutonium for the development of nuclear \nweapons is because we do not have leverage over North Korea. We cannot \nthreaten them militarily, and as a matter of fact we are susceptible to \na North Korean attack. We have no means of stopping the artillery from \nNorth Korea, the kind of attack that would occur on Seoul and that \nwould also cause casualties to American troops in South Korea.\n  What it tells us is that in the conduct of foreign policy we cannot \nbe held hostage to foreign powers. We cannot allow ourselves to be \ndefenseless against the weapons they would deploy against us or else we \nare neutralized in the conduct of our foreign policy, and that is what \nhas largely happened with respect to North Korea. It will be orders of \nmagnitude worse if and when North Korea obtains the kind of long-range \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction it is working on today.\n  North Korea is one of those nations that is indigenously producing \nlonger range ballistic missiles, and public reports assert that shortly \nafter the turn of the century one of those missiles will even be able \nto reach the continental United States, specifically the State of \nAlaska.\n  It does not take any reach of the imagination to predict what would \nhappen if North Korea threatened Anchorage, AK, let us say, or one of \nour military bases in Alaska with a nuclear weapon if we did not do a \ncertain thing or forbear from doing something that \n\n[[Page S 10867]]\nwas in the interest of North Korea. And yet the question is what would \nwe do about it, because we have no means of stopping that kind of \nattack.\n  It used to be that the threat of mutual assured destruction with the \nformer Soviet Union was enough to deter attack by either nation because \nthe thought of either nation sending everything it had against the \nother nation was simply too horrible to contemplate and neither nation \nwas foolish enough to do that. But today the threat of mutual assured \ndestruction does not work against these tinhorn dictators in countries \nlike Iraq or Iran or Syria or North Korea and similar places, Libya--I \nwill not extend the list--because of the characterized kind of \nleadership of those countries. But the fact is they have not been \nfriends of the United States; they have been antagonistic in the past. \nThey have either now or are developing these systems and therefore are \nlikely troublemakers in the near future. To be defenseless against them \nis to deny our responsibility.\n  Fortunately, we have it in our capability to begin developing the \nkind of defenses that would render these threats essentially \nmeaningless and prevent us from being subjected to the blackmail that \nthose threats certainly will entail in the future and hopefully deter \nattacks that, of course, would cause casualties either to our allies or \nour forces deployed abroad and eventually to the continental United \nStates.\n  Both the House and Senate Defense authorization bills begin to get us \nback on track to the development and deployment of effective theater \nballistic missile systems and do the work that will eventually enable \nus to deploy an effective national defense system, that is, a system \nthat would prevent attacks on the United States.\n  And so it is important for us, as we begin to debate this subject \nnext week, to focus on what the Armed Services Committee will be \nrecommending and why we should not adopt some of the amendments that we \nknow are going to be proposed that would weaken what the Armed Services \nCommittee has recommended with respect to the development and \ndeployment of these theater ballistic missile systems.\n  In the past, Mr. President, there have been attempts to reduce the \nfunding. Well, this year's funding level, I will note, is less than the \nClinton administration's recommendation for this year in the 5-year \nplan that was submitted last year. So I hope we will not see attempts \nto decrease the funding for ballistic missile defenses.\n  There is also a question about dumbing down our systems. The Patriot \nmissile was not as effective as it might have been in the Persian Gulf \nbecause it had earlier been dumbed down. We did not make it as \neffective as we could have. There is a belief today that because the \nRussians would not like to see a robust defense, a defense that might \neven prepare the way for an effective defense against missiles they \nmight send our way someday, therefore we are going to arbitrarily limit \nourselves so that the systems will not be as effective as they might \nbe.\n  One of the arguments will be, if we make them as effective as they \ncould be, they might violate the ABM Treaty.\n  This bill which will come to the floor next week has definitions \nbuilt into it that clearly permit us to test in a certain mode, and if \nwe test beyond that mode, it would be deemed testing against a \nstrategic system, which presumably would be in violation of the ABM \nTreaty, and so we will not do that. But if we try to add additional \nrequirements such as speed limits on American missiles, making them not \nas effective as they might otherwise be, we will be dumbing down our \nsystem, making it less capable than it should be, than it needs to be.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to reject any amendments along that \nline.\n  Finally, what we have done, since eventually there could be questions \nabout whether a national system should have one or more sites to \nprotect the continental United States, we have established a committee \nwhich will advise the Senate and the administration on what areas of \nthe ABM Treaty we may wish to modify in order to deploy an effective \nsystem to defend the United States. The treaty only allows for one \nsystem today. We may need to deploy in more than one place. Surely, if \nthat is in the United States national interest, we would seek to modify \nthe treaty and ask the Russians to agree to that with us.\n  We are not violating the treaty; we are simply preparing for the day \nwhen we may ask for changes to be made. The treaty is almost 25 years \nold and clearly was developed at a time when the Cold War was at its \nheight and when the United States and Russia, or the Soviet Union, I \nshould say, were depending on the doctrine of mutual assured \ndestruction. That does not exist today. As so many of our colleagues \nare fond of reminding us, the Cold War is over. Of course, it is over.\n  We have to begin to think about the kind of defense we will need in \nthe next century rather than focusing on a treaty that may have served \nus well in the past, though that is subject to some debate, but \ncertainly does not provide all the things that we need or the only \nthings that we need to protect us in the future.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will be agreeable to going forward with \nthe study committee that is established in the Armed Services Committee \nmark that will come to the floor. I hope that they will believe that is \na good idea and will go forward with that study.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I believe what the Armed Services \nCommittee will be recommending to us will make a lot of sense; that it \nwill begin to put us on the path to developing and ultimately deploying \nan effective theater ballistic missile defense, a system that will \nprotect us if we have troops deployed in Korea or in Saudi Arabia or \nanywhere else in the world, a system that will protect our allies to \nthe extent they wish to be protected. That is something the United \nStates wants to cooperate in and ultimately a system that can be added \nto and modified to protect even the continental United States.\n  Surveys show that Americans today overwhelmingly believe that if a \nmissile were launched against the United States, that we would be able \nto somehow intercept it either by some airplane-fired missile or some \nother missile we could fire or something in space. We know, of course, \nthat is not true. We have absolutely no defense against a missile fired \nagainst us, whether by accident or in anger, whether by a terrorist \nnation that only has one or two missiles, or whether as in an attack by \na country like the former Soviet Union.\n  It is time to start thinking how to deal with that threat today. It \ntakes a long time to develop the systems to meet that kind of threat. \nThat is why this bill begins to put us on the track that will enable us \nto defend ourselves, as well as our interests abroad, and it is a bill \nwhich will be deserving of our support.\n  I will be talking more about the bill and its specifics as we come to \nthe floor to debate it, but I wanted to at least outline those concerns \nto my colleagues today.\n  Mr. President, those conclude my remarks about the defense bill \nbefore us next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10866-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, a new study released today by the \nadministration shows the impact of the proposed Republican Medicare \ncuts on seniors and health care providers in each State. The numbers \nare devastating. How could any Senator look at these numbers and \nsupport these proposals in good conscience?\n  This study is especially timely on the eve of the National Governors \nAssociation Conference in Vermont this weekend. All Governors must be \nasked what these proposed cuts will mean for seniors in their State and \nfor the health care system as a whole. Here are just a few examples:\n  In my State of Massachusetts, over the next 7 years, seniors will be \nasked to pay an additional $4,300 for the medical care they need. A \nsenior couple will pay $8,600.\n  In Florida, a couple will have to pay $8,800.\n  In California, the figure is $8,200.\n  In Nevada, the additional burden will be $6,000.\n  The figures vary, but the message is clear: An unfair, unaffordable \nburden on senior citizens in every State to pay for the tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  And those who need health care the most will pay even more. Senior \ncitizens needing home health services will have to pay an average of \n$1,700 a year for this service alone, on top of the additional costs \nfor all their other health needs. Seniors needing nursing home care \nwill have to pay $1,400 more.\n  The impact on the health care system as a whole is even greater. In \nMassachusetts, the Medicare cuts will mean $9.5 billion less for health \ncare over the next 7 years. Mr. President, that is an extraordinary \nfigure, $9.5 billion less to the seniors in my State over the next 7 \nyears. In Florida, the figure is $28.1 billion. In California, it is \n$36.4 billion. In New York, the figure is $18.1 billion. The deep \nMedicaid cuts in the budget will take even more from the health system \nand those in need.\n  These cuts will be passed on to elderly people, to those who are on \nMedicare-- which is 97 percent of all of our seniors--with higher \ncopayments, higher deductibles and higher premiums.\n  Mr. President, I will include in the Record the detailed State-by-\nState breakdown of these proposed Republican Medicare cuts. Senior \ncitizens in every State will suffer, hospitals and nursing homes will \nclose, and the health care system will be of lower quality.\n  These numbers speak for themselves, but the impact goes far beyond \nmere numbers. Who speaks for the elderly widow, struggling to survive \non a fixed income, who must now try to find $1,000 more a year to pay \nfor the health care she needs?\n  Who speaks for the family who will now be forced to choose between \nmedical care for their parents and a college education for their \nchildren?\n  Who speaks for the retired couple who finds that the savings of a \nlifetime must now be sacrificed to pay for the medical care that \nMedicare used to cover?\n  President Clinton speaks for them--and so do Democrats in the \nCongress. We will never let these cruel cuts become law. We will never \nlet the Medicare trust fund become a slush fund for tax cuts for the \nwealthy. We will never let senior citizens be plundered for the \nbenefits they have earned by a lifetime of hard work.\n  We do not have to redebate, hopefully, the reason for the development \nof the Medicare system. It is based and built upon a very simple and \nfundamental concept: that the men and women who have built this Nation, \nhave made it the great country that it is, who fought in its wars and \nbrought it out of the Depression, ought to be able to live their senior \nyears in respect and in dignity.\n  It is recognized that a test of a civilization is how it regards its \nelders, what respect it pays them. To relieve our seniors from the \nanxiety and the pressures of seniors' health care needs, in the way \nthat Medicare has done, is something which is of fundamental importance \nto all Americans. It is this program which will be, I believe, \ndevastated, should these proposed cuts go into effect. Once again, we \nhave to reiterate that the principal reasons for those cuts to go into \neffect is for the tax cuts that will be available primarily to the \nwealthy individuals in our country.\n  The fact is that there is $270 billion proposed for the Medicare cuts \nand about $245 billion for the tax cuts. So if you eliminated the tax \ncuts, you would be able to move ahead with the Medicare program in a \nway that would not present these kinds of burdens on our senior \ncitizens.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I underline the obvious fact that all of \nus understand; and that is, when our citizens grow older and older, \nthat their incomes generally decline and they are dependent upon Social \nSecurity and they are dependent upon Medicare. At a time when their \nincomes are declining is a time that their health care needs continue \nto grow. It is that fundamental concept that drove this country to \nadopt the health care and the Medicare systems: declining incomes, \nincreasing health care requirements.\n  This chart reflects exactly who of our fellow citizens are really \naffected: 83 percent of the expenditures go to families with annual \nincomes of $25,000 or less; 21 percent of it goes to those with annual \nincomes of $15,000 to $25,000; 62 percent goes to those with annual \nincomes of $15,000 a year or under--men and women who are being asked, \nwith the proposed Medicare cuts, to see a significant increase in out-\nof-pocket expenditures,\n copays, deductibles, and premiums. There are $9.5 billion for the \nclose to 1 million of my fellow citizens in Massachusetts who benefit \nunder the Medicare system.\n\n  I hope that when those Governors meet this weekend up in Vermont, \nsomeone will ask them how they are going to be able to explain these \nkinds of sizable cuts, and how they will explain them to the people who \nlive in my State of Massachusetts, in the State of New York, the State \nof California, the State of Florida, and the State of Texas. We have \nseen that within Massachusetts the burden will be higher than the \nnational average, as it will be in Rhode Island and Connecticut--the \nNew England States. In these next several weeks as we are debating this \nissue, debating this proposal, those of us who believe and fought for \nthis particular program are going to do everything that we can to \nresist.\n  I am sure that in my State of Massachusetts, there are the elderly \nwidows who are wondering how they are going to be able to afford the \nadditional out-of-pocket costs that will be required under the proposed \nMedicare cuts.\n  How are they going to be able to handle it? How are the American \nfamilies going to handle it--the sons and daughters of those who are \nreceiving Medicare today? These kinds of cuts are not only going to be \ndevastating to the seniors, but to their sons and daughters that care \nand love their parents and have a great respect for the dignity of \nthose parents. They are going to do everything they can, with scarce \nresources, to be able to make sure their parents are going to be able \nto live with some dignity.\n  These kinds of cuts are not only going to be evident on the seniors, \nbut they are also going to be a heavy burden on the working families in \nthis country, who have lost real income in terms of wages over the last \n15 years. This is going to come at the same time when those families \nare worried about educating their children. We have seen that under the \nRepublican proposals, the cost of student loans is going to increase \nsome 30 percent, and the total number of Pell grants that will be \navailable to well-qualified needy children who can gain admission into \nthe finest colleges and universities across this country but need the \nPell grants to be able to continue their education, their program is \nbeing deteriorated. Those working families are going to have to make \njudgments about how much they are going to have to make up the out-of-\npocket expenses for their parents, or whether they are going to educate \ntheir children.\n  We know what is going to happen to the families. These couples are \ngoing to have to make a judgment about how much they are going to pay \nout of their life savings, which was going to be used for their \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, these are obscene choices left for our seniors, our \nfamilies, and our children. I daresay this \n\n[[Page S 10869]]\ndebate is just beginning. It has not concluded. We will have an \nopportunity to get into greater detail on these measures on the floor \nof the Senate. But I hope, Mr. President, that the Governors of these \nUnited States--not only my State, but the other States--will be asked \nabout the impact of the proposed Republican Medicare cuts on seniors in \ntheir States. This is going to be a matter of national debate and \ndiscussion. We can address in a responsible way the needs of the trust \nfunds without seeing these dramatic cuts used for tax cuts for the \nwealthiest individuals and corporations. I say no to that. We will \nbattle on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we will battle with this \nPresident, who has said no to the proposed Republican Medicare cuts, \nand we will fight for our seniors because they have made this Nation \nthe great Nation that it is, and we owe them no less. We owe them a \ngreat deal more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10868-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10869-S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am sorry I could not be on the floor \nduring the remarks of Senator Kennedy with reference to health care in \nthe United States, and in particular Medicare. By coincidence, \nunbeknownst that he would speak, I had prepared for myself to deliver \ntoday--since we are at about the 30th anniversary date of the passage \nof Medicare--a speech that I am prepared to give to the Senate. I \nbelieve I heard enough of the Senator's remarks that, at some point, I \nwill depart from the speech and answer a few of the comments made.\n  I will start right off by saying that it is unfair to the senior \ncitizens of the United States to talk about what might be, or how \nthings ought to be, and not tell them how things are.\n  The fact of the matter is that the cornerstone of hospital health \ncare for our seniors--Medicare--is in big trouble. And to make a speech \nabout the seniors and scare them about the future, without telling them \nthe truth, does not seem to me to be the right way to treat our \nseniors, who are filled with wisdom, understanding, and truly think \nthis is a great Nation and would like very much to do their share to \ntry to fix some things that are going wrong.\n  So the No. 1 point is that there has been in existence a group of \nAmericans who reviewed thoroughly the status, the financial status, and \nthe delivery system called Medicare. Mr. President, that is not a \nRepublican group. As a matter of fact, one might call it, if you seek \nto partisanize it, a Democratic group, because three Cabinet members of \nthis President and the appointee of this President who heads Social \nSecurity were four members of the Commission--the majority. There are \nonly two more. And all six of them, including the four, wrote a report \nto the people of this country, the seniors, the President, and the \nCongress, and told us in no uncertain language that the Medicare \nProgram was in trouble because it was costing too much. I just want to \nread their recommendation so that we put everything into perspective. \nTheir final words of real recommendation were the following:\n\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of Medicare trust funds be urgently \n     addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a review of the \n     program's financing methods, benefit programs, and delivery \n     system.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, you would not have gathered from the comments of \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that anything like this \nhad even happened. Here sits a report--I wish I had a copy of it. If I \nam going to talk about it, I should bring it around. When I saw it, it \nwas a little yellow notebook with a yellow cover, properly styled. I \nrepeat, the Commissioners, four of whom work for this President, said \nthe time is now--and I am going to repeat what they said we ought to be \ndoing.\n  It is very, very simple. But Members would not have heard it from the \nspeech of the Senator from Massachusetts. They said, ``It is time to \nreview the program's financing methods, benefit provisions, and \ndelivery mechanism.''\n  Now, why did they say that? Members would not have gathered this, \neither, from the remarks. They said there will be no money in 7 years \nto pay the bills. We would not have known that, either, from the \nremarks about all the evil and bad things that will happen to seniors.\n  The worst of all things is that there be no program, that they cannot \npay their bills in 7 years. That is, really, something to call to the \nattention of the senior citizens of the United States.\n  Then say, ``What is wrong with doing just what they said? Review the \nprogram's financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery \nmechanisms.''\n  Now, Mr. President, if we look at what was proposed in the budget \nresolution for this country, it is on all fours with the \nrecommendations of the commission that reports on the financial \ncondition of the system. If we take what they said and find out what we \nought to do, we ought to save a given amount of money to the health \ncare insurance over the next 7 years in order to make that system stay \nsolvent and not be bankrupt.\n  The budget resolution says that is what we ought to do. Now, \neverybody ought to understand that Medicare is growing at about 10 \npercent a year. They mention that too, in the report. It cannot \ncontinue to grow at that pace and there still be money in the trust \nfund in 7 years to pay the bill.\n  It falls on someone to take a look at how we might do it better, give \nthe seniors options, and perhaps cost the trust fund less money.\n  Now, that is what all of this is about. No matter how we talk about \nit, the truth of the matter is that many people in the U.S. Congress \nfelt it was time to look at this and fix it. In fixing it, we just \nmight give the senior citizens a pretty good hospital program that will \ncost very little more to them, but will cost less, because it will be \nmore efficient.\n  We will take the fraud and waste out of the program and cause the \ndelivery system to be restructured so you still have choice of your own \ndoctor, but there is choice of plans, and perhaps over time we would \nsave substantial amounts of money.\n  Now, Mr. President, before I read my anniversary speech on Medicare, \nI want to make one other comment. Those who oppose fixing the Medicare \nProgram now cannot miss a beat without saying the Republicans are going \nto cut the taxes for the rich, and that is why they are fixing \nMedicare.\n  Now, Mr. President, and anyone listening, that is not true. First of \nall, if we take the so-called tax cuts that are proposed off the \ntable--just do not do them--and the Medicare system will be bankrupt in \n7 years. Let me repeat: The so-called tax cuts--and we will talk about \nthem in a minute--if we take them off the table, we would not have \ngathered from the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts that the Medicare system will still be broke. They are \ncompletely different issues.\n  If we do not fix the Medicare system, it will be short of funds, and \ncutting people's taxes has nothing to do with that unless Members would \nlike to raise taxes to pay for Medicare. I have not heard anybody say \nthat. But if we want to raise taxes, then we could talk about the \nprogram not having to be reduced in terms of cost. Mr. President, that \nis the fact.\n  In addition, in the U.S. Senate, the sense of this Senate has been \nthat if we ever get tax cuts, and when we do, that 90 percent of the \ntax cuts will go to people with income under $100,000. Now, there is a \ndifference of opinion in this body on how that tax package will look \nwhen it comes out, if it comes out.\n  Essentially, to continue to try to say, ``Let's don't fix Medicare so \nit will be available 7 years from now,'' instead of dying on its 37th \nanniversary, go beyond the 37th, perhaps to 40 and beyond, instead of \naddressing that issue to talk about tax cuts for the rich does not help \nthe senior citizens one single bit.\n  What it does help, it helps to make a political issue out of a \nsituation that \n\n[[Page S 10870]]\nneed not be politicized, for we actually ought to be joining hands \nacross this aisle and with the President in fixing Medicare. I repeat, \nthe tax cuts that are referred to in the Republican budget--take them \nout, and we still have to fix Medicare, because the money will not be \nthere in 7 years. That is for certain.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me repeat, there are some who \nwould insist that we are making changes to Medicare for other reasons. \nThey may say we are changing it to balance the budget, or changing \nMedicare to lessen the tax burden on families.\n  Both of these claims are false. We are making changes in Medicare to \nsave the program, to strengthen it so it can survive into the next \ncentury, and so Senators will be here well into the next century, able \nto congratulate the program and its founders on its anniversaries.\n  Any attempt to link that with cutting taxes is to no avail for the \nseniors of this country. Any attempt to link the two is, plain and \nsimple, smoke and mirrors, from the opponents of reform. For there are \nstill some--and I do not know, perhaps my friend from Massachusetts is \none--who would stand and say the status quo for Medicare is good enough \nfor seniors.\n  Do not worry about it, leave it alone. Now, the President said that \nin his first budget--``Leave it alone.'' However, the President of the \nUnited States even came around, and in a 10-year proposal for a \nbalanced budget, although it did not get there, even the President \nsuggested that dramatic reform had to occur in the Medicare Program in \nan effort to keep it solvent.\n  This was in June when the new budget was submitted, our new budget \nproposal. The President claimed that would save Medicare; that budget \nmade a good start. His budget would save $127 billion from Medicare \nover the next 7 years--the same length of time as our budget.\n  Now, some are comparing the $127 billion in his budget, and saying we \ndo not need the $270 billion to fix the program in our budget. I submit \nthat the facts are our way. The experts on budget come down on our \nside.\n  We would like, very much, in the month of September, as part of a \nprocess up here, after hearings, meetings, input from senior groups, we \nwould like to try our hand at reforming this.\n  Mr. President, there are still some who leave the impression with \nsenior citizens that we are truly cutting the Medicare Program. Let me \nstraighten that out with some real facts. First, we are going to slow \nthe rate of growth of the program. Medicare spending will grow at 6.4 \npercent a year under our plan. To put it another way, and a more \nunderstandable way, over the next 7 years Medicare spending is going to \nincrease from $4,800 per person to $6,700 per person--not down, up. \nFrom $4,800 to $6,700.\n  I know many are very concerned about the future and what kind of \nfuture they are going to leave their children and grandchildren. And I \nbelieve, when the time comes, that when the program of reform is put \nbefore the American people it will be seen as an effort to deliver the \nsame kind of care in different ways, to get rid of the fraud and abuse \nin the program, and ultimately to provide our senior citizens with far \nmore options. They are operating under a program that is essentially 30 \nyears old, and it is also that old in terms of what kind of a delivery \nsystem it is. While all kinds of modern ways to deliver health care, \nall kinds of ways of insuring people, permitting a variety of options \nof insurance coverage now exist, Medicare is stuck in history. It is a \n30-year-old system.\n  We believe reform will cause seniors to get a better deal. There will \nbe incentives built in which will make it easier, rather than more \ndifficult, for seniors to purchase more of what they might want and \nless of what they might not want. Yes, there will be options for them \nto keep the very system they have and their own doctors.\n  So I want to just close by once again stating the caliber of the \npeople who recommended that we ought to do something to fix this \nprogram--three of this President's Cabinet Members: then-Secretary \nBentsen of Treasury, Secretary Shalala, and Secretary Reich. They are \ntrustees of this system. And there were two public trustees, and they \ntold us that we ought to fix the system. They told us it will not be \naround in 7 years. It will not have any money to pay the bills.\n  In a way, they said--and I am interpreting this--it is costing too \nmuch. Will you not take a look and see if you cannot do it better, \ncheaper, and protect not only the seniors who are using it now but \nseniors for a long time to come?\n  As I said, this Sunday, July 30, is the 30th anniversary of Medicare. \nFor 30 years, Medicare has provided health protection to elderly and \ndisabled citizens.\n  Medicare has been a successful program. Medicare has provided an \nimportant source of health security and needed health benefits to \nmillions of Americans since its inception 30 years ago. Today, 37 \nmillion Americans receive the benefits and health security that \nMedicare provides.\n  But Medicare has also become an expensive program, and everyone--\nincluding the President--agrees that the system needs fundamental \nstructural reform.\n  Medicare is running out of money. Unless we make changes now, \nMedicare will not continue to provide this same level of health \nsecurity in the future.\n  Nevertheless, this past week, the President held a rally for \nMedicare. But all he talked about was the past. The President forgot \nthe most important element of an anniversary celebration. He forgot to \nlook toward the future. If the President fights the reforms necessary \nto save Medicare's future, then in just 7 years, on the 37th \nanniversary of Medicare, the program will be bankrupt.\n  In the President's first budget, which he sent to us in February, \nMedicare would go bankrupt in 2002. Seven more years; that's all the \nPresident would give Medicare. After that, there would be no money to \npay Medicare hospital benefits. The President would let you choose your \ndoctor, but there would be no money to pay your hospital bills.\n  The President's original Medicare proposal was great--for the next 7 \nyears. But the 37th anniversary of Medicare would be its last. Under \nthe President's original plan, if you're on Medicare, you better not \nget sick 8 years from now.\n  Back in January, the President did not listen to his own Cabinet \nSecretaries. Three of his Cabinet officers--Secretary Bentsen, \nSecretary Shalala, and Secretary Reich, are trustees of the Medicare \nsystem. Along with the two public trustees, they told the President and \nthe Congress that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund had only \nenough money to pay benefits for the next 7 years.\n  The President chose to ignore that. The Republicans in Congress did \nnot. We invited the public trustees up to Capitol Hill, to tell us what \nneeds to be done. We listened carefully, and now we are taking their \nadvice.\n  Let me read from the summary of the trustees' report. The full board \nof trustees say, ``The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund * * * will be able \nto pay benefits for only about 7 years and is severely out of financial \nbalance in the long range.\n  The two public trustees tell us that:\n\n       The most critical issues relate to the Medicare Program. \n     Both the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary \n     Medical Insurance Trust Fund show alarming results. . . . The \n     Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present \n     form. . . . We feel strongly that comprehensive Medicare \n     reforms should be undertaken to make this program financially \n     sound now and over the long term. We strongly recommend that \n     the crisis presented by the financial condition of the \n     Medicare Trust Funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \n     basis, including a review of the program's financing methods, \n     benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.\n\n  This is what the public trustees of Medicare recommend we do to \nstrengthen Medicare for the future. And this is exactly what we are \ndoing now.\n  There are those who claim that we are making changes to Medicare for \nother reasons. They say we are changing Medicare to balance the budget, \nor we are changing Medicare to lessen the tax burden on working \nfamilies.\n  Both of those claims are false. We are making changes to Medicare to \nsave the program, to strengthen Medicare so it can survive into the \nnext century. Even if we were not balancing the budget, we would need \nto save Medicare. And whether or not we cut taxes, we still need to \nsave Medicare. Any attempt to link the two is nothing more \n\n[[Page S 10871]]\nthan blue smoke and mirrors from the opponents of reform.\n  The Republicans in Congress have chosen to look toward Medicare's \nfuture. We decided this spring that we would save Medicare from \nbankruptcy, control the growth of program costs, and ensure that the \nprogram would survive past its 40th anniversary. We developed and \npassed a budget plan in June that guaranteed a strong Medicare into the \nnext century.\n  Suddenly, the President decided to join us. In June, he submitted a \nnew budget proposal, one which he claimed would save Medicare.\n  In June, the President made a good start. His budget would save $127 \nbillion from Medicare over the next 7 years. He is now comparing that \nwith our budget, which will slow the program's rate of growth by $270 \nbillion over the next 7 years.\n  If I believed that we could save Medicare by doing only what the \nPresident wants to do, I would do so in a second. But, after a long, \nhard look at the numbers, and after extensive discussions with the \nCongressional Budget Office, I do not think the President's plan saves \nMedicare.\n  You see, the President has assumed that the costs of the program will \nnot grow as fast as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  The President's June budget assumes that a serious Medicare problem \ndoes not exist. He says the problem is not as hard to solve as CBO says \nit is. The President is much more optimistic in his assumptions than \nCBO.\n  I wish that were true, but I am afraid it is not. As much as the \nPresident wishes it would, the problem will not go away.\n  The President has come a long way since his first budget in January. \nNow all he has to do is agree to use the honest, objective, and \nnonpartisan CBO numbers, and we will have an excellent starting point \nfor discussions.\n  All he has to do is live up to the commitment he made in his first \nState of the Union address, his promise that he would use CBO numbers.\n  We in Congress use CBO numbers. The honest, responsible way to budget \nis to rely on a single source for our assumptions, and that is what we \ndid both in our budget plan, and in our plan to save Medicare. We did \nnot make the problem go away by wishing that it would. We asked CBO and \nthe trustees what it would take to save Medicare, to keep it alive for \nits 40th anniversary.\n  The Trustees have told us what we must do. Now we are going to do it.\n  We are going to slow the rate of growth of the program. Medicare \nspending will grow 6.4 percent per year under our plan. Over the next 7 \nyears, Medicare spending is going to increase from $4,800 per person, \nto $6,700 per person.\n  I know that older Americans are seriously concerned about the future \nthey will leave to their children and their grandchildren. I have found \nthat senior citizens are extremely concerned about the crushing burden \nof the debt that our current policies will place on their \ngrandchildren.\n  And I know they want a Medicare program that is fair, both for them, \nand for future generations. I also know that a 65-year old couple that \nstarts receiving Medicare this year will, over their lifetimes, receive \n$117,000 more in Medicare benefits than they will put into the system \nin payroll taxes and premiums.\n  I know that this will concern many seniors, who want Medicare to be \nthere in the future for them, for their kids, and for their \ngrandchildren.\n  We are going to spend nearly 5 percent more per year on each Medicare \nbeneficiary in this budget. So anyone who tells you that we are cutting \nMedicare is just trying to scare you.\n  What honestly should scare America's senior and disabled citizens is \nthe prospect that we will do nothing. For if we do nothing, seniors \nwill have hospital benefits for only 7 more years.\n  If we do nothing, seniors will be able to keep their doctor, but only \nfor the next 7 years. After that, you will still have your doctor, but \nhe will not be able to treat you in a hospital. After that, the \nhospital insurance trust fund will run out of money, and Medicare will \nnot be able to pay hospital benefits.\n  I want to make sure that our seniors can keep their existing \ncoverage.\n  I want to give them the opportunity to choose other health plans, \njust like my colleagues and I in the Senate can choose our health \nplans.\n  And most important, I want to make sure that they can do all these \nthings for more than just the next 7 years.\n  In September, we are going to report legislation that will strengthen \nMedicare. We are going to simplify Medicare. And we are going to make \nsure that every Medicare beneficiary has the right to choose their \nhealth plan, just like my fellow Senators and I have.\n  We need to strengthen Medicare, and that we have to do this by \ncontrolling the program's rate of growth. The first thing we are doing \nis attacking the waste and fraud in the system. Every senior currently \nreceiving Medicare knows that the system is inefficient, complex, and \nfilled with opportunities for waste and fraud. We are going after that \nmoney first.\n  But all the experts tell us that will not be enough. We are going to \ndo it, but then we are going to have to look at changes to the program, \nin both the short and the long run.\n  In the short run, we are going to look at how much we pay doctors and \nhospitals, and the way we pay doctors and hospitals for the services \nyou receive. We are going to try to create the right incentives so that \ndoctors and hospitals are smart about how they spend your money.\n  Most importantly, we are going to offer seniors more choices. As a \nU.S. Senator, I have the ability to choose my health plan once a year. \nIf I want a generous program with lots of benefits and no deductible, I \npay a bit more. In some areas of the country, Medicare already allows \nseniors these choices.\n  We are going to expand this program, and gradually change the system \nso that all seniors have choices like we have in the Senate.\n  Some seniors are going to have to pay a little bit more. There is no \nway we can get around that. But we are going to come to the seniors \nlast, after we have attacked the waste and fraud in the system, after \nwe have made changes to the way we pay doctors and hospitals, and after \nwe have started to phase in changes that provide seniors with more \nchoices.\n  Any changes we make will be phased in gradually over time. We know \nthat seniors on fixed incomes have difficulty adjusting to dramatic \nchanges, and we are taking that into account.\n  We also know that some seniors with higher incomes have a greater \nability to adapt to changes than others. We may ask those seniors to \npay a bit more, to compensate for those who have just enough income to \nget by.\n  I will not let Medicare go bankrupt. Yes, I too celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of Medicare. It has been an important program, critical to \nthe health of American's older and disabled citizens.\n  But right now, I am thinking about how we are going to make sure \nMedicare has a 40th anniversary and beyond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been 1 year since the start of the \nterrible wildfires which burned through Idaho last summer. Lightning \nstrikes ignited our forests, already suffering from poor forest health, \nand raged through Idaho, causing devastation to 738,000 acres, one-\nfifth of the nationwide total acres burned in 1994.\n  I am here to tell the story, as it has been written so far, of the \n1994 Idaho fires, and the slow progress of reforestation and timber \nsalvage. The fires began in late July, and by early September, 14,000 \nfirefighters had been employed across the State. Early on, Dave \nAlexander, forest supervisor on the Payette National Forest, called to \nalert me that with the dry conditions and already-dead forests adding \nfuel, the fires could not be stopped short of \n\n[[Page S 10872]]\nreaching the Salmon River after a run of 25 to 30 miles.\n  Dave Alexander was right. The fires were stopped at the Salmon River \nand extinguished only when the snows arrived in October. By then, \nIdaho's fires had cost $150 million to fight and an estimated 2 billion \nboard feet of timber had burned. And, of course, the habitat for the \nwildlife of the area was devastated.\n  By Forest Service estimates, as much as 665 million board feet of the \nburned timber was salvageable, with a potential revenue of $325 \nmillion. Remember, 25 percent of this revenue would be returned to \nlocal counties for schools and roads. In Idaho, Shoshone County \nofficials have watched their budget drop sharply because of the lack of \nnational forest timber sales. They are desperate for some solutions to \ntheir situation. They are among many who have pointed out the absurdity \nof no timber sales being offered while dead forests abound. Equally \nconcerned are the 100 former employees of the Ida-Pine sawmill which \nclosed for lack of timber supply, while watching the nearby forests \nburn up.\n  Unfortunately the value of burned trees drops rapidly over time. Time \nis the primary factor in accomplishing timber salvage and replanting \nthe burn. The consequences of leaving burned forests untreated are both \nenvironmental and financial. Not only is it a waste of potential \nrevenue to the U.S. Treasury and the counties, it encourages future \nwildfire. If left standing, dead trees become conduits for lightning \nand may cause a re-burn, fueled by the ready supply of fallen trees \nnever removed from the first fire. This scenario is no boon to fish and \nwildlife habitat, either.\n  So, it made sense to mount an aggressive timber salvage program on \nthe Boise and Payette National Forests. On the Boise alone, an \nestimated 2,600 jobs would be created by the salvage operations. These \ntwo forests have been moving as quickly as possible under current law. \nBut the laws and regulations, prior to enactment of the fiscal year \n1995 rescissions bill with its salvage provisions, simply did not \npermit the Forest Service to act quickly enough. Rather, they \nconstituted a formula for inaction and delay.\n  Let me tell you why. First, both forests have been slogging their way \nthrough eight separate NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act] \ndocuments, five of them environmental impact statements.\n  Consider the fact that the Forest Service even finds it necessary to \nprepare five environmental impact statements. When NEPA was enacted in \n1969, EIS's were to be done only in the case of a major Federal action. \nNow, driven by the courts, the Forest Service is compelled to conduct \nan EIS just to sell dead, burned trees. You tell me how this makes \nsense.\n  Consider also, that preservation groups have found a new method to \ndelay and obstruct completion of these NEPA documents. They \ndeliberately use the Freedom of Information Act as a harassment tool. \nThe Boise National Forest has responded to 45 separate FOIA requests at \na cost of more than $50,000. On the Payette, the number of FOIA \nrequests has quadrupled, and a new, full-time position was created at a \ncost of $20,000 to handle the responses. One FOIA request was expected \nto take 670 hours of staff time to respond, thereby diverting staff \naway from salvage preparations.\n  It is this type of delay and added expense which causes me and other \nSenators to argue the need for streamlining the current rules as we \nhave done in the rescissions bill, which is now law. Without the help \nof the Congress to clear some of the procedural path, timber salvage \nwould be nearly impossible to accomplish.\n  The continuing story of the 1994 Idaho wildfires is a case in point. \nAs of July 1, not one stick of burnt timber had yet been salvaged from \nthe Boise or Payette National Forests. Not 1 acre of the burned forest \nhas been replanted with trees, because the reforestation would be paid \nfor by salvage receipts. The State forests had been salvaged. The \nadjoining private ownerships had been salvaged, but not the Federal \nlands.\n  Now those decisions are finally being made on the EIS's, those \ndecisions have been appealed and held up by proponents of gridlock. I \nintend to come to the floor again soon to continue this story. I will \nfollow the story as it unfolds. It will demonstrate why it is \nimperative that Congress provide relief in some form to free salvage \nsales from the burden of the unnecessary and costly procedures in place \nnow. Salvage provisions in the rescission law are only temporary. They \nwill expire in December 1996. With that in mind, I will press forward \nwith S. 391, the long-term forest health bill I introduced in February. \nMore on that with the next chapter of this story.\n  For now, please take note--665 million board feet awaits salvage; as \nof July 1, no timber salvage had done; no reforestation had been done; \nand 11 months had passed in preparing NEPA documents. Now those \ndecisions are being appealed.\n  Soon I will be back to talk about the fires of 1994, the devastation \nand the destruction, and ways this Congress and this country can move \nto a better procedure to manage our national forests.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I feel it is important to talk on the 30th \nanniversary of the passing of Medicare and especially after listening \nto some of the statements made by my friend, the senior Senator from \nthe State of New Mexico while I was in the Chamber.\n  It is important that we recognize Medicare is a program that is \nreally working. It is a program that has separated us from other \ncountries, made our senior citizens able to receive the care, medical \ncare in general, that they need. Certainly there needs to be \nimprovements made in the Medicare system, and we should make those. But \nI think the across-the-board cuts we have in the budget resolution that \nis now before this body are really out of line.\n  Mr. President, just so we can understand, these cuts really do affect \npeople. These cuts are not just farfetched, in the imagination of the \nSenator from Nevada. Republicans are proposing to cut more than $450 \nbillion from health care between 1996 and 2002, $270 billion of these \ndollars from Medicare and $182 billion from Medicaid. In combination, \nthese cuts are more than four times anything ever enacted. Most of the \n$270 billion in Medicare cuts would not be necessary without the \nRepublicans' $245 billion tax cut.\n  Over a 7-year period, the combined Medicare and Medicaid cuts of the \nRepublicans would reduce Federal health care dollars to Nevada by $2 \nbillion--the small State of Nevada by over $2 billion. Each of Nevada's \n182,000 Medicare beneficiaries would pay as much as $3,000 more in \npremiums and copayments. Couples would pay at least $6,000 more. \nOverall, the State of Nevada would lose $533 million in Medicare \nfunding in 2002 and $2 billion over 7 years.\n  In Medicaid, overall, the State of Nevada would lose $157 million in \nFederal Medicaid funding in 2002 and $516 million over the 7 years, a \nreduction of 29 percent in the year 2002 alone, and this is according \nto the Urban Institute. This will have a devastating impact on the \nState's current almost 100,000 recipients. According to this study, \nthese cuts would mean that Nevada would have to cut off coverage to \nover 25,000 recipients, likely adding them to the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  Mr. President, we all heard the speeches early on. The distinguished \nmajority leader before the election said:\n\n\n[[Page S 10873]]\n\n       President Clinton and Vice President Gore are resorting to \n     scare tactics falsely accusing Republicans of secret plans to \n     cut Medicare benefits. This was reported widely. I just \n     selected the Washington Post in November of last year.\n\n  The Republican National Committee chairperson, Haley Barbour, said:\n\n       The outrage, as far as I am concerned is the Democrats' big \n     lie campaign that the Contract With America would require \n     huge Medicare cuts. It would not.\n\n  This was reported a number of places after Barbour made the speech, \nbut I have chosen here CNN Late Edition, November 6, 1994.\n  But what has happened after the election?\n\n       The GOP plan: $270 billion in Medicare cuts--\n\n  This does not count almost $200 billion more in Medicaid cuts--\n\n     the largest Medicare cuts in history; seniors pay $900 more a \n     year in out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\n  Those are the facts. We cannot escape it. To my friend from New \nMexico, I say clearly, of course we have got to make some changes in \nMedicare. But we should do it with congressional hearings, like we do \nother things responsibly around here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10872-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

In the Senate all but one of the 54 Republicans \nsupported the balanced budget amendment; only 13 Democrats supported \nit. Since a two-third-vote--67 Senators--is necessary to approve a \nconstitutional amendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one \nvote. There will be another vote later this year or next year.\n  Mr. President, as of the close of business Thursday, July 27, the \nFederal debt--down to the penny--stood at exactly $4,948,216,665,542.90 \nor $18,783.51 for every man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10873-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MEDICARE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this Sunday marks the 30th anniversary of \nthe Medicare Program's enactment into law. On July 30, 1965 President \nLyndon Johnson traveled to Independence, MO, to sign the bill creating \nMedicare with President Harry Truman looking on. President Truman, of \ncourse, had proposed the creation of a national health insurance \nprogram in 1948. But it took 17 years of discussion and debate, several \nfailed attempts in Congress, and the work of the Truman, Kennedy, and \nJohnson administrations, before the stage was set for Democrats to \nbuild on Social Security's successes and further guarantee security for \nour Nation's elderly and disabled citizens.\n  Thirty years ago, Medicare's detractors tried to rally opponents with \ncries of socialized medicine and forecasts of Medicare's impending \nfailure. Since that time, we have witnessed the positive impact that \nMedicare has had on the lives of seniors and disabled beneficiaries, as \nwell as their families. Few can deny Medicare's accomplishments. By \nensuring access to necessary and appropriate medical services, Medicare \ncontinues to help millions of Americans lead dignified and independent \nlives--free from worry that even a minor illness or injury could \ndevastate both their personal, and their family's, financial security.\n  Medicare is not a perfect health insurance program. Congress \ncontinues to work to control Federal health spending, and the elderly \nmust still confront the ever-increasing costs of treatment for \ncatastrophic illness, long-term care, and prescription drugs. However, \ntoday's seniors enjoy their retirement years in better health and with \na greater sense of security than most thought possible 30 years ago.\n  Ten years ago, I made a brief statement to mark Medicare's 20 year \nanniversary. In that statement, I discussed the efforts that Congress \nhad made to expand benefits, improve the quality of Medicare services, \nand address the explosion of health care spending. As we all know, the \nCongress has not solved all of the health care challenges I outlined \nthat day, and today the Medicare program may be facing its greatest \ntest. But Mr. President, Congress is confronting Medicare's current \nfiscal challenge with a radically different spirit and attitude than it \nhad in the past.\n  Until recently, the Medicare debate was centered around the \ncommitment to keeping our compact with America's seniors by ensuring \nMedicare's long-term solvency, while also expanding beneficiaries' \naccess to services and improving the quality of care. The recent budget \nresolution's $270 billion Medicare cut--which has been disguised as a \nMedicare rescue--is actually nothing more than an attempt to extract \nthe maximum amount of budget savings from the Medicare Program.\n  Somehow the Medicare reform debate has become a discussion about how \nthe Congress can balance the Federal budget and give tax breaks to the \nrich, instead of how our country can provide health care and security \nfor the elderly and disabled. Let us put aside the political posturing \nsurrounding the budget debate and sit down to figure out what is best \nfor the 37 million Americans who are served by Medicare, and the \nmillions more expected to join the rolls in the future.\n  Mr. President, these days Americans are very cynical about their \ngovernment. We should not confirm the public's fear that Members of \nCongress are trying to gain political advantage from Medicare's fiscal \ncrises, rather we must take action to restore the public confidence \nwhile restoring the stability of Medicare. A generation that has given \nso much should not be burdened with higher premiums and deductibles or \ndecreased benefits. Older American's financial security should not be \nsacrificed for partisan gain.\n  I recognize the limits of Medicare in this time of tight budgets and \ndownsizing of government, but I also believe that by working together, \nwe can fulfill a pledge made three decades ago and honor our commitment \nto today's seniors, and future generations of older Americans.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10873-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              GIFT REFORM\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to state briefly the reasons why I \nvoted today in support of S. 1061, the bill to reform the rules of the \nSenate regarding the acceptance of gifts by Members and employees of \nthe Senate. That measure, of course, was approved by a resounding, \nbipartisan vote of 98-0.\n  Mr. President, in the 103d Congress, I was pleased to support S. \n1935, the Congressional Gifts Reform Act, which was approved by the \nSenate on May 11, 1994, by a vote of 95 to 4. Ultimately, however, S. \n1935 did not become law because it was combined in conference with a \ncontroversial lobbying reform measure. As a result, the conference \nreport was not approved by the Senate.\n  I am pleased, Mr. President, that the Senate has now revisited the \nissue and has succeeded in reforming its Rules regarding gifts. S. \n1061, as adopted by the Senate today, represents a reasonable \ncompromise among the competing proposals for gift reform. In general, \nMembers and employees of the Senate will be permitted to accept only \nnon-monetary gifts with a value of less than $50, with a total \ncumulative value of no more than $100, in any calendar year from any \nperson, corporation, or organization. No gift with a value below $10, \nhowever, will count towards the $100 annual limit.\n  As a member of the Select Committee on Ethics, I am strongly \ncommitted to keeping the ethical standards of the Senate above \nreproach. The new gift standard under which the Senate will be \noperating will make an important contribution to enhancing public \nconfidence in the Senate as an institution.\n  I want especially to commend the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, \nMitch McConnell, for his exemplary leadership in working to achieve the \ncompromise that resulted in the unanimous passage of S. 1061. It is my \nprivilege to serve under Senator McConnell's leaderships as the \nchairman of the Select Committee on Ethics. He does an outstanding job \nof leading that important Select Committee under what are sometimes \ndifficult circumstances.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10873-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 10874]]\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH IRAQ--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 69\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nfamily-owned business exclusion from the gross estate subject to estate \ntax, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the american family-owned business act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nFamily-Owned Business Act--a bill that will preserve the American \nfamily and save jobs across the country.\n  I am proud that this bill was developed on a bipartisan basis, led on \nthe Democratic side by my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Pryor. We \nare joined by Senators Roth, Baucus, Pressler, Breaux, Simpson, Bond, \nD'Amato, Grassley, Nickles, Helms, Warner, Gregg, Bennett, Lugar, \nSnowe, Abraham, Burns, Lott, Ashcroft, Coats, Inhofe, Hutchison, \nStevens, Murkowski, Kassebaum, Kerrey, Cohen, and Hatch.\n  The current Federal estate tax is just too burdensome on the American \nfamily. Time and time again, farmers and other business owners across \nthe country have told me that estate tax rates are just too high. They \nrise quickly from 18 to 55 percent, effectively making the Government a \n50-50 partner in a family business.\n  Even the most sophisticated estate tax planning and the purchase of \nlife insurance cannot sufficiently mitigate the effects of these high \nrates, leaving families no recourse but to sell their businesses to pay \nthe estate tax. This bill will stop these forced sales from happening \nagain.\n  I agree with many who say that estate tax rates should be reduced \nacross the board, or repealed entirely. And I hope that we do that some \nday. But today we take an important first step with the American \nFamily-Owned Business Act.\n  This bill cuts estate tax rates in half and also creates a new \nexclusion that completely eliminates the estate tax for small \nbusinesses.\n  Under the new exclusion, family-owned businesses can exempt up to \n$1.5 million of family business assets from their estate. If a family \nbusiness is valued at more than $1.5 million, the excess is taxed at \none-half of the current rates--thus providing a maximum tax rate of \n27.5 percent.\n  My colleagues and I introduce this bill to protect and preserve \nfamily enterprises. We know too well the adverse impact of an estate \ntax-forced sale. The family loses its livelihood, the family business \nemployees lose their jobs, and the community suffers.\n  We must do all that we can to help family-owned businesses not only \nsurvive, but also prosper. They are the job creators in this country. \nIn the 1980's alone, family businesses accounted for an increase of \nmore than 20 million private-sector jobs.\n  By relieving families from the burden of the estate tax and letting \nthem keep their business, they can continue to prosper. And when \nfamilies continue to operate their businesses, we all benefit--the \nbusiness employees keep their jobs, the Government receives income \ntaxes on business profits, and the families retain their livelihood.\n  The estate tax is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, or one \nthat affects only rural or urban families. There are farmers, ranchers, \nor other family businesses in each State that would benefit from this \nlegislation. That is why this bill is supported by dozens of groups, \neach listed at the conclusion of this statement.\n  Many of my colleagues have introduced bills to provide estate tax \nrelief in various situations. These bills include important ideas, many \nof which are reflected in the American Family-owned Business Act. As we \nbegin the process of providing estate tax relief, we hope to work \nclosely with the sponsors of these other bills, and to work toward \ncommon goals. We encourage those Senators who have sponsored their own \nbills to sign on to this one and work toward a single package of estate \ntax relief.\n  As we intend, the American Family-Owned Business Act provides relief \nfor family businesses across the country--from the tree farmer in the \nNortheast or the rancher in the Southwest, to the farmer in the Midwest \nor the corner grocery store owner in the South.\n  The bill requires heirs to participate in the family business. These \nparticipation rules are deliberately flexible and recognize that \ndifferent family businesses need differing levels of participation by \nheirs. For example, the bill recognizes that owners of tree farms may \nparticipate at a level lower than that of owners of other businesses, \nsince tree farming often does not require continuous attention as do \nother farming activities.\n  This bill provides the critical relief needed for American families' \nbusinesses. We urge all our colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nother material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, sometimes it appears that government has \ndeclared war on the family farm and small business. This is an irony, \ngiven the fact that these historic American institutions are the \nbackbone of our economy. We all know the statistics--how since the \nearly 1970's, small businesses have created two out of every three new \njobs--how our family farms have helped turn America into the most \nproductive agricultural provider in the world.\n  On previous occasions, I've come to the floor to detail how \ngovernment, time and again, has tried to kill the goose that lays the \ngolden egg. Not only are small businesses and our family farms feeling \nthe crunch from Federal taxation and over-regulation, but they are \ngetting hit on the local level, as well. When Congress increases \nregulations--when Congress hits small business men and women with tax \nincreases--rarely are these regulations and increases considered in \nlight of the State and local taxes these men and women are paying. \nFortune magazine reports that the tax liability of small businesses is \none of the fastest rising, especially through the increases of property \ntaxes--taxes which have a profound impact on our farmers.\n  On top of this tremendous tax and regulatory load that small business \nowners and family farmers must bear in life, the Federal Government \neven refuses to allow them peace in death. In fact, in many cases the \nway the tax code is written today, the death of a small business man or \nwoman in a family-owned enterprise brings about what can only be \nconsidered a hostile takeover by the government.\n  Under current law, when the key member of a family-owned business \ndies, the Federal Government mandates an estate tax that can reach as \nhigh as 55 percent. Fifty-five percent, Mr. President. Think about \nthat. It can make the Federal Government literally the majority owner \nof a business that a family has worked for years to build.\n  If a government takeover isn't bad enough, the families involved soon \nrealize that Uncle Sam doesn't even want to keep the business. He's not \ninterested in a partnership. He just wants his pound of flesh, even if \nit kills the enterprise. Time again, this has happened as wonderful, \nhard-working, risk-taking spouses and children--valiant souls who have \noften sacrificed for the family cause--are forced by old Uncle Sam to \nsell the company or farm just to pay the taxes.\n  If all this seems familiar, Mr. President, it is. It's familiar to \nanyone who's ever seen an old Vaudeville melodrama. If you can't pay \nthe taxes, you lose the family farm. Well, Mr. President, all that \nchanges with this legislation--legislation I have authored with \nSenators Dole and Pryor. And frankly, I don't mind playing the role of \nDudley Dooright, along with these distinguished colleagues and a host \nof others who have cosponsored this legislation. In fact, I'm pleased \nto be a champion of small business, especially when I hear stories like \nthose I shared in our press conference today.\n  These are stories about real people--about an elderly woman from \nDelaware who, upon her death, left her family farm to her five \nchildren. They wanted the farm. They wanted it to remain in the family. \nIt was valued at over $2 million. But in came Uncle Sam--just like in \nthe melodrama--and demanded estate taxes of almost $1 million. Now Mr. \nPresident, it's not hard to understand how a hard-working family can \nbuild a farm that's worth $2 million, especially when you consider \ninflation. For good land and well-kept equipment, that's not an \nexorbitant amount of money.\n  But it's almost impossible to see how those who inherit the farm are \nable to keep it when they also inherit a million dollar tax liability.\n  In another case, an elderly couple from southern Delaware is \ncurrently struggling to plan their estate so it adequately provides for \ntheir handicapped daughter while it also allows their son to continue \nthe family farming operation. Unfortunately, with a projected estate \ntax bill of over $500,000, it is most likely that they also will have \nto sell their family farm just to appease Uncle Sam's insatiable \nappetite for taxes.\n  Mr. President, it's time for change. And the legislation I've \nauthored--legislation to provide estate tax relief--is an important \nmeasure toward creating the change we need. The Family Business Estate \nTax Relief Act--completely bipartisan legislation--will exempt from the \nestate tax a full $1.5 million of the value of the deceased \nindividual's interest in a family business. If the business or farm is \nworth more than $1.5 million, our legislation cuts the additional tax \nrate in half.\n  This exemption and rate cut are in addition to the current law's \nexclusion for up to $600,000 in personal and business assets. In this \nway, a family could protect a business valued up to $4.2 million, if \nthat business were owned by a husband and wife. To make certain that \nthe tax relief is going to protect family-owned businesses, our \nlegislation requires that surviving members keep the business for up to \nten years. It applies only to businesses that are family owned and that \nare located within the United States.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is important not only for our \nfamilies, but for our Nation. It restores proper perspective to what \nthis political experiment is all about--encouraging the American Dream. \nThere is nothing more important to that dream than the family, its \nbusiness, and its farm. I encourage all my colleagues to join us in \nthis bipartisan effort to once again make Uncle Sam a relative that \nfolks will want to see come visit.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN:\n  S. 1088. A bill to provide for enhanced penalties for health care \nfraud, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the health care fraud and abuse prevention act of 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced S. \n245, the Health Care Fraud Prevention Act. This bill, which was \ncosponsored by a bipartisan group of 21 Senators, was similar to \nlegislation I introduced last year that ultimately was incorporated \ninto a number of the major comprehensive health care reform proposals. \nUnfortunately, hopes for enactment of my fraud and abuse proposal faded \nsince comprehensive health care reform was not passed by the Congress \nlast year.\n  Regardless of whether we enact overall health care reform, it is \nvital that we no longer delay in adopting tough measures to crack down \non the fraud and abuse that robs billions of dollars from our health \ncare system each year. Estimates are that we are losing as much as $100 \nbillion each year to health care fraud and abuse, with as much as 30 \npercent of those losses to the Medicare and Medicaid programs alone. As \nwe embark upon the debate on how to achieve savings in, and control the \ngrowth of, Medicare and Medicaid, we must not overlook the very real \nsavings that can be obtained by \n\n[[Page S 10879]]\nclosing the doors of these programs to fraud and abuse.\n  Since I introduced S. 245 in January of this year, I have solicited \ncomments on this legislation from a host of law enforcement agencies, \nhealth care provider groups, and experts in criminal law and health \ncare. My purpose in seeking and reviewing comments on my legislation \nwas to ensure that health care fraud legislation be tough on those who \nintentionally scam or defraud the health care system, but also be fair \nand workable in practice, and not inadvertently penalize honest health \ncare providers who inadvertently run afoul of complicated \nhealth care regulations. I strongly believe that it is necessary, and \npossible, to strike the appropriate balance of being very tough on \nhealth care fraud while not entrapping or unduly burdening health care \nproviders and businesses who are simply trying to follow the rules.\n  The bill that I am introducing today reflects this delicate balance. \nIt is the product of many months of work by my staff on the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging to respond to comments by\n many experts in law enforcement, health care, and the health care \nprovider community. The changes made to S. 245 by this legislation I am \nintroducing today are both comprehensive in nature and extremely \nworkable.\n\n  For example, this bill alters the extension of the Social Security \nAct anti-kickback statute and civil monetary penalties. Under this \nlegislation, these penalties would be extended to cover all Federal \nHealth Care Programs, not just Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Another major change deals with the exclusion of individuals from \nMedicare for certain health care fraud violations. Under the proposal I \nam introducing today, the reach of this exclusion has been refined from \nmy previous legislation so that individuals not directly involved in \nthe fraudulent activity would not be unduly penalized or discouraged \nfrom serving on boards of hospitals or other health care organizations. \nThis legislation contains many other refinements to S. 245 that will go \nfar in achieving coordinated, effective, and fair response to health \ncare fraud and abuse.\n  Mr. President, the costs of health care fraud and abuse to our health \ncare system are staggering: As much as 10 percent of U.S. health care \nspending is lost to fraud and abuse each year. For Medicare and \nMedicaid, the Federal Government pays as much as $27 billion each year \nin fraudulent and abusive claims. Enactment of this legislation \ntherefore has the potential to save the taxpayers and American public \nmillions, if not billions of dollars each year.\n  I would like to thank all those individuals from law enforcement and \nthe health care industry who have come forth with pragmatic and \ncreative solutions to a growing and pernicious problem, and I ask \nunanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the changes \nhave been made to S. 245 and a copy of my legislation be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title--\n       (1) The term ``automatic data processing equipment'' (ADPE) \n     has the same meaning as in section 111(a)(2) of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. \n     759(a)(2)).\n       (2) The term ``billing code abuse'' means the submission to \n     medicare carriers of claims for services that include \n     procedure codes that do not appropriately describe the total \n     services provided or otherwise violate medicare payment \n     policies.\n       (3) The term ``commercial item'' has the same meaning as in \n     section 4(12) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act \n     (41 U.S.C. 403(12)).\n       (4) The term ``medicare part B'' means the supplementary \n     medical insurance program authorized under part B of title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j-1395w-4).\n       (5) The term ``medicare carrier'' means an entity that has \n     a contract with the Health Care Financing Administration to \n     determine and make medicare payments for medicare part B \n     benefits payable on a charge basis and to perform other \n     related functions.\n       (6) The term ``payment policies'' means regulations and \n     other rules that govern billing code abuses such as \n     unbundling, global service violations, double billing, and \n     unnecessary use of assistants at surgery.\n       (7) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                Section-by-Section of Changes to S. 245\n\n       Fraud and Abuse Control Program: The All-payer Fraud and \n     Abuse Control Program is now called the Fraud and Abuse \n     Control Program as extensions of certain Social Security Act \n     provisions will be extended to federal programs only.\n       The HHS Secretary and the Attorney General will be able to \n     establish the coordinated anti-fraud and abuse control \n     program by guidelines rather than by regulation.\n       The section relating to the disclosure of ownership \n     information is deleted as the Inspector General already has \n     standards relating to the disclosure of this information.\n       Technical corrections were made to the section on ensuring \n     access to documentation.\n       Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control: The provision is \n     clarified so that funds that are dedicated to anti-fraud \n     activities must go through the appropriations process so that \n     there is proper congressional oversight.\n       Anti-Kickback Statute: The Social Security Act Anti-\n     Kickback statute is extended to all federal health care \n     programs (it currently applies only to the Medicare and \n     Medicaid program). The statute would not be extended to \n     private health care plans.\n       Health Care Fraud and Abuse Guidance: In order to give \n     better guidance to the health care industry, the Inspector \n     General is required to issue interpretive rulings within 90 \n     days of the date of request. If the Inspector General does \n     not issue an interpretive ruling, it shall notify the \n     requestor within sixty days of the request and give the \n     reasons for denial. Clarifies that a ``substantive ruling'' \n     is defined as it appears in the Administrative Procedure Act.\n       Deletes the requirement that, in order to issue a special \n     fraud alert, the Inspector General shall consult the Attorney \n     General.\n       Reporting of Fraudulent Activities under Medicare: Deletes \n     the requirement that the HHS Secretary establish a program \n     through which Medicare beneficiaries may report fraud to the \n     Secretary, since such a program has been established.\n       Mandatory Exclusion from Participation in Medicare and \n     Medicaid: Clarifies that mandatory exclusion from \n     participation in Medicare and Medicaid is limited\n      to those individuals convicted of a felony relating to \n     health care fraud. A permissive exclusion is created for \n     those convicted of other types of government fraud.\n       Permissive Exclusion of Individuals with Ownership or \n     Control Interest in Sanctioned Entities: Clarifies that \n     permissive exclusion of individuals with controlling interest \n     in sanctioned entities be limited to those who are either \n     officers of, or managing employees of, the entity and deletes \n     references to those individuals who might sit on the board of \n     directors or who might be an agent of the entity. Deletes the \n     exclusion authority for those convicted of a civil monetary \n     penalty (but retains the conviction and exclusion \n     requirements).\n       Intermediate Sanctions for Medicare HMO's: Sets up a \n     requirement that, before the application of intermediate \n     sanctions (civil monetary penalty of up to $10,000 per week) \n     on a Medicare HMO for program violations, the HHS Secretary \n     must determine that the HMO has failed to comply with a \n     corrective action plan within a reasonable amount of time. \n     Also states that the Secretary may impose intermediate \n     sanctions on a Medicare HMO if it is carrying out a contract \n     in a manner that is substantially inconsistent with the \n     efficient and effective administration of the underlying \n     section.\n       Health Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection Program: \n     Requires that final adverse actions that are reported to the \n     fraud and abuse data collection program indicate whether such \n     action is on appeal. Also requires that malpractice decisions \n     not be included in the data collection program and that an \n     identifying number be included along with the names of health \n     care providers, suppliers, or practitioners who are the \n     subject of final adverse actions and who are included in the \n     data collection program. Also exempts federal agencies from \n     paying fees for disclosure of such information.\n       Civil Monetary Penalties: The Social Security Act civil \n     monetary penalty provisions are extended to all federal \n     health care programs (it currently applies to only the \n     Medicare and Medicaid programs). Civil monetary penalties \n     would not be extended to all private health care plans.\n       Excluded Individual Retaining Ownership Or Control Interest \n     in Participating Entity: Deletes ``director, agent'' and \n     retains ``officer or managing employee.''\n       Claim for Item or Service Based on Incorrect Coding or \n     Medically Unnecessary Services: The imposition of a civil \n     monetary penalty for upcoding requires a pattern or practice \n     of presenting claims. It also changes the civil\n      monetary penalty standard in the case of upcoding from \n     ``knows or should knows'' to ``knows or has reason to \n     know'' that such action would result in a greater payment. \n     The standard for the imposition of a civil monetary \n     penalty for medically unnecessary services was changed to \n     ``knows or has reason to know'' as well.\n       Prohibition Against Offering Inducements to Individuals \n     Enrolled Under Programs or Plans: The term ``remuneration'' \n     does not include differentials in coinsurance and deductible \n     amounts as long as the differentials have been disclosed in \n     writing to all third party payors, beneficiaries and \n     providers. The differentials will meet the standards as \n     defined in regulations which the Secretary must promulgate \n     within 180 days. Remuneration also does not include \n     incentives given to individuals to promote the delivery of \n     preventive care as determined by the Secretary within 180 \n     days.\n       Health Care Fraud Statute: The ``Willful'' standard was \n     added to the knowledge standard of the Title 18 health care \n     fraud statute. In addition, if violations of the new health \n     care fraud statute result in serious bodily injury, the \n     violator may be subject to as much as a life imprisonment \n     sentence.\n       Forfeitures for Federal Health Care Offenses: The \n     forfeiture provision no longer allows the forfeiture of \n     property that is used in the commission of a health care \n     fraud offense but calls for the forfeiture of property that \n     constitutes or is derived (directly or indirectly) from the \n     proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense. Fraud in \n     the federal workmen's compensation program was also added to \n     the list of federal health care offenses.\n       False Statements: Technical corrections were made to the \n     false statement section so that a ``health plan'' is defined.\n       Voluntary Disclosure: The requirement to establish a \n     voluntary disclosure program is deleted since a similar \n     program was recently created.\n       Theft or Embezzlement in Connection with Health Care: \n     Technical corrections were made to the theft or embezzlement \n     section so that ``health plan'' is defined.\n\n[[Page S 10887]]\n\n       Authorized Investigative Demand Procedures: This section \n     gives authority to the Attorney General or a designee to \n     utilize an administrative subpoena for investigations with \n     respect to health care fraud. The Inspectors General \n     currently have this authority and this section gives the \n     Attorney General or a designee similar authority.\n       State Health Care Fraud Control Units: The State Medicaid \n     Control Unit authorization language has been changed so that \n     those units will have concurrent authority to investigate and \n     prosecute health care fraud in other Federal programs at the \n     approval of the relevant federal agency. Their authority to \n     investigate and prosecute patient abuse also has been \n     extended into non-Medicaid ``board and care'' facilities.\n       Commercial Technology for Medicare Claims Processing: This \n     section requires Medicare carriers to acquire commercial \n     automatic data processing equipment to process Medicare Part \n     B claims for the purpose of identifying billing code \n     abuse.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1089. A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act of 1990 to prevent and control the \ninfestation of Lake Champlain by zebra mussels, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the lake champlain zebra mussel control act\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nLake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act of 1995. A year ago, the Senate \naccepted my amendment to address the growing problem of zebra mussels \nand their threat to drinking water systems. Unfortunately, the House \ndid not concur, and now the problem has reached epidemic proportions.\n  We enter a critical stage in our efforts to preserve Lake Champlain \nand other Vermont lakes from a zebra mussel explosion that could become \nan economic and ecological catastrophe. Vermonters have feared the \narrival of this dreaded mollusk for a long time. We didn't ask for \nthem, and were powerless to prevent them from arriving on our \nlakeshores. But now they are with us--and they are multiplying out of \ncontrol.\n  In 1993 the mussel was discovered in the South Lake near Orwell, VT \nby a young boy who had learned how to identify the zebra mussel by a \nwallet-sized identification card distributed by the Lake Champlain \nBasin Program. During the summer of 1994, the zebra mussel larvae \nreached a density of about 1,500 to 3,000 per cubic meter. This year, \nless than 3 years from the mussels' introduction, the Rutland Herald \nreported that zebra mussel larvae densities have been found throughout \nthe lake at about 60,000 to 109,000 per cubic meter with some \nconcentrations as high as 134,000 per cubic meter--almost as high as \nthe worst sites in the Great Lakes.\n  The zebra mussels in Lake Champlain deserve immediate and swift \naction. This pest poses a serious risk to the water resources \nthroughout Vermont and the health and safety of the people of Vermont.\n  Twenty-five percent of Vermont's families rely on Lake Champlain for \ntheir drinking water. The onslaught of zebra mussels and their \nastonishing ability to establish dense colonies in a matter of weeks, \njeopardizes the intake pipes for water systems up and down the shore. \nMunicipal, residential, industrial, and even the water systems to \nmotors on recreation boats are threatened. Furthermore, the mussels \ndon't just clog the ends of the pipes. Zebra mussels have been known to \nestablish colonies in the piping system causing multiple effects on the \nquality of drinking water. A recent Cornell University report points \nout that\n\n       Once in a water intake line, zebra mussels can colonize any \n     part of the system from the mouth of the intake in the lake \n     or river to the distribution pipes within the residence. \n     Impacts of this colonization include loss of pumping \n     efficiency, obstruction of foot valves, putrefactive decay of \n     mussel flesh, production of obnoxious-tasting and foul-\n     smelling methane gas, and increased corrosion of steel, iron, \n     and copper pipes.\n\n  Another potential threat to Vermont is the zebra mussel's impact on \nVermont's fish stocking program. These mussels, reproducing at \nstaggering rates, can close off hatchery piping and are threatening the \nState's multi-million-dollar sport fishing economy. In fact, Vermont's \nlargest hatchery in Grand Isle, a $16 million facility, is risking \ntotal shut down if it loses its ongoing battle with the zebra mussel. \nWhen zebra mussels infest beaches, summer swimmers are forced to wear \nsneakers or sandals to avoid getting cut from the sharp shells. We can \nonly speculate what the impact will be on submerged shipwrecks, real \nestate, summer cottages, and the tourism industry.\n  Finally, the zebra mussels have arrived without their natural \ncompetitors and are spreading through the lake ecosystem unchecked. As \ncolonies develop throughout freshwater bodies, they could displace all \nseven native mussel species in the Lake Champlain Basin, including the \nendangered black sandshell mussel. Scientists say all species are at \nrisk because zebra mussels are known to colonize right on the backs of \nnative mussels and choke them off from food and fresh water. Zebra \nmussels could throw entire aquatic ecosystems out of balance by \ndisrupting the food chain, changing water chemistry, and altering \nphysical habitat.\n  Mr. President, 6 months ago I came to the Senate floor during the \ndebate on the unfunded mandates bill to warn people of the real \nunfunded mandates that our States face--zebra mussels is one of them. \nWhile most of my colleagues supported S. 1 in an attempt to ease \nfinancial burdens by relaxing national standards and undermine Federal \nregulations, I pointed out that without national standards, States face \nthe financial burdens of water pollution from upstream and out-of-State \npolluters, forest decay from acid rain, and flooding from wetland loss. \nToday, my State faces one of the financial burdens that could have been \ncontrolled with stricter national standards. I have already mentioned \nthe $16 million hatchery and the water systems for one-quarter of my \nState. My State of Vermont faces a problem with no known cure and the \ncosts could be astronomical. I hope that those who supported S. 1 to \nreduce State costs by limiting Federal standards recognize soon that \ntheir effort may have had the exact opposite effect.\n  My Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act would do five things to \naddress the present threat and prevent further spreading of zebra \nmussels throughout the country.\n  The Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act specifically includes \nLake Champlain in Federal programs designed to fight the zebra mussel. \nAs America's ``sixth Great Lake'' with one of the greatest emerging \nzebra mussel problems and a destination for thousands of boaters, it is \nessential that Lake Champlain be included in any national effort to \naddress the problem.\n  My bill also establishes national voluntary guidelines for \nrecreational boaters who are the chief mechanism for the spread of \nthese mussels within New England. These guidelines will help States \ninform boaters of the steps they can take personally to stop the spread \nof zebra mussels into new areas. With 70 million people living within 1 \nday's drive of Lake Champlian, the potential for the spread of these \nmussels to other lakes and waterways is great. All boaters will know \nthat this is a national concern with clear protocols on how to stop the \nspread, and States can choose to enforce the guidelines as mandatory \nregulations if\n they believe the threat is justified.\n\n  The legislation also allows States to work cooperatively on watershed \napproaches to the prevention and treatment of zebra mussels. If my \nState of Vermont devoted millions of dollars in time and resources to \nfight the mussel and our neighbors on Lake Champlain did nothing, the \neffort would be futile. Section 4 of my bill emphasizes that sometimes \nthe watershed-based efforts like those of the Lake Champlain Basin \nProgram are the best approaches to complex environmental problems.\n  The bill designates the University of Vermont as a Sea Grant College \neligible for zebra mussel funding. Ironically, the only State in New \nEngland with a confirmed zebra mussel problem is also the only State in \nNew England without a Sea Grant College. My bill changes this. Also, \nrecognizing that zebra mussels are not just a coastal problem or a \nGreat Lakes problem any more, my bill authorizes land-grant colleges to \ncompete for zebra mussel research funding.\n  Finally, my legislation reauthorizes the Aquatic Nuisance Species \nControl Act, Public Law 101-646, and extends the appropriations \nauthority through the year 2000. To address the current need to find \ncontrol solutions, my bill \n\n[[Page S 10888]]\ndoubles the current appropriation of the Army Corps of Engineers to $4 \nmillion. It is crucial that the Army Corps has adequate funding to \npursue zebra mussel control technology. Since the Army Corps has used \nits full authority in recent years, doubling the authorization will \nassure they have access to the proper resources to do a thorough job.\n  There is one further issue that my bill does not address, but \nrepresents an important piece of the fight to stop the introduction of \nnew exotic and harmful species. The lamprey and the zebra mussels were \nboth imported through the ballast tanks of international shippers. In \nrecent years, the ruffe, a small fish, was introduced the same way and \nwhile it is not yet in Lake Champlain, its population is expanding in \nthe Great Lakes. My colleagues Senator Glenn, the original author of \nthe Aquatic Nuisance Species Act, and Senator Sarbanes will introduce a \nbill that addresses the loopholes in current ballast water controls \nthat allow shippers to unleash these devastating and costly pests into \nour State waters. I hope to make America's fresh water resources \ncompletely off limits for expensive and damaging exotic pests. I look \nforward to working with Senators Glenn and Sarbanes to address all of \nthese issues comprehensively.\n  Mr. President, I present this bill with the hope that the Senate will \nact on it in a timely manner. Every minute that we delay allows the \nzebra mussels to multiply exponentially and risks the physical and \neconomic health of Vermont. To turn our backs on this problem of \nnational significance only guarantees that it gets much worse. Just ask \nmy colleagues who knew little or nothing about zebra mussels as \nrecently as a few years ago, and are now plagued by their \nexistence.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Brown and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1090. A bill to amend section 552 of title 5, United States Code \n(commonly known as the Freedom of Information Act), to provide for \npublic access to information in an electronic format, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     THE ELECTRONIC FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Brown \nand Kerry in introducing the Electronic Freedom of Information \nImprovement Act.\n  This bill would increase public access to the electronic records of \nFederal agencies, and take long overdue steps to alleviate the delays \nin processing requests for Government records. In the last Congress, a \nunanimous Judiciary Committee reported the bill, which then passed the \nSenate by voice vote on August 25, 1994.\n  The emerging national information infrastructure [NII] will consist \nof interconnected computer networks and databases that can put vast \namounts of information at users' fingertips. Such an information \ninfrastructure will give the public easy access to the immense volumes \nof information generated and held by the Government. Individual Federal \nagencies are already contributing to the development of the NII by \nusing technology to make Government information more easily accessible \nto our citizens. For example, the Internet Multicasting Service [IMS] \nnow posts massive Government data archives, including the Securities \nand Exchange Commission EDGAR database, and the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office database on the Internet free of charge. Similarly, \nFedWorld, a bulletin board available on the Internet, provides a \ngateway to more than 60 Federal agencies.\n  The Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act would \ncontribute to that information flow by increasing online access to \nGovernment information, including agency regulations, opinions, and \npolicy statements, and FOIA-released records that are the subject of \nrepeated requests.\n  Some agencies are taking important steps in this direction. For \nexample, the Department of Energy compiled a database of photographs \nand texts describing federally-sponsored tests of radiation on human \nbeings and put made that database available on the World Wide Web. Now, \ninstead of responding to multiple requests for the same documents on \nGovernment human irradiation experiments, DOE has efficiently used \ntechnology to make this material affirmatively available to interested \ncitizens. This bill would require all Federal agencies to make records \nthat are the subject of multiple FOIA requests available \nelectronically.\n  The bill would also require all Federal agencies to use technology to \nmake Government more accessible and accountable to its citizens by \nrequiring an assessment of how new computer systems will enhance agency \nFOIA operations to avoid erecting barriers that impede public access.\n  Federal agencies are increasingly dependent on computers to generate, \nstore and retrieve records electronically. This bill would ensure that \nthese electronic records are available, in a timely manner, to \nrequesters on the same basis as paper records. Specifically, the bill \nwould clarify that FOIA covers all agency information in any format and \nwould require agencies to release records in requested formats when \npossible.\n  The changes proposed in the bill are not just important for broader \ncitizen access to Government records. Government information is a \nvaluable commodity and a national resource. In fact, the Government is \nthe largest single producer and collector of information in the United \nStates. It is essential for American competitiveness that easy, fast \naccess to that resource be available.\n  We have recognized that Government must take advantage of the \nbenefits of new technologies to provide easier and broader \ndissemination of information. In 1993, we passed a law requiring that \npeople have online access to important Government publications, such as \nthe Federal Register, the Congressional Record and other documents put \nout by the Government Printing Office. Earlier this year, House Speaker \nNewt Gingrich unveiled ``Thomas,'' an electronic archive available on \nthe Internet that contains bills and congressional speeches. In his \nNational Performance Review, the Vice-President has described his \nvision of the electronic Government of the future, where information \ntechnology will enable people to have access to public information and \nservices when and where they want them.\n  Making Government information readily available electronically on \npeople's computers can help to revitalize citizens' interest in \nlearning what their Government is doing and better their understanding \nof the reasons underlying Government actions. This would, I believe, \nhelp reduce cynicism about Government.\n  This electronic FOIA bill is an important step forward in using \ntechnology to make Government more accessible and accountable to our \ncitizens.\n  In addition, Federal agencies must work to reduce the long delays, \nwhich in some agencies stretch to over 2 years, that it takes to give \nresponses to FOIA requests. Because of these delays, newspaper \nreporters, students and teachers and others working under time \ndeadlines, have been frustrated in using FOIA to meet their research \nneeds. This works to the detriment of us all.\n  These delays are intolerable. This is not the level of customer \nservice the American people deserve from their public servants. The \nAmerican taxpayer has paid for the collection and maintenance of this \ninformation and should get prompt access to it upon request. That is \nwhat the law requires and that is the standard of service Government \nagencies should meet. Long delays in access can mean no access at all.\n  The bill addresses the delay problem in several ways: first, the bill \ndoubles the 10 day statutory time limit to 20 days to give agencies a \nmore realistic time period for responding to FOIA requests. Second, the \nbill encourages agencies to implement a two-track processing system for \nsimple and complex requests. Third, the bill provides for expedited \naccess to requestors who demonstrate a compelling need for a speedy \nresponse. Finally, the bill gives agencies an incentive to comply with \nstatutory time limits by allowing agencies in compliance to retain half \nof their fees, instead of submitting those fees to the general treasury \nas is currently the case. The fees the agencies can keep will be \ndirected back to the agency FOIA operation to provide an incentive and \nresources to make these operations better and more efficient. \n\n[[Page S 10889]]\n\n  I look forward to working constructively with the administration and \npeople in the FOIA community to keep FOIA up-to-date with new \ntechnologies and to ensure FOIA is an effective tool for open \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-\nsection analysis, and a letter of support from 23 organizations \nrepresenting a substantial portion of the FOIA requestor community, be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Freedom of \n     Information Improvement Act of 1995''.\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to \n     require agencies of the Federal Government to make certain \n     agency information available for public inspection and \n     copying and to establish and enable enforcement of the right \n     of any person to obtain access to the records of such \n     agencies (subject to statutory exemptions) for any public or \n     private purpose;\n       (2) since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act \n     in 1966, and the amendments enacted in 1974 and 1986, the \n     Freedom of Information Act has been a valuable means through \n     which any person can learn how the Federal Government \n     operates;\n       (3) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the \n     disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing in the \n     Federal Government;\n       (4) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the \n     identification of unsafe consumer products harmful drugs, and \n     serious health hazards;\n       (5) Government agencies increasingly use computers to \n     conduct agency business and to store publicly valuable agency \n     records and information; and\n       (6) Government agencies should use new technology to \n     enhance public access to agency records and information.\n       (b) Purpsoes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency \n     records and information;\n       (2) improve public access to agency records and \n     information;\n       (3) ensure agency compliance with statutory time limits; \n     and\n       (4) maximize the usefulness of agency records and \n     information collected, maintained, used, retained, and \n     disseminated by the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This section also \n     acknowledges the increase in the government's use of \n     computers and specifies that agencies should use new \n     technology to enhance public access to government \n     information.\n       The purposes of this bill are to improve public access to \n     government information and records, and to reduce the delays \n     in agencies' responses to requests for records under the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\n               Section 3. Public Information Availability\n\n       This section requires agencies to publish a complete list \n     of statutes that the agency relies upon to withhold \n     information under subsection (b)(3) of the Act. Exemption \n     (b)(3) covers information that is specifically exempted from \n     disclosure by other statutes. These exemptions currently \n     appear in non-FOIA bills and decrease information available \n     to the public without review by the Judiciary Committee. In \n     order to prevent ill-considered exemptions to the access \n     mandate of the FOIA, this section would place specific \n     limitations on an agency's ability to rely on the authority \n     of (b)(3) exemption statutes when they have not passed \n     through prescribed legislative channels and have not been \n     previously brought to public attention through publication in \n     the Federal Register.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies \n     to use electronic media and formats, including public \n     networks, to make government information more easily \n     accessible and useful to the public. (OMB Circular A-130, \n     Revised, July 1994). To effectuate this goal, section 3 of \n     the bill requires that information, such as agency \n     regulations, which under the FOIA must be published in the \n     Federal Register, should be accessible by computer \n     telecommunications. The Government Printing Office Electronic \n     Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (``GPO Act''), \n     Pub. Law 103-40, already requires that the Federal Register \n     and certain other congressional publications, be made \n     available online. If an agency cannot make these materials \n     available online, then the information should be made \n     available in some other electronic form, such as CD-ROM or on \n     disc.\n\n\n Section 4. Materials Made Available In Electronic Format and Index of \n                  Records Made Available To The Public\n\n       The first part of this section would require that \n     materials, such as agency opinions and policy statements, \n     which an agency must ``make available for public inspection \n     and copying'' pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Section 552, be \n     made available electronically, as well as in hard copy. If an \n     agency cannot make these materials available online, then the \n     information should be made available in some other electronic \n     form, such as CD-ROM or on disc. The bill would thus treat \n     (a)(2) materials in the same manner as it treats (a)(1) \n     materials, which under the GPO Act are required, via the \n     Federal Register, to be made available online.\n       The second part of this section would require agencies to \n     publish in the Federal Register an index of all major \n     information systems containing agency records and a \n     description of any new major information system with a \n     statement of how it will enhance agency FOIA operations.\n       The third part of this section would require that an index \n     of any records released as the result of ``requests'' for \n     records pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of Section 552 must be \n     made available for public inspection and copying under \n     paragraph (a)(2). This would assist requesters in determining \n     which records have been the subject of prior FOIA requests. \n     Since requests for records provided in response to prior \n     requests are more readily identified by the agency without \n     the need for new searches, this index will assist agencies in \n     complying with the FOIA time limits.\n       Under the fourth part of this section, copies of records \n     disclosed in response to FOIA requests that the agency \n     determines have been or will likely be the subject of \n     additional requests, must be made available for public \n     inspection and copying in basically the same manner as the \n     materials required to made available under paragraph (a)(2). \n     As a practical matter, this would mean that copies of records \n     released in response to FOIA requests on a popular topic, \n     such as the assassinations of public figures, would \n     subsequently be treated as (a)(2) materials, which are made \n     available for public inspection and copying. This would \n     reduce the number of multiple FOIA requests for the same \n     records requiring separate agency responses.\n       The fifth part of this section would make clear that to \n     prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, \n     an agency may delete identifying details when it makes \n     available or publishes the index and copies of records \n     released in response to FIOA requests, as required under the \n     third and fourth parts of section 4 of this bill.\n       The final part of this section would, consistent with the \n     ``Computer Redaction'' requirement in Section 7 of the bill, \n     require that any deletions made in electronic records be \n     indicated at the place where such deletion was made.\n\n\n                  Section 5. Honoring Format Requests\n\n       This section would require agencies to assist requesters by \n     providing information in the form requested, if the agency \n     has the information available in that form. In other words, \n     requests for the electronic format of records, which are \n     usually not maintained or stored in electronic form, should \n     be honored when the records nevertheless exist and are \n     available in the requested electronic form.\n       This section would overrule Dismukes v. Department of the \n     Interior, 603 F. Supp. 760, 763 (D.D.C. 1984), which held \n     that an agency ``has no obligation under the FOIA to \n     accommodate plaintiff's preference [but] need only provide \n     responsive, nonexempt information in a reasonably accessible \n     form.''\n\n\n                           Section 6. Delays\n\n       Fees.--In an effort to decrease the delays experienced by \n     FOIA requesters, the bill would authorize agencies to retain \n     one-half of the fees they collect if the agency complies with \n     the statutory time limits for responding to requests. The fee \n     retention provisions of the bill would reward agencies that \n     meet the statutory time limits and should diminish the \n     burdens on agencies with particularly heavy FOIA workloads. \n     It will be very important to structure the compliance \n     criteria so that the reward system operates effectively and \n     without favoring any class of requesters over other classes.\n       Payment of the Expenses of the Person Making A Request.--\n     The current statute allows for the award of attorneys' fees \n     and \n\n[[Page S 10891]]\n     other litigation costs in any case in which the complainant has \n     reasonably prevailed. The bill would permit a court to award \n     payment of requesters' litigation expenses and reasonable \n     attorneys' fees incurred in the administrative process in any \n     case in which the agency fails to comply with the time \n     limits. In determining whether to make such an award, the \n     bill directs the court to consider whether an agency's \n     failure to comply with statutory time limits was not \n     warranted and demonstrated bad faith or was otherwise \n     unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular \n     request.\n       Demonstration of Circumstances for Delay.--The bill would \n     require agencies not in compliance with the time limits to \n     demonstrate ``that the delay is warranted under the \n     circumstances.'' The bill would clarify the only \n     circumstances that excuse compliance with the time limits are \n     those unusual or exceptional circumstances set forth in \n     paragraphs 6(B) and (C) of Section 552(a).\n       Expansion of Agency Response Time.--The bill would expand \n     the time limit for an agency to respond to a request for \n     records under FOIA from ten days to twenty days. Attorney \n     General Janet Reno has acknowledged the inability of most \n     federal agencies to comply with the ten-day rule as ``as a \n     serious problem'' stemming principally from ``too few \n     resources in the face of too heavy a workload.'' A doubling \n     of the time limit will assist federal agencies in reducing \n     their backlogs.\n       Agency Backlogs.--The current statute provides that in \n     ``exceptional circumstances,'' the statutory time limits can \n     be extended, but does not define what those circumstances can \n     be. In Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, \n     547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the court held that an \n     unforeseen 3,000 percent increase in FOIA requests in one \n     year, which created a massive backlog in an agency with \n     insufficient resources to process those requests in a timely \n     manner, can constitute ``exceptional circumstances.''\n       Routine backlogs of requests for records under the FOIA \n     should not give agencies an automatic excuse to ignore the \n     time limits, since this provides a disincentive for agencies \n     to clear up those backlogs. This section of the bill would \n     clarify the holding in Open America by specifying that \n     routine agency backlogs do not constitute exceptional \n     circumstances for purposes of the Act.\n       Multitrack FIFO Processing.--An agency commitment to \n     process requests on a first-come, first-served basis has been \n     held to satisfy the requirement that an agency exercise due \n     diligence in dealing with backlogs of FOIA requests. Some \n     agencies have taken the position that they must process \n     requests on a FIFO basis, even if this procedure may result \n     in lengthy delays for simple requests due to the prior \n     receipt and processing of complex requests. The bill would \n     encourage agencies to implement multi-track processing \n     systems for FOIA requests to reduce backlog.\n       Expedited Access.--The bill would authorize expedited \n     access to requesters who demonstrate a ``compelling need'' \n     for a speedy response. The agency would be required to make a \n     determination whether or not to grant the request for \n     expedited access within five days. The requester would bear \n     the burden of showing, under penalty of perjury, that \n     expedition is appropriate and would be required to satisfy \n     strict time limits to obtain administrative and judicial \n     review of an agency's denial of such a request. The bill \n     would permit only limited judicial review based on the same \n     record before the agency.\n       A ``compelling need'' warranting expedited access would be \n     demonstrated by showing that failure to obtain the records \n     within an expedited timeframe would: (I) threaten a person's \n     life or safety; (II) result in the loss of substantial due \n     process rights and the information sought is not otherwise \n     available in a timely fashion; or (III) affect public \n     assessment of the nature and propriety of actual or alleged \n     governmental actions that are the subject of widespread, \n     contemporaneous media coverage.\n\n\n                     Section 7. Computer Redaction\n\n       The ability to redact information on the computer changes \n     the complexion of released documents. At times, determining \n     whether one sentence or 30 pages have been withheld by the \n     agency is impossible. The bill would require agencies to \n     indicate deletions of the released portion of the record at \n     the place where such deletion was made.\n\n\n                         Section 8. Definitions\n\n       The bill would add definitions of ``record'' and ``search'' \n     to the statute to address electronically stored information. \n     The current FOIA statute does not define either term. The \n     definition of ``record'' in the bill is an expanded version \n     of the definition in the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 3301. \n     There is little disagreement that the FOIA covers all \n     government records, regardless of the form in which they are \n     stored by the agency. The Department of Justice agrees that \n     computer database records are agency records subject to the \n     FOIA. See ``Department of Justice Report on `Electronic \n     Record' Issues Under the Freedom of Information Act,'' S. \n     Hrg. 102-1098, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1992).\n       The bill defines ``search'' as ``a manual or automated \n     review''to locate records responsive to a FOIA request. Under \n     the FOIA, an agency is not required to create documents that \n     do not exist. Computer records located in a database rather \n     than in a file cabinet may require the application of codes \n     or some form of programming to retrieve the information. \n     Under the definition of ``search'' in the bill, the search of \n     computerized records would not amount to the creation of \n     records. Otherwise, it would be virtually impossible to get \n     records that are maintained completely in an electronic form, \n     like electronic mail, because some manipulation of the \n     information likely would be necessary to search the records.\n                                                    July 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy and Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Brown: The organizations listed \n     below, representing a substantial portion of the Freedom of \n     Information Act requestor community, wish to express their \n     strong support for the ``Electronic Freedom of Information \n     Improvement Act of 1995.''\n       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a critical tool of \n     our democracy which allows Americans to learn about their \n     government and hold the government accountable for its \n     actions. This legislation ensures that the public will be \n     able to access agency records maintained in electronic form, \n     and also takes steps to alleviate endemic delays in \n     proceeding FOIA requests.\n       This legislation is needed to address new issues related to \n     increased use of computers by federal agencies. It clarifies \n     that the FOIA covers agency information in any form, \n     including electronic form, and requires agencies to provide \n     records in a requested form if the records are maintained in \n     that form. The legislation also increases on-line access to \n     government information, including agency regulations, \n     opinions, and policy statements, as well as FOIA-related \n     records that are the subject of repeated requests. This \n     increased on-line accessibility of FOIA-releasable material \n     is a critical step in using technology to make government \n     more accessible and responsible to its citizens.\n       The ``Electronic Freedom of Information Act'' also will \n     reduce agency delays in responding to FOIA requests. In \n     recognition of the difficulty faced by some agencies in \n     complying with FOIA time limits, the bill increases agency \n     response time from 10 to 20 days, and allows agencies to \n     retain half of the fees if they comply with statutory time \n     limits. The legislation encourages agencies to implement two-\n     track processing systems for simple and complex requests to \n     assist in the reduction of backlogs, and establishes \n     expedited access for requestors who demonstrate a compelling \n     need for a speedy response.\n       By keeping the Freedom of Information Act up to date with \n     new technologies and improving the administrative process, \n     this legislation will help ensure that the Act remains an \n     instrument for open and responsive government. We hope that \n     this legislation, which last year passed the Judiciary \n     Committee unanimously and the Senate by voice vote, will be \n     enacted into law.\n       American Civil Liberties Union, American Library \n     Association, American Society of Newspaper Editors, \n     Association of American Publishers, Center for Democracy and \n     Technology, Center for National Security Studies, Electronic \n     Privacy Information Center, Federation of American \n     Scientists, Fund for Constitutional Government, Government \n     Accountability Project, Information Trust, and Lawyers \n     Committee for Human Rights.\n       National Newspaper Association, National Security Archive, \n     Newspaper Association of America, OMB Watch, People for the \n     American Way Action Fund, Public Citizen, Radio-Television \n     News Directors Association, Society of Professional \n     Journalists, Taxpayer Assets Project, Unison Institute, and \n     Whistleblowers Alliance, Inc.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1091. A bill to finance and implement a program of research, \npromotion, market development, and industry and consumer information to \nenhance demand for and increase the profitability of canola and \nrapeseed products in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\nthe canola and rapeseed research promotion and consumer information act\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my purpose here today is to \nintroduce the Canola and Rapeseed Research, Promotion, and Consumer \nInformation Act. I am pleased to report that this piece of legislation \nis backed by the strong support of those in the canola and rapeseed \nindustry.\n  Canola and rapeseed products are an important and nutritious part of \nthe human diet, and the crops are in all regions of the United States. \nThis crop is produced by thousands of growers and consumed by people \nall over the world. A total of 35 states grow over 330,000 acres, and \nthat level is rapidly increasing. States such as Idaho see well over \n40,000 acres devoted to this particular crop. As you can see, Mr. \nPresident, it is important that these readily available commodities are \nmarketed efficiently to ensure that consumers have an adequate supply \nat a reasonable price.\n  Currently, a number of established State and national organizations \nexist \n\n[[Page S 10892]]\nwhose primary goals include the research and promotion of their \nrespective commodities. The cooperative development, financing, and \nimplementation of a canola and rapeseed research, information, and \npromotion program is necessary to maintain and expand the existing \nmarkets, and to develop new markets for these important products.\n  In addition, this act will establish an orderly procedure for \nfinancing through assessments on domestically produced canola and \nrapeseed, and the development and implementation of a program of \nresearch, promotion, consumer and industry information.\n  It is the policy of this act to establish a concise and uniform \nmethod of requesting, issuing and amending orders relative to the \ncanola and rapeseed industry. It will provide for a national canola and \nrapeseed board of 15 members who will administer and carry out programs \nand projects which provide maximum benefit to the industry.\n  Under this act, assessments will be levied on those products produced \nand marketed in the United States and will be deducted from the payment \nmade to a producer for all canola or rapeseed sold to a first \npurchaser. The assessment rate shall be 4 cents per hundredweight of \ncanola or rapeseed produced and marketed in a State, or a rate of 2 \ncents per hundredweight for States with a State checkoff.\n  Essentially, this act will enable the industry to create a commodity \ndriven and commodity controlled checkoff program. The idea of a \ncheckoff is not new, and generic promotional and research programs \nfunded through voluntary checkoff contributions have been working at \nall levels of government for over 50 years. Considering the limited \nresources of the Federal Government in all areas, especially \nagriculture, I believe that programs of this nature will become \nincreasingly important. I highly commend everyone involved in the \ncanola and rapeseed industry for their efforts in bringing this \ncheckoff to the attention of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in enabling this \nindustry to shape its own future. I ask unanimous consent that a \nsection-by-section summary of the bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCanola and Rapeseed Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act--\n                             July 28, 1995\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n       Section 1: Short Title; Table of Contents.\n       The short title is the ``Canola and Rapeseed Research, \n     Promotion, and Consumer Information Act.''\n       Section 2: Findings and Declaration of Policy.\n       Canola and Rapeseed products are important components of \n     the human diet.\n       There are several state and national organizations whose \n     primary goal is to promote canola and rapeseed research, \n     consumer information, and industry information which is \n     valuable to the new and existing markets. The cooperative \n     development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated \n     national program is vital to this market.\n       Section 3: Definitions.\n       This section gives specific definitions for words and \n     phrases used throughout this bill.\n       Section 4: Issuance and Amendment of Orders.\n       In general, the Secretary shall issue the orders only upon \n     request of the industry. This order shall be national in \n     scope and not more than one order shall be in effect at any \n     one time.\n       Section 5: Required Terms in Orders.\n       This section gives the specific terms and conditions to be \n     met by any order. It also specifies the organization of the \n     Board and other members, and gives guidelines for day to day \n     operations.\n       The Board consists of 15 members. Additionally, there shall \n     be no more than 4 producer members of the Board from any \n     state.\n       Section 6: Assessments.\n       This section describes the required provisions for \n     collection and refund of assessments.\n       The assessment rate shall be 4 cents per hundredweight of \n     canola or rapeseed produced and marketed in a state. The rate \n     is 2 cents per hundredweight for states with an approved \n     checkoff.\n       Section 7: Referenda.\n       The Secretary shall conduct a referendum among producers \n     during the period ending 30 months after the date the order \n     was issued to determine whether the order should be \n     continued.\n       Section 8: Petition and Review.\n       Anyone subject to an order may file a petition with the \n     Secretary.\n       Section 9: Enforcement.\n       This section deals with the jurisdiction, process, and \n     penalties in regards to the enforcement of an order.\n       Section 10: Investigations and Power to Subpoena.\n       The Secretary may make investigations as he or she sees fit \n     in order to ensure that no violations of specific regulations \n     have occurred and to ensure that there are no abuses of those \n     regulations.\n       Section 11: Suspension or Termination of an Order.\n       The Secretary has the power to terminate any order that is \n     no longer conducive to the industry.\n       Section 12: Regulations.\n       The Secretary may issue any regulations necessary to carry \n     out this act.\n       Section 13: Authorizations and Appropriations.\n       This section deals with the appropriation of funds for this \n     act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1092. A bill to impose sanctions against Burma, and countries \nassisting Burma, unless Burma observes basic human rights and permits \npolitical freedoms; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                        THE 1995 FREE BURMA ACT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the 1995 \nFree Burma Act. I had planned to introduce the legislation on July 11, \nthe date the State Law and Order Restoration Council--SLORC--was to \nreach a determination about the status of Aung San Suu Kyi. Fortunately \nfor Suu Kyi, her family and Burma, SLORC decided to release her from 6 \nyears of house arrest.\n  Everyone hoped that her release would mark the beginning of \nsignificant change in Burma. But, as Suu Kyi recently remarked, ``We \nare nowhere near democracy. I have been released--that is all. The \nsituation has not changed in any other way.''\n  Two weeks ago, I announced that I would refrain from introducing \nsanctions legislation in the interests of determining just how serious \nthe SLORC was about change in Burma. I indicated that I would monitor \nthe situation and determine if progress was made in four areas before \nintroducing sanctions. Let me review those conditions.\n  First, Suu Kyi has called for dialog with the SLORC to negotiate the \npeaceful transfer of power. In her first public statement she took note \nof the fact that a majority of the people in Burma voted for democracy \nand a market economy in 1990. In fact her National League for Democracy \ncarried 392 seats in Parliament. A dialog to set Burma on the road to \neconomic and political recovery should being immediately and without \npreconditions.\n  Second, Suu Kyi must continue to be afforded the opportunity to meet \nwith her political supporters. It is essential that she have freedom of \nmovement and speech and that her supporters and the press enjoy the \nsame rights.\n  Third, Suu Kyi urged the SLORC to release all political prisoners, \nincluding the 16 elected members of Parliament and hundreds of other \nNLD supporters. I hope this occurs promptly, but in the meantime, I \nthink it is imperative that the SLORC sign and implement the ICRC \nagreement granting access to political detainees. Last month the ICRC \nannounced they intend to withdraw from Burma after 7 years of \nattempting to negotiate an agreement with SLORC. I believe it would \nrepresent a good faith effort if SLORC now signed that agreement.\n  Finally, SLORC's intention to move toward national reconciliation \ncould be demonstrated by ceasing attacks on ethnic minorities along the \nThai border. Over the past year, SLORC has engaged in negotiations to \nreach cease-fire agreements with many of the ethnic groups--agreements \nwhich explicitly call upon the withdrawal of SLORC forces from various \nregions. In December, SLORC broke off talks and launched attacks \nagainst the Karen. Nearly 80,000 refugees fled across the border. Over \nthe past several weeks several thousand SLORC troop have moved into the\n Kayah state and launched attacks against Karenni camps. News accounts \nreport that 20,000 refugees have fled.\n\n  On Monday, this week, I asked Assistant Secretary of State for Asian \nAffairs, Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary for Narcotics, Robert \nGelbard, to provide the administration's assessment of progress in \nmeeting these conditions. I also asked a Burmese student, Omar Khin, \nand representatives from Asia Watch and the AFL-CIO to testify.\n\n[[Page S 10893]]\n\n  Although everyone agreed that Suu Kyi's release was an important \ndevelopment and that she was being afforded the opportunity to meet \nwith her supporters, every witness expressed disappointment that that \nwas all that has happened.\n  The war against ethnic groups continue. Political repression and \nhuman rights violations continue. In fact, just this week, Asia Watch \nreleased an extensive report detailing how the situation has \ndeteriorated.\n  The Red Cross still plans to shut down operations because of SLORC's \nrefusal to grant access to political prisoners. And, perhaps most \nimportantly, no negotiations have been initiated by SLORC to implement \nthe 1990 elections. In fact, no efforts have been made to set a date \nfor dialog to begin.\n  It is pretty obvious that SLORC's decision to release Suu Kyi was a \ncalculated move designed to encourage foreign investment and Burma's \ninclusion in ASEAN. Indeed, within 48 hours of her release, several \ngovernments announced their intention to consider expanding trade and \nassistance. I think it is too early to reward SLORC--these initiatives \nare premature.\n  I agree with Suu Kyi who has cautioned all potential investors. A \nrecent AP story made clear that she is concerned about a rush to \nembrace SLORC. She has, in fact, welcomed this legislation as a means \nof pressuring SLORC to the table. In an AP story she said, ``These are \nvery tough sanctions and I think they have shown they are very \ninterested in democracy.''\n  The legislation sends the message that Suu Kyi's release is not \nenough--that the Senate expects SLORC to implement the results of the \n1990 election and transfer power to a civilian government.\n  Mr. President, some people may wonder why Burma should matter to the \nUnited States. After all there are certainly other countries with \ncomparable human rights records.\n  That may well be true. But, there is one compelling reason why we \nhave a direct interest in Burma. Today, Burma is the source of 65 \npercent of the heroin coming into the United States compared with 15 \npercent 10 years ago. More alarming is the fact that purity has shot \nup. Law enforcement officials here in Washington and in Kentucky tell \nme they used to see purity around 2 percent to 3 percent on our\n streets. Now it is not uncommon to find purity levels from 25 percent \nto 65 percent.\n\n  The drug czar has said heroin trafficking represents a serious threat \nto our national interests. I agree. I also agree with Assistant \nSecretary Lord's testimony that the only thing that will solve the \nproblem is a change in government.\n  Mr. President, we all hope that Suu Kyi's release marks the beginning \nof the end of repression in Burma. However, past experience with this \nmilitary dictatorship suggests caution is the appropriate approach.\n  Suu Kyi has issued a statement of remarkable good will toward a \nregime that illegally held her in detention for 6 years. She has \ndemonstrated courage and determination, stating immediately after her \nrelease that her detention has not changed her basic goals to advance \npeace and freedom in Burma.\n  I think it is important that we respect and promote that agenda. \nKeeping the pressure on SLORC will assure that her release is \ntranslated from a symbolic gesture to real progress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record \nseveral letters of support for this legislation which have come in from \naround the world. I also ask unanimous consent to include a brief \nsummary of the legislation and an article including comments Suu Kyi \nhas made about the legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator McConnell, members of the press: My name is Ohmar \n     Khin. I am a Burmese student in exile who participated in the \n     1988 nationwide pro-democracy movement in Burma and \n     experienced first-hand, the brutality of the current military \n     regime. The memories of the events of 1988 are still vivid.\n       At that time, I was a senior student at Rangoon Arts and \n     Science University majoring in Chemistry. On March 16, while \n     walking to class with my friends, I saw students banging \n     drums and calling others to gather nearby the Convocation \n     Hall. They were protesting the death of a student who was \n     shot by soldiers dispersing a demonstration three days \n     earlier. My friends and I joined the protesters. As we \n     marched passed Inya Lake we saw troops stationed on the road, \n     blocking our way and riot police trucks rolling down the \n     road.\n       Many students ran into nearby streets and some jumped into \n     the lake. Others were beaten and kicked by police then \n     dragged into the trucks. I was separated from my friends and \n     ran into one of the houses in front of the lake. The \n     residents let me and a few others in, locking their gate. \n     From there, I watched the terrifying scene. My heart was \n     pounding with fear. My sarong was torn apart. I was holding a \n     pencil sharpener to defend myself if I were caught. Some \n     troops tried to climb over the gate to catch us but a \n     Japanese diplomat next door let us climb down into his \n     residence and hid us in his house. It was night before I \n     could finally get back home.\n       From that time there was a determination to fight for \n     justice in our country. During the next few months students \n     organized quietly. More and more people recognized the need \n     for change in the country and joined this movement which led \n     to the nationwide pro-democracy uprising of August 8, 1988, \n     known as 8-8-88.\n       Tens of thousands of people, including monks and children, \n     took to the streets that day, calling for democracy and human \n     rights. I marched along with my colleagues and witnessed the \n     horror of our own military shooting innocent people. One of \n     the students marching next to me was shot to death.\n       During those months of struggle in 1988, hundreds of \n     students were arrested, universities and colleges were \n     closed. Thousands of students, like myself, were forced to \n     flee the country.\n       I believe that democracy and human rights will truly come \n     to Burma one day, but the help of the international community \n     is critical in bringing about that change. Pressure brought \n     to bear by the international community was instrumental in \n     freeing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and such pressure must continue \n     until democracy is restored. The legislation planned by \n     Senator McConnell calling for economic sanctions on the \n     military regime is the type of initiative which will sustain \n     such pressure.\n       The struggle of 1988 should not be forgotten. The spirit of \n     the people and their desire to live under a just and \n     democratic government remains strong. Senator McConnell's \n     legislation can help the people of Burma achieve that goal.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Prime Minister,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I have recently learned of your \n     intention to introduce a bill to impose US economic sanctions \n     on Burma. On behalf of the democratically elected government \n     of Burma, I am writing to give you my wholehearted support as \n     well as that of my government in your effort.\n       The imposition of sanctions should never be taken lightly. \n     Any measure designed to constrict the economy of a country \n     will cause some degree of hardship to the people. However, I \n     believe, and the democratic forces working to liberate our \n     country believe, that foreign investment serves to strengthen \n     the outlaw State Law and Restoration Council (SLORC). It is \n     providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army and \n     intelligence service whose only job is to crush internal \n     dissent. SLORC controls all foreign investment into Burma and \n     channels contracts to the military and its party officials. \n     Unlike other countries, investment will not serve to create a \n     middle class of entrepreneurs, only reinforce allegiance to a \n     regime that has murdered tens of thousands of people whose \n     crime was the desire for democracy and to live in a free \n     society. SLORC is in desperate need of foreign currency. \n     Cutting off access to US funds will be a severe blow to \n     SLORC.\n       Your decision to move forward on this issue will not be \n     popular with the US business community or countries in Europe \n     and Asia. There are many who place trade and money over \n     Burma's deplorable narcotics, political, and human rights \n     record. I applaud your courage and will do everything in my \n     power to see you succeed.\n       The United States has a very special place in the hearts of \n     my countrymen. During the massive democracy demonstrations in \n     1988, students could be seen marching in Rangoon carrying \n     American flags and demonstrating in front of the US Embassy. \n     Supporting us in our struggle is the International Republican \n     Institute. This organization funds pro-democracy activities \n     inside Burma. The Burmese people desperately want what \n     Americans have: the ability to live in peace without fear of \n     government persecution, respect for human rights, and social \n     justice. American ideals will always be a symbol for what we \n     can achieve.\n       I want to personally thank you for your leadership and \n     raising your voice to support those who are oppressed. I look \n     forward to assisting you in any way possible.\n       With my highest consideration,\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                         Sein Win,\n     Prime Minister.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S 10894]]\n\n                                        The Government of Karenni,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Prime Minister,\n\n                                                     June 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The Government and people of \n     Karenni are happy to learn that you have prepared to \n     legislate sanction against SLORC in the U.S. Congress.\n       We give all our support to your efforts and we thank the \n     Senators and Congressmen who sponsored this legislation to \n     impose economic sanctions on Burma.\n       Meanwhile, the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) \n     has entered a cease fire ``understanding'' with SLORC. This \n     is done on convenience because we are pressured by \n     intimidation from SLORC.\n       KNPP wants peace and progress. For this reason it has been \n     fighting the war against SLORC and the Burmese Governments \n     preceeded it. With the cease-fire in place, the KNPP hopes to \n     be able to achieve progress. That was why it has agreed to a \n     cease-fire with SLORC. But contrary to expectation, no \n     progress is possible because the SLORC has reneged on its \n     agreement with KNPP. It has, in the name of existing Burmese \n     laws and regulations, put all kinds of obstacles in the way. \n     Although the KNPP has reminded SLORC of the agreement reached \n     between it and KNPP, the SLORC simply turns a deaf ear to the \n     reminders. On the other hand it continues collecting porter \n     fees--60 kyats per household--in some townships monthly. It \n     is believed that the porter fees collected will be used in \n     areas where cease-fire has not been reached or signed.\n       KNPP is of the opinion that only when there is a nation-\n     wide cease-fire between SLORC and all armed groups fighting \n     it, will the people be free from being made to contribute \n     porter fees, to serve as porters and to contribute forced \n     labour.\n       We, therefore, request the international organizations, \n     like the UN or democratic countries, like the United States \n     to put pressure on SLORC so that a nation-wide cease-fire in \n     Burma can take place.\n       The hard-learned fact we now experienced as mentioned above \n     is that the SLORC will continue its formally bullish practice \n     over all the cease-fire signatories.\n       We find our national security is still precarious and there \n     is no sign of democratic return in Karenni and also all over \n     Burma itself. For this belief, we send a memorandum to sub-\n     committee of House Foreign Affairs Committee, in which we \n     seek U.S. protection and aids. A copy of this memorandum is \n     sent to you by airmail postal service.\n       We wish you success in this efforts of yours.\n       May God bless you and your sponsorial comrades.\n           Your sincerely,\n                                                    Aung Than Lay,\n     Prime Minister, Government of Karenni.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          The New Mon State Party,\n\n\n                                         General Headquarters,\n\n                                                     June 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Your Excellency: Information of your efforts at imposing \n     economic and trade sanctions on Burma under the brutal regime \n     known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) \n     is very encouraging to us. Current situation shows that, only \n     by international economic and diplomatic pressure can \n     liberate Burma from the atrocious control of the ruling \n     military junta.\n       It appears that the world business community is now \n     mesmerized by SLORC's promises of the proverbial pot of gold \n     at the end of the rainbow. The economy is only open for the \n     Burmese generals and their associates to line their pockets \n     and they are in complete control of all business contracts \n     and are interested in upfront money in the form of signature \n     bonuses paid in dollars.\n       Any evidence offered that the regime is easing its \n     oppression is superficial. What the military leadership is \n     seeking is international legitimacy at the lest cost to \n     itself.\n       In spite of no foreign threats whatsoever, SLORC is \n     boosting up its armed forces to over 350,000 heading to \n     500,000 just to rule the country at gun point.\n       The best example of the Burmese leadership's political \n     failure is their attitude toward the ethnic minorities. For \n     nearly half a century it has used the bankrupt policy of a \n     military solution to Burma's political problems. It just does \n     not have adequate capacity to realize that Burma's ethnic \n     problems are a political problem that requires a political \n     solution.\n       May I urge you as President of the New Mon State Party and \n     Chairman of the National Democratic Front to do everything \n     possible to eliminate U.S. foreign investment in Burma until \n     a legitimate democratic government is in power.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                    Nai Shwe Kyin,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Kachinland Projects U.S.A.    \n                                                  For Human Rights\n\n\n                                       and Democracy in Burma,\n\n                                                    June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I write on behalf of the Kachin-\n     American & Friends USA, Inc., for Democracy and Human Rights \n     in Burma, a US citizens' organization dedicated to the \n     purpose of restoring democracy and human rights in Burma, \n     especially in the Kachin areas. We want to let you know that \n     we support your proposed resolution to impose trade sanctions \n     against Burma most strongly. We are ready to support your \n     leadership through active citizen input to our \n     representatives in the US Congress. If we could be of help in \n     other ways please let us know.\n       We have been unspeakably outraged by the severe persecution \n     of our people over the years for no apparent reason than the \n     fact that they are Kachin. We have felt most painful and \n     helpless because the one political movement, the Kachin \n     Independence Organization, has been hand-tied by the cease-\n     fire agreement. While Kachin leaders have been honor-bound, \n     SLORC's oppression and predations against our people have \n     continued, as has their despicable hypocrisy about opium \n     production and trading.\n       We support in the strongest manner any pressure that could \n     be applied against SLORC, by the US and by the international \n     community. And we will continue our strong protest against \n     SLORC's deadly rule in ethnic minority areas with their \n     occupation army. This pariah regime must be condemned and \n     cast aside.\n       We hope that you are determined to exercise your leadership \n     in a manner that will have a strong, effective and lasting \n     impact. We are ready and eager to come to your assistance \n     whenever called.\n           Most sincerely yours,\n                                               La Raw Maran, Ph.D.\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress and Industrial \n           Organization,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Warren Christopher,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to you to express my strong \n     concerns about the continuing egregious behavior of the State \n     Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) regime of Burma. \n     Directly contradicting its claims that it seeks peace and \n     national reconciliation, SLORC sent the Burmese army to \n     viciously attack, capture and sack Manerplaw, the \n     headquarters of the Karen people and key base area for many \n     groups, including the Federation of Trade Unions Burma \n     (FTUB), seeking to restore democracy in Burma.\n       We believe that the blatant, unprovoked attack on Manerplaw \n     is a major setback for the cause of democracy in Burma and \n     merits a strong response from the U.S. Government. In the \n     ``two visions'' policy laid out by Deputy Assistant Secretary \n     Hubbard during his visit to Rangoon, the U.S. indicated that, \n     if progress by SLORC on issues of democracy and human rights \n     was not forthcoming, the U.S. would renew its campaign to \n     isolate the regime. In line with this policy, now is the time \n     for the U.S. to show, by actions, that it is serious.\n       Accordingly, we urge the U.S. Government to implement a \n     full trade and investment embargo against Burma. Since most \n     U.S. investment enters Burma through joint ventures with \n     SLORC government agencies or entities wholly controlled by \n     the regime, implementing sanctions would have a direct impact \n     on the ability of the SLORC to repress its people and conduct \n     war on groups opposed to this illegitimate government. The \n     withdrawal of the Commercial Officer from the U.S. Embassy in \n     Rangoon would further underscore this message. We also renew \n     our call for the U.S. Government to exert pressure to block \n     development and aid projects of international institutions \n     that benefit the SLORC.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lane Kirkland,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Democratic Burmese Students\n\n\n                                           Organization (USA),\n\n                                      Rockville, MD, July 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I write this letter on behalf of \n     the Democratic Burmese Students Organization. We are students \n     in exile from Burma who were witnesses to the 1988 massacre \n     of peaceful demonstrators by the Burmese regime. We, the \n     Burmese students, are now living throughout the United \n     States. We are writing in support of your efforts to draft \n     legislation imposing economic and trade measures against the \n     military regime in Burma.\n       In view of the lack of freedom and democracy and the \n     persistent refusal on the part of the current SLORC regime to \n     honor the national mandate given in 1990 elections, we \n     commend any measures that the U.S. Congress takes to help the \n     emergence of a legitimate government, which is democratic and \n     responsive to the basic needs of its people.\n       We believe that your proposed legislation will set a \n     progressive direction for U.S. policy that promotes democracy \n     in Burma. It will also send a clear signal to the SLORC that \n     the U.S. insists on commitment for the immediate release of \n     all political prisoners including democratic leader Daw Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and the implementation of the full democratic \n     process. We believe that renewed action by the U.S. Congress \n     to increase pressure on Burma will bear critical influence on \n\n\n[[Page S 10895]]\n     the SLORC. We shall, therefore, support any of your measures to this \n     effect.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Shwe Sin Htun,\n     Representative, DRSO (East Coast).\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   [From the Desk of Betty Williams]\n\n                                                     July 6, 1995.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I wish to take this opportunity to \n     offer my support to the initiative you are preparing to \n     undertake on behalf of my sister laureate Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and the people of Burma. It has been brought to my attention \n     that you intend to introduce legislation on July 11, 1995 \n     which will ban all U.S. foreign investment in Burma.\n       On June 26, 1995, while commemorating the 50th Anniversary \n     of the United Nations, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa, \n     Oscar Arias Sanchez and myself presented a letter to the \n     United Nations which included the signatures of seven other \n     Laureates asking for the release of Daw Suu.

Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Senator: The United Front for Democracy and Human \n     Rights in Burma and its affiliated organizations in the \n     United States, Canada, Europe and Asia want to heartily \n     commend you for the hearing on the Trade and Investment \n     Sanction bill held on July 24, 1995.\n       On behalf of these organizations, I was present at the \n     hearing and wish to express our views regarding the various \n     statements made there. While we thank Assistant Secretary \n     Winston Lord and Assistant Secretary Gelbard for their \n     perspectives and their views on the counternarcotics issue \n     and your sanction bill, our organizations disagree with their \n     approach. We heartily endorse the views expressed in the \n     opening statement made by you and the statements made by Khin \n     Ohnmar and the representatives of Human Rights Watch/ASIA and \n     the AFL-CIO as well as the statement submitted by Prime \n     Minister Dr. Sein Win of the NCGUB.\n       Our organizations, after very careful consideration of the \n     present situation and after hearing the various views at the \n     hearing as well as those of individuals and other \n     organizations closely observing the developments in Burma, \n     feel very strongly that the only language the SLORC, one of \n     the most repressive and regressive regimes in the world, \n     would understand is the comprehensive trade and sanctions \n     legislation against Burma that you propose to introduce. We \n     also believe that this is the right time for the introduction \n     as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi herself has acknowledge publicly as \n     quoted by you, ``We are nowhere near democracy. I have been \n     released, that is all. The situation has not changed in any \n     other way.'' Most prudent Burma observers including \n     Ambassador Lord are of the opinion that the reason for Suu \n     Kyi's release was not out of good intention or desire to \n     change to democracy and national reconciliation in Burma, but \n     due to international pressure including your proposed bill as \n     well as the forthcoming ASEAN meeting in Brunei.\n       Enclosed herewith also is the statement made by the United \n     Front on the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      U Ba Thaung,\n\n                                                 Chairman.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1093. A bill to prohibit the application of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993, or any amendment made by such act, to an \nindividual who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local \ncorrectional, detention, or penal facility, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT OF 1993 AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk in behalf of \nSenators Reid and Bryan.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I just introduced is a prison reform \nbill that is designed to close a gaping hole in the current law that \nallows prison inmates to file frivolous lawsuits at will.\n  This legislation is necessary, and it is overdue. It addresses and \nremedies a specific ailment plaguing an otherwise solid piece of \nlegislation that passed this body in the last Congress. I am referring \nto the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. More specifically, I am \nreferring to the application of this law as it relates to prison \ninmates.\n  When the Senate passed RFRA, it sought to provide the legal \nprotections supporting the right to freely exercise one's religious \nbelief. This legislation was a well-intentioned goal which this Senator \nsupported.\n  The concern I raised when we considered this legislation was the \nabuse that I knew would take place of these new rights by prison \ninmates. In fact, I offered an amendment that would have exempted \ninmates from coverage of this legislation. Unfortunately, my amendment \nwas narrowly defeated.\n  As the saying goes, Mr. President, you reap what you sow. And because \nthe sponsors of this legislation sought to extend this coverage to \nprison inmates, our courts are now being flooded with inmate lawsuits \nalleging discrimination under this act. And the lawsuits are filed \noften for the most spurious of reasons. I said then, and I say now, \nthat providing inmates with all those rights and privileges would be a \nrecipe for disaster, and I was right.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, word of these new legal rights has spread \nlike wildfire. They are in Idaho. We have a letter that we will talk \nabout from one of the deputy attorney general of Idaho.\n  These taxpayer-supported lawsuits are spreading like wildfire. The \nresearch for these filings is being conducted in taxpayer-supported law \nlibraries containing spades of helpful filing information at the \ndisposal of prisoners.\n  Mr. President, this is like an alcoholic locked inside a liquor \nstore. These inmates cannot get enough.\n  What am I talking about? Should I talk specifics? I do not know where \nto start talking specifics. I only brought over a few of the lawsuits.\n  In this hand I have the some of the Nevada lawsuits; only some of \nthem. Because you see prison litigation in Nevada takes up 40 percent \nof the court's time--40 percent of the litigation in our Federal courts \nin Nevada are a result of prisoner lawsuits.\n  Is that what this is all about? Have we become so concerned with \nprisoner rights that we have forgotten the rights of society? Remember, \nthese people are in jail because they have been convicted of felonies. \nThey are not there because we are trying to check to find out if they \nare good or bad. They are felons. And we are spending 40 percent of the \ncourt's time on this trash.\n  Let me talk about some cases around the country. In California, we \nhave an inmate there who wants prison authorities to allow him to \npractice a religion called Wiccan, which is witchcraft. He is upset \nbecause the prison authorities will not supply him, among other things, \ntarot cards and other paraphernalia that goes with witchcraft.\n  We have one lawsuit filed because the satanic group in a prison \nwanted unbaptized baby fat for their candles.\n  Mr. President, I wish I were making this up. But a Federal judge, who \nhas a lifetime appointment, who is there to decide what is good and bad \nin this country, is being called upon to rule on this trash. And they \nhave to do it. They have to go through the process.\n  In the State of Connecticut they have allowed Catholics and \nProtestants to have religious services, and Moslems. We have an inmate \nthere who was not satisfied with that. What this inmate wanted is a \ncertain very refined, defined sect of the Moslem religion because he \nrefuses to go to a service for all Moslems. He wants his own.\n  We have one who changes his name. This man is in Florida. He keeps \nchanging his name, and he sues the prison because they do not give him \nhis mail in his right name.\n  We have, out of Florida, another case. There, an inmate alleges his \nrights were denied when he was not allowed to see Moslem visitors at a \ntime that he wanted them, not when everybody else visits those that are \nconfined. He wanted a time convenient to him. So he filed a lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S 10896]]\n\n  One wanted to perform the rite of washing--his definition of washing; \na religious ceremony.\n  Another inmate filed a lawsuit because his hat was confiscated.\n  Another inmate filed a lawsuit because he has alleged that the inmate \nbarbers are unskilled and are forced to perform the haircuts under too \nmuch pressure from the clock. This is a lawsuit filed.\n  We have another who filed a lawsuit because the diet kitchen in the \nprison did not meet his expectations. He believed that his religion \nentitles him to a healthy lifestyle as defined by what diet he wants.\n  We have another out of Nebraska. This man has filed a lawsuit because \nhe is a member of the Asatru religion, which is an Islamic word, which \nis a term for an ancient religion of the Teutonic people of northern \nEurope. And the prison authorities had a little trouble finding the \nparaphernalia this gentleman wanted.\n  We have another case out in Nebraska where an inmate there thinks he \nis a woman trapped in a man's body, and thus strip searches by male \nprison officials are not allowed by his religion.\n  Again, Mr. President, I kind of wish I was making this up. I mean, \ncan you imagine. These are real lawsuits that our Attorneys General and \nothers are defending on a daily basis taking tremendous amounts of time \nwhen they should be involved in other important matters.\n  We have case after case of this nonsense. I said it would happen and \nI intend to continue to fight to end this problem.\n  I am going to push this, Mr. President. We can wait for hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee. We can do all kinds of things. But before this \nyear is out, I am going to be offering this as an amendment to a piece \nof legislation moving through here. We cannot allow this kind of stuff \nto go on.\n  We have a letter here--I said on the floor, this is going to happen--\nfrom the Attorney General of the United States saying, no, it will not.\n  Like an alcoholic locked inside a liquor store, these inmates cannot \nget enough.\n  The consequences of these new prisoner rights are many, and an \noverburdened judiciary is forced to allocate its scarce resources to \nconsidering and processing these frivolous lawsuits. Our Nation's \nattorneys general are being forced to defend inmate lawsuits rather \nthan prosecute criminals. And as usual, who is picking up the tab? The \ntaxpayers are paying for the libraries that are better than I had when \nI practiced law. Why not? They get anything they want. All they have to \ndo is ask for it.\n  The American taxpayer, to the delight of these inmates, is left \nholding the tab on all of these legal expenses. And the time and cost \nis only going to continue to escalate unless we exempt inmates from the \ncoverage of RFRA.\n  At some point we are going to have to answer the question of whether \ncrimes are being left unprosecuted because the States' defense of \nprisoner lawsuits is the right thing to do.\n  I repeat, have we become more concerned about the rights of the \ncriminals than we have the rights of society?\n I asked the attorney general of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del Papa, to keep \nme apprised of these RFRA-related lawsuits they are defending. That was \nquite a task. Just to send me copies of the garbage that is being filed \nhas taken a significant amount of time of her staff.\n\n  I have told you about some of the cases around the country. Those in \nNevada are no different. They are just as ridiculous: A lawsuit filed \nbecause religious freedom rights have been denied--because they were \nnot able to check to see if there was pig fat, hog fat in the \ntoothpaste. They wanted scientific tests run on this to find out if \nthere were pork products in the toothpaste.\n  They wanted meat inspections to find out if the meat was properly \ncared for before it was given to the prisoners. This is, of course, on \na religious basis.\n  They confiscated a necklace that was bulky and large; they thought it \ncould cause problems to the rest of the prison populace. Not according \nto this man's religion. According to his claim, the jewelry would \nbecome defiled if another person touched it.\n  We have another man who is suing a prison chaplain for refusing to \nconduct a marriage ceremony between him and his male friend because \nthey belong to Universal Life Church, and this church allows people of \nthe same sex to marry.\n  They cannot get incense; they cannot get jewelry for their religious \nceremonies; they cannot get the right type of altar; they cannot get \nthe right type of nutritious vegetarian diet.\n  Skinheads are suing for the right to receive, because of their \nreligion, hateful, bigoted, anti-Semitic, racist literature from all \nover the country.\n  I have a letter from the deputy attorney general from the State of \nIdaho. She says, besides the cases enclosed--paraphrasing--even though \nwe do not have a lot of cases, the flood is beginning. I emphasize \n``yet'' because I know the Department of Corrections has every reason \nto believe it is only a matter of time.\n  This woman goes on in her letter to explain the trouble they have \ngone to in Idaho. They have sweat lodges in their prisons, trying to \nmake the Indian religions happy. They have problems with the Aryan \nNation, motorcycle gangs, trying to comply with their wishes of what \nthey need in prison. I do not understand why we have to bend over \nbackward to protect the rights of people who are locked up in prison.\n  Remember, 7 percent of the criminals commit over 75 percent of the \nviolent crime in this country. So our job is to get rid of the 7 \npercent. But what are we doing? We are trying to determine if the right \npork products are in toothpaste. I believe that these criminals who are \nconvicted felons have forfeited not all their rights but some of their \nrights by committing these acts against society. Rather than providing \nthem taxpayer-funded law libraries and better gyms, which most people \nin America do not have the opportunity to see let alone join, and they \nfile these lawsuits creating more work, rather than spending the money \non defending these frivolous lawsuits, I would prefer hiring more \npersonnel so they could watch them in chain gangs.\n  I think, with some of what we have going on in some States where they \nare going back and looking at chain gangs and having these people do \nwork instead of sitting around writing these phony lawsuits, we would \nbe better off. They do not deserve the costly luxuries they are \nprovided in prison. I believe the more difficult and the more \nunpleasant the present prison setting can be the better off we would \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I practiced criminal law. When I was a young lawyer, I \nwas assigned to represent a criminal defendant. At that time they did \nnot have the public defender system. And I went over there as a young \nlawyer all raring to go to defend this man who had been charged with \nstealing a car and taking it across State lines. And I proceeded as a \nyoung lawyer, wanting to get into that courtroom and help this man. He \nsaid, ``Young man, just back off.'' He said, ``I committed this crime \non purpose. I knew what crime I committed. I wanted to be returned to a \nFederal prison because they are nicer than the State prisons.'' I have \nnever forgotten that.\n  So I am going to push hard for this legislation. Our judges ought to \nbe spending more time hearing meritorious cases and our attorneys \ngeneral should be spending more time prosecuting criminals, not \ndefending frivolous lawsuits brought by them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should \nfully participate in Expo '98 in Lisbon, Portugal, and that it should \nencourage the private sector to support this effort.\n  Prime Minister Cavaco Silva recently invited the United States and \nother countries to participate in Expo '98, which will be the last \nexposition to take place in this century. A number of countries, \nincluding Germany, Greece, the United Kingdom, Morocco, India, \nPakistan, and Cape Verde, have committed to participating in Expo '98, \nand several others, including Argentina, the Philippines, Canada, and \nPoland, have demonstrated their strong interest in participating.\n  I understand that our own Government is seriously considering \naccepting the Portuguese Government's invitation. I believe it would be \nuseful for the Senate to weigh in on this issue, and to encourage the \nadministration to participate in this important exposition.\n  As a longtime friend of Portugal, I am pleased to support United \nStates participation in Expo '98. The theme of the exposition, ``The \nOceans, A Heritage for the Future,'' is particularly fitting as we mark \nthe 500th anniversary of Vasco Da Gama's discovery of the sea route to \nIndia. Portugal, of course, has a great history of sea exploration, and \nin fact, helped to create important trade links between the peoples of \nEurope, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Lisbon, the capital of Portugal \nsince the 12th century, is a vibrant cultural and economic center, and \nits location on the Atlantic makes it a fine choice for an expo focused \non the sea.\n  The U.N. General Assembly has declared 1998 as the International Year \nof the Ocean in an effort to alert the world to the need to improve the \nphysical and cultural assets of the world's oceans. The theme of the \nexpo is therefore, particularly appropriate. A fundamental goal of Expo \n'98 will be to focus on the growing importance of the world's oceans \nand to foster a debate on the sustainable use of marine resources and \nenvironmental protection. The United States, of course, has a vested \ninterest in being part of this debate.\n  The organizers of Expo '98 will provide all facilities relating to \neach national pavilion free of charge. Accordingly, participating \ncountries will have to provide only the contents of its representation, \nwhich I expect to be sponsored by the private sector. In fact, the \nresolution I am submitting encourages the private sector to support \nExpo '98.\n  As a fellow Atlantic power, and an ally of Portugal, the United \nStates should have a strong interest in participating in this \nexposition. I sincerely hope that President Clinton will accept Prime \nMinister Cavaco Silva's invitation to be part of this important event.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10897-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10897-S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 158--TO PROVIDE FOR SENATE GIFT REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Grams, Mr. \nAbraham, Mr. Warner, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Baucus) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention a resolution adopted by the National Conference of \nState Legislatures in opposition to the preemption of State tort law. \nThe conference stated that ``no comprehensive evidence exists \ndemonstrating either that State product liability laws have created a \nproblem of such dimension that a Federal solution is warranted or that \nFederal legislation would achieve its stated goals.'' Mr. President, \nthe conference went on to state that they ``strongly oppose[s] all \nlegislation before Congress that would have the effect of preempting \nState laws regulating recovery for injuries caused by defective \nproducts.''\n  I believe that the Senate would be wise to listen to position of the \nconference of State Legislatures, made up of legislators from all 50 \nStates. The Senate should not federalize our Nation's tort system and \ndestroy over 200 years of State law. I urge my colleagues to heed the \nadvice of our Nation's State legislators. I ask that a resolution \nadopted by the National Conference of State Legislatures be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n National Conference of State Legislatures Resolution Adopted July 20, \n                                  1995\n\n       NCSL has reviewed proposed federal legislation that would \n     preempt state law by severely restricting the rights of \n     persons injured by defective products to seek recovery in \n     state courts.

Mr. President, I would like to commend the \noutstanding service of the U.S. Navy Supply Corps, which is celebrating \nits bicentennial \n\n[[Page S 10901]]\nthis month. The Supply Corps is charged with the responsibility of \nproviding logistical support to all U.S. Navy ships. The Navy Supply \nCorps was created by Congress in the Naval Armament Act of 1794 and \nofficially began its service to our Nation in 1795.\n  The Supply Corps has seen many dramatic changes since the early days \nof its founding. During the late 1790's, each of our Navy ships was \nassigned a single warrant officer with the enormous responsibility of \npurchasing and providing all of the necessary equipment and provisions \nto maintain the ship's daily operations. A modern aircraft carrier \nserving with the U.S. Navy today may have as many as 15 supply officers \naboard. The board variety of duties currently performed by supply \nofficers require them to have detailed knowledge of accounting \nprocedures, food service, foreign currency exchanges, and management of \npay records. The Navy Supply Corps School currently trains about 3,800 \nstudents per year to become specialists in business, inventory \nmanagement, financial data processing, transportation, storage \nprocedures, petroleum handling, and purchasing.\n  I am pleased to note that the Navy Supply Corps School has been \nlocated in Athens, GA, since January 15, 1954. Every supply officer \nserving with the U.S. Navy has been trained at the Supply Corps School \nin Athens. In addition the school is home to the foreign officer supply \ncourse [FOSCO]. Since the course began its operations in 1955, it has \ngraduated more than 1,200 international students/officers from over 50 \ndifferent countries. The foreign officer supply course serves the \nextremely important function of increasing the number of military \ncontacts between the United States and other friendly governments. Such \ncontacts enhance the level of understanding between nations and make \nsignificant contributions to the cause of peace. Recently, the Navy \nSupply Corps School received the prestigious ``E'' Award, which \nrecognizes excellence in the field of training, from the Chief of Naval \nEducation and Training.\n  The outstanding relationship between the Navy Supply Corps School and \nthe local Athens community should serve as a model for other military \ninstallations and host communities to follow. Many of the students and \nstaff at the Navy Supply Corps School actively participate as tutors \nand mentors for local at-risk students in Athens area schools. While \nthe students benefit from the interaction with much-needed positive \nrole models, the participating service members receive a boost in \nmorale that comes from the realization that they are making a \nrecognizable improvement in the lives of their fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nU.S. Navy Supply Corps for its 200 years of excellent service. We wish \nit continued success in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10900-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               PREEMPTION OF STATE PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWS\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have opposed Federal product \nliability reform legislation primarily because I believe it is a \nmistake to replace laws that have been carefully crafted by the State \ncourts and legislature over the past two centuries with a one-size-\nfits-all piece of legislation developed in Washington, DC. Through the \ntime-tested methods of common law adjudication and legislative \nadjustment, the State courts and legislatures have worked together to \ndevelop tort laws that strike the appropriate balance between the needs \nof plaintiffs and defendants, and those of consumers and business. Over \nthe past decade, the States have been reforming their own tort systems \nby experimenting with alternative dispute resolution procedures, caps \non punitive damages, and changes in liability standards. In fact, the \nmost recent edition of the American Bar Association Journal reports \nthat State legislatures have taken up more than 70 new tort law bills \nin their current sessions and that new product liability laws have been \nenacted in Illinois, Michigan, and North Dakota this year.\n  This is the way the Federal system is supposed to work. When a \nproblem arises, the States should be the forum for experimenting with \nnew practices and devising new solutions. A Federal law, such as the \none passed by the Senate, would bring this experimentation to a \ngrinding halt and make Congress, which has virtually no experience \nlegislating in this area, responsible for the entire Nation's product \nliability system. It is ironic that this extension of Federal power is \ncoming at a time when we are trying to reduce the size and scope of the \nFederal Government by shifting authority to the States and localities.\n  Recently, the National Conference of State Legislatures adopted a \nresolution opposing Federal product liability legislation. The \nConference noted the proposed Federal legislation would conflict with \nState laws governing tort liability, worker's compensation, and \ninsurance and would place State legislatures and courts in an \nintolerable legal straightjacket.\n  I ask that the complete text of the National Conference of State \nLegislature's resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n National Conference of State Legislatures Resolution Adopted July 20, \n                                  1995\n\n       NCSL has reviewed proposed federal legislation that would \n     preempt state law by severely restricting the rights of \n     persons injured by defective products to seek recovery in \n     state courts.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee began consideration of the Major League Baseball Antitrust \nReform Act, S. 627. I look forward to the committee completing its \nconsideration of this measure at our next business meeting and \nreporting it to the Senate.\n  This year the major league season did not begin, of course, until a \nFederal judge granted an injunction and the owners and players, who had \nshut the game down last August and robbed fans of pennant races and a \nWorld Series, finally declared a ceasefire in their ongoing \nhostilities. They had to scramble to begin a shortened 144-game \nschedule.\n   As far as I can tell the owners and the players have not gotten back \nto the bargaining table. They are no closer to reaching a collective \nbargaining agreement than they were 3 months ago. A further unfair \ntrade practices complaint remains pending against the owners.\n  Interest in major league baseball is undeniably down. Attendance \nfigures show it--they are down between 20 and 30 percent. Ratings for \nthe recent All Star Game were down 10 percent from last year. \nAdvertising and merchandising revenues show it, as well. Both NBC and \nABC recently indicated that they will not even bid on broadcast rights \nfor baseball in the future.\n  In spite of the outstanding years that the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland \nIndians, California Angels, Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies and \nAtlanta Braves are having and the young, talented players throughout \nthe leagues, the unsettled business affairs that haunt major league \nbaseball and disillusioned many of its fans. Older fans have been \nturned off and the younger ones have decided to spend their time and \nattention on other pursuits.\n  Meanwhile interest and attendance at minor league baseball games \ncontinues. If the Vermont Expos are any indication, fans turned off by \nthe excesses of major league baseball have turned to minor league \ngames. Attendance at Centennial Field for Expos' games is up more than \n10 percent and merchandise \n\n[[Page S 10902]]\nsales are booming. It is friendly, fun, and entertaining. I know that I \nwill enjoy taking in a few games during the August recess, if there is \nan August recess.\n  As the season began, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner was \nquoted as saying: ``We knew there would be some fallout. It's very \ntough to assess, but there is a residue from the work stoppage, there's \nno question. There is a lot of anger out there.''\n  At our February 15 hearing on legislation to end baseball's antitrust \nexemption, I had asked the acting commissioner how fans get their \nvoices heard. I observed even then: ``Fans are disgruntled; I mean, \nthey are really ripped. Do they vote with their feet?'' Unfortunately, \nthe strike dragged on, fans suffered through the owners' experiment \nwith so-called replacement teams, and the matter remains unsettled and \nunsettling.\n  Mr. Selig answered me last February by observing that when the strike \nended, there would be an enormous healing process. I said then: ``The \nlonger you go, the harder the healing process is going to be.'' I say \nnow that major league baseball has gone too far and has been above the \nlaw too long.\n  I do not think that those who are the game's current caretakers \nappreciate the damage that they have done. Slick advertising, discount \ntickets, and special giveaway nights will not make up the difference. \nThe last year has been disastrous.\n  Worse, nothing has been resolved. The problems and differences \npersist. There is no collective bargaining agreement and, so far as the \npublic is aware, no prospect of one any time soon. To borrow from a \nfamous baseball great, ``It ain't over, 'til it's over.''\n  Why should people return to major league ballparks or patronize major \nleague teams if the risk remains of having affections toyed with again \nand having hopes of a championship dashed--not by a better team but by \nlabor-management problems?\n  I believe the time has come for the Senate to act. The Senate \nAntitrust Subcommittee reported the bill to the Judiciary Committee on \nApril 5. This consensus bill, S. 627, is sponsored by Senators Hatch, \nThurmond, Moynihan, Graham, and myself. It would cut back baseball's \njudicially created and aberrational antitrust exemption.\n  Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal baseball's \nself-inflicted wounds, but we can do this: We can pass legislation that \nwill declare that professional baseball can no longer operate above the \nlaw. The antitrust laws apply to all other professional sports and \ncommercial activity should apply to professional baseball, as well.\n  Along with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, I recently \nreceived a report of the section on antitrust law of the American Bar \nAssociation that examines S. 627. The antitrust section of the ABA \nreasons that professional baseball's antitrust exemption is not \ntailored to achieve well-defined and justified public goals.\n  The antitrust section, therefore, ``supports legislative repeal of \nthe exemption of professional major league baseball from the federal \nantitrust laws.'' Moreover, the report notes that putting professional \nbaseball on equal footing with other professional sports and business \nand having the antitrust laws apply ``cannot fairly be criticized as \n`taking sides' '' in baseball's current labor-management battle.\n  I look forward to working with our Judiciary Committee chairmen to \nhave our bill, S. 627, considered favorably by the Judiciary Committee \nat our earliest opportunity and then promptly by the Senate. It is time \nthat the Senate act and end this destructive aberration in our \nlaw.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10901-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10902-S10903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MEDICARE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise both to salute the 30th \nanniversary of Medicare and to call on the Republicans to release their \nsecret plan to overhaul the system.\n   Medicare has been an American success story. It has provided health \nand financial security to millions of American seniors for three \ndecades now. Along with Social Security, Medicare has transformed the \nretirement years from a time of fear to a time of confidence. Searing \nanxiety that the next illness would bankrupt you and your children has \nbeen replaced by the sure knowledge that a solemn contract will assure \nyou of the care you need.\n   But now, at a time when we should be celebrating Medicare and \ndiscussing how to make it stronger, we are instead discussing draconian \ncuts and a secret plan to turn the system on its head.\n   During the last week, word has leaked out in the New York Times and \nthe Washington Post about the Medicare cuts being cobbled together in a \nback room somewhere over on the House side. According to both reports, \nthe House Republicans have a plan that would give seniors a devil's \nchoice: face $1,000 a year in additional premiums, co-payments and \ndeductibles or be forced into a health plan that could very well \ndeprive them of the choice of their own doctor.\n\n\n                                 Tax Cut\n\n   Why are such wrenching changes being contemplated for Medicare? To \npay for a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. The $270 billion in \nMedicare cuts are roughly equivalent to the Republican budget's \nproposed $245 billion tax cut--more than half of which would flow to \npeople earning more than $100,000 a year.\n   The Republican Medicare cuts would not be reinvested back into the \nsystem to make it solvent. The majority is not cutting Medicare in \norder to strengthen it. Hardly one dime of the savings would be put \nback into the system. Nearly every bit of the savings would go right \nout the door as tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n  The Republicans also claim that all they want to do is hold Medicare \ncost increases to the same rate as private health care inflation. But \nsuch claims simply ignore the fact that the number of people on \nMedicare is increasing rapidly, as is the average age. The fastest \ngrowing population segment in the United States is people over 85, and \nthese people need a great deal of medical care.\n   The budget for Medicare must increase simply to keep up with these \ndemographic trends. If it does not, benefits will decline and costs for \nrecipients will increase.\n\n\n                               Secret Plan\n\n   According to press reports, that is exactly what the Republicans are \nplanning: increased costs and reduced benefits. Unfortunately, we do \nnot know all the details of the plan because it is being drafted in \nsecret. I joined with a number of my colleagues on the Budget and \nFinance Committees yesterday in sending a letter to our distinguished \nMajority Leader asking him to release details of the Republican \nMedicare plan before the August recess.\n   I am sympathetic to the occasional need for confidentiality in \ndrafting legislation. I believe, however, that the Republicans have had \nample time to come forward with a proposal. It has been nearly 9 months \nsince the Republicans took the majority in Congress and nearly 7 months \nsince they actually took power.\n   But now we are told they will not unveil their plan for Medicare \nuntil September--nearly a full year after they were elected. By that \ntime, there will be little time for hearings, committee consideration \nor public discussion of these sweeping proposals. The Medicare reforms \nwill likely be folded into the reconciliation bill, which will be \nconsidered under special rules limiting debate. We will be under the \ngun to pass the bill by October 1 in order to keep the Government \nrunning.\n   That is no way to consider the most radical overhaul of Medicare in \n30 years. The Republicans must come forward with their plan now so that \nseniors and their families will have time to digest the proposals and \nunderstand what they would mean to them personally and financially. We \nmust have adequate time to weigh this legislation--a few hectic days in \nlate September is not good enough.\n\n\n                              Higher Costs\n\n   As I said, we do not know the exact nature of the Republicans' \nMedicare cuts because they have not been released. What we do know from \nreports in the press, however, is quite discouraging.\n   The Medicare budget would not keep up with medical inflation or the \ninflux of new recipients, and as a result it would cover less and cost \nmore for recipients with each passing year.\n   The Republicans apparently contemplate transforming Medicare into a \n\n[[Page S 10903]]\n  ``voucher'' system. Under this plan, seniors would face mounting \nfinancial pressures every year to move out of their fee-per-service \nsystem and into a managed care plan in which they would not be able to \nchoose their own doctor.\n   I am a supporter of managed care, and I believe it is a valuable \ntool for controlling costs and improving quality in our health care \nsystem. I believe that seniors should be able to choose to join a \nmanaged care plan if they want to, and in fact, more than 70 percent of \nMedicare enrollees already have that option today. But it must be a \nchoice freely made, not one coerced by financial pressures.\n   But it is exactly that kind of financial coercion that the House \nRepublican plan would create. Seniors choosing to remain in the fee-\nper-service part of Medicare would face more than $1,000 a year or more \nin added premiums, co-payments and deductibles. Even those \nbeneficiaries who go into managed care will have their current benefits \nthreatened as the proposed cuts squeeze harder and harder and the real \nvalue of the voucher declines.\n   When we hear numbers like these, we must remember who we are talking \nabout here. The median income for Medicare recipients is $17,000 a \nyear. Seventy-five percent of all seniors make $25,000 a year or less.\n   These are the people who would be pounded by a barrage of new \nexpenses if they choose to stay in fee-per-service: higher copayments, \nhigher premiums, higher deductibles.\n   One Republican proposal would raise the amount seniors pay out-of-\npocket for their care from 20 to 25 percent.\n   The AARP estimates that another of the proposals would increase out-\nof-pocket deductibles--currently at $100--to $270 a year by the year \n2002.\n   The average beneficiary receiving home health care services would \npay $1,020 more in 2002 than they do now.\n  Another provision of the Republican plan spells out exactly how the \nRepublicans would attempt to stay within their extremely tight budget \nprojections for Medicare. According to an internal memo leaked to the \nNew York Times, ``If program spending exceeds growth rates set in law, \nthen outlay reductions will be triggered.''\n   Under the Republican plan, what if Medicare starts to run out of \nmoney at the end of the fiscal year? Will seniors needing medical care \nin September be told to come back after October 1st? If spending is \nprojected to exceed budgeted amounts, will Medicare announce part way \nthrough the year that it will no longer cover mamograms or that \nrecipient copays for doctor visits will double?\n   The Republican plan would also reportedly include some means-testing \nto have more affluent seniors pay more for their coverage. I agree that \nsome means-testing of Medicare benefits will probably be necessary in \nthe long run.\n   We should not kid ourselves, however, about how much savings could \nbe achieved through means-testing. Eighty-three percent of all Medicare \nspending is for older Americans earning less than $25,000 a year. There \nsimply is not that much Medicare spending on wealthy seniors from which \nwe could extract major savings.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n   The American people deserve to know about these changes. Seniors \ndeserve to know. Their children, who could find themselves saddled with \nmore and more of their parents' medical bills, deserve to know.\n   Everyone deserves to know about these changes for the simple reason \nthat the American people care about Medicare, and they care deeply. A \nrecent poll commissioned by the American Association of Retired \nPersons, shows that 89 percent of Americans support this program. \nNinety-two percent see it as the only way older Americans could \npossibly have adequate health care. And 9 in 10 older Americans said \nthey do not want to be a burden on their families.\n   In pushing for passage of Medicare 30 years ago, President Johnson \nsaid, ``the specter of catastrophic hospital bills can [now] be lifted \nfrom the lives of our older citizens.'' I hope we will do nothing in \nthis Congress to let that specter again stalk older Americans. I urge \nthe majority to release its Medicare plan to the public \nimmediately.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10902-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               IF YOU PICK THE FLOWERS YOU COULD EXPLODE\n Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, this Sunday, July 30 marks the \n30th anniversary of the establishment of the Medicare Program. As this \n30th anniversary approaches, it is important for us to reflect on the \nreasons this program was enacted, and its successes.\n  President Truman offered several proposals to Congress, and President \nKennedy made health care for seniors an issue in his 1960 campaign. \nOver and over again, Democrats attempted to pass Medicare legislation. \nOver and over again, Republicans voted overwhelmingly to defeat it. In \n1965, despite a record-setting barrage of advertisements by the \nAmerican Medical Association and many doctors' threats to boycott \nelderly patients, President Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law \non July 30, 1965. Even then, a majority of Republicans voted against \nit.\n  The Medicare Program is an important contract the U.S. Government has \nmade with senior citizens. It is a lifeline for our Nation's elderly. \nIt seems as though times have not changed--Republicans are still \nfighting against the Medicare Program. The same arguments are being \nused. And, Democrats are still fighting for seniors, and fighting to \nstrengthen the program.\n  During this year's budget debate, Democrats tried to put money back \ninto the Medicare Program by eliminating the tax breaks in the budget. \nWe were defeated, time and time again.\n  I have heard rumors of a Republican plan to save Medicare. I have not \nseen an official copy of this plan, and this is worrisome. The Senate \nwill be expected to act on the budget reconciliation plan by September \n22, which is less than 18 legislative days away. How can we possibly \nask our constituents to accept a plan that we have not even debated \nyet? From the little I have heard, this secret plan relies heavily on a \nvoucher system, which will encourage seniors to buy the least costly \nhealth plan. This means losing their family doctor in many instances. \nIf a senior chooses to stay in their current health plan, they will pay \nmore--as high as $1,000 more in premiums, copayments and deductibles.\n\n[[Page S 10904]]\n\n  Seniors simply cannot afford these additional expenses. The average \nsenior citizen makes only $25,000 a year. How can we expect them to pay \nmore, while we give out tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I realize the Medicare system of yesterday does not meet the needs of \nthe Medicare population today. It needs improvement. It needs reform. \nBut simply forcing seniors into HMO's and cutting benefits to seniors \nis not the answer.\n  Seniors will pay more for less. Our aging population is growing, and \ngrowing faster than the money put into the Medicare system in the \nRepublican budget. I worry about the families that have elderly \nparents, like I do. This so-called sandwich generation takes care of \ntheir own children and their elderly parents at the same time. They \nwill feel the pain as their parents are unable to pay for their health \ncare. The middle class will feel the squeeze.\n  My question is this: What will this secret plan the Republicans are \nproposing do to the seniors of this country? Why will they not make the \ndetails public?\n  As we near the 30th anniversary of Medicare, let us fix what is \nbroken in the system. Let us get rid of the waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe system. And let us be honest and sincere with the American people. \nThey understand sacrifice. What they do not understand is secret \ntactics, and bearing an undue portion of that sacrifice. We need to \ngive some hope back to middle-income, working families in this Nation. \nLet us strengthen the program our predecessors rightly worked so hard \nfor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10903-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MEDICARE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, we celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of the passage of Medicare by the Congress. Thirty years \nago, Members of this body took a courageous step and guaranteed health \ninsurance coverage to seniors and the disabled--regardless of a \nperson's income, regardless of a person's illness.\n  The struggle was not an easy one. In fact, it took 30 years of \nstruggle by Democrats to pass Medicare. Through the unwavering \nleadership from Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson, \nMedicare was finally signed into law.\n  What does Medicare mean to the seniors of Maryland and this country? \nLet me tell you.\n  Earlier this week, I visited senior centers in Maryland. I talked \nabout the 30th anniversary of Medicare. And I listened to the seniors--\nwho told me what it means to them to have Medicare coverage and of \ntheir concerns about the proposed cuts to Medicare.\n  Mr. President, who is going to speak for the senior couple in \nCatonsville, MD, who do not know if they will be able to afford higher \nMedicare premiums, particularly given all the out-of-pocket expenses \nlike for prescription drugs that Medicare doesn't even cover?\n  Who is going to speak for the widow I met at the Liberty Road Senior \nCenter in Baltimore County that needs cataract surgery that can save \nher eyesight and doesn't know if Medicare will be there to pay for it?\n  And, Mr. President, who is going to speak for the sons and daughters \nof these seniors who after these cuts may be forced to balance the \nfinancial demands of helping their parents pay deductibles and \ncopayments for necessary lab and screenings and the financial needs of \ntheir own children?\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak out--and speak out loudly and \nforcibly--for these seniors, their families, and their health care.\n  Medicare is a unique American success story. Let us not turn back the \nclock on this success. We should not be talking about downsizing and \ndegrading Medicare.\n  On this 30th anniversary, we should be talking about innovations and \nimprovements. I, personally, would like to see a prescription drug \nbenefit and coverage for prostate cancer screenings, and we desperately \nneed a long-term care policy.\n  Instead we are facing cuts that mean seniors will pay significantly \nmore for the privilege of keeping their own doctor or going to the \nhospital of their choice. That is no choice at all. That is not the \nAmerican way and that is not what Medicare is about.\n  Medicare is a commitment to America's seniors. Medicare says that in \nAmerica, if you are over 65 or disabled, no matter what your income, we \nwill stand by your side and you will get the health care you need. I \nintend to fight to keep this commitment. I intend to keep the ``care'' \nin Medicare.\n  This year, we are not only celebrating the 30th anniversary of \nMedicare, but we are also celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end \nof World War II. Fifty years ago, the Medicare generation organized, \nmobilized, and saved Western civilization. Now is the time once again, \nfor all of us to organize, mobilize, and save health care for our \nseniors. Just as in the days of World War II, the GI Joe generation--\nthe current Medicare generation--hunkered down and was committed to the \ncause. So must we.\n  I am here on the floor today to tell you that I am committed to the \nmission and meaning of Medicare. I am ready to fight the good fight. \nAnd I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to preserve and protect \nthe health care benefits of seniors in Maryland and throughout this \nNation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10904-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10904-S10905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      REMARKS OF THE HONORABLE JOHN DALTON, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY\n\n Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I want to take a moment to draw the \nattention of my colleagues to some very eloquent and pertinent words \nrecently delivered by the Secretary of the Navy John Dalton in my home \nState of Connecticut.\n  The text I am about to insert in the Congressional Record is the \nspeech delivered by Secretary Oalton at the christening of the first \nSeawolf submarine on June 24, 1995, in Groton, CT. I believe it speaks \nvolumes about our country and our future.\n  Therefore, I now ask that the text be printed in the Record and I \ncommend it to my colleagues.\n  The text follows:\n\n                       For Our Children's Freedom\n\n       Thank you admiral Boorda for those very gracious and warm \n     comments. And thank you even more for everything you said \n     about Margaret. Let me say that I agree with every word.\n       One of my great privileges as Secretary of the Navy is to \n     name ships and appoint sponsors of those ships. It is a \n     responsibility I take very seriously. I chose a very special \n     lady to be the sponsor of this most special ship.\n       Let me give you an example of what kind of sponsor Margaret \n     will be. She knew that today would be a day filled with such \n     activity that she wouldn't be able to meet every member of \n     the crew, and she wanted to know every member of the Seawolf \n     crew.\n       So last week she got up in the middle of the night and \n     caught the 4:30AM train to Groton and spent the day and \n     evening with the Sailors of this ship. She will be your \n     sponsor and champion for the life of this ship over the next \n     thirty-five years.\n       It is said that a ship is imbued with the spirit of its \n     sponsor and that indeed is a blessing for Seawolf. Through \n     the course of its life this ship will have many fine \n     commanding officers, and many outstanding Sailors in its \n     crew. But throughout the life of this ship their will be but \n     one sponsor. Seawolf and the United States Navy are very \n     fortunate to have Margaret.\n       This is indeed a historic day, and I want to thank everyone \n     who is here, I am told there is some twelve to thirteen \n     thousand strong in number. I would lie to make each and \n     everyone of you an honorary Seawolf sailor.\n       I am also very proud to have some people who are special to \n     me here today. It is rare that I have the opportunity to have \n     close members of my family around, but my sons John Jr. and \n     Chris are here today. I would like for them to please stand. \n     My brother and my sister, Margaret's brother and her parents. \n     We have lots of family and friends from Louisiana, Texas, \n     Arkansas and Virginia. I would like for all of you to stand \n     and be recognized.\n       Obviously, Margaret and I are very proud to be here. . . .  \n     But not simply because of the honor of participating in the \n     christening of this submarine--the finest submarine in the \n     world. . . .  Not simply to applaud the men and women of the \n     shipbuilding trades here at Electric Boat and the many \n     contractors who contribute to the building of this ship. . . \n     . Not just to honor the brave officers and sailors who will \n     serve through the life of this vessel. But to also take an \n     opportunity to recognize why we are building this submarine \n     and why we need to build more.\n       A number of years ago, a public official--entrusted with \n     the best interests of the citizens of his nation--reflected \n     his personal judgement and the common wisdom with the \n     following words:\n       ``There is no excuse for [building] submarines . . . So far \n     as naval armament is concerned, it will not be long until \n     [we] recognize that the torpedo is obsolescent; the submarine \n     out of date; and the seaplane of so limited utility that \n     expenditure [should] not \n\n[[Page S 10905]]\n     be enlarged by any useless absurdities as air-craft carriers . . .''\n       Historians record that quite a few people applauded that \n     particular speech. In fact, it was published in the most \n     prestigious journal of the day. And why shouldn't those words \n     have been applauded and accepted? Most nations of the world \n     were at peace. An ``evil empire'' had been previously \n     defeated. There was no apparent threat. Government was moving \n     to reduce its budget. There were more important social and \n     economic challenges. Freedom was a given.\n       Ten years later, a crisis threatened that nation and the \n     entire world. . . . A crisis of such magnitude that many \n     apparently wise men chose to sacrifice their very principles \n     to avoid war, a war they were unprepared to fight.\n       Well, war came anyway--perhaps even sooner because of their \n     lack of readiness . . . their lack of such ``absurdities'' as \n     enough capable submarines or aircraft carriers. The war broke \n     with a fury that destroyed their budget plans, their economic \n     strength, their position of world leadership, and the very \n     lives of a great many of the citizens of that democratic \n     nation--whose freedom was ultimately saved through the \n     intervention of its Allies.\n       When that war ended, fifty years ago this year . . . the \n     men and women of that nation--and many nations--would \n     somberly ask themselves: ``why were we so unprepared?''\n       I am talking, of course, about World War Two . . . the war \n     our parents or grandparents had to fight. The public official \n     who made those unfortunate remarks belonged to one of our \n     Allies. But there were many in the United States who had \n     echoed the same\n      sentiments for the same reasons. The irony is that the \n     submarine and the aircraft carrier--absurd and expensive \n     in the perspective of their critics--were the two weapons \n     that proved most effective in winning the naval war.\n       Today, we face a situation not to much unlike the past. A \n     few years ago we won a war--a Cold War to be sure--but one \n     that nevertheless required a great deal of military \n     expenditure. We are now in the process of reducing our budget \n     deficit and tackling many challenges--economic and social--\n     that are very worthy of our attention. There is no longer a \n     threat of global war. Many nations--though not all--are at \n     peace. Freedom seems secure. And like their predecessors, \n     some people think they can predict the future.\n       I don't claim to predict the future. And I am not, by \n     training, a professional historian. But I do know what \n     history teaches. I do know that freedom is not free--it is \n     purchase by heroism and sacrifice in war, and by good \n     judgment and preparedness in peace. In a high-tech world . . \n     . the world of today . . . it is purchased by remaining \n     first-rate in technology and innovation.\n       Having served as a naval officer and a submariner, I know \n     what it is like to go down to the sea--to face potential \n     enemies--in the most capable ship, and what it is like to go \n     down in a ship that would be considered second rate.\n       As Secretary of the Navy, I am committed to ensuring that \n     the tools we give our Sailors and Marines--that their lives \n     depend on--remain first rate.\n       As a businessmen, I know false economy when I see it.\n       And as a citizen, with two fine sons--and maybe to be \n     blessed someday with grandchildren--I am not willing to \n     gamble their future, their freedom on the chance that there \n     will be no war, or that, if it comes, we will be suddenly \n     able to build tomorrow what some proposed to throw away \n     today.\n       How do you preserve freedom? Do you preserve it by letting \n     an entire industry go out of business in the name of false \n     economy? Do you preserve it by allowing partisan politics to \n     blind your judgement? Do you do it by giving a pink slip to \n     men and women who have labored for many years to produce the \n     finest tools for our defense? Do you do it by creating \n     monopolies in the name of competition? Do you do it by \n     declaring new technology unnecessary . . . and the status quo \n     ``good enough.''\n       You know that's not how you preserve freedom. We all know \n     that. So why are some ready to sacrifice an entire defense \n     industry and are willing to throw away hundreds of millions \n     of dollars to stop building capable submarines? How much \n     would we pay to start building them again when the next \n     crisis comes?\n       This Seawolf is the finest submarine in the world. It will \n     regain the American lead in quietness and stealth. The second \n     Seawolf will be better still. And the third Seawolf which we \n     need will be the bridge that preserves this industry to build \n     a more affordable, littoral warfare-oriented New Attack \n     Submarine.\n       You can't get across a chasm without a bridge. There is a \n     chasm in our defense industrial strength. If Congress does \n     not authorize and fund the third Seawolf, the depth of this \n     chasm will not simply be measured in lost jobs . . . or \n     dollars wasted in higher overhead and contracting fees . . . \n     but in the potential breakup of a defense industry that has \n     always served our best interest in preserving the peace. I \n     shudder at the thought that someday historians will say: the \n     United States was once the best builder of submarines.\n       I do not predict that a global crisis is coming. I do not \n     claim that we are in danger today. I hate war. Every night \n     before I sleep, I pray that war never again occurs. I pray \n     that throughout their lifetimes, my sons will be blessed with \n     the gift of peace. But I know that--to paraphrase President \n     John F. Kennedy--God's work on earth must truly be our own. \n     We are the ones who are responsible for peace. We are the \n     ones who are responsible for freedom. The steps that we take \n     today will be the ones that may determine the freedom of our \n     children.\n       The builders of this submarine . . . this mighty Seawolf . \n     . . are a national treasure in knowledge and skills. The \n     nuclear submarine-building industry represents an investment \n     we have spent over forty years to develop. We are gambling \n     with a national treasure if we do not take steps to preserve \n     it. That's why I want to take this opportunity to ask each \n     one of you in the audience--and all Americans--to urge \n     Congress to fund the third and final Seawolf as a bridge to \n     the submarine capabilities we will need in the future.\n       Just before I left Washington to come to this ceremony, I \n     received a letter that I would like to read to you. The \n     letter is dated 22 June.\n       ``Greetings to all those gathered for the christening of \n     Seawolf.\n       Seawolf will strengthen and sustain the invaluable \n     contributions the Navy makes to America's leadership in \n     global affairs. Ready for any contingency, her combat power, \n     mobility, and flexibility will help to promote the cause of \n     liberty and protect our national security. This fine \n     submarine will stand as a reminder of our steadfast \n     commitment to maintaining a democratic world for the \n     generations to come.\n       As we celebrate the christening of Seawolf, I want to \n     reemphasize my continuing support for the completion of the \n     third and final Seawolf-class submarine SSN-23. The Armed \n     Forces of the United States and our civilian defense \n     industries share an effective partnership; proceeding with \n     the construction of SSN-23 is the most cost-effective method \n     of retaining the vitality of these industries while bridging \n     the gap to the future New Attack Submarine.\n       On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank those who \n     design and build the Seawolf submarines, as well as those who \n     will serve in them. Best wishes for a wonderful ceremony.''\n       The letter is signed by President Bill Clinton.\n       This is a wonderful occasion--this christening of a \n     Seawolf-class submarine. This is a great day for Margaret and \n     me, for the United States Navy, for all America. But--as \n     President Clinton says--we need to do it twice more--not once \n     more--if we are to guarantee that--as concerns the deterrence \n     of global war . . . as concerns war undersea or elsewhere--\n     there will always be great days of peace, and freedom from \n     fear, for our children.\n       No one can predict the future. But we can prepare. To stay \n     prepared, America requires a healthy nuclear submarine-\n     building industry. Our Commander-in-Chief knows that. And \n     Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs, the CNO, these distinguished members of Congress and \n     I are convinced of that. We are convinced that we need to \n     build a third Seawolf to preserve this industry's health. And \n     to preserve this vital resource . . . to let everyone know \n     the real risks we take by gambling it away for false economy. \n     To reply to those who say a third Seawolf is not necessary, \n     to those who oppose our submarine program--my response is the \n     words of our founding father, John Paul Jones, ``We have not \n     yet begun to fight.''\n       Thank you very much. God bless you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10904-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10905-S10906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       FOOD STAMP FRAUD REDUCTION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am convinced that the single most \nimportant thing we can do to reduce fraud in the Food Stamp Program is \nto eliminate the use of paper coupons--and shift to electronic benefits \ntransfer systems, also known as ``EBT.''\n  I made that same point to this body on November 8, 1993. That was \nwhen I first introduced legislation to eliminate food stamp coupons in \nfavor of EBT.\n  I will introduce an updated version of that bill--which I hope can \npass with the support of every Member of the Senate.\n  I know that Senator Santorum recently spoke of the benefits of EBT, \nas demonstrated in a pilot project in Berks County, PA.\n  The Majority Leader, Senator Dole, and I supported pilot testing EBT \nsystems for food stamps in 1982.\n  My bill eliminates the coupon system in 3 to 5 years. The present \nsystem is a clumsy dinosaur in need of overhauling by modern \ntechnology.\n  By the year 2000, those paper coupons --which now cost the Government \n$50 million to $60 million a year to print and process--will be \nhistory.\n  We will reduce fraud and save the Government money.\n  My bill empowers retail stores, financial institutions, and the \nStates to figure out the best way to move to an EBTS system. \n\n[[Page S 10906]]\n\n  My bill specifically gives businesses and States the lead roles in \nthis conversion.\n  Because the Federal Government saves so much money through EBT, I \nwant USDA to pay 100 percent of the costs of the point-of-sale \nequipment that goes into the stores, unless the store wants to obtain \nits own equipment. The bill encourages stores, but does not require \nthem, to buy their own point-of-sale equipment.\n  Under current law and most welfare reform proposals, States have to \npick up half those costs.\n  I also believe USDA should provide the cards to States at no cost to \nthe State. Under current law, USDA picks up the tab for coupon costs \nand should do the same for cards.\n  The point-of-sale terminals should also be available for use by the \nState for State assistance programs.\n  Many grocery stores already use electronic systems to read credit \ncards and debit cards. I do not want us to reinvent the wheel--my bill \npiggy-backs the Food Stamp Program onto existing technology.\n  I intend to incorporate this bill either into the food stamp title of \nthe farm bill or into the budget reconciliation bill.\n  Food stamps are America's largest child nutrition program. Over 80 \npercent of food stamp benefits go to families with children. Most of \nthe rest of the benefits go to the disabled or the elderly.\n  I want you to join with me in assuring that nutrition benefits go to \nneedy families--not to criminals who are stealing taxpayer money.\n  Just about everybody agrees that EBT will reduce fraud dramatically.\n  The inspector general of USDA has testified that EBT ``can be a \npowerful weapon to improve detection of trafficking and provide \nevidence leading to the prosecution of traffickers.''\n  The U.S. Secret Service says that ``[t]he EBT system is a great \nadvancement generally because it puts an audit trail relative to the \nuser and the retail merchant.''\n  Under President Bush, USDA noted that ``the potential savings are \nenormous'' if EBT is used in the Food Stamp Program.\n  A more recent Office of Technology Assessment report determined that \na national EBT system might reduce levels of food stamp fraud losses \nand benefit diversion by as much as 80 percent. Think about that--EBT \ncould reduce food stamp fraud losses and benefit diversions by as much \nas 80 percent.\n  Alan Greenspan has described the potential advantages offered by EBT \nfor the Food Stamp Program, including reducing costs in food stamp \nprocessing by the Federal Reserve System.\n  Perhaps nothing is totally fraud-proof, but EBT is clearly much \nbetter than the current system of paper coupons. When a small store \nstocked with cigarettes and a few stale candy bars starts ringing up \nfood stamp sales in the thousands of dollars, it is pretty obvious that \nthe Government is being taken for a ride.\n  With the electronic card, EBT transactions can be constantly \nmonitored by law enforcement agencies. Paper coupon transactions \ncannot.\n  If we had to reinvent the Food Stamp Program today, would anyone \ninsist on paper coupons, instead of EBT?\n  Under the current program, USDA prints more than 375 million food \nstamp booklets per year, which amounts to 2.5 billion paper food \ncoupons for food stamp households to use at retail stores.\n  These coupons are used once, except for $1 coupons which may be used \nto make change--and the change is often spent on non-food items.\n  The 2.5 billion coupons issued per year are mailed, shipped, issued \nto participants, counted, canceled, redeemed through the banking system \nby Treasury, shipped again, stored, and then destroyed.\n  Some States mail them out each month and pay the postage, for which \nthey receive a partial Federal reimbursement. Coupons are lost or \nstolen in the mails.\n  Some States issue coupons at State offices, which is labor-intensive. \nThe total Federal and State cost is up to $60 million per year.\n  EBT has another benefit--it eliminates cash change. Food stamp \nrecipients can get cash change in food stamp transactions if the cash \ndoes not exceed $1 per purchase. This system allows food stamp benefits \nto be diverted to the purchase of non-food items.\n  While we may disagree over food stamp benefit levels and eligibility \nrules, I hope we can all agree that transferring food stamp benefits \nelectronically is much better than using paper coupons.\n  The bill amends the Food Stamp Act to require that the Secretary of \nAgriculture no longer provide food stamp coupons to States within 3 \nyears of enactment.\n  Any Governor may grant his or her State an additional 2-year \nextension and the Secretary can add another 6-month extension, for a \nmaximum of 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  At the end of that time, States no longer would receive coupons. Food \nbenefits instead would be provided through electronic transfer, or in \nthe form of cash if authorized by the Food Stamp Act.\n  For example, under a bill reported out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee by Senator Lugar on June 14, 1995, States can cash out food \nstamp benefits as part of a wage supplementation program.\n  As in the food stamp bill reported out of the Agriculture Committee \nby Senator Lugar, States will not be liable for losses associated with \nlost or stolen EBT cards.\n  The bill makes households liable for most EBT losses; however, they \nare not liable for losses after they report the loss or theft of the \nEBT card.\n  As under current law, States are liable for their own fraud and \nnegligence losses.\n  My bill provides that regulation E will not apply to food stamp EBT \ntransactions.\n  In general, regulation E provides that credit or debit card users are \nliable for only the first $50 in unauthorized uses of lost or stolen \ncredit cards as long as such a loss is reported in a timely manner.\n  The card issuer is liable for the rest of the loss.\n  Under current law the State is considered the card issuer for food \nstamp EBT purposes. Regulation E has been a major impediment to \nimplementation of EBT by States.\n  While the risks are much lower for the Food Stamp Program than for \ncredit cards since EBT food cards only contain the balance of the \nunused food benefits rather than a credit line, States are still \nworried about liability and oppose the application of regulation E.\n  The bill also provides that each recipient will be given a personal \ncode number [PIN] to help prevent unauthorized use of the card.\n  Under the bill, in an effort to reduce the costs of implementing a \nnationwide EBT system, States will look at the best way to maximize the \nuse of existing point-of-sale terminals. States will be able to follow \nexisting technology, rather than reinvent the wheel.\n  Stores which choose not to invest in their own systems will be \nreimbursed for card readers for Federal and State benefits only. \nCurrent law, which requires States to pay half that cost, will be \namended to have USDA pay all those costs.\n  If the store decides at a later date that it needs a commercial \nreader, the store will have to bear all the costs.\n  In very rural areas, or in other situations such as house-to-house \ntrade routes or farmers' markets, manual EBT systems will be used.\n  This restriction--in which the Government pays only for Government \nbenefits readers and the upgrade at store expense--will encourage the \nlargest possible number of stores to invest in their own point-of-sale \nequipment.\n  That is clearly the best option.\n  To the extent needed to cover costs of conversion to EBT, the \nSecretary may charge a transaction fee of up to 2 cents per EBT \ntransaction, taken out of benefits. Households receiving the maximum \nbenefit level may be charged a lower per transaction fee than other \nhouseholds.\n  In implementing the bill, the Department of Agriculture will have to \nconsult with retail stores, the financial industry, the Federal EBT \ntask force, the inspector general of USDA, the U.S. Secret Service, the \nNational Governors' Association, the Food Marketing Institute, and \nothers.\n  I believe this legislation will be an important tool as we try to \nimprove the Food Stamp Program.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10905-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 10907]]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \nnote the passing of my good friend and mentor, former Michigan Gov. \nGeorge Romney. George Romney will be remembered as one of Michigan's \ngreatest citizens, a leader in government, a leader in business, and a \nleading advocate of his favorite cause, which was voluntarism.\n  He was born in 1907 in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua, Mexico, but grew \nup moving with his family throughout the American Southwest. He worked \nhard to help his family, working in the sugar fields, and then went off \nto England as a missionary of his faith.\n  Returning to America, he attended George Washington University, \nworked in this city for a time dealing primarily with tariff and \nmanufacturing issues, and then went back to Michigan as a local manager \nof the Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n  In Michigan, George Romney joined Nash-Kelvinator Corp., the \nforerunner of American Motors, in 1946. In 1954, he became AMC's \npresident. From this position, he changed the way America drives, \nselling us on the ease and efficiency of compact cars.\n  But George Romney was not content with his success in business. He \nwas a public spirited man and wanted to do more to improve life in our \nState of Michigan. That is why he founded a nonpartisan group, Citizens \nfor Michigan, which successfully pushed for a State constitutional \nconvention. That convention rewrote Michigan's code of laws and watched \nGeorge Romney's first successful bid for Governor. Twice more, he ran \nfor Governor and twice more the people of Michigan showed their support \nfor a man who put their interests first.\n  But George's public service did not stop there. He went to Washington \nto serve in the President's Cabinet for over 4 years. Then leaving \npolitics, he turned his attention to the great cause of his life, \nvoluntarism.\n  All of Michigan has benefited from George Romney's work, bringing \ncommunities and civic organizations together to encourage people to \nvolunteer their time. George knew that it is public spirit that holds a \ncommunity together, and he promoted that public spirit and the hard \nwork that must support it wherever he went.\n  Michigan's first lady, Michael Engler, joined him in this important \nwork, as did other prominent people in Michigan.\n  Interestingly, just last week, I met with George Romney in my office \nin the U.S. Senate. He was still working on that cause of voluntarism, \nand together we began working on legislation to promote voluntarism at \nour local communities and throughout the Nation.\n  To the last, he was vital, energetic, and committed to improving \npeople's lives.\n  I convey my condolences today to the Romney family and everyone who \ncherished him as a friend. I am consoled, as I hope they are, by the \nmany fond memories with which this good friend of Michigan and our \nNation left us.\n  As I said, Mr. President, just last week, I met with George Romney to \ndiscuss a legislative issue of great importance to him and one which I \nintend to continue in his memory, because I believe that the commitment \nhe made to voluntarism is one that all of us in the U.S. Senate should \ndo their part to advance.\n  For all that we may do as paid public servants, it pales, in my \njudgment, in comparison to the things that voluntarists do to make life \nin our country better. The memory of George Romney for me will be of a \nman who did things for his community and for his State as a volunteer \nand made our lives better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 30 years ago today the Senate passed the \nlaw creating Medicare. Two days later--on July 30, 1965--President \nLyndon Johnson signed that bill into law.\n  In doing so he made a quantum leap toward fulfilling the goal--first \nchampioned by President Truman--to end the scandal of poverty and poor \nhealth among older Americans. \n\n[[Page S 10909]]\n\n  He also changed dramatically what it means to grow old in America, \nand to watch our parents grow old.\n  Medicare helps seniors replace dependence with dignity, uncertainty \nwith stability, and destitution with financial security.\n  Over the last three decades--despite the turmoil of wars and \nrecessions and even a crisis in our health care system--Medicare has \nsurvived to become one of the most popular--and successful--programs in \nour Nation's history.\n  Ask America's families. They will tell you. Medicare is not some \nGreat Society extravagance. It is the cornerstone of financial security \nand independence of older Americans and their families.\n  Indeed, when you ask people what Medicare should look like in the \n21st century, most Americans say we should make only minor changes in \nthe program--or no changes at all.\n  The American people want us to preserve Medicare and strengthen it, \nnot weaken it.\n  They want us to honor the commitment we made 30 years ago to seniors \nand their families, not abandon it.\n\n\n                    The Route to Passage of Medicare\n\n  Passage of the Medicare bill did not come easily or quickly.\n  It took 20 years. Twenty years from the time Harry Truman began the \ncampaign for a national plan to provide affordable health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Although big-money special interests and their allies in Congress \nwere able to block President Truman's plan by claiming falsely that it \nwould mean ``socialized medicine,'' Democrats did not give up.\n  Instead, we refocused our efforts on the area of greatest need: \nhealth security for America's seniors.\n  In 1960, the Medicare concept gained an important supporter when \nthen-Senator John Kennedy sponsored a Social Security approach to \nhealth care for the elderly.\n  Again, Republicans invoked the fear of social welfarism.\n  These criticisms only strengthened Kennedy's resolve. As a \npresidential candidate, he was even more determined to make Medicare a \nreality.\n  Three times Kennedy requested passage of Medicare, and three times it \nwas opposed in large measure by Republicans and defeated.\n  In the short-run, President Kennedy's efforts failed. But they laid \nimportant groundwork for the final, successful push for Medicare's \npassage.\n  After President Kennedy's death, President Johnson took up the fight.\n  Though criticism of Medicare continued--some of it from Members who \ntoday serve in this chamber--President Johnson was undeterred. Congress \nfinally passed the measure, and the bill was signed into law 30 years \nago this Sunday.\n\n\n                           Republican Budget\n\n  It is a strange and sad irony that the Republican majority chose the \nyear of Medicare's 30th anniversary to unveil a budget that threatens \nto severely weaken the program. Thirty years after its passage, we are \nfighting to preserve the one program that, more than any other, older \nAmericans and their families count on for economic security.\n  It was only a year ago that Republicans and Democrats alike spoke in \nthis Chamber of the need to ensure health security for all Americans.\n  Today, Republicans are rushing headlong in the opposite direction. \nInstead of extending coverage to all Americans, they are preparing to \nincrease dramatically health costs for older Americans.\n  In their drive to gain control of this Congress, Republicans assured \nus that any dollars they cut from Medicare would be plowed back into \nthe program to strengthen and improve it.\n  They promised to balance the budget, cut taxes, leave Social Security \nand defense spending untouched, and do no harm to Medicare.\n  Many seniors hung their hats on this promise and gave the new \nmajority the benefit of the doubt.\n  Now we know the truth. We have seen draft Republican plans for \nMedicare. And we know that their promises to protect the program were \nhollow.\n  What a way to say ``Happy Anniversary'' to Medicare and the people \nwho support this program.\n\n\n                    Faces of Medicare Beneficiaries\n\n  There are many in this Chamber who would like to reduce the Medicare \ndebate to numbers on a ledger. But this debate is about more than \ndebits and credits. It is about people, and the promises we have made \nto them.\n  Today's Medicare beneficiaries lived through the Great Depression and \nthe Second World War. They established homes and built families. They \nalways looked to the future instead of dwelling on the hardships of the \npast.\n  Most are now retired and live on modest Social Security benefits, \npensions, and savings. And most depend on Medicare as their primary \nsource of health coverage.\n  They do not live lives of leisure and luxury. Three-quarters of \nMedicare beneficiaries have incomes below $25,000 per year. Fewer than \n5 percent have incomes over $50,000.\n  And each year, health care costs chew up a growing percentage of \ntheir incomes. The average senior today spends over 20 percent of his \nor her income on health care--even with Medicare coverage.\n  For many seniors, the prospect of living without Medicare is \nunimaginable.\n  What should they give up to pay their doctors bills? What would those \nwho want to cut Medicare have older Americans do without?\n  Food?\n  Heat in the winter?\n  Electricity?\n  Should they not go to the doctor when they are sick?\n  Should they not take the medicine they need?\n  Our Republican colleagues say their Medicare cuts will not hurt \nanyone.\n  That is not true.\n  Cutting Medicare by $270 billion--which is what Republicans are \nproposing--will cost seniors nearly $900 per year in additional out-of-\npocket expenses--$900 a year from seniors living on fixed incomes so \nthat we can give more tax breaks to the rich.\n  Republicans will claim differently, that a more efficient program \nwill absorb the cuts. But their numbers simply do not add up.\n  They call it reform. I call it what it is: an insurance hike.\n  Money to pay for higher premiums will not materialize out of thin \nair. It will come out of Social Security checks. Or, it will come out \nof the savings seniors worked so hard for--savings they are counting on \nto last the remainder of their lives.\n  This is the human side of the Medicare debate.\n  It is a side of the discussion that makes some of us feel \nuncomfortable, and rightfully so. But it is a side we must recognize \nand address. We owe it to our Nation's seniors.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  It is true that everyone must sacrifice if we are to balance our \nbudget.\n  No one knows about change and sacrifice more than older Americans. \nThey did what was necessary to make the blessings of that freedom \navailable for us today.\n  All they are asking in return from us now is that we keep our promise \nto them.\n  When President Johnson signed the Medicare legislation 30 years ago \nin Independence MO, standing next to him was President Truman, the man \nwho had 20 years earlier staked so much of his own Presidency on health \nsecurity for all Americans.\n  After the bill had been signed, President Truman turned to President \nJohnson and said, ``You have made me a very, very happy man.''\n  When I look at what some Republicans are preparing to do to Medicare, \nI wonder what Harry Truman would say today?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/28/senate-section/article/S10908-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL 12:30 P.M., MONDAY, JULY 31, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
