Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning, again, \nwith America on my mind and American families on my mind. Today, they \nare working harder and they are worrying more about job stability, and \nthey are wondering about what the future holds, especially when this \nGovernment wants to call all of the rules and regulations from here \nthroughout the country.\n  Most families live from paycheck to paycheck, and they struggle every \nmonth just to make ends meet. They are frustrated because the money \nthey used to be able to live on does not get to the end of the month. \nSome would say, ``There is a lot of month left over at the end of the \nmoney.'' Families, from Montana to Maine, want freedom from Washington \nand the crushing burden it puts on the backs of all Americans.\n  Let us talk about taxes first, as we have been doing all week. We \nneed to give some of the 1993 tax increases back to families. That is \nwhat repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax would do.\n  I thought a lot of the comments yesterday of my friend from Missouri, \nwhen he says, ``Let us give it back to the people.'' This really \nstresses people who have to go to work every day, and it goes to people \nthat will not work. That is not fair. These are the people that are \ntrying to make America work.\n  Tax freedom day is now after 128 days because of that big tax \nincrease in 1993. Total taxes are now running around 38.2 percent on \nfamily income. This repeal starts to at least give some of the money \nback to American families and also helps them along with their savings, \nand with the education of their young folks.\n  Also, let us talk a little bit about Government regulation this \nmorning.\n  Flextime. What we have been talking about is the ability--and the \nTEAM Act--of people, of employers and employees, sitting down and \nironing out some of the factors in a workplace that make a company go. \nThat is what we are doing here, and talking about what is wrong with \nthis communication between an employee and an employer. What is wrong \nwith some of them setting some rules and some parameters which help not \nonly the employee but the employer and also help the company to \nsurvive?\n  Home office deduction telecommuters. We fought very hard for that. I \nthink back in 1991 or 1992, we put an amendment in the Transportation \nAct that says we ought to study the impact of folks who stay home and \ndo their work because they have new technology such as computers, such \nas fax machines, such as telephones. So we said, do a study and see \nwhat impact that has on our transportation system and on our highways \nbecause right now we know we cannot outbuild the roads to stay ahead of \nAmerica's love for the automobile.\n  So what is wrong with having a designated spot in a home in \ntelecommuting maybe where even the employees here in Washington who did \nnot want to come up I-395--as you know, I-395 from 6 o'clock in the \nmorning until about 9 o'clock in the morning has been termed the \nworld's largest parking lot. What is the impact on the environment? \nWhat is the impact on our fuel consumption, and on energy consumption?\n  Why can we not look at our tax bracket and say, ``OK. Maybe you can \nstay home maybe 1 or 2 days out of\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\nevery week and still get your work done, still be in contact, still \ncommunicate with everybody in the office and your customers or people \nin other places.''\n  What is wrong with the TEAM Act? What is wrong with making these \nkinds of agreements for a better workplace? Where I come from, the \npeople I am talking to sure want higher wages. The Government got their \nincrease. In 1993, it was taken away from you; stagnated wages. If you \nlook at a State like Montana, everybody wants to put the miners out of \nbusiness where the best blue-collar jobs in Montana are in natural \nresources and the management of natural resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. So this morning, Mr. President, I ask that we take a long \nlook at the total picture of families and what makes them tick. How do \nwe secure their wages? How do we give them some permanence, and how do \nwe contribute to a better life for families in all of America?\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut has reserved 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4883-5", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4884-S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ARMS SHIPMENTS TO BOSNIA FROM ISLAMIC COUNTRIES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a few days ago, on Tuesday of this \nweek, a number of colleagues rose to express criticism of the actions \nof the Clinton administration with regard to arms shipments from \nIslamic countries, including Iran, across Croatia to supply the Bosnian \nArmy and the decision made not to intervene by this administration in \nApril 1994. Yesterday, our colleagues in the other body voted to \nappropriate $1 million to conduct a formal investigation of this \nincident, which has been referred to as Iran-Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, as far as I am concerned, the suggestion here that \nwhat happened in April 1994 with the Clinton administration bore any \nresemblance to the Iran-Contra affair is wrong. There is simply no \nconnection between the two. As my colleagues in the Senate know, for \nquite a long time--1993, 1994, 1995--I was very critical of this \nadministration's inability to lift the arms embargo multilaterally, \npreferably, but unilaterally if necessary. But for the very reasons \nthat led me to work, on a bipartisan basis, with the Senate majority \nleader and others to urge this administration to mandate finally that \nthe arms embargo against Bosnia be lifted, I find the criticism of the \nadministration and the President with regard to the decision made in \nApril 1994 to be way off base, to be unfair, to be a bum rap. It is, in \nfact, quite the opposite of what was implied and expressed by all of us \nwho worked so hard to convince our colleagues and this administration \nto lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. I want to \nexplain why I come to the conclusion that what the President did in \nApril 1994 was not simply not wrong, but, in fact, I believe it was the \nright and moral decision to make.\n  Let me go back to that time in early 1994. In January 1994, we passed \nan amendment, supported by the majority leader and myself and many \nothers on both sides of the aisle, which expressed the sense of the \nSenate--because it is all we could manage to convince our colleagues to \nsupport--a sense of the Senate that we should lift the arms embargo on \nthe Bosnian Government by an 87-to-9 vote. That was a vote here in this \nChamber. That vote expressed the growing disgust, fury, and frustration \nby most of us here in this Chamber, if not people throughout the \ncountry and the world, that acts of aggression and genocide were \noccurring, primarily by the Serbs against the Bosnian people, and not \nonly was the world just standing by, but we were prohibiting the \nBosnian people from receiving the arms necessary to exercise their \nfundamental right of self-defense. That was in January of 1994 that the \nSenate spoke.\n  In the spring of 1994, Bosnia was in dire straits. The newly \nestablished federation joining the Bosniacs and the Croats was in a \nvery precarious state. The Bosnian Moslems in Gorazde, Sarajevo, and \nelsewhere were under siege, and not just casual siege but siege that \nthreatened wide-scale death, destruction, and defeat. The Bosnians \nagain, confronted by a foe with immense advantage and heavy weaponry, \nwere, under an embargo passed in 1992 before the war broke out to try \nto stop the war from breaking out, denied by the international \ncommunity the means to defend themselves.\n  I said then repeatedly, as others did in this Chamber, that that \nembargo was unjust and immoral. Major cities in Bosnia were threatened \nwith being overrun by the Serbs. In fact, the Bosnian-Croat Federation \nwas on the edge of defeat and annihilation.\n  Against that backdrop, in April 1994, the Croatian Government asked \nthe United States, through diplomatic channels, whether the United \nStates Government would object if Croatia were to allow arms shipments \nto go through its country, Croatia, to the Bosnian Government from \nother countries, primarily Islamic countries, including Iran. In fact, \nas I mentioned Islamic countries, there is some reason to believe that \nnot just Iran, although that for understandable reasons concerns us, \nbut also Turkey, perhaps Malaysia, perhaps including, with the support \nof our allies, Saudi Arabia, supplied arms to the Bosnians in transit \nthrough Croatian territory. The question then posed to the Clinton \nadministration by this diplomatic query from Croatia was, should the \nUnited States at that point have acted forcefully to require the \nCroatians to stop those arms from going to the Bosnians?\n  President Clinton decided that the United States would neither \napprove nor object to such shipments. American diplomats told the \nCroatian Government in response to their question that they had ``no \ninstructions'' on the matter. That, I feel very strongly, was the right \ndecision diplomatically and morally, for to have done otherwise would \nhave meant that the United States was not simply refusing to supply \narms itself to the Bosnian Government, was not simply at that point \nenforcing to the extent it was able the embargo against the Bosnians, \nbut was in fact demanding that other countries that wanted to allow \narms to go to the Bosnians not be allowed to do so.\n  Some critics now insist that in making that decision the \nadministration undertook covert action without reporting to Congress. \nThat is a quasi-legal argument invoking, I suppose, memories of Iran-\nContra, and I wish to explain why I feel there was not covert action \nhere. In fact, it was neither covert nor was it action.\n  Let me make clear, too, that unlike the Iran-contra episode, there \nwas here no mandate from Congress not to supply aid as there was in the \ncase of aid to the contras. In fact, here there was growing support in \nCongress to have the United States Government either supply arms to the \nBosnians or at least, as happened later in the year, to stop enforcing \nthis immoral embargo.\n  Why do I say this was neither covert nor was it action? In legal \nterms, the administration decided to take no position, give no \ninstruction on the delivery of arms through Croatia to Bosnia from \nIslamic countries including Iran. That does not constitute action. The \nState Department has made it very clear that the United States had no \ncontact with Iran on this matter and took absolutely no action to \nfacilitate these shipments. So I do not see how this can be construed \nas action by our Government which would require formal reporting to \nCongress under relevant law.\n  Second, and very importantly, this decision was by no means covert. \nWhile my colleagues who have been critical of late of the decision have \nacted, I presume, on the basis of an article which appeared early in \nApril of this year, 1996, in the Los Angeles Times about the \nPresident's decision, the fact is that the decision made by the \nPresident and the administration in 1994 to give no instructions to the \nCroatians on the question of Islamic shipments of arms to the Bosnians \nacross their territory should have been known to all of us and \ncertainly should not be construed as news.\n  The leadership of the Congress and the relevant committees and their \nstaffs have and at that time and from the beginning of the war in \nBosnia had routine access to the very same intelligence information \nabout the Islamic arms shipments that was seen by administration \nofficials early in 1994, and, in fact, before. No one, to my\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nknowledge, urged the administration to take any steps at that time to \nstop the arms from reaching the Bosnians.\n  Arms shipments from Iran and the other countries to Bosnia, \nfacilitated by Croatia, which incidentally took its share of these \nweapons, in fact, became public knowledge in a Washington Post article \non May 13, 1994, approximately 1 month after the administration made \nthe decision to give no instructions to the Croatians. Again, we heard, \nand the record shows, no calls from anyone to stop those shipments of \narms.\n  In June 1994, 1 month later and 2 months after the decision made by \nthe administration, our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nspeaking forcefully for the lifting of the arms embargo denying the \nBosnian Government the right to self-defense, shared with us all--and \nit is printed in the Congressional Record--a June 24, 1994, Washington \nTimes story entitled ``Iranian Weapons Sent Via Croatia--Aid to Moslems \nGets U.S. 'Wink.''' The whole story was told 2 years ago, 2 months \nafter the administration's decision. I urge my colleagues to look at \nthat article. Thus, the Congress and the public not only knew of \nIranian arms shipments to Bosnia, but we also knew of President \nClinton's decision not to act to stop those shipments nearly 2 years \nago.\n  On April 14 and 15, 1995, a little more than a year ago, a year after \nthe decision was made by the administration, the Washington Post \nreported extensively on the President's decision not to stop arms \nshipments destined to the Bosnian Government, and still, I think for \nunderstandable reasons, there was no clamor for the United States to \nstop those shipments. In fact, the Washington Post, in an editorial on \nApril 16 of 1995 entitled ``Arms For Bosnia,'' endorsed President \nClinton's decision saying that the risk of Iranian influence was ``A \nrisk worth taking to serve what ought to be regarded as the political \nand moral core of American policy to render as much support as possible \nto the Bosnian Muslims.''\n\n  So there can be no doubt that we all knew or should have known about \nthe Iranian arms shipments to Bosnia and the shipments from other \nIslamic countries 2 years ago, and we all knew or should have known of \nthe President's decision not to try to stop those shipments in the \nspring of 1994. And during that whole time the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives did not call for U.S. action to stop those shipments.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I conclude that these shipments were by no \nmeans covert. In fact, not only were they not covert, they were not \nwrong, and shortly thereafter we in Congress expressed our agreement \nwith that conclusion.\n  Later, in 1994--in fact, in August 1994, on August 11, 1994--with \npressure building here for support of the resolution that Senator Dole \nand I and others were advancing to lift the arms embargo, unilaterally \nif necessary, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Nunn, and then Senate majority leader, Senator \nMitchell, as an amendment to the fiscal year 1995 Defense authorization \nbill which called for multilateral lifting of the arms embargo but, \nmore relevant to the present controversy, mandated the end of any \nAmerican involvement in enforcing the international arms embargo on the \nBosnian Government.\n  In October 1994, Senator Dole and I and our cosponsors, \nunfortunately, could not gain enough votes to pass our legislation \nmandating unilateral lifting of the arms embargo, but in response to \nour efforts the Congress adopted the Nunn-Mitchell provision as part of \nthe fiscal year 1995 National Defense Authorization Act. So we in this \nbody and our colleagues in the other body made it illegal, against the \nlaw, for the United States to use appropriated funds to enforce the \narms embargo.\n  So since November 1994, the Clinton administration has been \nprohibited from acting to intercept arms shipments to Bosnia from Iran \nor anybody else, exactly the decision made in April 1994 by the \nadministration. In that sense, the decision was ratified by the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear that I share the concern expressed \nby my colleagues who spoke the other day, and other times, about the \ncontinued Iranian presence and influence in Bosnia. In fact, the Senate \nmajority leader and I raised this concern in a letter we sent a few \nmonths ago to President Izetbegovic of Bosnia. I believe there has been \na response to that letter. But, of course, what I am saying here is \nthat we need to see the results and the content of the administration's \ndecision of April 1994 beyond the unfortunate but, after all, very \nlimited, continued presence of Iran in Bosnia.\n  The supply of arms to Croatia and Bosnia by Islamic countries in 1994 \nand before in fact changed the military balance in the former \nYugoslavia. As a result, the Bosniacs and Croats were able to defend \ntheir people and their territory and even reverse Serb gains.\n  I certainly--and I am sure most of my colleagues--would much rather \nhave seen the arms embargo lifted and the arms supplied to the Bosnian \nGovernment by the United States or other friendly countries other than \nIran. It is clear to me--it was then--that the Bosnian Government would \nhave preferred that outcome, but just as a drowning person cannot be \nparticular about who has thrown him a life jacket, a dying nation, a \nnation under death siege, as Bosnia was at that time, cannot be \nparticular about who gives it arms. Without the supply of those arms, \nthe Serbs, in my opinion, would have completed their campaign of \nterritorial aggression, ethnic cleansing. With these arms, the Bosniacs \nand Croats cooperated to hold the Serbs in place--in fact, to reverse \nsome Serb gains.\n  Then we came to 1995, growing concern about the course of the war, \nand finally Senator Dole and I, and our cosponsors, were able to \nreceive majority support here in this Chamber and in the other body for \nmandating a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo against the \nBosnians. Srebrenica fell; a slaughter occurred there. With that in the \npublic's mind, and being able to say to our allies in Europe that \nCongress was about to force him to lift the arms embargo unilaterally, \nthe President was able to gain the allies' support for the NATO \nairstrikes which brought the Serbs to the negotiating table at Bosnia, \nwhich stopped the war and then led to the 60,000-person implementation \nforce now there in Bosnia, with 20,000 Americans, whose presence, \nincidentally, was ratified in a bipartisan vote here in which the \nSenate majority leader, in an extraordinary act of bipartisanship, \nnonpartisanship, gave his support to that presence.\n  So I say, in conclusion, that to criticize the Clinton \nadministration, President Clinton, for their decision not to protest \nthe flow of arms to Bosnia in April 1994 is unfair and inconsistent \nwith the position that so many of us took that, in fact, the arms \nembargo should be lifted. The decision the President made was, in my \nopinion, moral. It would have been outrageously immoral to have watched \naggression and genocide continue in Bosnia and have done nothing--in \nfact, not only to have done nothing, but to have acted to stop others \nfrom doing something to help the victims of that aggression and that \ngenocide.\n  Finally, in the struggle many of us made here on a bipartisan, \nnonpartisan basis to change the course of this war, I think we had a \nsubstantial effect. It was, in my opinion, some of the finest hours of \nthis Chamber in affecting the course of foreign policy and world \nevents, stopping aggression and genocide, and preserving stability in \nEurope.\n  I hope we will not sully that extraordinary record of nonpartisanship \nwith a kind of partisanship in hindsight, which is unjustified by the \nfacts and inconsistent with the bipartisan leadership of this Chamber \non this matter.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4885-S4886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I quote from the majority leader of the U.S. \nSenate in late February of this year, when he stated, ``It is also \ntrue''--said Senator Dole--``as some have said, that our economy is the \nstrongest it has been in 30 years.''\n  The business publication, Barron's magazine, that is looked upon with \nfavor by the business community and has been for many, many years says:\n\n       In short, Clinton's economic record is remarkable. Clinton \n     rightfully boasted that our economy is the healthiest it's \n     been in 30 years.\n\n  This came, Mr. President, late in March of this year. DRI McGraw-\nHill, late March of this year:\n\n       The normal economic indicators suggest that the economy is \n     in its best shape in decades.\n\n  Mr. President, the statements that I have given here, the quote from \nthe majority leader of the U.S. Senate, from Barron's magazine, and \nfrom DRI McGraw-Hill are not publications of the Democratic National \nCommittee. We could not go further from the Democratic National \nCommittee than the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Barron's \nmagazine, and McGraw-Hill, yet each of these state that the economy is \nthe best it has been in decades.\n  I am the first to acknowledge that we can do better. But we are doing \npretty good. We are doing real well. The reason I want to talk about \nthis this morning is I understand from listening and watching very \nclosely what has transpired in this Chamber, especially on the other \nside of the aisle, that there is some tendency to talk about how bad we \nare doing.\n  The economy is on fire. The economy is doing well. These are not \nstatements. They are based upon statistics. The smallest deficit share \nof our economy since 1979. This will be the fourth year in a row where \nwe have had a declining deficit. I, Mr. President, last year with pride \ntalked about it was the third year in a row where we had a declining \ndeficit, the first time in 50 years we had 3 years in a row with a \ndeclining deficit.\n  I said then, as I say now, it should be smaller, but 3 years in a \nrow, the first time in 50 years, a declining deficit. This next year \nwill be 4 years in a row with a declining deficit; the first time since \nthe years of the Civil War that we have had 4 years in a row with a \ndeclining deficit.\n  The lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation since 1968. \nStrongest job growth. In fact, it is a stronger job growth than any \nRepublican administration since the 1920's. Nearly 8.5 million new jobs \nadded in just over 3 years. That is a faster annual rate of growth than \nfrom any Republican administration since the 1920's.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk in years gone by about the \nFederal employment being too high. President Reagan, when he was \nGovernor, used to rail about how big the Government was. Yet while he \nwas Governor of California, the government of California got bigger and \nbigger. When he got off his job of being Governor, he had a radio \nprogram, and about one out of every two programs dealt with how big the \nFederal Government was. It is interesting to note, when President \nReagan was President, the Government got bigger and bigger.\n\n  Vice President Gore, in this administration, was given the job to cut \nback the size of Government. The Government has been cut back. It is \nnot talked about. We have over 200,000 fewer Federal jobs than we had 3 \nyears ago. That is a cutback that is staggering. The smallest work \nforce since the days of President Kennedy. Highest share of jobs in the \nprivate sector again since the 1920's. And 93 percent of all new jobs \nhave been created by the private sector.\n  We have had the lowest inflation during any administration since the \ndays of Kennedy, the strongest industrial production growth in 30 \nyears. The industrial production has grown almost 4 percent annually. \nThat is faster than any administration since the days of Lyndon \nJohnson.\n  Strongest business investment growth for an administration since the \ndays of John Kennedy. Business investment has grown almost 11 percent \nannually. As I have indicated, that is a faster rate of business \ninvestment growth than any administration since John Kennedy was \nPresident.\n  Lowest mortgage rates in 30 years. Strongest stock market growth \nsince World War II. Highest home ownership in 15 years. Strongest \nconstruction growth since Truman was President. Almost 900,000 new \nconstruction jobs have been created in just over 3 years. That is the \nfastest annual rate of construction since Harry Truman was President.\n  It is no wonder that Barron's magazine says:\n\n       Clinton has rightfully boasted that our economy is the \n     healthiest it's been in 30 years.\n\n  Mr. President, we have had 10 Presidents since the Second World War. \nIf we listed the Presidents, we would find we have had five Republican \nPresidents and five Democrat Presidents. But if you looked at job \ngrowth during the years of those 10 Presidencies, you would find that \nNos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were Democrats. The bottom five were Republican \nPresidents.\n  If you want to look at that same list of Democratic Presidents, you \nwould find that they also led from 1 to 5 in economic growth. I think \nit is important that we here on the Senate floor make sure the record \nis clear and not try to frighten the American public.\n  We acknowledge that we need to do better. We acknowledge that we have \nproblems that need to be looked into. We believe that the minimum wage \nshould be raised. We believe that it is not a question of making sure \nthat teenagers that work at McDonalds get paid more, because the vast \nmajority of the people who earn minimum wage are not teenagers. Sixty \npercent of the people who earn minimum wage are women, and for 40 \npercent of those women, that is the only money they get for them and \ntheir families.\n\n  We believe one of the ways we can make the economy better is to raise \nthe minimum wage. Why? Because it will tend to force people off welfare \nand cause people not to go on welfare. We need to do better, but we are \ndoing well. The so-called misery index, the combined rate of \nunemployment and inflation, is at its lowest level since 1968. We think \nthat is good.\n  Car manufacturing. The United States is in the world lead. In 1994, \nthe United States surpassed Japan as the world leader in automobile \nproduction. The last time the United States was No. 1 was way back in \n1979. In 1995 and 1996, America has and will retain its status as the \nworld's largest producer of cars. There have been times in the history \nof our country when the business sector has done as well, but never \nhave they done any better. Economic numbers point to the business \ncommunity as being very happy with what is going on.\n  We can look at areas where not everyone can enjoy this, but a family \nthat invested money in the stock market----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator he has reached \nthe 8-minute mark.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  A family that invested money in the stock market, under the Clinton \nadministration, for example, if they invested $10,000, they would get \nalmost a 50-percent return on that money, in fact a little over 50-\npercent return.\n  Jobs have been added, as I have indicated, and the fact of the matter \nis, Mr. President, they have been good jobs, high-wage jobs. Over 60 \npercent of the jobs added have been high-wage jobs.\n  So we have work to do. We have a lot more that we can do. There are a \nlot of people not enjoying the success of the economy that is doing so \nwell. We have to try to make sure that we do a better job in allowing \npeople to succeed in this great country that we have.\n  But I want everyone within the sound of my voice to appreciate the \nfact that\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\nwe as an economy, we as a country, are doing extremely well. We have to \nfeel good. We have to have confidence in our economy, confidence in our \nGovernment. We can only do that by understanding that we need to work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to move the country along.\n\n  We can do that by, first of all, allowing up-or-down votes on the \nminimum wage, repeal of the gas tax, and if the majority leader wants \nto bring forward the TEAM Act, let us have a debate on that like we \nhave done in the Senate for over 200 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4886-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR WASTE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it has been kind of an interesting couple \nof days in the Senate, and I noticed in the newspaper this morning in \nthe headlines the word ``gridlock,'' which I am sure will please some \nin this Chamber, because yesterday they were trying to persuade the \npress to use the word ``gridlock.'' They said what is happening in the \nSenate is gridlock.\n  What happened yesterday was quite interesting. Those who suggest this \nis gridlock in the Senate came to the floor of the Senate yesterday, \noffered a piece of legislation and then, prior to any debate beginning \non that legislation, the same people who offered the legislation filed \na cloture motion to shut off debate that had not yet begun on a piece \nof legislation that had been offered only a minute before.\n  Someone who does not serve in the Senate or does not understand the \nSenate rules might scratch their head and say, ``How on Earth could \nsomeone do that with a straight face? How could someone, without \nlaughing out loud, offer a piece of legislation before debate begins, \nfile cloture to shut off debate on a piece of legislation they have \njust now filed, and then claim that the other side is guilty of causing \ngridlock?''\n  Only in the Senate can that be done without someone laughing out loud \nat how preposterous that claim is.\n  This is not gridlock. It is more like a gag rule, where you bring a \npiece of legislation to the Senate because you control the Senate floor \nand you say, ``Here's what we want to do, and, by the way, we're going \nto use parliamentary shenanigans to fill up the parliamentary tree so \nno one has an opportunity to offer any amendments of any kind, and then \nwe are going to file a motion to shut off debate before you even get a \nchance to debate.''\n\n  No, that is not gridlock, that is a gag rule. From a parliamentary \nstandpoint, it can be done. It was not done when the Democrats were in \ncontrol in the 103d Congress. We never did what is now being done on \nthe floor of the Senate: filling the legislative tree completely and \nsaying, ``By the way, you have no opportunity, those of you who feel \ndifferently, to offer amendments.''\n  But we will work through this, and we will get beyond this. I will \nsay to those who claim it is gridlock, it is clear the Senate is not \nmoving and the Senate is not acting, but at least the major part of \nthat, it seems to me, is because we have people who decide that it is \ngoing to be their agenda or no agenda, and they insist on their agenda \nwithout debate, their agenda without amendments.\n  What we have are three proposals that have been ricocheting around \nthe Chamber the last couple of days, and there is a very simple \nsolution. We have a proposal called the minimum wage. Many of us feel \nthere ought to be some kind of adjustment in the minimum wage. It has \nbeen 5 years. Those working at the bottom of the economic ladder have \nnot had a 1-penny increase in their salaries. Many of us feel there \nought to be some adjustment there.\n  The second issue is, the majority leader wants to cut or reduce the \ngas tax by 4.3 cents a gallon.\n  And the third issue is a labor issue called the TEAM Act.\n  The way to solve this, instead of linking them together in Byzantine \nor strange ways, is simply to bring all three measures to the floor one \nat a time, allow amendments to be offered and then have an up-or-down \nvote. This is not higher math; it is simple arithmetic. Bring the bills \nto the floor.\n  Our side has no interest, in my judgment, in filibustering on any of \nthose bills, at least not that I am aware of. I do not think we ought \nto filibuster any of those bills. Bring the bills to the floor, have a \ndebate, entertain amendments, have a final vote, and the winner wins. \nThat is not a very complicated approach. It is the approach that would \nsolve this problem.\n  I listened carefully yesterday to a speech on the Senate floor that \nwas essentially a campaign speech--hard, tough, direct. It was a \nPresidential campaign speech. You have a right to do that on the Senate \nfloor. I do not think it advances the interests of helping the Senate \ndo its business. I almost felt during part of that speech yesterday \nthere should be bunting put up on the walls of the Senate, perhaps some \nballoons, maybe even a band to put all this in the proper perspective.\n\n  The Senate is not going to be able to do its work if it becomes for \nthe next 6 months a political convention floor. I hope that we can talk \nthrough that in the coming days and decide the Senate is going to have \nto do its work. We have appropriations bills we have to pass. We have \nother things to do that are serious business items on the agenda of \nthis country. I do not think that we can do this if the Senate becomes \nthe floor of a political convention from now until November.\n  I want to speak just for a moment about the proposed reduction in the \ngasoline tax. Gasoline prices spiked up by 20 to 30 cents a gallon \nrecently. When gasoline prices spiked up and people would drive to the \ngas pumps to fill up their car, they were pretty angry about that, \nwondering, ``What has happened to gasoline prices?''\n  Instead of putting a hound dog on the trail of trying to figure out \nwho did what and why, what happened to gas prices, immediately we had \nsome people come to the floor of the Senate and say, ``OK, gas prices \nspiked up 20, 30 cents a gallon. Let's cut the 4.3-cent gas tax put on \nthere nearly 3 years ago.''\n  I do not understand. I guess the same people, if they had a \ntoothache, would get a haircut. I do not see the relationship. Gas \nprices are pushed up 20 to 30 cents so they are going to come and \nincrease the Federal deficit by cutting a 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  I would like to see lower gas taxes as well, but I am not going to \nincrease the Federal deficit. The Federal deficit has been cut in half \nin the last 3 years. Why? Because some of us had the courage to vote \nfor spending decreases and, yes, revenue increases to cut the deficit \nin half.\n  The central question I have is this: If you cut the gas tax, who gets \nthe money? There are a lot of pockets in America. There are small \npockets, big pockets, high pockets, and low pockets. You know who has \nthe big pockets and small pockets. The oil industry always had the big \npockets. The driver has always had the small pockets.\n  Guess what? When you take a look at what is going to happen when you \nsee\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\na gas tax reduction and have some people talk to the experts, here is \nwhat you find.\n  This is yesterday's paper: ``Experts say gas tax cut wouldn't reach \nthe pumps. Oil industry called unlikely to pass savings on to \nconsumers.''\n  Energy expert Philip Verleger says:\n\n       The Republican-sponsored solution to the current fuels \n     problem . . . is nothing more and nothing less than a \n     refiners' benefit bill. . . . It will transfer upwards of $3 \n     billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and \n     gasoline marketers.\n\n  The chairman of ARCO company says:\n\n       My concern is, quite frankly, how the public will react to \n     what the Senate does.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Some Democrats have already said `before we pass the gas \n     tax, we want to make sure we see it at the pump.'\n\n  He said:\n\n       I'll tell you, market forces are going to outstrip the 4 \n     cents a gallon. You're not going to be able to find a direct \n     relationship between moving that and 4 cents. Then prices \n     could go up, go down, could stay the same, and there you have \n     the question of how the public is going to perceive that.\n\n  The majority leader's aides in the paper today said they had:\n\n       . . . received assurances from the oil companies that the \n     full extent of any cut in the gas tax will be passed on to \n     consumers.\n       However, officials at several major oil companies said \n     yesterday that no such assurances had been or could be given.\n       ``Even asking for them represented a mistaken return to \n     direct government involvement in setting prices,'' several \n     energy experts said. . . .\n       Bruce Tackett, a spokesman for Exxon Co. USA in Houston, \n     said, ``We have not made any commitments to anyone `regarding \n     a 'future' price. Not only have we not made a commitment, we \n     can't. In a competitive market, the market will set the \n     price.''\n\n  An Amoco Corp. spokesperson said:\n\n       We've received no official request, and we haven't spoken \n     to anyone about this.\n\n  Mobil Corp. said:\n\n       Mobil doesn't believe that a reduction in the tax will \n     automatically mean a reduction in the pump price. . . In the \n     end, it will be the marketplace that sets the price at the \n     pump.\n\n  The point is this gas tax reduction sounds like an interesting thing, \nbut if you take $3 billion out of the Federal Government and increase \nthe deficit, which you will do--I think the so-called offset is a \nsham--but increase the Federal deficit, take $3 billion, put it in the \npockets of the oil industry and the drivers are still going up to the \nsame pumps paying the same price for their gas, who is better off? The \ntaxpayer? No. Is the Federal deficit better off? No, that is higher. \nThe oil industry is better off.\n\n  I guess my hope is that we will decide for a change here in the U.S. \nSenate to do the right thing. The right thing, it seems to me, is for \nus to proceed on the agenda. Yes, the majority leader and the majority \nparty have the majority, they have the right to proceed down the line \non their agenda. We are 47 Members in the minority. We are not pieces \nof furniture. We are people that have an agenda we care deeply about. \nWe also intend to exercise our right in the Senate to offer amendments \nand to try to affect the agenda of the Senate.\n  For those who say we have no right to offer amendments, that we will \nbe thwarted in any attempt at all to offer our agenda, we say it will \nbe an awfully long year because we intend to advance the issue of the \nminimum wage. The minimum wage ought to be adjusted. People at the top \nrung of the economic ladder have a 23-percent increase in the value of \ntheir salaries and their stock benefits last year; the people at the \nbottom of the economic ladder, those people out there working for \nminimum wage, have for 5 years not received a one-penny increase, and \nlost 50 cents of the value of their minimum wage. We are not asking to \nspike it way up. We are just asking for a reasonable, modest adjustment \nof the minimum wage. We ought to do that.\n  Gas tax, bring that to the debate. I do not intend to vote to reduce \nthe gas tax. I would like to. I would like to see people pay less taxes \nin a range of areas, but I do not intend to vote to increase the \nFederal deficit. I have been one, along with others, who care and \ncontinue to ratchet that Federal deficit downward. I do not intend in \nany event to transfer money from the Federal Treasury, so the deficit \nincreases, to the pockets of the oil industry, and leave drivers and \ntaxpayers stranded high and dry.\n  The TEAM Act that has been introduced in the last day or so, bring \nthat to the floor, entertain amendments, have a vote on that. That is \nthe way the Senate ought to do its business. It is probably not the \nmost politically adept way. It does not most easily advance an agenda \nof someone, but a way for the Senate to advance these issues, have a \nvote, and determine what the will of the Senate is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, there has been, as my colleague from North \nDakota has pointed out, a number of disappointments in terms of things \nthat have reached the floor, and with the overhang of Presidential \npolitics in this year. One of the most disturbing things to me is the \npower of special interests at work in this Congress and their effort to \nbring a piece of legislation to the floor, S. 1271, which we are told \nwill reach the floor sometime in the next few weeks. That is the effort \nof a powerful lobby, well financed, very effective, the nuclear power \nlobby, to bring a proposal to locate an interim storage of high-level \nnuclear waste in my State of Nevada.\n\n  One can hardly open a newspaper or one of the many Capitol Hill \nnewsletters these days without seeing one of the nuclear power \nindustry's many misleading, and in my view, intellectually dishonest \nadvertisements urging Members of this body, of this Congress, to \nsupport S. 1271, which is the latest nuclear power industry's piece of \nlegislation.\n  There are many things wrong with S. 1271, Mr. President. The obvious \nreason for my strong interest in the bill is an utter and complete \ndisregard for the rights and interests of public health and safety of \nthe men and women who I represent, my fellow Nevadans. Contrary to the \nwishes of the great majority of Nevadans--Democrats, Republicans, \nindependents, those who choose no political affiliation--the \noverwhelming majority are strongly opposed to this so-called interim \nstorage facility.\n  The problems with this legislation are more than a question of \nunfairness, which I will have occasion to speak to at some length \nduring the debate on this issue. It is much more than unfairness, \nbecause most of the mistruths that are being spread about this \nlegislation in the nuclear waste program in general affect not only my \nown State but many other States, as well.\n  First and foremost, I think it is important to emphasize that this \npiece of legislation is unnecessary. It is unnecessary. I have served \nin this body long enough to know that on many pieces of legislation, it \nis a very difficult balance. Some things that you like, some changes \nthat you do not, there are some pluses and minuses. But always there \nshould be at least some overriding necessity for that piece of \nlegislation to be acted upon. In this instance, there is absolutely no \nneed at all.\n  The scientific experts, experts independent of the nuclear power \nindustry, independent of the environmental community, independent and \nin no way connected with my fellow constituents in Nevada, have \nconcluded that there simply is no problem with leaving the high-level \nnuclear waste where it currently resides, and that is at the reactor \nsites. Most recently, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a \nFederal agency created by the Congress for the sole purpose of \nmonitoring and commenting on the high-level nuclear waste program, that \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board recently stated, ``There is no \ncompelling technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a \ncentralized storage facility for the next few years.''\n\n  Mr. President, that view has been endorsed by the Clinton \nadministration as well because they can see through the transparency of \nthe nuclear power industry's scare tactics. They have indicated that if \nthis legislation should pass this Congress it will be vetoed.\n  Let me say for those who have watched this issue over the years, \nscare tactics have become the kind of conduct that we expect from the \nindustry. More than a decade ago we were told\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nthat without some type of interim storage, then called away-from-\nreactor storage, that nuclear reactors around America would have to \nclose down. In fact, their prediction was by 1983, 13 years ago. Well, \nthe Congress wisely rejected the overture by the nuclear power industry \nmore than a decade ago, and not a single reactor has closed because of \nthe absence of storage for the spent nuclear fuel rods.\n  It is, in my judgment, a wiser policy and a more sensible policy that \nwe make a determination only after we have a judgment as to the \nlocation of a permanent repository. That is what the language currently \nsays, Mr. President, that there will be no decision to force a State or \nany jurisdiction to accept an interim storage until after the permanent \nrepository program has made its own judgment. That, Mr. President, has \nnot yet been done.\n  This sensible approach, accepted by those who have independent \njudgment and are members of the scientific community, endorsed by this \nadministration and by many others, does not satisfy the nuclear power \nindustry. They are furious that their bluff has been called, that its \nscare tactics over the years have been sufficiently transparent, that \nmost have been able to see through them, and they have been frustrated \nin their goal of establishing an interim storage facility.\n  The risk that would be created by caving in to these special interest \ndemands are substantial. In addition to creating overwhelming risk for \nthose of us in Nevada, particularly because of its geographical \nproximity to the metropolitan area of Las Vegas, which is now home to 1 \nmillion people, this legislation would result in over 16,000 shipments \nof dangerous high-level nuclear waste to 43 States.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues and staff who are \nwatching this issue and I apologize to America that we do not have the \nresources to have full-page ads in major newspapers across America and \nall of the various bulletins and pieces of literature issued covering \nand commenting on the operation of the Congress. I see the very able \nand distinguished Senator from Kansas, and I assure her I will not be \nlong in my comments. I take the occasion to make her aware, as I do the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, we are talking about 43 different \nStates that will be affected, 16,000 shipments. Much of that is located \nin the Midwest. The State of Kansas, if I might cite for my colleague's \nedification since she is on the floor, is a major transshipment \ncorridor. The red indicates highway. The blue indicates rail. We have \none, two, three, four major shipment routes to the State of Kansas, \nexposing communities--we will talk more about this when this issue \ncomes to the floor--exposing communities to a great deal of risk if \nindeed an accident happens.\n  We all hope that an accident does not happen. But most pencils in \nAmerica are still made with an eraser. Mistakes occur--human error. We \nknow that. Whether it is Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, or whatever the \nnuclear disasters have been in recent years, there are human failures, \nmistakes, neglect, all of those things, and they are not likely to \nchange as a result of anything that we have done or are likely to do on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I know that the chairman of the Energy Committee spoke yesterday at \nsome length about that. I can understand why he does not share the \nconcerns. Alaska is not a transshipment corridor, so that none of his \nconstituents would be exposed to the risk, as 43 States and some 50 \nmillion of us that live along one of these transportation routes might \nbe affected.\n  I might say--and I believe the occupant of the chair served at the \nmunicipal level of government--there is no assurance in this \nlegislation that any financial assistance is provided to communities \nwho are placed at risk. None. No assurance whatsoever. So these \ncommunities exposed to this risk will have to bear that responsibility \non their own.\n  Let me just say that for some of us--and the occupant of the chair \nand I are from two States that have no nuclear reactors at all; yet, we \nwill bear the burden of those transshipments--all unnecessary, all \nunnecessary because our States will be affected. In the great State of \nOklahoma, there are at least three rail shipment routes that will pass \nthrough that great State. I can cite State after State, and I will have \noccasion to do so later.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee, in addressing this yesterday, \ntended to dismiss any concerns about safety. ``Nothing to worry about. \nThis is all under control.'' Mr. President, I have said many times on \nthe floor that I was in the eighth grade in early 1951 when the first \nnuclear atmospheric test was conducted at Frenchman Flats in Nevada, \nabout 60 to 70 miles from my hometown of Las Vegas. We were assured at \nthe time, ``There are no risks. There is nothing to worry about. The \nscientific community has this under control.'' Indeed, people were \ninvited to go up to observe this great scientific phenomenon. Benches \nwere established so you could go up, if you were part of the press \ncorps. Those of us who were in school, as part of science programs, \nwere invited to rise early in the morning and see the great flash from \nthe nuclear detonation, see the cloud, and wait for the seismic shock \nto hit us, and calculate with some precision how far from ground zero \nwe were from the place where the shot took place. Community \nreaction was overwhelming. Stores, retail establishments, all embraced \nthis new nuclear phenomenon.\n\n  Well, it is now 45 years later. Nobody buys that argument anymore. No \nscientist worthy of his or her degree would ever suggest with absolute \ncertainty that we can detonate a nuclear blast in a 70-mile range of a \nmajor community. Nobody will assert that.\n  Do you know what the consequences of that trust us is? Today, every \nMember of this Congress, every taxpayer in America is paying for those \npoor, innocent victims downwind of where those atmospheric shots \noccurred, who suffer from cancer and other genetic effects as a result \nof those experiments. Trust us, you need not worry. We are talking \nabout something that is lethal. And those of us who would bear the \nburden of this do not have the same sense of safety and assurance that \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee has.\n  Mr. President, I know that this debate has been framed largely as a \nresult of the special interests of the nuclear power lobby. Many of my \ncolleagues, I am sure, have not heard from their constituents. Today, I \ntake the opportunity to acquaint Americans and my colleagues and staff, \nwho are watching our discussion, that this is not just a Nevada issue. \nObviously, we feel powerfully aggrieved at this outrageous conduct that \nsuggests that not only are we to be studied for a permanent repository, \nbut an interim facility will be placed there as well.\n  My point is that ours is a lonely voice, a small State of 1.6 million \npeople and 4 Members of Congress.

The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3960\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss, again, legislation \nthat has been before us, which is support for the Teamwork for \nEmployees and Management Act, the TEAM Act.\n  During the past couple of days, we have had some lengthy debate on \nthis legislation, as well as, of course, repeal of the 4.3-cent gas \ntax, and raising the minimum wage. I thought it might be useful at this \npoint to review some of the debate back and forth on the TEAM Act, what \nit does and does not do, and dispel some of the myths that have \nsurfaced over the course of the debate.\n  The TEAM Act responds to a series of decisions by the National Labor \nRelations Board that invalidated numerous employee involvement \nprograms. The NLRB decisions that have been made regarding employee-\nemployer relationships have been very broad. They found that the \nNational Labor Relations Act of 1935 prohibited supervisors from \nmeeting with workers in committees to discuss workplace issues like \nhealth and safety, working conditions, family leave, and other \nimportant areas of mutual concern.\n\n  The TEAM Act simply establishes a safe harbor in Federal labor law to \npermit these types of employee involvement programs, where workers meet \nwith supervisors to discuss issues of mutual concern, to continue to \nexist without running afoul of Federal labor law. Under the TEAM Act, \nworkers may discuss quality, productivity, efficiency, health and \nsafety, or any other issues that are important to them.\n  It seems to make so much sense, Mr. President, and it is very hard \nfor me to understand why this is being so vigorously challenged and \nfought by the unions in this country, particularly the chairman of the \nNLRB, William Gould, who does not support the TEAM Act, but does say \nthat we need a clarification of the law so that there can be the \nability of employers and employees to come together with a clearer \nunderstanding of what is within the parameters of the law.\n  I believe that workers have important contributions to make to \nimprove the quality of their work life and the quality of the product \nor service their company delivers. America needs to harness workers' \nideas and put them to good use. They are the ones who are there making \nthe day-to-day effort, who best know the whole condition of workplace \nhealth and the safety of the atmosphere--on the line, perhaps, in a \nfactory--and can come up with innovative suggestions.\n  The legislation also has important worker protections. For instance, \nteams may not have, claim, or seek authority to negotiate collective-\nbargaining agreements, or amend existing collective-bargaining \nagreements, and the TEAM Act also clearly prohibits employers from \nbypassing an existing union if the workers have chosen to be \nrepresented by a union.\n\n  I do not fault the NLRB for the breadth of their decisions \ninvalidating employee involvement. I think they did the best job they \ncould under the circumstances. Our Federal labor laws were written in \nthe 1930's at a time when employers had used company unions to avoid \nrecognizing and bargaining with unions after workers had selected union \nrepresentation. So the Congress wrote our Federal labor laws very \nbroadly to prohibit that type of activity.\n  In fact, the law was written so broadly that it invalidated the \nlegitimate employee-involvement programs that we see today. So the TEAM \nAct permits these legitimate employee-involvement programs to move \nforward, while requiring firms to recognize and negotiate with \nindependent unions if that is what the workers want.\n  Why do we need the TEAM Act? This has been mentioned many times. \nBecause it has worked very successfully in the union businesses where \nthe union shops exist. There have been many times effective employee-\nmanagement teamwork. But we have, I think, also heard compelling cases \nof why there is great uncertainty.\n  During the debate over the last 2 days, some of my colleagues have \nasked, if there are so many employee-involvement programs going on \nright now, why then is it necessary and why do we need the TEAM Act? I \nwill respond to my colleagues that the NLRB interpreted the law so \nbroadly that it has cast great uncertainty on the legality of all \nemployee-involvement programs. Some companies have disbanded their \nteams, either by order of the NLRB or because they are concerned with \nwhether they are legal and fearing they might not feel it is worth the \neffort to even try, and other companies are not expanding their \nexisting teams.\n  For example, during our committee hearings on the TEAM Act, we heard \nfrom David Wellins, a senior vice president of a human resource \nconsulting firm in Pittsburgh, PA. Mr. Wellins' firm assists clients, \nfrom Fortune 500 companies to small nonprofits, to establish high-\nperformance work organizations.\n  Mr. Wellins testified:\n\n       On manufacturing plant floors and in corporate offices \n     across this country, work teams are making employees and \n     their companies more productive than at any other time in the \n     history of this country. . . The second point I want to make \n     [is that the NLRB decisions] have dramatically dampened the \n     enthusiasm for teams. Many of the Nation's leading companies, \n     both union and nonunion, are confused about which aspects \n     of teams are allowable and correspondingly reluctant to \n     proceed with team initiatives.\n\n  Mr. Wellins then cited several examples, including a large Midwest \nbank, a major beverage manufacturer, and a consumer product packaging \nplant that eliminated their employer involvement program due to the \nuncertainty which has been caused by the NLRB's interpretation of \nFederal labor law. It is clear from Mr. Wellins' testimony that we need \na legislative solution to this problem.\n  Some of my colleagues have also asked whether the TEAM Act permits \nemployers to establish company or sham unions. The answer is absolutely \nnot. This is very clear, and has been very misleading in the debate so \nfar that has gone back and forth for a couple of days.\n  The TEAM Act permits workers to choose independent union \nrepresentation at any time. The TEAM Act does not replace traditional \nunions, and once workers select union representation, the employer must \nrecognize and then negotiate with the union.\n  Moreover, the Team Act specifically states that employee teams may \nnot ``have, claim, or seek authority to negotiate or enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with the employer or to amend existing \ncollective bargaining agreements.'' It does not in any way interfere \nwith the collective bargaining agreements that are in place and working \nand clearly understood. So the TEAM Act does not permit employers to \ncreate company or sham unions.\n  Mr. President, one of the other issues that has come forth also \nduring the debate is who selects team members?\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\n This has been debated in our committee hearings as well. Some of the \ncolleagues have asked whether the TEAM Act promotes true employee \ninvolvement because the legislation does not mandate that workers \nselect all team members. I respond to my colleagues who have questioned \nthis that the TEAM Act avoids mandating a one-size-fits-all for the \nemployee-involvement program. Instead, it recognizes that there are a \nvariety of worker teams that exist and would encourage workers and \nmanagers to develop flexible teams that best suit their needs.\n  Sometimes workers select team members, sometimes the team members \nvolunteer, and sometimes the whole company is run on the team concept. \nSo the question of team member selection is moot. At other times, \nparticularly if a worker has a necessary job skill required by the \nteam, such as appointing an EMT to a safety team, the employer may \nchoose team members.\n\n  Focusing on team member selection really misses the point because the \nreal issue is management commitment to employee involvement. Workers \nare not stupid. They know when management values employee involvement, \nand workers quickly tire of making suggestions if management will not \nfollow through on them; therefore, it is not going to succeed. It \nreally has to be a management commitment even more than a worker \ncommitment. So it would be useless for managers to limit teams to their \nfavorite workers, because the value of those employee ideas would be \nlimited. It really has to be a commitment that is on both sides, \nrecognizing the changes that are taking place in our work force today, \nnot in an attempt to undermine the unions but in an attempt to \nstrengthen the initiative, the productivity, and the constructive \nenvironment instead of a suspicious, adversarial environment that can \noccur in the workplace. I think it has a very positive benefit.\n  Ironically, the whole idea of team member selection reveals how \nnarrowly critics are viewing employee involvement. They are assuming \nthat there should be only one type of program, where the employees \nselect their team representative. But many times, team members do not \nrepresent their coworkers on teams. Many times, the whole plant is run \nby self-directed work teams. So there are no employee representatives \nsince everyone serves on a team.\n  We cannot categorize every type of team in America, and we should not \ntry. Instead, we should give workers and supervisors the flexibility to \ncraft their workplace needs and craft how they can best be met.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. I think, \nMr. President, it offers us an opportunity, that we have not had \nbefore, to clarify a situation that will allow us to move forward to \nmeet the needs of a workplace, that will allow us to be ever more \ncompetitive, ever more imaginative, ever more inventive, and create an \nemployee involvement that I think will add a lot of vitality in our \nworkplace today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Kassebaum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as I was sitting in the chair presiding \nand I was listening to several people try to justify an argument \nagainst repealing the tax increase, a tax increase that was sold to the \nAmerican people that it only affected the fat cats in this country, we \nare talking about the gasoline tax at 4.3 cents as if 4.3 cents is not \na significant amount.\n  I remind these people that this was part of a package in 1993, when \nBill Clinton had control of both Houses of Congress, and they passed \nwhat was characterized by then the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, as ``the largest single tax \nincrease in the history of public finance, in America or any nation in \nthe world.''\n  I think it needs to be in the Record after these statements \njustifying continuing these taxes that if anyone was opposed to ``the \nlargest single tax increase in the history of public finance, in \nAmerica or any place in the world'' back in 1993, they would be \nsupportive of repealing any portion of that tax increase today. It was \nnot just a gasoline tax. It was many other taxes which included a 50 \npercent tax on Social Security for thousands and thousands of senior \ncitizens in America.\n  So I think that those individuals who believe as the chief financial \nadviser to the President believes, that there is no relationship \nbetween the level of taxation in a country and its economic production, \nhave lost the argument because truly that is not the case.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have before the Senate a proposal to \nrepeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon Federal excise tax on gasoline enacted \nin 1993 as part of a comprehensive deficit-reduction package. That \nlegislation--the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 [OBRA]--\nhas been largely responsible for cutting the Federal deficit nearly in \nhalf since its enactment. The 4.3-cent tax on gasoline that was \nincluded in that legislation has contributed more than $10 billion to \nthis deficit reduction. Though we have not yet completed the difficult \ntask of balancing the Federal budget, in the middle of a Presidential \nelection year we are suddenly being lured by a politically inspired \nproposal to repeal that very same 4.3-cent tax for the remainder of \n1996 to combat a recent increase in gasoline prices across the country. \nOur colleagues in the majority would have us believe that the 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax is the primary culprit for the current high level of gas \nprices. The American people are being asked to believe that a simple \nrepeal of the 1993 tax for the balance of one year will cure the pain \nat the pump. And this is utter folly. It is not true.\n  Mr. President, the current Federal excise tax on gasoline stands at \n18.3 cents per gallon--approximately 14 percent of the current average \nprice of a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline. The 4.3-cent tax that \nthis proposal would repeal represents less than 3.5 percent of the \ncurrent cost of a gallon of gasoline. Are we to believe that 4.3 cents \nof this tax enacted in 1993 has had any really significant effect on \nthe price of gasoline? Or, conversely, are we to believe that a repeal \nof this tax will substantially reduce the price of a gallon of gas?\n  Simply put, gas prices have risen because of forces unrelated to the \nFederal excise tax on gasoline. They have risen because of factors \nassociated with the basic economic principles of supply and demand. The \nreduced supply of world crude oil and the higher gasoline consumption \nin the United States and Europe as a result of a lengthy, cold winter \nhave undoubtedly played a much larger role in the higher price of \ngasoline than has the much-demonized 4.3-cent gas tax approved in 1993. \nIn fact, Mr. President, the repeal of the national speed limit by this \nCongress has probably contributed more to the price of gasoline than \nthe 1993 tax.\n  Is it not somewhat contradictory to first give drivers a green light \nto drive faster and then blame the recent surge in the cost of gas on a \ntax enacted 3 years ago. After all, it is no secret that cars use more \ngas when they are traveling at higher speeds. More gas means higher \ndemand. Higher demand means higher prices. While rising gas prices do \ninflict financial burdens on some segments of the society, let us \nremember also that the current increases in gas prices has come after a \nprolonged period of low prices at the pump. According to the American \nPetroleum Institute, gasoline prices last year, adjusted for inflation \nand including Federal and State taxes, were at their lowest level since \ndata were first collected in 1918. Thus, Mr. President, we may view the \nrecent escalation in the price of gasoline not as a dramatic increase \nabove its historical cost, but as an upward adjustment from unusually \nlow\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\nprices. It certainly stretches the imagination, however, to place the \nblame for the recent gas price increase solely on the shoulders of the \n4.3-cent tax enacted to reduce the Federal deficit.\n\n  Contrary to what one might think in listening to the rhetoric \nsurrounding this so-called Clinton gas tax increase, the 1993 deficit \nreduction package was not the first time that gasoline taxes have been \nincreased for the purpose of deficit reduction. The fact is that the \n1990 Summit Agreement, which was negotiated by Congress and the Bush \nadministration, contained a gasoline tax increase of 5 cents per gallon \nwhich went into effect on December 1, 1990. Of that amount, two-and-\none-half cents per gallon of that gasoline tax increase went to deficit \nreduction. This fact is set forth in a report of the Congressional \nBudget Office to the Congress dated January 1991, in the following \nstatement relating to the 1990 Summit Agreement:\n\n       For the first time since the Highway Trust Fund was \n     established in 1956, not all highway tax receipts will be \n     deposited in the trust fund. Revenue from 2.5 cents of the 5-\n     cents-per-gallon increase in the motor fuel taxes will remain \n     in the general fund. The baseline assumes that this portion \n     of the tax expires on schedule at the end of fiscal year \n     1995.\n\n  Ultimately, as Senators are aware, the 1990 Summit Agreement as \nnegotiated with President Bush and which contained the gasoline tax I \nhave just described, passed the Senate by a vote of 54-45. And, of the \n54 yea votes, 19 were Republican Senators--19.\n  Mr. President, this being a Presidential election year, it is clear \nthat this proposal before the Senate is being presented to the Congress \nfor reasons beyond the question of whether or not a repeal of the 4.3-\ncent gas tax represents sound fiscal policy. It is true that rising \ngasoline prices have permeated the country, particularly California, a \nState with a plethora of electoral votes. It is also true that \nrepealing any tax, particularly a tax on gasoline, is politically \npopular. In addition, it is tempting to remind the electorate of a tax \nincrease approved in the past by a political opponent, even if that tax \nincrease was included in a responsible deficit reduction package. So, \nwhen we consider these factors, we may understand, without any unusual \nclairvoyance, why we are now considering a proposal to temporarily \nrepeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax until January 1, 1997. While this may \nbe labeled a temporary repeal, I must question the likelihood of the \ngas tax being reinstated after its repeal. As soon as this tax is \nrepealed, we will hear from countless interests claiming that the 4.3-\ncent repeal needs to be permanent. Do we expect Members of Congress to \nignore those inevitable pleas? The fact is, Mr. President, that if we \nrepeal this gas tax now temporarily, we will have taken a giant step \nthrough the one-way door of permanent repeal, and I doubt that we will \nfind the courage to break that door down. And why are we considering \nentering this dangerous aperture? Is it anything more than politics? \nMr. President, the 4.3-cent gas tax was enacted in 1993 as part of the \nsuccessful deficit reduction package crafted by President Clinton and \nenacted by the 103d Congress without one single vote by a Republican \nMember of Congress. But it was the right thing to do. It took courage \nfor the President and the Congress to enact that bill. Tax increases \nare not known for their popularity. In fact, some Members of Congress \nmay not be here today because of their vote in 1993. But the fact \nremains that the 1993 bill nearly halved the Federal budget deficit, \nand the 4.3-cent tax on gasoline contributed to that effort. And, Mr. \nPresident, I voted for it, and I do not regret it.\n  Mr. President, the politics of this proposal notwithstanding, it is \nmore important to focus on the economics of this proposal. Economics \nis, after all, often cited by advocates of tax cuts on the grounds that \nthey spur economic growth. The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper \nfrequently cited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, ran \nan interesting story on May 7 about the proposed gas tax repeal. Let me \nread the title: ``Economists Say Gasoline Tax Is Too Low.'' The title \ndoes not read ``too high,'' as some in this body would have us believe. \nIt reads ``too low.'' Economics, Mr. President, is a field where the \nexperts rarely reach agreement on any issue. Yet, the Wall Street \nJournal reports that ``there is widespread agreement in the field [of \neconomics] that the Federal gasoline tax of 18.3 cents a gallon is too \nlow.'' In fact, according to the article, more than half of the \neconomists surveyed at a recent conference favor a gasoline tax of $1 a \ngallon or higher. Further, the article states that ``Economists cite \nvarious factors to justify a gasoline tax. Chief among them are the \nenvironmental and health costs of air pollution, along with the costs \nof traffic congestion, and road construction and repair.'' Finally, Mr. \nPresident, the Journal article states that the ``proponents of an \nincrease [in the gasoline tax] point to foreign producers' control over \noil supply, and favor a gasoline tax that is high enough to stem U.S. \ndemand.'' On the other hand, cutting the gas tax would do just the \nopposite: It would increase demand for gasoline and drive up the price, \nthus making the United States more dependent on foreign oil. So, Mr. \nPresident, it appears from these statements that, if this gas tax \nrepeal is being proposed on the grounds of economics, it is being \nproposed on very shaky grounds indeed.\n  As I have already mentioned, the gas tax stands today at 18.3 cents \nper gallon, and many would have us believe that this amount is an \nanomaly in a world where other countries either do not have a gasoline \nexcise tax or have substantially lower gas taxes. But, this is not the \ncase. In fact, if you lived in Germany, France, the Netherlands, or \nItaly, you could not purchase a gallon of gasoline for less than $4. \nGas excise taxes per gallon in those nations stood on March 1, 1996, at \n$2.92, $3.05, $3.09, and $2.91 respectively. Of course, lower taxes on \ngasoline could be found in the United Kingdom and Japan, where the tax \nper gallon stood at $2.37 and $1.99 respectively. Even if we combine \nthe Federal excise tax on gas in the United States with a weighted \naverage of the various State taxes, the typical American consumer pays \nonly 37 cents tax per gallon on gasoline. That is quite a disparity, \nMr. President. And what is the logical effect of this disparity? \nAmericans drive more and consume more gas than their foreign \ncounterparts. We rely less on public transportation and fuel-efficient \nautomobiles than do citizens of many other industrialized nations. And, \nMr. President, we have become very dependent on gasoline--a resource \nthat is nonrenewable. In other words, if we continue to depend on free-\nflowing fuel from abroad, and do not develop alternative methods of \nmore efficient transportation, we are not placing ourselves in a \nposition to remain competitive throughout the world in the 21st \ncentury, and we are endangering our economic independence and our \nchildren's future as well.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as we are met with this proposal to reduce the \nexcise tax on gasoline, we must not allow ourselves to be swayed by the \nwinds of the political moment. We all know that tax cuts are popular. \nThere are few easier votes that a Member of Congress can make. But, is \nthat why we are sent here? The American public is tired of this endless \npolitical pandering--that is what it is--and the people are not fools. \nThey will see this debate for what it is--a fiscally irresponsible, \nextremely political initiative brought before the Congress in the \nmiddle of an election year. And we talk about a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget; a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget on the one hand and repeal the gas tax on the other. So we \nare going in two opposite directions at once. Of course, the gas tax \nproponents have claimed to offset the lost $4.8 billion in revenues \nthat will result from this proposal. They intend to pay for this \nproposal by auctioning the spectrum to the private sector. Why not \napply that against the deficit? Why not apply that savings against the \ndeficit? However, it is my understanding, Mr. President, that the \nactual sale of the spectrum will not occur until 1998, and the \nreductions for the Department of Energy will occur over the next 6 \nyears, while the loss in revenues from the gas tax will occur right now \nin fiscal year 1996. Thus, this legislation is subject to a 60-vote \npoint of order--and I hope we will keep that in mind and not waive \npoints of order if unanimous-consent agreements are entered into--under \nboth section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and the \ncongressionally mandated pay-as-you-go, PAYGO,\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nrequirement. Furthermore, Mr. President, using the spectrum sale now \nwill remove another building block on which to construct a responsible \nbalanced budget. The spectrum auction was, after all, included in last \nyear's budget reconciliation measure. Is not a balanced budget a more \nlofty goal than a short-term, nonsolution to the recent elevation in \nthe price of gasoline? Well, Mr. President, what I hear from my \nconstituents is a real concern about the deficit and about the economic \nfuture of our country. I see a desire among the people to balance the \nbudget in a way that does not undermine our Nation's ability to \nreinvest in itself or make us more dependent on foreign oil. Mr. \nPresident, reducing the gas tax now will make it harder to formulate \nany responsible plan to balance the budget in the future, and I will \nnot support that effort.\n\n  I wish the President would veto the bill instead of saying he will \nsign it. I wish the President would veto the bill repealing the gas \ntax, if it is passed by Congress. This is pure political pandering, and \nboth sides are engaging in it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the legislation now \nbefore this body that is called the TEAM Act, which is an amendment to \nthe Minimum Wage Act, which, in turn, is tied to the legislation to \ndecrease the gas tax. I speak in favor of the TEAM Act. It is a very \ngood piece of legislation.\n  That position puts me opposite a union that I used to belong to. The \nunion was the International Association of Machinists. I was a member \nof that union from February 1962 to March 1971, when the factory I \nworked for closed down and shut its doors. I was an assembly line \nworker making furnace registers. We were a sheet metal operation.\n  The International Association of Machinists, along with most other \nunions, are against passage of the TEAM Act. I am a Republican and I am \nproud to be a Republican. When I was a union member, I was proud to be \na union member, and if I were still working there today I would be \nproud to be a union member as well.\n  But unions do not always speak for all workers, and this is an \nexample, where the labor union leaders in Washington, DC, supposedly \nrepresenting their members back at the grassroots, are not speaking for \nthe rank-and-file members. I remember, even 30 years ago, rank-and-file \nmembers wanted to have something to say about the operation of the \nplant. They did not want it all to be confrontational. They wanted us \nto have a cooperative working effort, because with a cooperative \nworking effort, we have more productivity, and the more productivity \nyou have, the greater the chances are of preserving jobs and of having \nbetter wages, working conditions, and fringe benefits for the \nemployees.\n  This is even more important today, because we are competing \ninternationally and must focus on productivity in the labor force. \nHaving friendly relationships between labor and management means more \nproductivity. And we have to be more productive if we are to compete in \nthis global-interdependent market.\n  So I support the TEAM Act because it would allow employees the \nprivilege to participate in workplace decisions, giving them a greater \nvoice in mutual interests such as quality, productivity, and safety. \nCurrent law prohibits this type of participation. This act would, among \nother things, encourage worker-management cooperation, preserve the \nbalance between labor and management while allowing cooperative efforts \nby employers and employees, and permit voluntary cooperation between \nworkers and employees to continue.\n  I also support it because, without this legislation, 85 percent of \nworking folks are not allowed to talk with their employers in employee \ninvolvement committees about such things as extension of employees' \nlunch breaks by 15 minutes; sick leave; flexible work schedules; free \ncoffee; purchase of a table, soda machine, microwave, or a clock for \nthe smoking lounge; tornado warning procedures; safety goggles for \nfryer and bailer operators; ban on radios and other sound equipment; \ndress codes; day care services; and nonsmoking policies.\n  The President indicated he was for this type of legislation in his \nState of the Union Message this year. At least to me it seemed an \nindication. He said: ``When companies and workers work as a team they \ndo better, and so does America.''\n  I happen to agree with the President. Secretary Reich, in a July 1993 \nfeature article in the Washington Post, said:\n\n  High-performance workplaces are gradually replacing the factories and \noffices where Americans used to work, where decisions were made at the \ntop and most employees merely followed instructions. The old top-down \nworkplace doesn't work anymore.\n\n  Again, I wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary of Labor. But just a \nfew months ago, at a national union rally in Washington, DC, following \na $35 million campaign pledge made to the Democratic Party and a grand \nendorsement by the AFL-CIO, Vice President Al Gore promised President \nClinton's veto of this TEAM Act that is now before the Senate. This is \nan act that would legalize workplace cooperation between nonunion \nemployees and management.\n  Union representatives tell me they fear the TEAM Act would prevent \nthem from organizing union shops. Let me emphasize, this act does not \napply to union settings, and would not undermine existing collective-\nbargaining agreements. Under the TEAM Act, workers retain the right, as \nthey should, to choose an independent union to engage in collective \nbargaining. Mr. President, I plan to continue my remarks this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak about a matter that \naffects my State of South Dakota, but also several States, including \nCalifornia. We are part of a compact under the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Policy Act. Governor Wilson of California, and Governor Janklow \nof my State, have had a very difficult time with the Secretary of the \nInterior on this matter.\n  The original Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act gave the States \nthe responsibility of developing permanent repositories for this \nNation's low-level nuclear waste. Now the Clinton administration wants \nto take away that authority.\n  For 8 years, South Dakota, as a member of the Southwestern Compact, \nalong with North Dakota, Arizona, and California, has worked to fulfill \nits duties to license a storage site. It did the job.\n\n  Ward Valley, CA, is the first low-level waste site to be licensed in \nthe Nation. After countless scientific and environmental studies and \ntests, the State of California and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \napproved Ward Valley as a safe and effective place to store the \nSouthwestern Compact's low-level radioactive waste.\n  However, there is one problem. Ward Valley is Federal land. It is \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management. The Southwestern Compact has \nrequested that Ward Valley be transferred to the State of California. \nThe Clinton administration refuses to take action. Instead, it has \nstalled again and again and again.\n  I spoke with the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski, \nabout this matter. He has introduced legislation to resolve the matter. \nBut this is a tragic example of where the Secretary of the Interior for \nsome reason is thwarting the intent of Congress and the intent of \nGovernors of the States in the Southwestern Compact.\n  Mr. President, the reason behind all this is that the extreme \nenvironmentalists do not want to store radioactive waste anywhere \nbecause of their antinuclear agenda. But strangely enough, this type of \nlow-level radioactive waste has been used in medical treatments and \nother areas to benefit humanity. I find this a very tragic situation. \nThe Secretary of the Interior is cooperating with the extreme \nenvironmentalists against the public interest.\n  Nobody seems to know what is going on. What has the Secretary of the \nInterior done? He has stalled. First, he has\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\nordered a supplemental environmental impact statement. Then he ordered \nthe National Academy of Sciences to perform a special report on the \nsuitability of Ward Valley for waste storage. Each study presented the \nSouthwestern Compact with a clean bill of health for Ward Valley, yet \nthe administration still delays.\n  Now the administration has ordered additional studies on the effects \nof tritium, studies the State of California already intended to \nperform, but not until a land transfer was complete. Also, I should \nnote the National Academy of Sciences made no mention that such a study \nshould be a prerequisite to this land transfer.\n  Instead, the Academy believes this type of study should be ongoing, \nconducted in conjunction with the operation of the waste storage \nfacility. Unfortunately, I suspect that even if California gives in to \ndemands and performs these tests, the administration will think of new \ndemands--anything to keep the Ward Valley waste site from becoming a \nreality.\n  Who really benefits from these delays? No one. This is yet one more \nexample of the Clinton administration's pandering to the environmental \nextremists, extremists intent on waging a war on the West and on the \nAmerican people.\n  Scientific evidence shows that Ward Valley is a safe location for \nlow-level radioactive waste storage. Neither public health nor the \nenvironment will be at risk. In fact, most of the waste to be stored at \nWard Valley is nothing more than hospital gloves and other supplies \nwhich may have come into contact with radioactive elements used by \nhealth care providers.\n  By contrast, continued delays create risks both to public health and \nthe environment. Currently, low-level waste is simply stored on site at \nhospitals, industries, or research institutions. In the four States of \nthe Southwestern Compact, there are over 800 low-level radioactive \nwaste sites. These sites were not meant to be permanent facilities. \nThus, there have been no environmental studies, no long-term monitoring \nsystems, nothing to guarantee safe storage of the waste.\n  With no regional low-level radioactive waste sites available, South \nDakota would be forced to transport its low-level radioactive waste \nacross the country to a disposal facility in Barnwell, SC. Clearly, the \ncosts of transporting this waste across the country would be great, \nfrom the monetary cost to the waste generators, to the legal \nramifications, to transporting hazardous waste, to the potential \nSuperfund liability incurred by the State and the generators.\n  This is far too costly a price, one my State cannot continue to bear. \nThat is why, Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of legislation pending in \nthe Senate to convey Ward Valley to the State of California and to \nallow the construction of the Ward Valley low-level radioactive waste \nsite to continue unimpeded. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee voted in favor of this bill.\n  This legislation is ready for Senate action. This legislation is \nnecessary only because politics got in the way of good science. \nTransferring lands such as Ward Valley is a common procedure for the \nadministration. However, because of a political fight waged by \nenvironmental extremists, this conveyance has been held up for more \nthan 2 years. This fight, this continued delay, will continue unless \nCongress acts.\n  We have the opportunity to institute a rational approach to this \nprocess. By approving this legislation, we can allow the Southwestern \nCompact and the rest of the States to comply with the law we created. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation and to allow good \nscience to prevail rather than politics.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that correspondence between \nGov. Pete Wilson of California and South Dakota Governor Janklow \nregarding the Ward Valley low-level radioactive waste storage site be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        State of South Dakota,\n\n                                        Pierre, SD, April 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete Wilson,\n     Governor, State of California, State Capitol, Sacramento, CA.\n       Dear Governor Wilson: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact \n     and the site of the facility in Ward Valley. While the site \n     in Ward Valley is currently owned by the federal Bureau of \n     Land Management, the bureau has for about 10 years declared \n     its intent to sell to California.\n       I, too, am concerned and upset with the continuing needless \n     delays imposed by the U.S. Department of Interior on the Ward \n     Valley land transfer. California has made tremendous efforts \n     attempting to comply with the federal Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Disposal Act and its Amendments. While these efforts \n     have resulted in the issuance of the first license to \n     construct a new low-level disposal site in this nation's \n     recent history, implementation of this license has been set \n     back again and again by the federal government. If these \n     delays cause our generators within the Southwestern Compact \n     to ship wastes across the United States to Barnwell, South \n     Carolina for disposal, I fully agree that the federal \n     government must comply with those stipulations you set forth \n     in your letter.\n       Study after study has shown the proposed facility in Ward \n     Valley to be protective of human health and environmentally \n     safe. The US Congress had it right the first time; the \n     Southwestern Compact can solve the problem of disposal of the \n     low-level radioactive wastes generated within its states. \n     But, we can do it only if the federal government will \n     transfer the site and let us get on with it.\n       While I agree that the latest actions of the US Department \n     of the Interior appear to confirm the notion that the Clinton \n     Administration is trying to usurp the states' duly delegated \n     power to regulate low-level waste disposal, I am still hoping \n     the transfer can occur soon. If the delays by the Department \n     of the Interior were to result in repeal of the Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Disposal Act and place the responsibility \n     for trying to manage this problem on the federal government, \n     that would be a huge step backwards.\n       Thank you again for your letter and for your efforts on \n     behalf of the entire state of California and the other states \n     in the Southwestern Compact to develop a responsible and safe \n     disposal site for low-level waste.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Janklow,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                         Governor Pete Wilson,\n\n                                Sacramento, CA, February 16, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Janklow,\n     Governor, State of South Dakota, 500 East Capitol Avenue, \n         Pierre, SD 85007\n       Dear Bill: As the host state for the Southwestern Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact, California has labored \n     diligently for ten years to establish a regional disposal \n     facility in accordance with the federal Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste (LLRW) Policy Act. This facility would serve generators \n     of LLRW in your state and the other compact states. In the \n     absence of this facility, these generators have no assured \n     place to dispose of their LLRW.\n       To fulfill its obligations, California carefully screened \n     the entire state for potential sites, evaluated candidate \n     sites and selected Ward Valley from those candidates as the \n     best site in California for the regional disposal facility. \n     Although the site is on federal land, the Bureau of Land \n     Management has for about ten years now declared its intent to \n     sell it to California. We identified a qualified commercial \n     operator to apply for a license to construct and operate a \n     facility at that site, and took steps to acquire this land \n     from the federal government. We subjected the application for \n     the license to a scrupulous review to ensure that the \n     facility would satisfy in every respect the health and safety \n     requirements established by the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission.\n       A comprehensive Environmental Impact Report was prepared \n     for the project, and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \n     and Supplemental EIS were prepared for the land transfer. We \n     subsequently became the first state to license a regional \n     disposal facility under the LLRW Policy Act, and have \n     successfully concluded our defense of the license and related \n     environmental documents in the state courts. In short, \n     California has in good faith done all it can to fulfill its \n     obligations to your state under the Compact and federal law.\n       The sole obstacle to the completion of this project is the \n     failure of the U.S. Department of the Interior to transfer \n     the Ward Valley site to California. After abruptly cancelling \n     the agreed-to transfer almost completed by former Secretary \n     Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary Babbitt has created a series \n     of procedural delays ostensibly based upon this own health \n     and safety concerns. He demanded a public hearing, then \n     abruptly cancelled it. He asked the National Academy of \n     Sciences (NAS) to review site opponents' claims, then ignored \n     NAS conclusions that these claims are unfounded and that the \n     site is safe. He has unreasonably and unlawfully demanded \n     that California agree to continued Department of the Interior \n     oversight of the project after the transfer. Now, according \n     to the attached press release, he intends to have the \n     Department of Energy conduct independent testing at Ward \n     Valley, and then will require another Supplemental EIS before \n     deciding upon the conditions for transfer.\n       Every person and organization which has anxiously followed \n     California's decade-long effort has concluded from this \n     latest set of demands that the Clinton Administration\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n     has no intention of transferring land to California for our \n     regional disposal facility. I cannot help but agree. There is \n     no scientific basis for further testing prior to construction \n     or legal requirement for a Supplemental EIS. These demands \n     are purely political, and made for the sole purpose of \n     delaying, if not terminating, the Ward Valley project. It is \n     clear that, once these demands are met, more demands will be \n     made. In short, because President Clinton doesn't trust the \n     states to assume the obligations which Governor Clinton asked \n     Congress to give the states, he has proven that the LLRW \n     Policy Act does not work. Faced with this lack of political \n     will to implement the policy he himself once supported, many \n     now question the wisdom of expending further resources in a \n     futile effort to further that policy.\n       The intransigence of the Clinton Administration in \n     connection with the Ward Valley land transfer leaves me few \n     options as Governor of California. The Ward Valley site is \n     clearly the best site in California for LLRW disposal, a fact \n     upon which my predecessor Governor Deukmejian and former \n     President Bush agreed. All other sites, including the \n     alternative site in the Silurian Valley, present potential \n     threats to public safety not found at the Ward Valley site. \n     The Silurian Valley site is also located on federal land, and \n     there is no reason to believe that the Clinton Administration \n     has any greater motivation to transfer that site.\n       Consequently, to continue the effort to establish a \n     regional disposal facility, California would need to identify \n     a site on privately-owned land which would be technically \n     inferior to War Valley and would be unlikely to license in \n     accordance with California's and my own uncompromisingly high \n     standards for the protection of public health and safety. For \n     these reasons, I would personally oppose identifying any \n     other potential disposal site in California.\n       Therefore, as Governor of California, I am compelled to \n     inform you that, because the Clinton Administration has made \n     compliance with our obligations impossible, California will \n     be unable to provide a regional disposal site for your state \n     and the other states of the Compact during the tenure of this \n     president. California will continue to seek title to the Ward \n     Valley land, but will devote greater resources to a repeal of \n     the LLRW Policy Act, and to the enactment of federal \n     legislation making the federal government responsible for the \n     disposal of LLRW.\n       The Department of the Interior has formally announced that \n     California's LLRW generators are not harmed by its \n     interference with the opening of the Ward Valley LLRW \n     disposal facility because they have access to the disposal \n     facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. Given the public safety \n     threat to the good citizens of South Carolina, and the \n     additional costs and exposure to liability to users, I find \n     this suggestion questionable. Nevertheless, in order to make \n     this an even marginally acceptable solution, I am calling \n     upon the federal government to do all of the following:\n       Assume responsibility for assuring continued access for all \n     California generators of LLRW to Barnwell;\n       Subsidize the amount of any transportation costs to \n     Barnwell which exceed transportation costs to Ward Valley;\n       Ensure that California generators obtain any necessary \n     permits for transportation across the United States and to \n     Barnwell;\n       Indemnify California generators and transporters for any \n     liability which might result from the necessity to transport \n     California waste from coast to coast; and most importantly,\n       Hold California generators, including the University of \n     California and other state entities, harmless form any \n     federal or state cleanup related (Superfund or CERCLA) \n     liability which they might potentially incur as a result of \n     using a waste facility which is on a substantially less \n     protective site than Ward Valley and which has already \n     experienced tritium migration to groundwater.\n       If LLRW generators in your state have problems with storage \n     or with use of Barnwell similar to those of California \n     generators, I urge you to join with me in demanding similar \n     relief.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Wilson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4893-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE LEGISLATION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on a separate subject, let me say I \nstrongly support the efforts of the majority leader to repeal the \nPresident's Clinton 4.3-cent-per-gallon fuel tax. I also believe \nstrongly that the efforts of the majority leader in this area will \nresult in some relief to the consumers of America.\n  In my State of South Dakota, agriculture and tourism are the two most \nimportant industries. This is just the time of the year that farmers \nare driving their tractors, truckers are hauling agricultural supplies \nand produce and seeds, and tourists are beginning to come to see Mt. \nRushmore and the attractions in southwestern South Dakota. They need \nimmediate relief from high fuel prices.\n  I also support the Justice Department's antitrust probe into the \nrecent price increases. Certainly, we need to know if price fixing is \noccurring. However, past antitrust investigations have failed to \nproduce conclusive evidence of illegal activity. We need to take action \nnow. I hope the Congress can avoid procedural delays and give immediate \nrelief to millions of Americans at the gas pumps.\n  Let us remember that this Senate has been stalled by filibusters \nthroughout this session. I know that the national media has stopped \nusing the word ``filibuster,'' but that is what is happening. The \nSenate is tied up in knots. The approach of the opposition in this \nChamber has been nothing more than gridlock and filibuster.\n  Therefore, I hope we repeal the fuel tax very quickly. We are ready \nto do it. Members of the Senate Finance Committee have discussed this. \nWe are prepared to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4895-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on yet another subject, I hope that the \nFederal Communications Commission follows the intent of Congress \nregarding the recently passed Telecommunications Act. I was privileged \nto be able to author and chair the Joint House-Senate conference \ncommittee on telecommunications. But I fear that some of the \nderegulation and some of the good things in that bill are being taken \naway by regulators who are now writing the regulations for that bill.\n  I have asked in our committee that we hold a hearing and bring those \nCommissioners before the Commerce Committee. I know many Members of the \nSenate have written to me urging such a hearing because they are \nconcerned that the intent of Congress is not being followed.\n  The telecommunications bill was a very well-written bill. We had a \nchecklist for the entry of companies into the regional, local telephone \nbusiness and also for entering into the long-distance telephone \nbusiness. Those rules are set. Also, the whole issue of the States' \npower and participation with the States' public utilities commissions \nwas clearly written out in that bill.\n  I was just this morning told by one of our good public utilities \ncommissioners that the States' powers are being undercut by the Federal \nCommunications Commission. So we must be vigilant in trying to remind \nthe Federal Communications Commission that their No. 1 guideline in the \nimplementation of regulations is supposed to be intent of Congress.\n  I remember in Clark Weiss' law class the importance of ``intent of \nCongress'' for administrative law. That is the key that these agencies \nare supposed to follow. But that has been abandoned in this Government \nbecause now the agencies are more powerful in some cases than Congress. \nThat is unfortunate.\n  But the Federal agencies, when they write the regulations, the \nforemost thing in their mind is supposed to be intent of Congress and \nnot going off and starting to legislate all over. If they want to be \nlegislators, they can go out and run, as I am running this year, and \nsubmit their name to the public. But they are not legislators. They are \nregulators. They are a regulatory agency, not the legislative branch of \nGovernment. I will plead with the FCC to remember that as they write \nthose regulations. Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I understand we are on the pending \nbusiness and there are no time limits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the actions\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\ntaken by the majority leader earlier this week. Just to outline, we \nhave the underlying proposal, which is the effort to reimburse the Dale \nfamily for the costs they have that they were unjustly burdened with. \nThat has been objected to by the other side.\n  The majority leader has come forward with a full-ranging proposal \nthat, first, repeals the 4.3-cent gas tax that was imposed on America \nby President Clinton in August 1993; second, would grant the other side \ntheir vote for which they have sought on raising the minimum wage; and \nthird, would call for a vote on what is characterized as the TEAM Act, \nbut which is properly described as giving American workers the \nopportunity to meet without threat to the National Labor Relations \nBoard, to meet with management to discuss the general improvement of \ntheir work environment, an idea that came to us out of a tough \ncompetitor, Japan, where they had experimented with management \nemployees organizing themselves into various work groups to improve the \nproduct and to improve their competitiveness. We have before us these \nthree very important proposals.\n  Mr. President, when President Clinton was running for the Office, he \ntold the American people that a gas tax was the wrong thing to do. He \nsaid it was the wrong thing to do because it was particularly offensive \nor hard on low-income families and on the elderly. I would expand it. I \nthink it is not only hard on low-income families and the elderly, but \nit creates a hardship among small business people. It is particularly \ndifficult for rural communities who are confronted with long distances \nto travel. I think it has been just one more brick on the back of our \nmiddle-class families.\n  Yesterday, May 8, Mr. President, was the first day that an American \nwage earner could keep their paycheck. That is pretty remarkable, Mr. \nPresident. May 8 was the first day that wage earners could keep their \npaycheck. Their paycheck for their own needs, his or her housing needs, \ntransportation, and all the things we ask of the American people.\n\n  You ask, rightfully, anyone listening to this, ``Well, what happened \nto all the paychecks from January 1 to May 7?'' I can tell you. All of \nthose paychecks went to a government. As hard as it is to believe, from \nJanuary 1 to May 7, every dime earned is taken by the government, taken \nout of the resources of that family. When we take a snapshot of an \naverage family in my State, they earn about $45,000 a year, both \nparents work and they have two children. By the time the government \nsweeps through their checking account and you add on that family's \nshare of regulatory costs, which is now about $6,800 a year, and by the \ntime you add on their share of higher interest rates because of the \nsize of the Federal debt imposed on America by the Congress and the \nPresident of the United States, that is about $2,100 a year.\n  At the end of the day they only have half of their wages left to do \nall the work that we ask that family to do for our country. That must \nmake Thomas Jefferson roll over in his grave. If you read through his \nworks he warned over and over of the propensity of the Government to \ntake the rightful wages away from those that earned them. That is \nexactly what we have done in this United States of America.\n  Repealing the gas tax is a long way from redressing and correcting \nthis horrible imbalance. It would have been much better if the $245 \nbillion in tax relief--children's tax credits, eliminating the marriage \npenalty, alleviate the pressure on those living off Social Security--if \nall those things we sent the President had been signed into law, then \nwe would have put about $3,000 to $4,000 back into the checking account \nof the family I just described. What a difference that would have made. \nThat is the equivalent of about a 10- or 20-percent pay raise for that \nfamily. When you think of the responsibilities we put on those \nfamilies, that kind of resource is an enormous difference.\n  Repealing the gas tax, one piece of it, will help. It will put \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $100 to $400 back into their checking \naccount. It will be used a lot better there than having been shipped \noff to the Federal Government.\n  Just to cite some figures here, we have just gotten a report from the \nHeritage Foundation. This 4.3-cent gas tax on motor fuel, $168 million \nwas removed from Georgia and shifted up here to this burgeoning Federal \nGovernment. On diesel fuel, another $28.5 million was shipped up to \nWashington. And in jet fuel, of course, we have Atlanta Hartsfield \nInternational, $27.5 million, for a total $224 million. That is a \nquarter of a billion dollars taken right out of the State, right out of \nthe homes, right out of the businesses and shifted up here so that we \ncould have a larger Federal Government.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I think leaving the quarter of a billion dollars \nin Georgia, in those families, in those businesses, in those \ncommunities, in those school districts makes a lot better sense. We \nhave heard people say, ``Well, that does not amount to much.'' If it \ndoes not amount to much, why are there so many headaches about giving \nit back? If somebody wants to worry about it, let us let the folks at \nhome worry about it. This quarter of a billion dollars being used by \nour families, businesses, our communities, makes much better sense.\n  Mr. President, the report goes on to say, ``The poor and lower middle \nclass will be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.'' Susan Perry, \nthe senior vice president of the American Bus Association, testified on \nMay 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as a result of higher \nfuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, there are fewer bus \nstops. The very poor, the very elderly, and the very rural are mostly \naffected because they disproportionately ride buses. And the fuel costs \nare passed on to passengers.\n  It is a regressive tax. I suspect that is why the President, during \nhis campaign, said it was not a good idea. It only became a good idea \nafter he was elected. Because three-quarters of those Americans earning \nless than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a \nflat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percentage of \ntheir income. In 1987, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that \nthe poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their \nexpenditures to gasoline and motor oil, while the wealthiest 20 percent \ndevote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor \noil.\n  There is another feature of the gas tax the President imposed on \nAmerica that I disagree with, and that is that the tax was taxed on a \nuser fee concept, but was not used to build better roads or safer \nroads. The tax was imposed on the user of gasoline and motor oil, but \nit was shifted into other expenditures and a growing Government. It is \nregressive. It is hurting the middle-income family, hurting our \ncommunities, and it was not used in a dedicated form for highways and \nsafer roads.\n  This tax should be repealed, and it should be followed, Mr. \nPresident, by other reductions in taxes, so that we can get more money \nin the checking account of the average American family, where it \nbelongs, so that they can do the things they need to do to raise \nAmerica.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, a second feature of the proposal that Senator \nDole put on the floor was, as I mentioned a moment ago, entitled the \nTEAM Act. The TEAM Act merely adds a short provision to section 8(a)(2) \nof the National Labor Relations Act, to make it clear that employers \nwho meet together in employee involvement programs to address issues of \nmutual interest, as long as they do not engage in collective \nbargaining, or attempt to, they can meet and discuss general conditions \nin the workplace. The President, in his State of the Union Address, in \n1996, said, ``When companies and workers work as a team, they do \nbetter.'' So does America.\n  His Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, has said, on December 14, \n1995, ``Many companies have already discovered that management \npractices fully involving workers have great value behind their twin \nvirtues, higher profits and greater productivity.''\n  Those quotes are correct. So why is the other side so energized to \nkeep this modern idea from coming into law? Many American companies are \nintimidated from having these kinds of sessions for fear of the current \nlaw, and that ought to be changed.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, I had two separate groups of employees of \ncompanies--a large numbers of employees--contact our office, who think \nthis concept is superior and belongs in the\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nworkplace. They want to be able to engage in these kinds of activities \nin their companies in Georgia so that they can improve what they do, so \nthat they can compete, so that they can protect their jobs.\n  Mr. President, one of those companies engaged in this kind of \nactivity produced a $6 million annual savings by one of the work groups \nthat had met together between employees and management for 6 months. \nThey produced a $6 million savings for that company. That helps make \nthe company stronger, more competitive, and able to hire more \nemployees, and protects the jobs of those who work there now.\n  We were taken by the number of employees we have heard from seeking \nthis kind of innovation in the marketplace. Mr. President, candidly, we \nought to be doing a lot more to make the new workplace modern, as we \ncome into the new century, with ideas and laws that relate to the new \ncentury. Labor law, today, is greatly governed by laws that were \nwritten 30, 40, and 50 years ago. Those are old ideas. Those are \nrestraining ideas, and those ideas will keep America from competing \nwith the rigorous competition that is developing throughout the world. \nThe workers in the workplace know this, and they want these changes.\n\n  The working family, today, in 1996, versus 1930 and 1940, is vastly \ndifferent. That family, in the mid-1950's, had one spouse in the \nworkplace. You could count on one hand the number of families that had \nboth spouses working in the workplace. Today, you can count on one \nhand, almost, the families for which both spouses are not in the \nworkplace.\n  Mr. President, just as an aside, I believe the Government is \nprincipally responsible for that. You might ask, why is that? It is \nbecause we have pushed the tax burden higher and higher and higher, and \nin order for these families to fulfill their responsibilities, they \nhave to have two or more people in the workplace to keep the family \ngoing, to keep it educated, to keep it housed.\n  In fact, about a year ago, Mr. President, I did a graph, and I \ngraphed the new tax burden, beginning in 1950, and ran it up through \n1996. And then I did another graph. That graph was of the number of \nAmerican families for which both spouses were working. You are not \ngoing to be surprised that the two lines track each other almost \nidentically, because as that tax burden went up each succeeding year, \nas Congress spent more, built more, got bigger, with more programs, it \nhad to take more of the earnings from that family. And at the end of \nthe day, that family had to put more workers in the workplace.\n  I do not believe there is any institution that has had a more \nprofound effect on the American family than our own Government, more \nthan Hollywood. What other institution would sweep through an American \nfamily and take half its wages? None.\n  So, Mr. President, families in the workplace today have both parents \nout there, and sometimes children. And they need a new workplace. They \nneed more flexibility in the workplace. They need more options in the \nworkplace.\n  The TEAM Act that Senator Dole has put before the Senate this week is \na great first step. It is an initial step, just like the repeal of that \ngas tax. It is a first step going in the right direction leaving a \nlittle more money in that checking account. This TEAM Act is a first \nstep to start moving America to a new, a modern, a flexible, and a \nfriendly work environment.\n  Mr. President, by a 3-to-1 margin, when asked to choose between two \ntypes of organizations to represent them, workers chose one that would \nhave no power but would have management cooperation over one with power \nbut without management cooperation. The American worker wants this \nflexibility in the workplace.\n  I am very hopeful that at the end of this extended debate we will \ncome to a conclusion on the other side of the attempt to block the \nrepeal, to block the TEAM Act. They are going to get their vote on \ntheir idea of the minimum wage which I personally believe will cause \nabout 500,000 people to lose their jobs. But they are going to have \ntheir chance. We want a modern provision in the workplace, a new idea, \none that we have seen make our competitors tough, and we want to be as \ncompetitive as those other companies in those other countries.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 1:30 p.m. be equally divided for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished majority whip and I \nhave had a number of consultations over the last several hours, and we \nstill have not reached any resolution to the impasse that we are \nfacing. But I do want to note that over the last couple of days, as we \nhave had the opportunity to more closely examine the gas tax repeal \nlegislation, it has now been made evident to us that the offset that is \nincorporated in the legislation falls $1.7 billion short of the \nrevenues needed to provide for the offset in 1996.\n  Throughout this debate, we have indicated that we would be supportive \nunder two conditions. The first condition was, of course, that it was \nadequately offset. By adequately offset, obviously, we are talking not \nonly about the source of revenue, but also about the amount. And, of \ncourse, the second issue was that it be directly targeted to consumer \nrelief and not to the oil companies, or others.\n  Unfortunately, given the current legislative draft, as I said, we are \ntold now that the revenue loss--the addition to the deficit--would be \n$1.7 billion in 1996. Clearly, that is not in keeping with the two \ncriteria that we set out. Our hope was that we could find an adequate \noffset and, for whatever reason, that offset has not been achieved. It \nis ironic in some respects that, as the Budget Committee is now meeting \nto find ways to reduce the deficit and reach a balanced budget in 6 or \n7 years, the very legislation we are now considering falls short by \n$1.7 billion of the necessary offset required to ensure that this \nlegislation is entirely paid for.\n  And so, at an appropriate time--I expect it will be about 1:30--I \nwill make a point of order that the amendment is not fully offset. \nBecause Senator Dole is not here, and because Senator Lott and I have \nhad the opportunity to talk about their response, and to accommodate \nthe majority, we are going to wait until 1:30 to officially raise this \npoint of order.\n  Mr. President, this situation, again, illustrates why having separate \nbills is so important. Obviously, now, you have a point of order \nagainst an amendment dealing with gas taxes that has an effect on the \ntravel legislation, on the minimum wage, and on the so-called TEAM Act. \nSo this is becoming more and more convoluted, the more we get into this \ndebate and the closer we look.\n  I think it, again, makes the point that, unless we can separate these \nissues, unless we can have individual debates and votes on each bill, \nwe are going to continue to be frustrated by the complex nature of this \nvery intricate legislative structure that we have created for \nourselves. So I hope that we can, again, find a way to separate out the \nlegislation and have a good debate, a good vote, and deal with these \nissues one at a time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the distinguished Democratic leader \nnoted, Senator Dole will be back around 1:30. I am sure that we will \nhave continuing conversations in between now and that time, and the \nleader will be here and prepared to take action, also.\n  I want to emphasize that we are continuing to work to find a way to \nget through this process. The Members clearly want an opportunity to \nvote on the gas tax repeal. I understand the Democratic leader wants a \nstraight vote on the minimum wage. My understanding of the offers we \nhave been discussing back and forth would provide a\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\nclear, straight, separate vote on minimum wage. We have looked at \ndifferent ways to approach that, including different combinations of \nthe three matters that are pending--the gas tax repeal, minimum wage, \nand the freedom in the workplace, known as the TEAM Act. We are still \nworking on that, and I have faith that we can find a way to address all \nof these issues in an appropriate manner.\n  We do have some proposals pending right now that we hope to be able \nto agree to here within the next hour, as to how we will proceed for \nthe balance of the day, and what time we might expect votes to occur, \nand how we would deal even with Friday and next Monday. So we will \ncontinue to work with that.\n\n  With regard to the tax repeal, I indicated privately--and I will do \nit here publicly--on behalf of the leader yesterday that I thought we \ncould get some agreement on what amendments might be offered. I do not \nthink the leader is opposed to having some amendments as long as we do \nnot have a filibuster, as long as they are relevant, as long as there \nis not a filibuster by amendment, and if we could get an amendment \nidentified.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota is looking for some way to make \nsure that this gas tax repeal actually gets to the people buying the \ngas. We agree with that. We want to make sure that it actually gets to \nthe people who have been paying these taxes. We have some language in \nthe gas tax repeal that we think addresses that. But if there is a way \nto help in a way that it can be administered to help guarantee that \nthat actually happens, I would like to look at that because I want to \nmake sure that the people of my State get this 4.3-cent gas tax repeal \nbecause I personally did not think they should have been paying it in \nthe first place. That is why I spoke against it and voted against it in \n1993. I thought it was a tremendous mistake at the time to start taking \non a permanent basis a gas tax--not for the highway trust fund to build \ninterstate highways and Federal highways and bridges that we need \ndesperately--and move it over to the deep, dark, black hole of the \nGeneral Treasury never to be heard or seen from again. I thought that \nwas a mistake. So I would like to repeal that. I would like to \nguarantee that it gets to the people. If we can identify some \namendments, or an amendment, I would like to see that. I think the \nleader would be willing to look at that, if we could work out an \nagreement on it.\n  As to the offset, we have an offset in our proposal. We think it is a \ncredible offset. We have a small amount--$2.4 billion, as I understand \nit--from spectrum, plus some savings from travel at the Energy \nDepartment. There may be some lag time because, if this gas tax repeal \nis signed into law and goes into effect, if in fact the President signs \nit--I am not sure; the indication is that maybe he would or would not. \nNow I think maybe he indicates that he would, if it were sent to him in \nsuch a way that it did not have things that he would call poison pills \nand which he would call the opportunity for him to use his poison pen \nagain. But we do have offsets in this legislation.\n  The only problem is that the gas tax repeal would take effect \nimmediately and for some of these offsets it takes some time before \nthey actually begin to start coming in.\n  But, again, I think we can work out the offset in such a way that it \nis fair and would cover the loss to the Treasury. We do not want to add \nto the deficit. But we also are very committed to trying to help the \nworking people of America get this gas tax off of their backs. We will \ncontinue to work on that.\n  I point out, also, as the distinguished Democratic leader has, as I \nunderstand it, that the minimum wage probably is subject to a point of \norder. I do not think the leader would want to have that happen because \nI believe it would be identified as an unfunded mandate where it would \ndirect that we have the minimum wage, and it would mean loss of jobs. \nSo that would be subject to a point of order.\n  So I would be inclined, if we get into this point of order process, \nto think we should waive that and not have the gas tax knocked out \nbecause it is a revenue bill that did not begin in the House, for \nwhatever purpose, or have the minimum wage knocked out. I do not think \nthe Democratic leader would want that to happen. If we should by chance \ncombine those two issues, the gas tax and minimum wage, we would not \nwant either of them to be knocked out by a point of order, whether it \nis a revenue measure our unfunded mandate, because with minimum wage \nyou are mandating that small businesses throughout this country have to \nbear the burden of this increase, which I am convinced would lead to \nthe loss of jobs of people who need them the most.\n  But there are these arguments on both sides. I think a good-faith \neffort is being made to work through it to see how we can address the \noffsets and how we can address guaranteeing that the gas tax repeal \ngets to the people we want to get it--and that is the working people, \nthe people who drive long distances, paying for this unfair gas tax to \ngo into spending by the Federal Government. But we will have a chance \nto work on this further here in the next 30 or 40 minutes. I will be \nglad to talk with the distinguished Democratic leader and others, and \nthen we will communicate with the majority leader when he returns.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know there are at least two Senators on our side who \nwish to speak, and I see those on the majority side as well.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, and \n10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island as the \nallocation of the time that we have remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. That would mean 15 \nminutes. So we would get at least 15 minutes on our side to offset \nthat. So we should have enough time to cover the speakers that we have.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 5 minutes \nof the time on our side to talk about the issue that is before us.\n  This has been going on for some time. I have not been privy to the \ninternal workings of it. But I have to tell you, I am a little bit \ndisappointed in the system where we have gone now for almost 2 weeks \nand have effectively done nothing. It seems to have been perfected on \nthat side of the aisle--the idea of being able to keep things from \nhappening. Let us talk about what we are really doing here.\n  As I recall, the basis is the Travelgate question, the question of \nreimbursing those employees who were unfortunately, and I think perhaps \nunfairly, accused regarding their fees in the Travelgate affair at the \nWhite House.\n  We are talking about minimum wage, which I do not happen to support. \nI think it takes more jobs than it creates. But I am certainly willing \nto have a vote on it. I think it is interesting. You get accusations \nabout politics. The minimum wage did not come up for 2\\1/2\\ years when \nthe Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, as well as the White \nHouse. But suddenly--I guess it was just happenstance--when the AFL-CIO \nwas here, they promised to give $35 million for the election, this \nissue came forward. I am sure that was an accident.\n  The TEAM bill, which seems to me to be pretty hard to argue against, \nis an opportunity for people to work with their employer to find ways \nto deal with issues that affect them as a business person. It seems to \nme that is a great idea. There seems now to be questions about whether \nit can be done, and that needs to be clarified. I support that.\n  The tax reduction, I think, is one of the most important things that \nwe have talked about here. I was in the House when this came up. I \nvoted against it for several reasons. One is that it does not have \nanything to do with the maintenance of highways. It does not have \nanything to do with roads. Someone in our hearing this morning said, \n``Well, why don't we do the 10 cents that came up earlier?'' There is a \nsignificant difference between the two. This one goes into the general \nfund for social programs, or whatever. The other one goes to the \nmaintenance of highways, which has traditionally been our system, where \nthe gas tax goes for the maintenance and building of the highways.\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\n  The other is, of course, that it is another tax that is added on. It \nis a tax that some claim is used, of course, to balance the budget. I \nwould like to suggest that we ought to be a little more proud about \nbalancing the budget if we reduce the spending rather than raising \ntaxes, rather than talking constantly about how we are coming closer to \nbalancing the budget because we had the largest tax increase in our \nhistory. Instead, we might talk a little bit about how we might reduce \nthe size of Government. I think people in my State say the Federal \nGovernment is too big, that it costs too much. But instead we talk \nabout how we are going to balance the budget by raising taxes.\n  I am a little surprised that that tax increase passed at all, of \ncourse. The President said, and I quote from 1992. ``I oppose Federal \nexcise tax increases for gas.'' That is when he was campaigning. After \nhe was elected, then he started with a Btu tax and ended up with this \none. Bill Clinton said in 1992, commenting on the gas tax proposal, \n``It sticks it to the lower income, middle-income retired people in the \ncountry, and it is wrong''--talking about a gas tax.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we ought to move forward. I understand \nthat this is the deliberative body. I understand the rules that, when I \nask about them, I usually am told, ``Well, they have been that way for \n200 years.'' But their needs to be a way for us to move forward. We are \nhere to solve problems. We are not here to find ways to keep from \nsolving them. I think we ought to move forward. I am pleased with what \nI hear from the leaders that we might be in a position to move forward \nand make some decisions.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has been allocated 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not take the entire 5 minutes, and \nI appreciate the indulgence of my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I listen from time to time, and I wonder some morning \nwhether we will not come out to hear the other side blame the President \nfor thunderstorms and tornadoes that rolled across the Midwest the \nnight before. It seems to be a popular sport in the Senate. I guess I \nunderstand that.\n  However, I wanted to just comment for a moment on what it appears to \nme the vote will be on soon. It appears to me that the proposal to \nreduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents is a result of the gas price spiking up \n20 or 30 cents in recent weeks. Some have come to the floor and said \nlet us reduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents per gallon. I said this morning \nthat is like treating a toothache by getting a haircut. There is no \nrelationship between the two.\n  The 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax put on 2\\1/2\\ years ago was put on to \nreduce the deficit. The deficit has been reduced in half. The fact is \nafter the gas tax was put on, for market force reasons the price of \ngasoline came down, having nothing, of course, to do with the tax.\n  Those who say let us reduce the gas tax now might listen to the oil \ncompany executives who are telling us there is no guarantee that the \ngas price is going to come down if you repeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon \ngas tax.\n  So the question is, which pocket will be the beneficiary of some $30 \nbillion in the next 7 years--the big pocket of the oil industry or the \npockets of the drivers? There is no guarantee it is going to be passed \non to the drivers.\n  The point I want to make is this. My understanding is that the bill \nbrought to the floor by those who want to change the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget, by those who say today they are working in \nthe Budget Committee to produce a balanced budget, will now result in a \nvote by a point of order on the budget; that we will be required to \nvote to waive the Budget Act, as I understand it, because this proposed \nrepeal of the gas tax will increase the Federal deficit by $1.7 billion \nto the end of this fiscal year and by $2.8 billion by January 1. The \noffsets they propose will come apparently in 1998.\n\n  So we will have the interesting prospect that those who are bringing \na bill to the floor saying we want to balance the budget also come to \nthe floor to move to waive the Budget Act to allow the budget deficit \nto grow, as a result of their proposal on the gas tax, $1.7 billion in \nthis fiscal year and $2.8 billion by January 1.\n  I will not intend to vote to waive the Budget Act to do that. But \nthat will apparently be the vote, the vote to waive the Budget Act and \nagainst the point of order that will be made. It will be an interesting \ndebate.\n  I think it makes no sense for us to begin running backward on this \nissue of the budget deficit. The budget deficit has been cut in half \nand is coming down 4 years in a row, down very substantially. If you \nreduce the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon and to do so will increase the \nbudget deficit, which is going to happen in this proposal and which is \nwhy the point of order and the motion to waive the Budget Act to \nincrease the deficit, it does not make any sense. We will have an \ninteresting debate about that. But that will eventually be the vote in \nthe Chamber--to permit a higher Federal deficit in order to repeal a \n4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax which oil company executives say there is \nno guarantee it will show up in the price of gas at the pumps in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to reiterate that we should not rush \nheadlong, like lemmings to the sea, to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon \ngasoline tax. When this tax was enacted in 1993, it was specifically \ndedicated to deficit reduction, and experience to date indicates that \nthe gas tax has been helpful in this regard. Under President Clinton, \nthe deficit, which was at a high of $290 billion in 1992, has been \nbrought down to an estimated $144 billion in the current year. Why \nrepeal this tax, when to do so will slow down or reverse this favorable \ntrend and add billions of dollars to the deficit? Rather, we should \nconsider raising, not lowering the gasoline tax in order to further \nreduce our deficit.\n  I join the senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] in expressing \nthe thought that we should not accept even a temporary repeal.\n  It has been suggested that the funds with which to finance this \nrepeal may be found by cutting education spending, requiring banks to \npay more to the savings association insurance fund, cutting Energy \nDepartment expenses, and/or, selling off unused wavelengths on the \nbroadcast spectrum. The disparity of these suggestions seems to \nindicate that there exists no credible consensus as to exactly how we \nwill be able to pay for this ill-advised tax cut.\n  Probably for these same reasons, the States show no inclination to \ncut the tax. Across the country, State gasoline taxes often exceed the \nFederal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon. The State tax on gasoline in my \nhome State of Rhode Island is the second highest in the Nation, at 28 \ncents. Yet no State legislature thus far has moved to cut their \ngasoline tax, reasoning wisely, that it helps stave off operating \ndeficits, enabling States to balance their budgets. A task, I might \nadd, which they seem to perform better than we.\n  I recognize that higher gas prices impact adversely upon commuters \nand those whose daily livelihood depends upon the availability of low \npriced fuel. But it should be noted that the price of gasoline today, \nwhen adjusted for inflation, is as low as at any time since World War \nII. With prices relatively low, demand for gasoline has been steadily \nrising; motorists today are driving more, at higher speeds, and in cars \nthat are less fuel-efficient than in years past. In consequence, we now \ndepend on foreign suppliers for close to half of the oil we consume.\n\n  Partly as a result of this dependency, we now have a temporary \nshortage of supply, making it unlikely that prices will go down in \nresponse to this tax decrease. Rather, the forces of the market, \ninexorable as they are, will delay a drop in the price of gasoline \nuntil sometime later this summer, when supplies are expected to \nincrease. To quote the Los Angeles Times, ``the grim lessons about \nover-dependency of the 1970's are being forgotten, and the conservation \nethic is slipping away.''\n  Finally, there is absolutely no certainty that the oil companies will \npass\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nthis rebate on to the consumer. Economists across the spectrum, ranging \nfrom William Niskanen of the Cato Institute to Phillip K. Verleger at \nCharles River Associates, agree that the 4.3-cent-a-gallon cut will \nbenefit the oil industry, not the consumer. The total effect of this \ngesture will be to add $2.9 billion to the Federal deficit over the \nnext 7 months, while transferring the same $2.9 billion to the pockets \nof refiners and gasoline marketers.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the siren's song of the inevitability \nof this tax cut. Economist Michael Toman of Resources for the Future is \nquoted in the Washington Post as describing such a cut as ``nutty.'' I \nwould simply add that it is wrong-headed and ill-conceived. It should \nbe rejected.\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago, when the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee met to mark up S. 295, the TEAM Act, I once again \nspoke of my longstanding interest in innovations in the conduct of \nlabor-management relations. As I said at that time, I have been \nparticularly interested in the efforts of many European countries to \ninvolve workers in policy deliberations at all levels of corporate \nbureaucracy. In Europe, this practice is referred to as ``co-\ndetermination,'' and means that management and labor sit on the same \nboard.\n  While it is not suggested that what works in Europe would work here \nin the United States, the notion of worker involvement is no less \nvalid. Now, after years of regrettably bitter, contentious, and even \nviolent interaction and with the ever-increasing demands of a high-\ntechnology workplace in a global economy, a more collaborative process \nhas developed that brings workers and employers together on an ongoing \nbasis. Companies ranging from Texas Instruments and IBM to Harley-\nDavidson motorcycles have instituted ongoing employer-employee work \ncouncils.\n  There is, I believe, little disagreement about the value of these \ncouncils. There is, however, considerable debate about the current \nlegality of these groups. We are told by some that this disagreement \nproduces a chilling effect that hinders the continued and future \ndevelopment of employer-employee work councils.\n  I have tried for some time to find the proper balance. During the \nlast Congress, I introduced legislation, S. 2499, that, among other \naspects, established a formal election process for employee \nrepresentatives.\n  While not introducing legislation during this Congress, I have \ncontinued to explore other avenues in this area. I had hoped to offer \nan amendment during the Labor Committee markup that would give \nemployees the right to select their own council representatives; ensure \nthat council agendas were open to both employees and employers and, \nfinally, prohibit the unilateral termination of a council. I decided \nnot to offer language of this nature, however, because of a lack of \nsupport from both the majority and organized labor.\n  S. 295, the TEAM Act, is certainly not the answer. The bill, as \npassed by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, amends the \nNational Labor Relations Act to allow the employer, I repeat, the \nemployer ``to establish, assist, maintain, or participate in any \norganization of any kind, in which employees participate to address \nmatters of mutual interest.'' At no point in this section of the TEAM \nAct is there any mention of employee rights, nor are employees given \nthe right to designate their representatives.\n  I must say I was very encouraged on Tuesday to hear that the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] suggested an amendment to the \nTEAM Act allowing workers to select their representatives.\n  I regret that we find ourselves faced with the current deadlock. Not \nonly are Senators prohibited from amending any of the three issues \nunder consideration but American workers are faced with the choice of \ngiving up their rights in return for a raise.\n  It is clear that the path out of this predicament is to separate the \nminimum wage increase, the gas tax repeal, and the TEAM Act, allow each \nto be amended and then individually voted on.\n  Furthermore, the only solution to the stalemate over the TEAM Act--as \nI have said for many years now--is to allow employees to freely select \nthe employee representatives of the work councils.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document titled ``Co-\ndetermination in European Countries,'' prepared by my staff, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Codetermination in European Countries\n\n\n                                germany\n\n       Coal & Steel Co's (1,000+ employees): Equal number of \n     worker and shareholder representation along with an \n     additional independent member agreed on by both sides.\n       Joint Stock Company (less than 2,000 employees): worker \n     reps. hold \\1/3\\ of seats on Supervisory Board of company. \n     These reps. can't be proposed by the union and must be \n     elected by all company employees.\n       Limited Liability Co's.

These \n     reps. can't be proposed by the union and must be elected by \n     all company employees.\n       Others: An equal number of both employees and shareholders. \n     Depending on size of company each side has 6-10 \n     representatives. Trade union must have at least 2 reps, 3 if \n     the total employee representation = 10. Other employee groups \n     (blue collar, white collar, and executives) must also have at \n     least one representative.\n\n\n                                denmark\n\n       Co-determination laws only cover companies with 50 or more \n     employees.\n       Workers are entitled to elect 2 or more representatives to \n     the company Supervisory board. Shareholders appoint at least \n     3 members. There is no upper limit to the number of \n     representatives but shareholder representatives must hold the \n     majority.\n\n\n                               luxembourg\n\n       Co-determination laws only cover companies that have had \n     1,000 or more employees for 3 years. The State also must have \n     at least a 25% interest in the firm.\n       Worker representatives account for \\1/3\\ of each \n     Administrative Board. In reality, however, day-to-day work is \n     handled by a separate Management Board that has no \n     requirement for union membership.\n\n\n                                 france\n\n       Nationalized companies have Supervisory Boards with equal \n     membership of Government representatives, worker \n     representatives, and consumer representatives.\n       There are no legal provisions for worker representation in \n     private sector companies.\n\n\n                             united kingdom\n\n       Boards of nationalized companies contain minority worker \n     representation.\n       There are no legal provisions for worker representation in \n     private sector companies.\n\n\n                            the netherlands\n\n       There are no legal provisions for worker representation in \n     private sector companies.\n\n\n                                belgium\n\n       There are no legal provisions for worker representation in \n     private sector companies.\n       Only the most liberal unions in the country favor worker \n     representatives.\n\n\n                                 italy\n\n       There are no legal provisions for worker representation in \n     private sector companies.\n       Italian unions view Co-determination as an effort to dilute \n     worker power.

Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that the \npending Dole amendment, which contains the Democratic proposal for the \nminimum wage increase, violates the Budget Act by creating an unfunded \nmandate.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have been requesting they \nget a clean vote on this minimum wage amendment for some time now, and \nit seems to me if the amendment were to fall on the point of order just \nraised, that our colleagues would lose their opportunity for such a \nvote.\n  With that in mind, I move to waive titles 3 and 4 of the Budget Act \nfor consideration of the Dole amendment No. 3960.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

I believe now under the unanimous-consent agreement we do \nhave time for debate under the agreement. I see Senator Grassley from \nIowa is waiting to speak. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to continue my remarks from this \nmorning and express my support for the TEAM Act. I support the TEAM Act \nbecause it would allow employees the privilege to participate in \nworkplace decisions, giving the workers a greater voice in matters of \nmutual interest such as quality, productivity, and safety. These are \nrational things and ought to be a subject of discussion between workers \nand employers. But, current law prohibits this type of participation.\n  The bill before the Senate would, among other things, encourage \nworker-management cooperation. It would preserve, without a doubt, the \nbalance between labor and management, while allowing cooperative \nefforts between worker and employer. It would permit voluntary \ncooperation. It would do it between workers and employers and would \nallow all we want to encourage to continue working.\n  Current law prohibits 85 percent of working folks from talking with \ntheir employers in employee involvement committees. I know that does \nnot sound reasonable, but present law prohibits it. It prohibits \ndiscussing things like the extension of employees' lunch breaks by 15 \nminutes; sick leave; flexible work schedules; free coffee; purchase of \na table, soda machine, microwave, or a clock for the smoking lounge; \ntornado warning procedures; safety goggles for fryer and bailer \noperators; ban on radios and other sound equipment; dress codes; day \ncare services, and no smoking policies. We know that because employee-\nemployer committees have tried to discuss these things and their \nefforts have been found illegal. The President spoke in support of this \nsort of cooperation in his State of the Union message this year. He \nsaid:\n\n       When companies and workers work as a team, they do better, \n     and so does America.\n\n  Mr. President I agree with the President of the United States. I also \nagree with what Secretary Reich said in July 1993. He said this in an \narticle in the Washington Post:\n\n       High-performance workplaces are gradually replacing the \n     factories and offices where Americans used to work, where \n     decisions were made at the top and most employees merely \n     followed instructions. The old top-down workplace doesn't \n     work anymore.\n\n  As astounding as it might sound that a Republican would be agreeing \nwith the Secretary of Labor, I wholeheartedly agree. But things said in \nWashington do not always come out at the end of the pipeline in policy \nthe way that they are really stated. In other words, rhetoric is not \nalways followed through by performance in office.\n  Just a few months ago, at a national union rally in Washington, DC, \nfollowing a $35 million campaign pledge made to the Democratic Party \nand a grand endorsement by the AFL-CIO, Vice President Al Gore pledged \nPresident Clinton's veto of the bill that we are debating on the floor \nof this body right now. This bill, in every respect, fits into \ncompliance with the statements made by President Clinton in his State \nof the Union Message and Secretary Reich's article in the Washington \nPost. The TEAM Act is an act that does nothing more and nothing less \nthan legalize workplace cooperation between nonunion employees and \nmanagement.\n  Union representatives tell me that they fear that the TEAM Act would \nprevent them from organizing union shops. I want to emphasize that this \nact does not apply to union settings and would not undermine existing \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  Under the TEAM Act, workers retain the right, as they should, to \nchoose an independent union to engage in collective bargaining. But as \nit stands now, if employees choose not to organize--and 88 percent of \nthe private sector has chosen not to--they are penalized by not being \nable to conduct this sort of worker-employer cooperation through \ncommittees.\n  In other words, they are gagged and prohibited from discussing \nworkplace issues with their employers. Throughout this debate, I have \nheard some of my colleagues talk about how they mistrust the intention \nof management. My colleagues who make these statements must assume that \nworkers and managers have a built-in adversarial relationship, or they \nwant to promote some adversarial relationships, instead of promoting \ncooperation, which this legislation would allow them to do.\n  At one time that may have been true, but that was decades ago and is \ngenerally not true today. The employers, as well as the employees, \nwhether from my State or other States--but I listen primarily to those \nin my State--tell me they only want the legal privilege to form \npartnerships to promote cooperative work environments. They just want \nto be able to talk to each other.\n  One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stated that most \ncompanies already legally meet with their employees. But I would like \nto tell him about the possible consequences that a company faces if \nthey choose to do so.\n  The Clinton-appointed Dunlop Commission invited the Donnelly Corp. to \ntestify before the commission. This company was chosen because it was a \nshining example of how well employee involvement in these committees \nworks. The company was praised for its promotion of workplace \nflexibility and formation of worker-management teams.\n\n  But this public announcement brought them and their employees a great \namount of grief. The Donnelly Corp. was slapped with a labor lawsuit \nfiled by the NLRB. Why? Because of its progressive operations. The \nCorporation was temporarily forced to cease its employee involvement \nprograms. The company was accused of breaking Federal law, a law that \nthe TEAM Act would reform.\n  After a long year of litigation, the case was settled, but the \ncompany is still threatened by possible labor lawsuits, unless the law \nis changed.\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\n  In 1995, Secretary Reich, when speaking to the Securities and \nExchange Commission, called on the SEC to find ways to encourage \ncompanies to voluntarily disclose workplace practices that contribute \nto higher profits. He said he had heard that many companies were \nreluctant to provide information about such programs to the market for \nfear that they would be sued.\n  He said, ``I believe there is a chilling effect. Why disclose if you \nsubject yourself to potential liability?''\n  President Clinton, Secretary Reich, and their own commission, the \nDunlop Commission, up until the union leaders made a $35 million \ncampaign pledge to their party, supported reforms of current labor law. \nNow the Clinton administration has threatened to veto the TEAM Act in \nits present form.\n  The Clinton administration says that it is not beholden to special \ninterests. But it seems like with a lot of vetoes, or a lot of threats \nof vetoes, this administration listens just to trial lawyers or to \nlabor union leaders. Is it possible that the same administration that \nmarches in lockstep with the National Education Association and the \nTrial Lawyers of America is more interested in a $35 million campaign \npledge than in correcting the wrong that was done to the Donnelly \nCorp.?\n  So I encourage my colleagues today to recognize the need for the \npeople to have a real voice in decisions affecting their workplace and \nurge them to support this act.\n  I know that everybody knows I am a Republican, and I know everybody \nbelieves that Republicans do not have any understanding of the \nworkplace or the labor union environment. So I want to repeat what I \nstated this morning when I spoke about this same piece of legislation. \nI had the experience of working in a sheet metal factory from August \n1960 until March of 1971. I worked on the assembly line, making furnace \nregisters for the Waterloo Register Company in Cedar Falls, IA, a \ncompany that went out of business in 1971. I was a member of the \nInternational Association of Machinists from February 1962 until March \n1971. I have an understanding of the workplace environment. I have an \nunderstanding of the cooperation that is necessary between labor and \nmanagement if productivity is to increase. I have an understanding that \nyou can have workplace committees and dialog between labor and \nmanagement, outside of the normal collective bargaining process, and \nenhance productivity within the workplace.\n  Not only does it happen, but we need to encourage more of it, so that \nnothing is done in that process to interfere with the statutory right \nand the constitutional right that people have to organize in unions.\n  I was a member of the International Association of Machinists for \nthat period of time. If I were still working at that company, I presume \nI would still be a member of that union. But the union that I used to \nbe a member of, and most of these other unions that are stationed here \nin Washington, are against this bill. I think that is kind of like \nhaving your head stuck in the sand, because we are going to have to \nincrease productivity in the workplace if we are going to keep up with \ninternational competition. We ought to be enhancing and doing \neverything we possibly can to make our manufacturing and our service \nindustries more productive to meet the competition from overseas. And \nthis bill would encourage that. I do not know why leaders here in \nWashington cannot understand that.\n  The people that were on the assembly line with me in the 1960's \nunderstood that, even though we did not have the international \ncompetition we have now. But also I think I learned something in the \nprocess, too, that labor union leaders here in Washington, DC, do not \nalways represent the voice of their leaders at the grassroots. The \npeople I worked with felt the necessity of encouraging this cooperation \nbetween labor and management so that we would be more productive, so \nthat we could make more money, get higher salaries, and better fringe \nbenefits.\n  So I hope that we can pass this bill and get it to the President. I \nhope the President will stick to his message in the State of the Union, \nthat we have to enhance cooperation between workers and employers, \nbecause that is what this bill does.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago today, I attempted to offer an \namendment repealing the 1993 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. Two \nweeks ago today, the Democrats objected to that amendment coming up, \nand we find ourselves in a situation where, all over America, people \nare talking about the rising cost of gasoline and diesel fuel.\n  The President now says he is in favor of the repeal. Our Democratic \ncolleagues say they are in favor of it. But yet 2 weeks after I tried \nto offer this amendment, we have yet to get an opportunity to vote on \nit. When I tried to offer the amendment, our Democratic colleagues \nsaid, ``Well, we want to vote on the minimum wage.'' So Senator Dole \nsaid: ``OK, let us vote on the gasoline tax, and let us vote on minimum \nwage with a relevant amendment if the Democrats want to offer an \namendment to try to guarantee a pass-through on the gas tax.''\n  The majority leader said that he would allow that amendment to be \noffered. If they come up with a reasonable amendment, we will support \nthat amendment. But the majority leader said that, with the minimum \nwage bill, he would like to try to do something about an absurd \nsituation which has had the effect of preventing workers and managers \nfrom using the teamwork approach which has increased productivity all \nover the world. The National Labor Relations Board has come in and \ndenied employers and employees the ability to meet and talk together \nabout such issues as company softball teams, appropriate work clothing \nfor pregnant women, and other issues involving quality, efficiency and \nproductivity because the union bosses believe that somehow their power \nis diminished if people who work for companies and people who run \ncompanies learn how to work together.\n  So, as a result, we are in a situation where the American people \ncontinue to await a repeal of the gas tax. I do not have any doubt in \nmy mind that if we had a vote on repealing the gas tax this afternoon, \n75 Members of the Senate, minimum, would vote for it.\n  The Democrats say they want to raise the minimum wage. The majority \nleader says: ``Great, we will give you that vote.'' Yet, here we are \nwhere people are affected by rising gas prices, where we have the \nability through legislative action to reduce the cost of a tank of \ngasoline when working families fill up their car or their truck or \ntheir van--about $1 for every fillup. Yet, for 2 weeks nothing has \nhappened.\n\n  I wanted to come over today to express my frustration. I think we \nought to bring up the gasoline tax repeal and have a vote on it. The \nmajority leader has said he is willing to bring up the minimum wage and \nhave a vote on it. The majority leader would like to have a vote on the \nso-called TEAM Act. My guess is that 98 percent of the American people \nwould support the concept of letting people who work in the same \ncompany, whose retirements are tied to the progress of the company, who \nhave the shared goal of creating jobs and growth and opportunity, talk \nto one another. Only in America do we have an absurd system where the \nGovernment tries to stop people who work for the same company from \ntalking to each other to improve safety and efficiency and to improve \nthe quality of life. Yet, while we have three proposals and we have an \nagreement from the majority leader to vote on all three of them, we are \ndenied that ability.\n  While I am in the process of listing legislative agenda items, recall \nthat we recently passed a health care bill. It was touted by both sides \nof the aisle. It was going to help 25 million people in making health \ninsurance more affordable and by making it more available. And the \nmajority leader, in his capacity as majority leader, sought to appoint \nconferees so we could go to conference with the House, adopt this bill, \nsend it back to both Houses, and attempt to make it the law of the \nland. Now we have an objection to even going to conference with the \nHouse because the Senator from Massachusetts does not like the makeup \nof the conference decided upon by the majority leader.\n  So it seems to me that what we are seeing here is an effort to \nprevent the will of the American people from being exercised in the \nSenate. I think it is\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\noutrageous when we have had a consensus in the country for over 2 \nweeks, when we have probably 75 Members of the Senate who want to \nrepeal the gasoline tax and bring down the cost of gasoline for working \nfamilies, when we have a President who has said he would sign the bill, \nwe cannot bring it up for a simple yes-or-no vote in the U.S. Senate. I \nthink it is very clear to anybody who wants to watch the process that \nit is our Democratic colleagues who are denying us the ability to \nrepeal the gasoline tax.\n  Let me say just a little bit about the gasoline tax. Many people do \nnot understand, really, what this issue is about. Let me try to explain \nit in two ways.\n  First of all, prior to 1993, we had never had a permanent gasoline \ntax that was not tied to building highways. In fact, the gasoline tax \nhas historically built up a transportation trust fund which has been \nused to build the transportation system of the country. It has in \nessence been a user fee. So you pay taxes on gasoline, and that builds \nroads. We have now taken part of that money, unwisely, in my opinion, \nand put it into mass transit, instead of a mass transit user fee paid \nfor by mass transit. So we have mass transit systems all over the \ncountry, and nobody rides mass transit in many cases.\n  Quite aside from that point, before 1993 and the Clinton gasoline tax \nincrease, the gasoline tax went to build highways. In 1993, the \nPresident tried to impose a general energy tax called a Btu tax. We \ndefeated that tax. As an alternative, without a single Republican vote, \nthe President and the Democratic majority raised taxes on gasoline, but \nnone of the money that went into the Treasury from the gasoline tax \nwent to building roads. For the first time, it went into general \nGovernment, which under the budget that we adopted----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the gasoline tax bill be made \nin order and be brought before the Senate at this point.\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator says this is the first time that we have ever \nused gasoline taxes for the general fund.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I said this is the first permanent gas tax we have ever \nhad that did not go to the highway trust fund. We have adopted gasoline \ntaxes in the past on a temporary basis, but we have never adopted a \npermanent one that did not ultimately go into the trust fund. This is \nthe first.\n  Mr. FORD. For 1932 and 1956, all of it went to the general fund. That \nis No. 1. No. 2, the Bush nickel was divided, 2.5 cents for \ntransportation and 2.5 cents went to deficit reduction. It did phase \nout in 1995.\n  So when you get back and start looking at all these things, there has \nbeen some tax that has been used in past administrations, and that is \n10 cents, if you want to look at it, 5 in 1982 and 5 in 1990, and 2.5 \ncents was used in the general fund for 5 years. So when the Senator \nsays it is the only one that has been dedicated, technically he might \nbe right. But when you take it out of my pocket and you put it in the \ngeneral fund, then I expect that I feel a little bit differently than \nthe way the Senator explains it technically. So, yes, we have used \ntaxes before for the general fund put on gasoline. Am I not correct, I \nask the Senator?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, obviously, before we \nestablished the highway trust fund, there was no trust fund to which \nthe taxes could be directed. The Senator makes it very clear that we \nhave had temporary taxes in the past that were not dedicated to the \ntrust fund, but were planned to expire. The point I am making is this \nis the first permanent gas tax that we have had since we have had the \nhighway trust fund that has not gone to the highway trust fund.\n  Let me tell you why that is important. We are taxing people who work \nfor a living, people who have to get in their car or their pickup truck \nand, in my State, drive 30 and 40 miles to work to subsidize social \nprograms for people who do not work, and I object to that tax. We are \ntaxing people who live in the West and who live in rural areas who have \nto drive great distances to work for a living to subsidize people who \nlive in the big Eastern cities, and I object to that tax. I do not \nthink this is a fair tax.\n  I think it ought to be repealed on its merits. The American people \nwant to repeal it because gasoline prices are up. The only thing we can \ndo that will bring down prices at the pump is to repeal this tax.\n  Now, we have had the administration suggest that we have \ninvestigations. We have various committees that are holding hearings. \nBut the point is, if we want to bring down the price of gasoline, we \nknow how to do it. We could do it this afternoon. If the Senator had \nnot objected and we had brought up the gasoline tax repeal as I just \nasked consent to do, we could have passed it this afternoon; it could \nhave gone to the House; they could have passed it tonight; the \nPresident could have signed it tomorrow; and Saturday morning when \nevery filling station in America opened, they could have lowered their \nposted price by 4.3 cents a gallon.\n  Let me also note that the price of highway diesel would come down 4.3 \ncents a gallon; the price of diesel used on the railroad would come \ndown 4.3 cents a gallon; the price of commercial and noncommercial jet \nfuel and aviation gasoline would come down 4.3 cents a gallon. So we \nare not just talking about what you save filling up your gasoline tank. \nWe are talking about consumers who pay this tax every time they go to \nthe grocery store, because the cost of everything from red meat to \nbeans has the cost of the diesel fuel tax in it because all of those \ngroceries had to be brought in by truck or by rail to that grocery \nstore. Every time you get on an airplane, you are paying this tax \nbecause it is built into the price of your ticket. So the plain truth \nis, the Joint Economic Committee has estimated that the annual cost of \nthis 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline to Texans is $445 million a \nyear.\n  So my point is this. We have an issue here where the American people \nare overwhelmingly for repeal of this gasoline tax and in favor of \nbringing down the price of gasoline by about a dollar a tank. We should \nstop taxing working people who have to use their car or truck to go to \nwork to subsidize social programs for people who do not work.\n  I do not understand, when we have such a clear consensus, when the \nPresident says he is for it, why we cannot vote on it.\n  Now, maybe they are not for it. I would never suggest that someone \ndoes not stand where they say they stand, but I think it is up to \npeople who claim they are for repealing this tax but yet will not let \nus vote on it to explain to us why it is that they are for it. They \nthink it is a good idea. The President, who is from their party, says \nhe will sign it. But yet this now represents 14 days we have attempted \nto bring up the gasoline tax repeal, and we have been denied that \nability.\n  So I just wanted to come over this afternoon to express my \nfrustration at where we are. I do not understand. If people want to \nvote on the minimum wage, the majority leader has offered them an \nopportunity to have an up-or-down vote on it. People want to vote on \nguaranteeing the right of people who are in management and who are \nworking on assembly lines to get together and talk and work together as \na team, as the whole world is doing now and doing very effectively, and \nas American companies are doing but now they are being stopped by the \nNational Labor Relations Board from doing it. I do not see why we \ncannot have a vote on it.\n  Now, I know that the people who run the AFL-CIO are against it, but I \nam against a lot of things that we vote on every day in the Senate. I \ndo not know what gives them the power to dictate our agenda. I \ncertainly wish we could submit this to popular referendum because most \nAmericans would laugh in your face if you told them that you want to \nprotect the ability of Government to tell employers and employees, \nblue-collar, white-collar workers working for the same company with the \nsame interests that they cannot sit down and talk about safety clothing \nfor pregnant women, about softball teams, and about jointly seeking \nquality.\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\n  It seems to me that is an eminently reasonable proposal. My point is \nwhy not vote on all three of these things? The one I am most concerned \nabout, the one that I have tried now for 14 days in a row to get a vote \non is repealing this unfair gasoline tax, unfair because it does not go \nto build roads; it goes to general revenues. It is being spent, every \npenny of it, on social programs, and we are taxing people who have to \ndrive their cars and their trucks to work to subsidize in many cases \npeople who do not work, and I do not think it is right. I would like to \nhave a vote on it. I would like to be able to cut gasoline prices and \ndo it today. I would like, when people tomorrow go to the filling \nstation, that they look and see that the posted price is down 4.3 cents \na gallon. If we acted today, we could make it happen.\n\n  I just express frustration that we are not allowed to bring it up and \nvote on it. If you are against it, fine, vote against it. We heard the \nSenator from Louisiana say yesterday that he was going to filibuster. \nGreat, I admire that honesty. At least he admits that he is against the \nrepeal. He is not pretending that he is for it and it is just that we \nare not going to bring it up and vote on it. He says, no, he thinks it \nis a lousy idea, he is against it and that he is going to filibuster. \nGreat, let him filibuster. He has a right to do that, but let us bring \nit up. Let us let him talk, and let those of us in favor of repeal \ntalk. And when everybody gets tired, then let us vote.\n  We could have cut gasoline prices 2 weeks ago if we had chosen to do \nit. So I hope when people go to the filling station to gas up the car \nfor the weekend, when they are going to get the kids in the car and the \ndog in the back and go see mama, and they look at that posted price of \n$1.279, I want them to remember that Republican Members of the Senate \nwanted to cut that price 4.3 cents a gallon; when they filled up their \nSuburban with 42 gallons, we wanted to save them about $2. But we could \nnot do it because people who say they are for repealing this tax, who \nare every day in the paper saying, ``Yes, we do not object to it; we \ncould vote for it; the President says he could sign it,'' but, yet, \nthese are the very people that are preventing us from repealing this \ntax and cutting the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  So let me say to Mr. and Mrs. America, when you fill up your tank on \nFriday to go see mama and you look at that posted price, remember those \nwho wanted to cut the tax and remember those who said they were for it \nbut they would not let us vote on it.\n  If you will just enshrine that in your elephantine memories, it will \nserve the public interest and perhaps bring some good to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Ford addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 2337\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order No. 374, \nH.R. 2337, be immediately brought to the Senate floor and taken under \nconsideration.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I would ask to amend that \nunanimous-consent request to say that the bill be brought up and that \nthe gasoline tax be in order and that there be 1 hour equally divided \non the gasoline tax.\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FORD. He objects. Is it not wonderful? If you want something, \nthey object. We want something--``we object.'' It is rather interesting \naround here.\n  What the Senator fails to tell us in his eloquent remarks, his Ph.D. \nphilosophy here, and verbiage--and I am just a country boy from Yellow \nCreek trying to explain my position and I will do the best I can--what \nthe Senator does not tell those who are watching on C-SPAN--and we had \na big story on C-SPAN junkies today; he speaks to them--is that what \nthe Republicans are trying to do is to have all this in one package. \nYou have absolutely locked the minority out, and they cannot amend any \none of those three items that you have talked about today. It is called \nthe Dole gag order. The Dole gag order.\n  Let me quote what the distinguished Senator said, I guess back in \n1993--we all go back to those--when he was frustrated. But he was wrong \nin his frustration. He says, ``But as the distinguished chairman \nknows''--talking about the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--\n``we also have rights.''\n  You said that--excuse me--the Senator said that. I want to be careful \nnot to use improper language.\n\n       One of the rights we have is to refuse to participate in a \n     situation which we believe, though it is totally fair and \n     totally within the rules, creates a playing field on which we \n     believe that we are not capable of getting a fair contest \n     underway.\n\n  That is the language of the Senator from Texas. At that time he had \nthe ability to offer four amendments. Right now we have no time to \noffer any amendments. And it is not, ``Oh, we just want a vote.'' Vote \non what? Vote on a package that you cannot offer an amendment to? They \nhave us locked out. They have us locked out.\n  You know something, this 4.3 cents--look at it. Because it increases \nthe deficit almost $2 billion this year. And there is no offset--no \noffset. To offset it in the language they have, they do two things. \nOver 6 years, they get the $800,000 out of the Department of Energy. \nAnd we have a $2 billion debt this year--deficit. Then they want to \nsell the spectrum. That cannot go into effect until 1998.\n  So we have no ability to amend it to be sure that the consumer gets \nthe 4.3 cents. You say they could--the distinguished Senator from Texas \nsays, ``The consumer could get it.'' If he had been at the hearing in \nthe Energy Committee this morning, he would have found out there is \nnothing we can do. If we give the 4.3 cents back, we create a deficit \nof almost $2 billion, because you do not offset it for 6 years and the \nspectrum sale does not occur until 1998.\n  Now, I have heard about the Gramm-Rudman bill, you know. You ought to \nread what the former Senator, Senator Rudman, talks about, how we \ncannot get together here. That is one of the reasons he left.\n  So the Democrats are the minority in this case. We always want to \nprotect the minority, that is one of the reasons for the rules of the \nSenate. Sure, I can quote the Senator from Texas again: ``We also have \nour rights.''\n  So we have our rights. We want a cloture; we want to have the ability \nto amend. We offered yesterday afternoon three stand-alones, one on the \ngasoline tax, with amendments, relevant. We wanted the minimum wage, \nwith amendments, relevant amendments; and the TEAM Act, with \namendments. That is all. That is our rights. To quote the Senator: That \nis all we are asking for, is our rights.\n  You know something? Ninety-six percent of all the businesses today \nhave committees that get together and talk about the very things the \nSenator says that they want under this legislation. They talk about \nsafety. They talk about that now. Mr. President, 96 percent of all the \nbusinesses have those committees now. If they want to talk about \nhealth, they all could talk about that. But in this bill they eliminate \npresent law, and the employer will appoint the committee. The employees \ndo not have the opportunity to make that selection.\n  You know, we get out here and it sounds so good, and we are so bad. \nIf I had not been on the floor--I think it is kind of unprecedented \nthat you ask for a unanimous consent when the opposite party is not on \nthe floor. I just happened to walk out here and we get a unanimous-\nconsent request. I suspect the Chair may have recognized that, and I \nthink that would have been disastrous, not only for the Senate's \nprocedures but for the Members themselves.\n  So, yes, we are ready to vote on the 4.3-cent tax, but we want to \noffer an amendment to say that the consumer will get it.\n  You go back and listen to the very crafty language of the Senator \nfrom Texas. He says you ``may'' get it. We can save you, but if the oil \ncompanies, when you take off 4.3 cents, add a nickel on, the only \npeople who make any money really, putting more money into their \npockets, is the oil companies.\n  If I represented Texas and big oil, I imagine I would want to do the \nsame thing, but I am here trying to protect the low-income people in my \nState and in this country.\n  When gasoline prices go up and you have no control over it, only 4 \ncents,\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nand the minimum wage does not go up, they are still making the same \namount of money, why do we not have our right?\n  So the choice here is whether we are able to have a question on the \n4.3-cent gasoline tax removal and the ability to amend, that is all we \nask. Then we have--and give a time agreement--and then we have the \nminimum wage. If you want to amend it, well and good. But the majority \nleader gave the Senator from Massachusetts exactly what he asked for. I \ndoubt seriously if the Senator from Texas likes that. I do not imagine \nhe does, but that is a stand alone. If they want to amend it--the other \nside--they can. We are giving them that right.\n  Then on the TEAM Act: stand alone, time limit, but give us an \nopportunity to amend it.\n  My dad used to tell me, ``Son, when you miss a train, stand there \nwith your suitcase and hat and another one will be by.'' What goes \naround comes around. We can fill the tree one of these days, and some \nof the Senators on the other side may just be here --may just be here. \nI understand the rules of the Senate. I understand them very well.\n  So, Mr. President, we want to be sure that an offset is there, and it \nis not there in this bill for 4.3 cents. Just increase the deficit, \nincrease the deficit, increase the deficit. I have been preached to \never since I have been here by the Senator from Texas about balancing \nthe budget. Well, he wants to dig into Social Security, $147 million a \nyear. I am not going to allow that. I have a contract with my senior \ncitizens around the country.\n  I hope he is making a lot of notes on this. I want to hear the \nrebuttal. Probably will be good; probably will be good. I can hardly \nwait. I will wait with bated breath, I guess.\n  Insurance? The insurance bill that was agreed to here I think was \nsomething very good for the retiring Senator from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum. I think it was good that we had bipartisan agreement with \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum joining together and asked we \nhave no amendments. An amendment was offered and it lost. Then you want \nto put conferees on who would say, even though we lost the amendment in \nthe Senate on a vote, we are going to put it on in conference. Sure, \nyou have something to object to. We have our rights. We have our \nrights, and that is what the distinguished Senator from Texas said: ``I \nhave played by the rules in sending up the pending amendment.''\n  So we have our rights.\n  Well, we are going to have a little debate on the budget, I guess \nnow. We did not have a chance to have any input into it. Read the paper \ntoday. It is the Dole budget. You know, it looks like they are reducing \nthe amount of tax cuts, but it is a ``fooler.'' The last budget was for \n7 years; this budget is for 6 years. So you have one-seventh more taxes \ninto that one little frame--6 years.\n  So we have to be very careful. One thing Dad told me, too, ``The \ndevil's in the fine print.'' If you do not read the fine print, you \nmight not understand what you are voting on. That is one reason, I \nthink, that we ought to be sure we understand that if the 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax comes off, we will have almost a $2 billion deficit this \nyear, and this year ends September 30, and it takes 6 years to repay \nit. We cannot even pay for part of it until 1998.\n  We think we ought to have an ability to amend it to be sure that the \nconsumer receives the money rather than ``might save,'' ``might \nreceive.'' The dealer does not have to pass it on. I think that is a \ntrue statement. The oil companies do not have to pass it on. I think \nthat is a true statement.\n\n  So give us an opportunity to amend, to the best of our ability, to be \nsure that the consumer receives the 4.3 cents. That is all we have \nasked. That is all the fairness we want, and I think that fairness is \nwhat the argument is about--not gridlock, not refusing to let you vote, \nbut principle. I intend to stay here and work as hard as I can for \nprinciple and for the rules of the Senate and to operate in the best \nmanner possible. So when you get down to it, that is all that you can \nask for.\n  So I go back and one more time read:\n\n       But as the distinguished chairman knows, we also have \n     rights.\n\n  I am quoting the Senator from Texas.\n\n       And one of the rights we have is to refuse to participate \n     in a situation which we believe, though it is totally fair \n     and totally within the rules, creates a playing field on \n     which we believe that we are not capable of getting a fair \n     contest underway.\n\n  So now I say to the Senator from Texas, all we are asking for is a \nfair contest. I think we have offered you a fair contest--or to the \ndistinguished majority leader. Stand alone, give us an opportunity to \namend. We cannot amend. You have it your way, we cannot get it our way.\n  Fairness in this Chamber is one thing that we have always prided \nourselves on, but when we have a gag order--a gag order--and we are \nunable to amend, then I think we have every right under the \nConstitution and under the ability of use of the rules that we do the \nbest we can.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to our colleague from \nKentucky. I am always enlightened by his views. No one is saying that \nthe Senator from Kentucky, or the distinguished minority leader, or \nevery Democratic Member of the Senate does not have the right to deny \nus the ability to vote on repealing the gasoline tax.\n  I have certainly exercised my right as a minority Member of the \nSenate, when we were in the minority, as much as any other Member. In \nfact, we debated in one form or another the President's health care \nbill for 86 days. As much as any other Member of the Senate, I fought \nit and denied, until we had the votes to defeat it, the ability of the \nmajority to vote on it. But the point is I never denied doing exactly \nthat. In fact, I said in front of God and everybody the Clinton health \ncare bill is going to pass over my cold, dead political body. I said in \nfront of God and everybody, the Clinton health care bill is deader than \nElvis.\n  Mr. FORD. Elvis is not dead.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, when he comes back maybe he could moderate this \ndispute we are having.\n  Mr. FORD. I would rather him than some I have.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, let me put it this way, the point is, for a period \nof time, I was one who helped deny a vote on the Clinton health care \nbill.\n  But the difference between me and my colleagues is I made it clear I \nwas not for the Clinton health care bill. I never intended to see it \npassed. And it will not ever be passed. What I do not understand is all \nthese people who say that they are for repealing the gasoline tax, but \nthey will not let us vote on it.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may just make my statement, then I will yield the \nfloor and let our colleague have it back.\n  Mr. FORD. OK.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will go back to the Budget Committee.\n  My colleague says all they want is an amendment to assure that if we \nrepeal this tax it is passed along to the consumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the gasoline tax bill be the pending \nbusiness of the Senate, that there be one amendment in order, to be \noffered by a minority Member to guarantee a passthrough to the \nconsumer, and that debate on that amendment occur within an hour, and \nthat there then be a final vote on the passage of the gasoline tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, I am considering modifying \nthat to go to the Kennedy minimum wage amendment. What the Senator has \ndone here--and I need to confer with the leader. I am sure you have not \nconferred with Senator Dole as to your unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Senator Dole--reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, I have that time. So I want \nto consider modifying that amendment to add the minimum wage to that \nand under the amendment that was used by the majority leader in his \nproposal that we will vote on cloture at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note there is a pending \nunanimous-consent request. Does the\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\nSenator from Texas modify his request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not going to modify the request.\n  Mr. FORD. Then I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reclaiming my time, the point I want to make is, despite \nour dear colleague from Kentucky saying all he wanted to do was to \noffer an amendment to guarantee that the tax cut was passed through to \nthe consumer, that in fact----\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is not all that the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky wants to do.\n  Mr. FORD. He is quoting me as all I wanted to do was to add an \namendment. That is not true. I said--and I regret that he misunderstood \nme--that we have the right to offer an amendment or amendments--I said \nplural--and that we wanted to be sure that the consumer received the \n4.3 cents and not the big oil companies that he represents.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader said \nyesterday and the day before and the day before that he would look at \nany language the minority had concerning a passthrough of the tax cut \nfrom the filling station to the consumer.\n  In terms of oil companies, I do not think--first of all, I am proud \nof the fact that my State is an oil producer, as I am sure my colleague \nis proud of the fact that his State is the producer of tobacco and \ncigarettes.\n  Mr. FORD. Add coal to that. That is energy.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My point is, the gas tax is collected by filling stations. \nThey collect the tax. And they remit it to the Government. The average \nfilling station in my State collects about $300,000 of gasoline taxes a \nyear. If we want to lower prices, the quickest way to do it is to \nrepeal that tax.\n  Let me touch on a couple of other things here.\n  Our colleague says, 96 percent of companies are engaged in some form \nof joint work between management and labor. That is not the point. The \npoint is, the National Labor Relations Board is now denying companies \nthat ability. What we want to do is to guarantee that workers and \nmanagement on a voluntary basis can meet together and talk about things \nlike safety and health and productivity.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the Senator say that includes collective bargaining \nand wages and hours worked and things of that nature under your \nproposal?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Under the proposal that I am making--I believe in free \nspeech. So I think if people want to get together and talk about any \nlegal act between two consenting adults, they ought to be able to do \nit. It is an amazing thing to me that two consenting adults can engage \nin any kind of activity other than industry, commerce, work, \ninvestment, job creation, but when they try to do those things they \nstand either naked before the world in terms of protection from our \nGovernment or they are impeded. If they want to do any other thing as \nconsenting adults, they have a right to do it. I have never understood \nthat. But there are many things that I do not understand.\n  Finally, I see two of our other colleagues are here. I want to yield \nthe floor, but here is my point. For 2 weeks we have been trying to \nrepeal the tax on gas. It is a simple issue. It is not a complicated \nissue. You either want to repeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax or you do \nnot. I do. A few people say they do not. Most people say they do. But \nyet we do not get a vote on it.\n  I am simply frustrated about it. But I have been frustrated before. \nBut I just hope people will make note of the fact that even though for \n2 weeks we have been talking about it, even though for 2 weeks people \nsay they are for it, for 2 weeks we have not been able to do it. I hope \nthat something can be worked out. I certainly, for my part--this is a \ndecision that will be made by the majority leader and the minority \nleader--but I am perfectly willing to see votes on other issues. I want \na vote on repealing the gasoline tax. I hope something can be worked \nout. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been sitting in on this debate, and \nI have been presiding during part of the time. There are some things \nthat I think should be said at this point that have not been said so \nfar that would be appropriate.\n  It is shocking, it seems to me, the issue of raising taxes is a \npartisan issue. I mean, if you look at the way that the debate is \ngoing, those on the Democratic side are trying to raise taxes.\n  I reread a statement that was made by Laura Tyson who is the chief \neconomic adviser to the President of the United States. I am going to \nquote it right now into the Record.\n\n       There is no relationship between the level of taxes a \n     nation pays and its economic performance.\n\n  If you really believe that, then it is understandable why we are \nhaving the discussion that we are having today. But the difference in \nthe way we treat our attitude toward taxes, between the Democrats and \nthe Republicans, is incontrovertible.\n  In the 103d Congress, under a Democrat-controlled Congress, they had \nthe ``largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in \nAmerica or any place in the world.'' That is a direct quote from \nPatrick Moynihan who at that time was the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not until I am through with my remarks.\n  Mr. FORD. I have a question about that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am kind of slow, and it takes me long to get my train \nof thought back.\n  During that time, it was the first ever retroactive tax increase, in \nother words, we passed a tax increase that went back and imposed taxes \non people who were adjusting their behavior and their activities \npredicated on the existing tax structure at the time. They made it \nretroactive.\n  The third thing they did--the top tax rate increased to 39 percent, a \ndramatic increase. It has been increased again since then to 42 \npercent. The tax on Social Security for many of the senior citizens in \nthis country went up by 50 percent to a total of 85 percent.\n  I believe we need also to make a couple of statements in response to \nwhat has been said about the economy, this glowing economy that we \nsupposedly have right now. I have some figures here that show there is \nno glowing. I know if you say it is long enough, the people will \nbelieve it. Then they will say, ``Well, someone's doing a very good \njob.'' But it is not.\n  Right now, under President Clinton, the economy grew at a slower rate \nin the first quarter of 1996, 2.8 percent, than it did in the first \nquarter of 1992, which was 4.7 percent. There have been lost--this \ncomes right out of the Bureau of Statistics, published on May 3, 1995--\nin that particular year, 17,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in April, \nbringing the total number of jobs lost in that sector to 338,000 since \nlast March.\n  I guess the reason I bring this up is that I am one of those \nindividuals who has read history and who believes that you can increase \nrevenues by reducing marginal rates. We saw this happen in the 1980's, \nduring the decade of the 1980's, when we saw the largest number of rate \ndecreases. We increased revenues substantially. The total revenue that \nwas generated in 1980 was $244 billion for marginal rates. In 1990, it \nis $466 billion. We almost doubled it by reducing dramatically the \nrates.\n  This is not just a Republican concept. President Kennedy, back when \nhe was President of the United States, made a statement, ``It is a \nparadoxical and economic statistic that the way to increase revenue is \nto reduce marginal rates.''\n  It is something we have seen history repeated over and over again. \nYou are not going to increase revenue by increasing taxes. Therefore, \nif we can reduce any of these taxes, we should take this opportunity to \ndo it.\n  As he said, 1993 was the largest single tax increase in the history \nof public finance in America or any place in the world. If you opposed \nthat increase, the largest increase in history, you should be \nsupportive of repealing any part of it. This is just a small part of \nit.\n  I think, also, if you remember what President Clinton said in Houston \nnot too long ago when he was talking to a\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\ngroup of people who were pretty offended by the increases in taxes, he \nsaid, ``A lot of people think I increased taxes too much in 1993. It \nmight surprise you to know that I think I did, too.''\n  I want to help the President. I want to help him reduce the taxes \nthat he admits were too high in 1993. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, a couple of items. The Senator from Texas \n[Mr. Gramm] talked about the payment at the pump, the taxes collected \nat the rack. That is what I thought. I was not sure. I got the \ninformation. So the wholesaler or the distributor collects the tax, and \nit is not the dealer that would be able to give or reduce his price. I \nthought that ought to be brought out here now. I do not want my service \nstation operator to be jumped on when we say you did not get the 4.3-\ncent reduction tomorrow or next week. It is at the rack. So I am trying \nto protect them.\n  My colleagues, as they make these speeches, they leave the floor. I \nhave to give the Senator from Texas a compliment because he stayed here \nand we had a little back and forth. The Senator from Texas is going to \nthe budget meeting, I understand. My figures--and I always stand \ncorrected because somebody will find a way to get at me with words--but \nunder the Republican Budget Committee's mark yesterday, taxes will \nincrease more over the next 6 years than they did over the past 6 \nyears.\n\n  Think about that: $415 billion. Under the Republican budget \nchairman's mark advertised yesterday, taxes will increase more over the \nnext 6 years than they have over the past 6 years. That is $415 \nbillion, if I figure that right.\n  Everybody will say, well, the economy is increasing and all that \nstuff. If it is increasing, give this administration some credit. I \nunderstand the criticism. This has become a Presidential campaign \nChamber. It is not a Chamber dedicated to the people of this country, \ntrying to do the best job we can for them. If we could stop the \nPresidential campaign in the Chamber, I think the overwhelming majority \nof U.S. Senators could get together and pass something in the best \ninterests of the people.\n  We just cannot continue to have the Democrats shut out with a gag \nrule on us. The principle here is not whether we are for or against a \n4.3-cent reduction in gasoline tax. That is not the question. The \nquestion is, we are being eliminated from having the opportunity to \ndebate it and offer amendments.\n  The Senator from Texas said that he could not guarantee they could \ngive them 4.3, or the big oil companies could keep it, or the \nwholesaler at the rack could keep it. It does not have to pass this \nprice on. We just want to have the opportunity.\n  The point of being for or against removal of that tax is not the \nquestion. Fairness is the question, and the ability to have an up-or-\ndown vote and to offer amendments. We have offered stand-alone \namendments and a time agreement on each one of those three. We have \nbeen turned down. We will consider an amendment to get this, but we \nwant to put it in our package. We do not want it outside that package. \nSo the gag rule still is extended.\n  Nowhere, nowhere--we may have filed cloture, but we did not say you \ncould not file amendments. I quoted from the Senator from Texas in 1993 \nwhere he said that he had his rights. That is the same thing I am \ntalking about. Nothing different. When he was fussing then, he had the \nability to offer four amendments under that tree. He had a right to \noffer four amendments. We never excluded anybody from offering \namendments, as is happening to us now.\n  Where is the fairness, Mr. President? All we are asking is for a \nlittle fairness.\n  The gag rule is being applied to the minority. The gag rule is being \napplied to the minority. As long as I have the ability and breath in \nme, I am going to speak out against that, as the Republican side of the \naisle did for so long. I listened to it. We can quote and quote and \nquote what they said and what statements they made, and now we are \ntrying to say the same thing. We never instituted a gag order on the \nminority in all the 22 years I have been here.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is time to repeal the 1993 Clinton gas \ntax increase. On Wednesday, Senator Dole, Senator Gramm and I, along \nwith a number of our colleagues, introduced legislation that would do \njust that. I wish we would have been able to repeal this tax on tax \nfreedom day. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle were unable to agree to the compromise package that Senator Dole \nhad offered them. Today is another day, one in which I hope we will see \nrepeal of the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax.\n  During the 1992 Presidential election campaign, then-candidate \nClinton, when asked about Federal excise taxes, said, ``I oppose \nFederal excise tax increases.'' But as with other views that Bill \nClinton has held, this one was not adhered to for very long. In fact, \nin 1993, President Clinton, as part of a $268 billion tax increase, the \nlargest tax increase in history, embraced a permanent 4.3 cent per \ngallon motor fuels tax.\n  I like to remind my colleagues that President Clinton originally \nproposed a Btu tax, which translated into a 7.3 cent per gallon motor \nfuels tax increase. Just last October, the President admitted to \nAmericans that he had raised our taxes too much. I agree and believe \nthat right now every driver in America also agrees.\n  Last month, gas prices were higher than they had been in a decade. \nThe administration and some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have responded to this crisis by calling for investigation of the \noil companies.\n  Certainly, if there is any price gouging going on, we ought to know \nabout it and we ought to stop it. But, we need to take action now. What \nwe in Congress can do right now is repeal a tax that only adds insult \nto injury for every driver in America, a tax that, again, is part of a \npackage of increases that Bill Clinton himself admits is too high.\n  Last Friday, the Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss the \neffect of the Clinton 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax increase and \nto explore the possibility of repeal. We heard from several \nrepresentatives from industries that are affected by the increase. The \npanel included representatives from the Air Transport Association, the \nAmerican Trucking Associations, the American Bus Association, the \nAssociation of American Railroads, as well as the Service Station \nDealers of America and Allied Trades. These panelists provided our \ncommittee with useful insight to the damaging effect the permanent 4.3 \ncent per gallon motor fuels tax has upon their industry and their \ncustomers. In addition, the American Automobile Association, which \nserves more than 38 million drivers, submitted testimony supporting \nrepeal of the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax.\n  The American Automobile Association said in their written testimony \nthat repeal of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon motor fuels tax restores the \nintegrity to the gasoline tax as a user fee, and it helps restore \npublic trust in the Federal Government and integrity to the Highway \nTrust Fund.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle at the Finance \nCommittee hearing and here on the Senate floor have expressed concern \nthat the tax benefit derived from repeal of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon \nmotor fuels tax would not be passed on to consumers. During the \nhearing, one of the witnesses was Mr. Melvin Sherbert, chairman of the \nlegislative committee of the Service Station Dealers of American & \nAllied Trades. He is also an owner and operator of two Amoco stations \nin Prince Georges County, MD. I asked Mr. Sherbert whether he and other \nservice station owners would pass on the tax benefit from repeal of the \n4.3-cent-per-gallon motor fuels tax. Mr. Sherbert responded, and I \nquote:\n\n       I know that [prices] would go down. . . . The moment we \n     receive [the benefit from repeal of this tax] we would put \n     that on the street.\n\n  The other witnesses at the hearing testified that they too would pass \non the benefit. Since the hearing we have also received letters from a \nnumber of oil companies and industries assuring us that the benefit \nfrom repeal will be passed through to their customers. We\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nin Congress cannot control market prices. But what we can control is \nthe tax burden we impose on the American people. Repealing the 4.3-\ncent-per-gallon motor fuels tax, therefore, will reduce the tax burden \non gasoline and that which the American people must bear. It will also \nsend a clear message from Congress to the industry, that we want to \nkeep prices low for the consumers, and that we are willing to do our \npart. We strongly encourage them to do theirs.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, that when President Clinton \nraised taxes $268 billion in 1993, he said he was raising them on the \nrich. We knew then that that was not true.\n  Now there is no doubt. President Clinton has raised taxes not only on \nthe middle class but also on low-income families, and now my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are denying these low-income families \ntax relief. The truth is, Mr. President, that every person who drives a \ncar, who buys groceries, who takes the bus, the train, or a plane has \nto pay this tax. These are not all rich Americans. In fact, Americans \nwho are hit the hardest by this regressive tax are people at the lowest \nincome levels, those making less than $10,000 a year. Repeal of this \nregressive tax, therefore, would benefit all Americans, especially \nthose with modest incomes.\n  It is a well-known fact that 4.3-cent-per-gallon motor fuels tax not \nonly disproportionately affects low-income people, but it also hits \npeople in rural areas harder than it does those in more metropolitan \nareas. President Clinton knows this. In February 1993, just months \nbefore he signed into law the largest tax increase in history, said:\n\n       For years there have been those who say we ought to reduce \n     the deficit by raising the gas tax a whole lot. That's fine \n     if you live in the city and ride mass transit to work. It's \n     not so good if you live in the country and drive yourself to \n     work.\n\n  Despite this statement, the 4.3-cent-per-gallon-tax increase was \nenacted. I agree with President Clinton's 1993 statement. People in \nrural areas should not be penalized because they live in areas that \nrequire them to use their cars and travel longer distances. For \nexample, in my home State of Delaware, which contains many rural areas, \nthe average family pays $463 in gas taxes per year. This figure \nincludes both State and Federal gas taxes. When the 4.3-cent-per-gallon \nmotor fuels tax is repealed, the average Delaware family's tax burden \nwill be reduced by $48--a good first step.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that the 4.3-cent-per-gallon motor fuels \ntax is no different than other gas tax increases used for deficit \nreduction. I disagree. The 1993 Clinton gas tax increase is different \nfrom other gas tax increases before it. This gas tax increase went, and \ncontinues to go, entirely to the general fund. Unlike in past years, no \nportion of the Clinton gas tax increase goes to the highway trust fund. \nThus, none of this money goes to pay for building and repairing \nhighways. President Clinton and many of my colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle have argued that this tax is going to reduce the \ndeficit. But, in fact, a study released last week shows 44 cents of \nevery dollar Americans paid for the Clinton tax increase did not go to \nreduce the deficit. Instead, once again, Americans' tax dollars went to \npay for more Government spending--for bigger government.\n  The Clinton gas tax increase did not get a single Republican vote \nbecause Republicans believe in cutting wasteful Government spending, \nrather than increasing taxes to pay for more Government spending. So \nwhile in the scheme of Government programs the 4.3-cent-per-gallon \nmotor fuels tax may not seem to be a paramount issue, it represents \nwhat separates Republicans from the big Government spenders. While the \nPresident purports to favor balancing the budget, at best he would do \nso by matching big spending with high taxes. Our belief is that we \nshould cut spending and lower taxes on the American people.\n  Mr. President, it is time to give Americans a break from taxes and \nbig Government. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will allow the Senate to move forward, and stop blocking tax \nrelief for working Americans.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take some time to respond to \na remark made by President Clinton in his press conference Wednesday. \nPresident Clinton said, and I quote, ``I ask the Republicans in \nCongress to consider something else. This is the first time your party \nhas controlled both Houses of Congress at the same time since 1954. \nWhat is the record you will present to the American people and leave \nfor history?''\n  Well, I must say I am glad that President Clinton asked. As chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee, I would like to respond in the area of \ntaxes: this Congress cut taxes. By contrast, when President Clinton's \nparty controlled Congress, taxes skyrocketed Again: we cut taxes. \nPresident Clinton and the 103d Congress raised taxes.\n  Here is a chart that shows what happened to taxes when the Democrats \ncontrolled both the White House and the Congress: taxes increased by \nthe largest amount in history--$268 billion. Now, on the other side of \nthe chart, in green, we see what happened with the Republicans in \ncontrol of Congress--we passed a $245 billion tax cut. But, that was \nvetoed by the same President who signed the $268 billion tax increase.\n  So, our Republican record is of tax cuts--letting Americans keep more \nof what they earn so that they can spend it or save it as they see fit. \nTax cuts that allow businesses to expand, hire more people and pay \ntheir employees more. Tax cuts that allow Seniors to keep more of their \nSocial Security benefits. Tax cuts that allow more Americans to save \ntax free for their retirement, or their first home, or their children's \neducation, or their health care. Tax cuts that end the Tax Code's \npenalty against marriage.\n  President Clinton, tax cuts are the record of this Republican \nCongress. What is the record of President Clinton and the 103d \nCongress? A world record tax increase and a veto of a tax cut. Frankly, \nMr. President, I prefer our record, and I think that most of America \ndoes too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I would add, in addition to his answer to the \nPresident, what has been the record of this Congress. This Congress, \ndespite news coverage and quarrelsome attacks from our opponents, has \nbeen able to change the pattern of Government spending. We just reduced \ndiscretionary spending $23 billion. Most people do not know that. We \nhave put appropriations bills through that actually cut Government \nspending--unheard of in recent years. A little over a month ago we put \nthrough a very significant regulatory reform measure that is going to \nbenefit small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and others who believe \nthat Government regulation, while necessary, ought to be reasonable and \nsensible. We got that done. I am proud to say that we did that one in \nthis body on a totally bipartisan basis. So we can make progress.\n  But, Mr. President, I want to talk today just a few minutes and set \nthe record straight on something called the TEAM Act. Our Small \nBusiness Committee recently held a hearing on the TEAM Act. We heard \nfrom small businessowners who achieved better productivity, quality, \nand safety by involving their employees in workplace decisions. \nFrankly, in the years when I was Governor, we tried to figure out how \nwe could help small businesses improve their productivity. We talked to \nthe best civil and manufacturing engineering and engineering talent \nfrom the University of Missouri at Columbia, and from the University of \nMissouri at Rolla, people who set up the Japanese management style, who \nsaid we could really improve productivity by involving employees in \ndecisions to improve productivity, getting them actively involved in \nteams, not the same as the TEAM Act today, but we used teams. Small \nbusinesses seized on that model, and they were successful and they did \nreduce their costs. They were able to achieve productivity increases, \ngetting better wages, and keeping their jobs because of it.\n  At the hearing that we held in the Small Business Committee, we were \nbringing in people to talk about it, and some of those people had great \nstories. Let me tell you that five other\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\nbusinessowners and their employees who had enthusiastically agreed to \ncome and testify before our committee had to back out. They backed out \nbecause their lawyers said they were crazy, because, if they went in \nfront of a Senate committee and admitted that they had involved their \nemployees in improving productivity, they might be brought up by the \nNLRB for violating the National Labor Relations Act. They were proud of \ntheir accomplishments and proud of what employees had done, working \ntogether with their employers, to improve productivity and their job \nsecurity for the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I think employee involvement has special implications \nfor American small business. By definition, small business employees \nhave to be used in a variety of ways because the small business owner \nhas many duties to delegate and the line between manager and employee \nis much less distinct than it might be in a larger business. The TEAM \nAct is also important because many small employers cannot afford to \nhire a labor law expert or consultant or lawyer each time they want to \ntry something new or to talk with their employees.\n  I can tell you from listening to small employers throughout America \nthat they are scared to death of having another expensive confrontation \nwith the Federal Government. They particularly are afraid of having the \nNLRB come down on them. No small businessowner wants to invest precious \ntime and resources in an employee-involvement system to utilize the \ngood ideas of their employees and then find out it has to be dismantled \nif the union, or the NLRB, gets wind of it.\n  My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, in arguing against \nthis measure, has emphasized that employee involvement is used in many \nbusinesses now. That is probably true. But this does not change the \nfact that many of the employee-involvement teams in existence today may \nactually be in violation of the law as it is written. The argument, I \ngather, that is being made on the other side is that because some \nbusinesses and employees work together and do not get caught by the \nNLRB, they do not need a law. That sounds a little strange to me.\n  Secretary Reich and President Clinton have said we need to encourage \ncorporate citizenship and employment and employee involvement in \ndecisionmaking if America is going to compete globally. It is not just \na question of competing globally. For many small businesses in my \nState, it is a question of competing in the marketplace right now. They \ncan do it. They can provide a better product or a better service for \ntheir customers. But they want to be able to rely on the good ideas of \ntheir employees. The reality of the modern workplace for businesses of \nall sizes is that workers are being given more power, and that is good. \nManagement likes employee involvement because it increases \nproductivity, improves safety, and creates skilled workers. Employees \nlike to work in teams because it gives them a voice both in their \nworking conditions and the quality of the goods or services they \nprovide.\n\n  The National Labor Relations Act apparently right now gives employers \nand managers two options: employee involvement through unions, or no \ninvolvement at all. This means that 90 percent of workers in America \nwho do not belong to a union, or who have chosen explicitly not to \nbelong to a union, are not allowed to have a substantive voice in what \nthey are doing in the workplace. The TEAM Act offers employees who are \nnot unionized a way to participate.\n  Opponents of the TEAM Act have argued that employee teams are really \nsham unions that delude employees into thinking they have power. I must \ntell you sadly that I heard one news report this morning which said \nthat the purpose of the TEAM Act was to permit companies to establish \nunions. That is just not true. That is absolutely false. I do not know \nwho is spinning the story, but they really suckered a news broadcaster \non that one.\n  The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Act, section 8(a)(2) \nto allow employees and managers at nonunion companies to resolve issues \ninvolving terms and conditions of employment. These include things such \nas scheduling, safety and health, even when they get coffee, and \ncompany softball teams, but it does not allow and it would not allow \nemployee teams to act as exclusive representatives of employees or \nparticipate in collective bargaining. In other words, the teams of \nemployees would not have the power of unions. Section 8(a)(2) would \ncontinue to prohibit the domination of unions by the employer. So \nemployers that tried to set up teams of employees to bargain \ncollectively would still be in violation of 8(a)(2) both because they \nare dominating and because of the collective bargaining aspect. It is \nimportant to note that any bad-faith actions on the part of the \nemployer would also result in violations of other parts of the National \nLabor Relations Act, particularly section 8(a)(1).\n  Mr. President, we have seen the National Labor Relations Board. I do \nnot think there is any problem with their being vigilant to make sure \nthat the statutes that will remain on the books are thoroughly \nenforced. I think it is time to give employees and employers a little \ncredit for good sense.\n  Workers are smart enough to know when they are getting a fair shake \nfrom management and to look elsewhere if they are not. Management knows \nthat without meaningful employee involvement the improvements in \nefficiency, safety, and quality simply are not going to be there. \nEmployees and employers must be given the right to choose what is right \nfor them--unions if they want it, employee involvement if they want it, \nor maybe in some circumstances both or neither. We ought not to be \nsaying that employees cannot work in teams with employers or employers \ncannot work with teams of workers when they are not bargaining \ncollectively. Small business owners want to work closely with their \nemployees. These employees have often been there from the inception of \nthe small business. They are the ones who can make it grow. They are \nthe ones who can ensure it prospers. They are the ones who can ensure \nthat it will provide good job opportunities in the marketplace.\n  President Clinton has said time and time again he is a friend of \nsmall business, but the fact that he has already issued the veto threat \nand called the TEAM Act a poison pill shows that simply is not true. He \nis marching to a different drummer. It is not the drumbeat of small \nbusinesses and their employees today who know how they can compete and \nprovide a better product and get more satisfaction from their jobs.\n  America's business needs the flexibility and the legal ability to \ninvolve employees in every facet of business in order to compete with \nlarge businesses, with other businesses and to compete globally.\n  I sincerely hope that we can move to votes on this measure and adopt \ninto law reform, incorporating the provisions of the TEAM Act which \nwill let businesses and employees work together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what we are doing this afternoon is trying \nto move forward to get approval of a piece of legislation, S. 295, \ncalled the TEAM Act--T-E-A-M, TEAM Act.\n  Now, what the TEAM Act says is that it is perfectly permissible for \nan employer to sit down with a group of his employees and say, what do \nyou think is the best way to make this place more efficient? Or how can \nwe make this place safer? Or what can we do to increase our \nproductivity? Now, apparently--and I must say I was stunned to learn \nthis--that is illegal. You cannot do that. Now, of course, it is \nhappening across the country, but if it is discovered it is illegal, \nyou can be hauled up before the National Labor Relations Board.\n  There is something about this that has an Alice in Wonderland complex \nto it. What is going on in the United States of America when an \nemployer cannot say to a group of workers out there, the fellow down \nthe road is producing our product at a lower price and faster than we \nare. What can we do to improve our productivity? And so they give him \nsome suggestions. But it turns out that is against the law. It is \nagainst the National Labor Relations Act which was passed in 1935. So \nwe are held up, ensnarled in an act that was passed 61 years ago.\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\n  So what this act, introduced by the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. \nKassebaum], reported out of the committee, says is that there are \ncertain things you can do. No, you cannot do collective bargaining with \na group of employees like that. That is separate. But certainly you can \nsit down and decide how you are going to increase productivity or how \nyou are going to make the place safer or what can we do to make it more \nattractive to get other workers to come and join with us in this \neffort.\n  That is what this is all about. The mere idea that we need a law to \ndo this seems to me--I must say I never dreamed this would be required. \nFrankly, when they started talking about the TEAM Act, I did not know \nwhat it was and had to have somebody spell it out. So that is why we \nare here today. This is vigorously resisted by the unions, and it is \nvigorously resisted by the administration. The administration has gone \nso far as to say if this law is passed, this TEAM Act, it will be \nvetoed.\n\n  I must say I think that is unwarranted and extremely shortsighted. \nThere are two factors, it seems to me, that make it very important we \npass this legislation. First--and this is no secret to anybody who is \nwatching this or in the galleries or anywhere--American industry is in \nthe fight of its life against competition. We now have a global \neconomy, no question about it. Something made in China or the \nPhilippines or in the Caribbean nations comes into the United States \nand is sold is competition.\n  So we in this country have seen the loss of tens of thousands of \nhigh-paying American jobs. I have seen this regrettably in my State to \na considerable degree. So what this intense competition abroad has \nrequired is for American industry to produce better products at a lower \nprice, increase productivity and be more efficient in every fashion. So \nthis painful but necessary reexamination has required more intensive \nlabor and management cooperation than in the past.\n  The second thing that has taken place--the first is the global \ncompetition. We have to compete or our jobs will not survive--our laws \nhave not kept pace and in many ways impede our progress toward reaching \nthis global competitiveness. Labor law must change just like \nmanufacturing processes must change or cooperation has to be greater. \nAnd that is true of labor laws likewise. Labor laws have to reflect the \nneed for cooperation and teamwork that is critical for our survival.\n  The National Labor Relations Act, as I previously mentioned, was \nenacted in 1935 and has changed very little in those ensuing 61 years. \nUnfortunately, that law is rooted in adversarial--when that law was \npassed in 1933, it was there to take care of a situation. At that time, \nthere was great turbulence in our industries. There was an adversarial \nsituation between labor and management. Indeed, workers were prohibited \nfrom organizing in many States. They were prohibited from going on \nstrike. All of that changed in the early 1930's with the National Labor \nRelations Act and other laws such as that.\n  The act, as I say, has not been adequately changed in the 61 years \nthat have passed, and it does not recognize that now there is a great \ndeal of cooperation that is needed in our factories and workplaces, so \nefforts to increase workplace cooperation were substantially hindered \nin 1992 by a decision called the Electromation case. That was a \nNational Labor Relations Board case some 4 years ago. In that case, the \nNational Labor Relations Board said that employers and employee \ncommittees which talk about attendance--people are not getting to work \non time. What is going on around here? What can we do to increase the \nattendance? We have a lot of people who are not showing up. We have \nsome people who work a 4-day week when they are meant to be here 5 \ndays. What can we do about it? What can we do about no-smoking \npolicies? What do you want? Do you want a separate place to smoke? Do \nyou want no smoking? What do you want? It was decided you cannot do \nthat. You cannot even talk to your employees about what is the best \nsmoking policy or no-smoking policy.\n\n  This act we are talking about today, called the TEAM Act, would \nsimply conform labor law with what is already happening. As I say, all \nacross our country there are, in fact, these committees, and our \nmanagers and our owners of these companies do not realize it is against \nthe law. Indeed, there are some 30,000 of these labor/management \ncommittees across the country. But if any one of them is discovered, it \ncould well be that it is in violation of the National Labor Relations \nAct and could be punished with fines of a very severe nature.\n  It is said that this bill is a threat to labor unions. I must say, I \ndo not understand the rationale for that argument. This bill \nspecifically states in its language that the committees that are \nentitled to be formed under this act cannot negotiate, cannot amend \nexisting collective bargaining agreements. All they can do is talk \nabout better productivity, talk about greater efficiency and matters of \nthat nature.\n  As has been mentioned previously, the hitch is that the law says \nemployers cannot enter into the formation of any organization that \ndeals with these problems that I have mentioned: attendance, \nproductivity, efficiency. This, as I further mentioned, has received a \nvery broad interpretation from the National Labor Relations Board. So \nit makes illegal most of those employee-involvement committees that I \npreviously dealt with and mentioned.\n  What we seek in this act is to have some clear definition of what we \nmight call a safe harbor. What is a safe harbor? A safe harbor is an \narea where the employer knows it is safe for him to enter into \ndiscussions with employees without running afoul of the law. That is \nwhat this is all about. The TEAM Act is this safe harbor. It would do \nnothing to undermine union organizing or collective bargaining. It \nwould recognize and authorize a simple fact of life: Employers are, \nindeed, nowadays looking to their employees more than ever before to \nhelp them, the employers, have a better workplace, a smarter workplace, \na more efficient workplace, a more successful workplace that, \nhopefully, will result in more jobs, not only for those employees and \ntheir families but others across our Nation.\n  This is very simple. It is a good idea that, as I say, I am stunned \nit is causing this furor, this fuss, because it ought to be adopted, I \nthink, unanimously. Democrats and Republicans and unions all ought to \nembrace something that is going to make our country more efficient.\n  I do hope this TEAM Act, S. 295, will be adopted, and I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise again to support the concept that \nworkers are America's most valuable asset. If we are to succeed in the \nnext century, if we are to survive in a world of universal competition, \nwe cannot go into the competition forbidding workers and employers from \ntalking to each other.\n  If the 1960's and 1970's taught us anything at all, it was a lesson \ntaught when foreign competition, especially in automotives and \nelectronics--competition that gained from taking suggestions from the \nproduction floor and incorporating them in the process of the \noperation--almost drove some American businesses under. Suddenly, \nAmerican manufacturers began to replicate this awareness of the great \nresource that employees can bring to business. I watched that happen \nwhen I was Governor of the State of Missouri. I observed as companies \nstarted to develop a sensitivity and how they would increase their \nproductivity in the process.\n  On numerous occasions I have come here to support the TEAM Act, which\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nprovides specific authority for employers to talk to employees, even in \nthe absence of a labor union--specifically in the absence of a labor \nunion--in order to gain the benefit of those employees, their views and \ntheir opinions.\n  A series of cases with the National Labor Relations Board has found \nillegal the contacts between employers and employees on fundamental \nissues like safety, like working conditions, like working hours, like \nflexible work time, something that would help resolve this tension that \nexists between the demand that we seem to have for both parents being \nin the workplace and the fact that we need to raise children in our \nhomes.\n  I believe it is good to say to our companies, ``Talk to your workers, \nget their suggestions, become more competitive, become more productive \nand, as a consequence, help us be survivors in the next century; be \nswimmers, not sinkers, in the competition which we're going to be \nencountering all across the world as those tremendous nations of the \nFar East come on line, nations like China, like Korea, Japan, \nSingapore, Indonesia, tremendous populations which will be very \ncompetitive.''\n  So I believe the TEAM Act is one of those fundamental things that \nAmerica should stand for, and that is working together.\n  This already can happen in union settings. But only one out of nine \nworkers is a union worker in the United States--outside of government--\nand we do not want to tie the hands of eight out of nine of our \ncompetitors by not allowing them the advantage of working together with \nmanagement to improve situations.\n  One of the great examples that has been talked about in this entire \ndebate has been a company named EFCO. It is a company in the State of \nMissouri that makes architectural glass, window wall systems. If you \nbuild a skyscraper that is going to be made out of glass, you order \nglass from someone like EFCO.\n  In the process of their conferring with their workers, they went from \nabout 70 percent on-time deliveries to well over 90 percent on-time \ndeliveries. They improved their performance so substantially that the \ncompany exploded the jobs and literally had lots of new jobs, and that \nis the kind of thing we want to have happen.\n  One of the Senators came to the floor to criticize the EFCO company, \nand in listening to him, I cannot really tell you that it is much of a \ncriticism. But in attempting to criticize the company, he said the \ncommittees met on company property. I think that is nice for the \ncompany to say to employees and their committees that they are \ninterested in helping the employees by allowing them to use company \nproperty.\n  They met during working hours. I think that is good. It did not \nrequire these folks to come back away from their families.\n  He said they had high management officials who attended these \nmeetings. I think it is good when management and workers talk together.\n  He said the committee members were paid for the time spent on \ncommittee work and that EFCO provided any necessary materials or \nsupplies.\n  I suppose that might be an indictment, but it does not sound like an \nindictment to me.\n  But also represented was that somehow these committees were \nestablished in response to union activity. But the conclusion of the \nadministrative law judge, who reviewed the evidence in this case, \nindicated that simply was not so.\n  These committees were started in 1992, and the administrative law \njudge indicated, in his opinion, that there was no ``noticeable union \norganization'' activity until July 1993. The first committee was \nestablished in April 1992 which was 15 months before any noticeable \nunion activity. Besides, the case law states the employer's motivation \nwould be irrelevant in any event.\n  The Senator who came to the floor to criticize the EFCO decision said \nthat EFCO was found to have dominated these discussion groups; it sort \nof had a dark and nefarious tone about it. Let us find out what this \ndomination really amounted to.\n\n  The company set up the committee and said, ``We want to talk.'' I do \nnot find that to be particularly onerous. I think that is really nice. \nSo many companies do not bother to listen to their employees. As a \nmatter of fact, that EFCO set up the committees is a commendation for \nEFCO.\n  No. 2, that Senator said it was pretty bad that EFCO initially \nselected the members of these committees. What a terrible thing that \nis. To get them started they did. What was not said is they wanted to \nhave broad membership and, second, that the employees soon established \na policy whereby they chose their own members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  It sounded pretty bad that the company chose the members until we \nfound out that was just a way to get it started, and then it sounded \nvery generous that the company allowed the employees to select the \nmembers after that. That is more generous than most labor unions that \nunilaterally select employees.\n  Then it was charged that management participated in most of the \nmeetings. It turns out they participated, but they did not vote on \nmatters before these committees. They wanted to participate for \npurposes of discussion and learning. In addition, they attended the \nfirst committee's meeting, but then after that, they only attended by \ninvitation of the workers.\n  Of course, it was then charged that management in some instances \nsuggested issues. I happen to believe that such employee groups would \nwant to hear from management and management would want to hear from the \nemployees.\n  All these things that were said to have been so disastrous seem to me \nlike good, constructive things to do, and that is really why we need to \npass the TEAM Act.\n  This company was hauled into court for asking for the opinion of \nemployees, for letting them express their opinions on company time, for \nproviding a place where they could meet, for providing supplies, papers \nand pencils upon which notes could be taken. That is a throwback to a \nbygone era that we can no longer afford to tolerate.\n  Because this company has provided that it would share not only \ndecisionmaking with its employees but share ownership. Twenty-five \npercent of the company has now been transferred to a special account \nfor employee ownership. I think that is the kind of company we want to \nhave, and it is a shame that this company owner, Chris Fuldner has had \nto spend $64,000 defending himself from having conducted himself so \nnobly. We ought to pass the TEAM Act.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, I believe is on his way, and some others are on the way \nadditionally to visit on our time.\n  My understanding is we are discussing several areas. One is the TEAM \nAct. The other is the proposed reduction of the gas tax. And a third is \nthe minimum wage proposal to adjust upward the minimum wage.\n  All of this, of course, started some weeks ago when some of us \nsuggested it was important to consider some kind of an adjustment in \nthe minimum wage. Those who work at the bottom of the economic ladder, \nthe lower rung of the economic ladder, have not had an increase for 5 \nyears. The minimum wage has been frozen for 5 years.\n  It is easy, I suppose, for some, especially some in this body, \nperhaps to not think much about those who work on minimum wage, not be \nacquainted with those who are trying to live on minimum wage. But there \nare a lot of folks in this country who go to work, work very hard all \nday, are paid the basic minimum wage in this country of $4.25 an hour, \nand at the end of a long week still cannot make ends meet.\n  There is a legitimate reason to question should there be a minimum \nwage, and there are some, I think, in this body who think we should not \nhave a minimum wage. I know there are some in Congress who said \npublicly we should not have a minimum wage, and that is a very \nlegitimate position. I do not share it, but some believe there should \nnot be a minimum wage. They do not bring legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate suggesting we repeal the current minimum wage, but they just \nsay a minimum wage is inappropriate.\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\n  But, by far, the majority of the Congress would say it is appropriate \nto have some minimum wage. Not only does the Federal Government have \nit, but virtually every State has a minimum wage, and some States have \na minimum wage nearly identical to the Federal Government. Some have a \nhigher minimum wage than the Federal Government does.\n  But if you believe there should be a minimum wage, then certainly you \nwould believe from time to time it ought to be adjusted.\n  Among all recent Presidents during their terms, we have had some \nadjustment in the minimum wage. Sometimes it occurs after 4 or 5 years, \nsometimes a little longer. By and large, we do make periodic \nadjustments in the minimum wage.\n  I received a letter from a woman last week, and I will not use her \nname. I will not read it. But I read it last evening because, like most \nMembers of the Senate and the House, I spend my last hours of the \nevening reading and signing mail and going through the substantial \namount of paperwork that we do in the Senate, and I read constituent \nmail and sign mail, sign letters back to them late in the evening.\n  I read this letter late in the evening, and it almost broke my heart. \nIt is a letter from a woman. I am just going to read the last two \nparagraphs, but it is a 4-page letter. She describes her circumstances \nand her husband's circumstances and her children's circumstances, \nmedical problems, problems of not being able to get the education they \nwanted. They tried, but they had to quit school to take care of this or \nthat and getting pregnant, having four children.\n  What she describes in this letter is a rather long list of setbacks \nfrom two people who married very young and struggled and tried to make \nit but without much skill and without much education were always forced \nto take a job at the bottom of the economic ladder and were always \nforced by circumstances, a fire that destroyed their trailer home and \nevery single thing in it, and no insurance, always forced by \ncircumstances like that, just as they started to get ahead a little \nbit, to be completely pushed back to start over.\n  It is a 4-page letter. I shall not read it, but it does break your \nheart to read these kinds of things. And it is not just this woman, it \nis so many people in this country who try very hard to get ahead but \nnever quite seem to be able to do it.\n  She talks about all of her circumstances, and she said:\n\n       I wonder how we can make it like this. How can I tell my \n     children? I wish somebody in some official office would help \n     me tell my boys that they're not going to be able to play \n     baseball this summer because I can't afford a $25 fee for \n     each of them, let alone paying for the baseball glove, the \n     bats they would need to play ball this summer.\n\n  She says:\n\n       We don't spend our money on alcohol or drugs. We don't go \n     out on the town. Our lives revolve on trying to make ends \n     meet. Our dream of owning a home and of being financially \n     secure is long gone. We're better off, I know, than a lot of \n     other people that, for instance, have to live on the street, \n     but how far are we from that? One paycheck? Maybe two? We're \n     the forgotten people in this, called the working poor, the \n     people who fall through the cracks somehow.\n\n  Her point is, after setting out her story in 4 pages, that they work \nfor the minimum wage, both her and her husband, and just cannot make \nends meet. They cannot balance buying groceries, paying the rent, \ntrying to handle child care expenses and paying all their bills at the \nend of the month.\n\n  So some of us think that there should be an adjustment in the minimum \nwage. It ought to be a reasonable adjustment. I am not suggesting that \nwe have an adjustment that is out of line. But I think there is a \nreason for an adjustment.\n  Some people have talked about it for some while. That is one of the \ndiscussions here in the Senate. Ultimately, I think there will be an \nadjustment this year, and I think one that will probably gain some \nbipartisan support.\n  The second issue that was introduced in this discussion was a 4.3-\ncent gas tax reduction. Presumably the 4.3-cent gas tax reduction was \nto draw attention to the fact that a 4.3-cent gas tax was added in \n1993. That is true. I voted for that. I do not regret voting for it. It \nwas included in a long list of tax increases, some tax increases, \nmostly on upper income folks, but some tax increases, spending cuts, \nand other approaches to try to reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  The Federal budget deficit has been reduced in half since that time. \nAnd 4 years in a row the budget deficit has come down. I do not regret \nvoting for that. But would I like to see lower gas prices? Yes, I \nwould. Gas prices spiked up 20 to 30 cents a gallon in recent weeks, \nand as a result of that price spike, we are told now that we should \nreduce the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon.\n  I said this morning, it is a little like treating a toothache by \ngetting a haircut. I do not see much relationship here. The gas price \nspikes up and they say, let us reduce the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon. \nThe industry executives say there is no guarantee it will be passed \nthrough to the consumers at the pump, there is no guarantee that the \nconsumers will see a lower gas price at the pump. ``Experts Say Gas Tax \nCut Wouldn't Reach the Pumps.''\n  Energy expert Philip Verleger says, according to yesterday's paper:\n\n       [This] . . . is nothing more and nothing less than a \n     refiners' benefit bill. . . It will transfer upwards of $3 \n     billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and \n     gasoline marketers.\n\n  If it is not going to go to the consumers--and there are an army of \npeople out there who suggest there is no guarantee this is going to \nresult in a lower pump price--then the question is, who is going to get \nit? And it is not pennies. I know they are talking about from now until \nthe end of the year, but there is a discussion of a 7-year proposal for \n$30 billion. The question is, who divides the $30 billion pie? Who gets \nthe $30 billion?\n\n  The proposal that is before us has a point of order against it. And \nthat brings me to the reason I rose again. The point of order against \nthe proposal is that the proposal violates the Budget Act because the \nproposal that is brought to the floor to reduce the gas tax by 4.3 \ncents a gallon, an act that will not guarantee lower prices at the gas \npump, violates the Budget Act.\n  Why does it violate the Budget Act? Because it increases the Federal \ndeficit in this fiscal year by $1.7 billion. So this proposal violates \nthe Budget Act by increasing the deficit in this fiscal year $1.7 \nbillion. So the next vote that will occur, after the cloture vote at 5 \no'clock this afternoon, will be a vote to waive the Budget Act so that \nCongress can reduce a gas tax that the experts say the consumers will \nnot ever get the benefit of, and in doing so we will waive the Budget \nAct to increase the Federal deficit.\n  I do not know whether others think this is kind of an incongruous \nsituation, at the same time we are talking about bringing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget to the floor of the \nSenate this week--which has now been postponed, I guess--and at the \nsame time the Senate Budget Committee is talking about constructing a \n7-year balanced budget plan, we are also constructing a mechanism now \nto have a vote on waiving the Budget Act in order to allow an increase \nin the Federal deficit in this fiscal year of $1.7 billion in order to \naccommodate a reduction in the gasoline tax that the experts say may \nnever reach the pockets of the consumers.\n  I come from a town of only 300 people. I graduated in a high school \nclass of nine. They might not have taught the most advanced or the \nhighest mathematics available to students in America, but this does not \nadd up. This does not pass the test. Those who say they want to balance \nthe budget require the next vote to be one in which they will vote to \nwaive the Budget Act so they can increase the deficit to create a tax \nbreak that the experts say is not going to reach the consumer. It \nsounds to me like a deal the American people can easily resist.\n  I have heard huffing and puffing and ranting and raving. I have seen \nsidestepping that would befit an Olympic contest out here on the floor \nof the Senate in recent years about the issue of a balanced budget. And \nwe have people who stand up, and they arch their back, and they point \nacross the room, and they say, ``We're the ones that fight for a \nbalanced budget. And none of you cares. You're big-time spenders who \nwant to spend this country into oblivion.''\n\n  Yet, in 1993 the last serious effort to do something to balance the \nbudget, every one of us, every single one of us\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\ncast the votes that were necessary to pass the bill to reduce the \ndeficit, which has brought the deficit down by half, and we did not get \none vote from the other side even by accident.\n  I am not backing away from that vote. I say, I am glad I did it. \nMaybe there are legitimate reasons to be critical of some parts of it. \nI understand that. But I am not somebody who says I wish I had not done \nthat. We did the right thing. But it is an incongruity, it seems to me, \nto decide with the first winds of politics that we should, on the floor \nof the Senate, decide to waive the Budget Act so we can increase the \nFederal deficit this year, to provide a tax cut the experts say will \nnot reach the American people.\n  There is room for disagreement. I mean, we are talking, as I said \nwhen I started, about three different issues, the TEAM Act and the \nminimum wage and the gas tax. There is great room for disagreement.\n  I notice Senator Bennett, from Utah, on the floor. There are few in \nthis institution for whom I have higher regard than the Senator from \nUtah. I think he is a straight shooter and a fellow who calls it like \nit is. There is plenty of reason for us to disagree when we disagree on \nthe merits of issues. I understand all that.\n  We might feel strongly about things and line up and end up on \ndifferent sides of the same question. I think the country would be \nbetter off if on issues like this--and I admit to those who question \nthat there is politics on all sides of this Chamber, and when the \ncharge of politics ricochets back and forth across this room, there is \nplenty of blame to go around. I understand all that. I just observe \nthat the closer we get to the first Tuesday in November of an even-\nnumbered year, the more likely it is that we will be seduced into easy \ndecisions that are fundamentally wrong, that will move this country in \nthe wrong direction. It is the wrong direction to decide now to \nincrease the Federal deficit to accommodate a gas tax that the experts \nsay will not reach the pockets of the American people.\n  I hope as we move along here that we will find a way to not vote on \nthis issue of waiving the Budget Act and increasing the deficit. Maybe \nthis will be withdrawn and we can look where we ought to look: What \ncaused the 20- to 30-percent increase in taxes? We can deal with that. \nMaybe it is simply supply and demand relationships. Maybe it is other \nthings. Maybe those are things we can do something about. I hope we \nstart looking in the right direction and choose the right set of public \npolicies.\n  Mr. President, I notice a colleague is waiting for the floor. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I commend my colleague for his comments on the issue \npending before the Senate. It has gotten so bad it is hard to figure \nwhat is pending before the Senate.\n  I want to comment on two things--what we are trying to do, and a \nlittle bit on the merits of one of the proposals.\n  I said, I guess, 2 days ago the Senate looked like what we were \ntrying to do is mix and match pieces of legislation in order to try to \naccomplish something. It is like a woman who goes shopping for an \noutfit. My wife calls it mixing and matching because she buys a little \nbit of this, a little bit of that, and a little piece over here, and \ntries to put it all together and hope that it comes out in a wonderful, \nexciting new outfit by mixing and matching the different parts. That \nmight be a good concept for buying clothes, but it is a very bad \nconcept for writing legislation.\n  I think that is exactly what the Senate is being asked to do here \ntoday, take a little bit of minimum wage, put it together with a little \nbit of TEAM Act, and stir in a little bit of gas tax repeal, stir it \nup, and hope it comes out as a good legislative package. It kind of \nreminds me in Louisiana of trying to make a gumbo. We put everything in \nthe pot, stir it up, and hope it comes out eventually, after you cook \nit along with something that is edible. The problem is you have to be \ncareful what you put in the pot. If you put something that will not \nfit, it will come out tasting pretty bad.\n\n  The same analogy is true with regard to trying to legislate. There is \nno reason in the world why we should try to be putting a minimum wage \nbill on the back of a gas tax repeal and attach it to this TEAM Act \ndealing with labor-management relationships. There is not a lot of \nrelationship between any of these three provisions, except politics.\n  I said on the floor the other day, and I asked the distinguished \nmajority leader, why do we not just take the bills up and vote on them \nin the normal course of following the Senate rules, debate minimum \nwage, vote on it, pass it if there is a majority for it and kill it if \nthere is not. Do the same thing with the repeal of the gas tax. Let us \ndebate it, let us vote on it, and then decide what the will of the \nSenate happens to be. The same thing on the TEAM Act. Bring it up, \namend it, talk about it, debate it, have the normal rules of the Senate \napply.\n  I think our side has even gone further than that and offered bringing \nthe measures up separately and give up one tool that the Democratic \nside, as members of the minority now, would have as a legislative tool. \nThat is the filibuster. Just bring it up and agree that we will debate \nthese measures and that we will offer amendments, but that we can agree \non a time certain in which to vote, that we will not filibuster if it \nis not going our way, being willing to let us have a vote on these \nlegislative packages. I think that is a pretty generous offer. I \nthought that the majority leader had agreed to that in his press \nconference yesterday but find out later on, no, that is not really what \nhe meant.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why we do not just bring \nthese three bills up and debate them and vote on them, and if we get a \nmajority for them, they pass; if we do not, they do not pass. That is \nsort of the way legislation is supposed to be written.\n  What we are engaged in now is a mix and match proposition where we \nare trying to mix and match things that do not mix and match. I do not \nthink that is the way to legislate. Again, it may be the way to buy \nclothes, but it is not the way to produce legislation that is good for \nthe people of this country. I think they desperately want us to start \nworking in some type of a fashion that makes sense for the rest of the \ncountry.\n\n  The other thing I want to comment on is the proposition that we \nshould repeal the gas tax. There was an article that caught my \nattention this morning, the headline of the Los Angeles Times. The last \ntime I was on the floor I talked about the law of supply and demand, \nwhich I thought really is what should govern this country, as opposed \nto price controls coming out of Washington, DC. What a frightening \nthought it would be to think that Washington will regulate the price of \neverything. I do not think we are qualified to come close to getting \nthat done. Yet I think that, if we are going to say by removing the gas \ntax we will guarantee that people that buy gasoline at the pump are \ngoing to get the benefit of that reduction, the only way we can do \nthat, folks, is very simple, and that is price control. The only way we \ncan guarantee that tax cuts somehow worked their way through to the \nultimate consumer is by passing a law that mandates that. That is price \ncontrol. We have tried that, and it has not worked in the past. It will \nnot work in the future.\n  What does work and has always worked in this country is the law of \nsupply and demand. The headline of today's Los Angeles Times is ``Gas \nPrices Show Signs of Decline as Production Surges.'' ``The average cost \nat the pump falls half a cent, and State officials predict more \nreductions. After lagging, refineries again operating at close to \nnormal output.''\n  That really should not be a headline. That is normally what happens; \nthat is not news. But the law of supply and demand is at work. When the \ndemand is great, the supplies are increased to meet that demand and \nprices adjust according to the ability to meet the demand. That is \nexactly what is happening.\n  I also said 2 days ago that the price of crude oil in this country \nbetween April 23 and May 6 decreased 10 percent. That is over $2 a \nbarrel that oil dropped. It usually takes 30 days from the drop of \nprice in crude oil to be reflected in the finished product at the pump. \nIt dropped 10 percent in 1 week, over $2 a barrel. That, naturally, \nshows up in the normal course of doing business at the pump and lower \nprices. This headline is not a surprise. It is not really news. Yet it \nis the lead story. It\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\nsays ``Gas Prices Show Signs of Decline as Production Surges.'' That is \nwhat has happened.\n  This Congress is in a panic. This Congress is running for cover. We \nare hiding behind our desks trying to say, ``Well, we will fix the \nproblem. We are going to lower the price of gas.'' That is not what \nthis proposition does at all. It only lowers the tax that oil companies \npay per gallon of gas. There is no guarantee that they do nothing more \nwith that than put it in their pocket and take it as an extra profit \nover their normal course.\n\n  The less we get into the business of determining what prices should \nbe for all products, the better off Americans will be. Every time the \nprice of wheat or corn or cotton or rice is going to go up, are we \ngoing to rush in here and say, ``Wait, we are going to regulate the \nprice''? Are we going to go back to production and wage and price \ncontrols? I think not.\n  I want to say from my home State of Louisiana, I think people who are \noutside the thin air that sometimes I think we breathe too much of here \nin Washington are thinking, I think, more sanely and more responsibly \nthan we are here, and less politically. I think they know what this is \nall about. We have a Presidential election, a congressional election in \na couple of months, Senate elections in a couple of months. People are \ndesperately running everywhere they can to try to do something that was \nnot the priority of the people of this country. I think the priority \nwas for us to balance the budget.\n  When they say, ``We want to do something for families,'' I say the \nbest thing we can do for families in this country is to produce a \nbalanced budget. That is what families want, so we will give them lower \nmortgage rates, lower interest rates on home loans, lower rates on \nsending their children to college and educating their families, and \nproduce a more stable environment, make more money available, and add \nto the economy for growth, expansion, and job creation.\n  One of the papers in the State of Louisiana, the Times-Picayune, has \na column written by a guy named Jack Wardlaw, whom I know. The name of \nhis column, I say to the Senator from Utah, is called ``The Little \nMan.'' He always sort of takes the side of the ``little man'' and \nrepresents what is good for the little man as opposed to what is good \nfor the ``big man,'' big business, or the big corporations. His \nheadline in today's paper says, ``Gasoline Tax Cut Will Mean More Red \nInk in the Budget.'' He makes some good points. I will refer to a \ncouple because I think it really says what I think we should all be \nthinking. He says, ``Sometimes it seems like Members of Congress have \nthe attention span of a honey bee.'' It goes on to say, ``Congress has \njust come through months of tedious in-fighting over the national \nbudget, the goal of which we were constantly told was to agree on a way \nto, over a period of years, get rid of the red ink. Now, all of a \nsudden, nobody cares about balancing the budget anymore. All of a \nsudden, the main thing to do is to cut the gasoline tax. Is everybody \ncrazy?''\n  I think that, by asking the question, he sort of also answers the \nquestion himself because of what he thinks we all are about at the \npresent time by our actions. He says, ``It is a little hard to figure \nout what is going on, except that the national news media have been \nexaggerating what is going on. CNN puts on pictures of pump prices of \n$2.09 a gallon, but who is paying that?'' he asks. He points out that, \nin New Orleans, at his neighborhood gas station, the posted price for a \ngallon of unleaded regular was $1.19 a gallon, which had gone up from \naround $1.05 3 months ago. He later passed a convenience store offering \nthe stuff for $1.14 a gallon. ``It appears to me that prices are \ndropping back into line on their own, without any action of Congress.''\n  The same thing in Los Angeles: ``Gas Prices Show Signs of Decline as \nProduction Surges.''\n  This is the marketplace at work. We have had economist after \neconomist--they generally are very nonpolitical--say this is the wrong \nthing to do. This proposal is a dagger to the heart of any effort to \nbalance the budget. It would take over $30 billion out of any effort to \nbalance the budget over a 7-year period. A penny tax per gallon is $1 \nbillion a year. I suggest that we should be concentrating more on how \nwe, in a bipartisan fashion, can come together and do the right thing \nwith regard to balancing the budget.\n\n  I think we clearly do the wrong thing when we do what I think is \nabout to happen, and that is, to make it even more difficult, if not \nimpossible, to reach a balanced budget agreement.\n  Let me close by saying that I have expressed my opinion on the gas \ntax repeal. There are others who will argue that it is the most \nimportant thing we could do. I disagree. Whether we agree or disagree, \nwe should not try to concoct this scenario, whereby in order to pass \none bill, you have to pass another bill, and in order to pass a second \nbill, you have to pass a third bill. Let us take them up separately, \ndebate them on the merits. Let us consider and hear amendments that \nwould be offered through these pieces of legislation. Perhaps the \nproposals can be improved by serious amendments that would be offered. \nBut let us vote on the bills. Let us vote on the minimum wage. Yes, let \nus vote on the TEAM Act. Yes, let us vote on the repeal of the gas tax.\n  What is wrong with taking up legislation, considering bills that have \nbeen offered, debating them? I think I signed an offering to do this \nwithout the use of the filibuster. It is a most generous offer--\nincredibly generous. Look, we are in the minority, and we are not going \nto filibuster. We can take it up and vote on it. Why try to mix and \nmatch? Maybe that is good when buying clothes, but it is very bad when \ntrying to write legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate. A bad bill \ncannot be made good by adding another good bill to it. It still is, in \nessence, a bad bill. The converse is also true.\n  So my suggestion is, let us follow the proposal of the leaders on \nthis side of the aisle to take these pieces of legislation up, debate \nthem, consider them, vote on them, and move on with what I think is a \npriority in this Congress: to try to reach a bipartisan balanced budget \nagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we are under a time \nagreement, and we will be voting at 5 o'clock. The time has been \ndivided earlier today. As I understand it, there are 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator is correct. The \nminority has 43 minutes 36 seconds. The majority has 57 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from New \nYork, who would like to address the Senate as well. I will take 15 \nminutes, and then whatever other time is available I will yield to the \nSenator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 15 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the past several weeks, we have seen \nthe majority in the Senate and the House use every parliamentary trick, \nevery legislative gimmick, every inside-the-beltway tactic they could \nconjure up to avoid a vote on increasing the minimum wage.\n  At the same time, particularly when they were outside the beltway, \nthey talked about helping America's working families make ends meet. It \nis not enough to say you care about working families, and it is \ncertainly not enough to concoct a so-called alternative proposal that \nwould raise taxes on 4 million of our lowest paid workers. The majority \nmay think they can fool the American people, but the only people fooled \nby the Republican magic tricks are the Republicans themselves. The \nAmerican people cannot be fooled by legislative sleight of hand. They \nwant an increase in the minimum wage, and they want it now.\n  While Republicans in Congress complain that increasing the minimum \nwage is a political issue, the American people know that it is an issue \nof fundamental fairness. The American people know that the time has \ncome to raise the minimum wage and make work pay for millions of \nworking families. The American people know that inflation has eroded \nnearly all of the bipartisan 1989 increase in the minimum wage. The \nAmerican people know that the minimum wage is about to reach its lowest \nreal value in 40 years. The American people know that there\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\nare minimum wage workers who work 40 hours every week, yet their \nfamilies live in poverty. The American people know that refusing to \nraise the minimum wage is wrong, it is unfair, it is unjust, and it \nshould not continue.\n\n  Nearly every national survey finds overwhelming support for raising \nthe minimum wage. A national poll conducted in January 1995 for the Los \nAngeles Times found that 72 percent of Americans backed an increase in \nthe wage. That survey confirmed the results of a December 1994 Wall \nStreet Journal/NBC News survey, which found that raising the minimum \nwage is favored by 75 percent of the American people. A poll for ABC \nNews in January 1996 found that 84 percent of the American people \nsupport a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. Other recent polls confirm \nthat support for an increase in the minimum wage now stands at nearly \n85 percent.\n  This support cuts across political parties. It cuts across gender and \nage lines. It cuts across ethnic and racial groups. In every segment of \nour society, in every region of our country, a large majority of \nAmericans want the minimum wage to be a living wage. No one who works \nfor a living should have to live in poverty.\n  Another measure of broad support for raising the minimum wage is the \nlarge number of editorials from newspapers across the country \nsupporting a higher minimum wage. Here are a few of the editorials.\n  Here is a New York Times editorial of April 5, headlined, ``Boost the \nMinimum Wage:''\n\n       There is a strong case for raising the minimum wage by a \n     modest amount. Unfortunately, the issue is caught up in \n     election-year politics, making compromise unlikely. . . .\n       The Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage over two \n     years to $5.15 an hour, which would raise earnings for these \n     workers by 90 cents an hour, or about $1,800 a year. Even at \n     $5.15, the minimum wage would, after taking account of \n     inflation, remain 15 percent below its average value during \n     the 1970's.\n       Will low-paid workers lose their jobs if employers must pay \n     higher wages? Yes, but there is widespread agreement among \n     economic studies that the impact would be very small. A 90-\n     cent wage hike would probably wipe out fewer than 100,000 of \n     the approximately 14 million low-paid jobs in the economy--\n     less than a 1 percent loss. Indeed, 100,000 represents only \n     about half the number of jobs the economy typically creates \n     each month.\n\n  And the editorial goes on.\n  The Washington Post headline: ``The Minimum Wage'':\n\n       The purchasing power of the minimum wage is about to fall \n     to its lowest level in 40 years. The last time Congress voted \n     to increase it was in 1989. It is time--you could argue well \n     past time--to do so again.\n       President Clinton has proposed to raise the minimum 45 \n     cents in each of the next two years, to $5.15 an hour. That's \n     a one-fifth increase, and no such step is ever cost-free. It \n     would have a broad effect on wages, not just those at the \n     minimum but those in the zones immediately above, and it \n     would add to the pressures on smaller businesses \n     particularly to cut costs in order to survive. But the \n     president is proposing to restore the wage, not break new \n     ground. In real terms, it would remain well below the \n     levels that obtained from the 1960s through the early \n     1980s, and would be only a dime above the level to which \n     George Bush agreed, and Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich voted \n     for, in 1989.\n\n  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, its headline is ``Workers Due for a \nRaise'':\n\n       President Clinton has picked a good time politically and \n     economically to push for a modest increase in the minimum \n     wage. Millions of workers need the raise, and the economy is \n     healthy enough to absorb a hike without causing many job \n     losses or inflation.\n       The administration and congressional Democrats want to \n     raise the minimum wage to $5.15 in two 45-cent steps over the \n     next two years.\n       A raise would help the 4 million workers who get the \n     minimum of $4.25 an hour, and would nudge up the wages of \n     another 8 million who earn between $4.26 and $5.14 per hour. \n     The minimum wage hasn't been raised in five years. In terms \n     of purchasing power, the wage will fall to a 40-year low this \n     year if Congress doesn't act.\n       Such low pay for workers puts a strain on society. Making \n     about $8,500 a year, a full-time minimum-wage worker with \n     children needs food stamps and welfare to survive. The \n     poverty line for a family of four is $15,600 a year which \n     means a worker would have to make at least $7.80 an hour to \n     keep a family out of poverty.\n\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch headline: ``The Politics of 90 Cents an \nHour.''\n\n       President Bill Clinton made some interesting observations \n     the other day about Congress' failure to raise the minimum \n     wage. He pointed out that since the last time the federal \n     minimum went up--five years ago on Monday--senators and \n     representatives have increased their own salaries by about \n     one-third. He also noted that a member of Congress made more \n     money during the month that the government was shut down last \n     year than a minimum-wage earner makes in an entire year.\n       Add those stark statistics to the more philosophical \n     point--that the GOP majority always stresses the need for \n     people to make it on their own, without the help of \n     government--and the Republican roadblock to raising the \n     minimum wage becomes even harder to swallow. At $4.25 an \n     hour, a full-time worker earns less than $8,900--far below \n     the $15,600 poverty line set for a family of four. How can \n     politicians try to push families off the welfare rolls on the \n     one hand and filibuster attempts to let them earn a livable \n     wage on the other?\n\n  The San Francisco Chronicle, ``Rewarding the Work Ethic.''\n\n       The minimum wage is approaching a 40-year low in terms of \n     its purchasing power.\n       For those fortunate enough to have no idea what the minimum \n     wage is these days, it is $4.25 an hour. It has been at that \n     level for five years, while inflation has steadily gnawed \n     into the paychecks of workers at the lowest rung of \n     compensation.\n       President Clinton has proposed a modest increase of the \n     minimum wage to $5.15 an hour.\n       Unfortunately, the Clinton plan has become mired in \n     election-year politics. Republicans have characterized the \n     proposal as a big favor to organized labor that would cost \n     jobs and mostly benefit middle-class teenagers.\n       Wrong, wrong and wrong.\n       Yes, organized labor is supporting the minimum-wage \n     increase, but this is hardly a bonanza for unions. At most it \n     would have a slight indirect effect on collective bargaining, \n     as union negotiators try to keep rank-and-file pay above the \n     minimum wage.\n\n  The St. Petersburg Times, ``Let's Vote on Minimum Wage.''\n\n       Now that he has clinched the Republican nomination for \n     president, Bob Dole is back at work in the Senate. Last week \n     the Senate majority leader spent most of his energy trying to \n     keep Democrats from bringing a proposed minimum wage increase \n     to a vote.\n       Dole should end the debate and allow senators to vote. \n     Democrats say they will keep trying to force a vote. Everyone \n     knows a minimum wage increase has little chance of clearing \n     the House. But that hasn't kept either side from trying to \n     score political points on this issue.\n       Disregard for the country's poorer workers, those who try \n     to live on an annual salary of $8,500, is one of the \n     hallmarks of the Grand Old Party. As usual, opponents of a \n     minimum wage increase claimed they were acting in the \n     interests of the working poor. Allowing those workers another \n     90 cents per hour, they argued, actually could do them more \n     harm than good.\n       Similar arguments have been made against every previous \n     increase in the minimum wage, and each has been proved wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nSeattle Times and all of those editorials to which I have referred be \nprinted in the Record in their entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Seattle Times, Apr. 5, 1996]\n\n               Help the Working Poor, Raise Minimum Wages\n\n       Presidential politics threaten an overdue 90-cent increase \n     in the federal minimum wage. As Republicans and Democrats \n     argue over who is the greater champion of the working poor, \n     the buying power of their paychecks wheezes near a 40-year \n     low.\n       The current $4.25 hourly wage, which was last increased in \n     1989, is earned by four million Americans, and another eight \n     million workers range up to the proposed $5.15.\n       Republicans are loath to help Clinton fulfill a 1992 \n     campaign pledge, and Democrats want to scorch Dole for \n     raising his own congressional pay, and not the incomes of \n     those whose full-time jobs only bring in $8,500 a year. . . .\n       Seven years ago another 90-cent increase was a largely \n     nonpartisan event, with Dole, Georgia congressman Newt \n     Gingrich and most all Republicans voting for the first \n     increase since April 1981.\n       Over the years, the economic facts of life have drained the \n     issue of ideological force. Americans have overwhelmingly \n     supported the concept of a minimum wage since its creation in \n     the Great Depression. Current polls show strong support for \n     efforts to help poor people willing to work.\n       Liberal and conservative economists agree that moderate \n     increases in the minimum wage have a negligible effect on \n     employers or the number of low-paying jobs available, \n     especially in the service industries where they are \n     concentrated. Most minimum-wage workers are over age 20, and \n     40 percent are the sole breadwinner in their family, \n     according to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.\n       Increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 is no windfall; that \n     is 15 percent below the wage's buying power of the 1970s. \n     (Today a worker\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n     has to earn $7.80 an hour to even reach the federal poverty \n     line of $15,000 for a family of four.)\n       Raising wages takes on added importance if the Republican \n     Congress follows through on plans to cut the Earned Income \n     Tax Credit, which holds the working poor harmless from income \n     and payroll taxes. The EITC, a favorite of former President \n     Reagan, has been denounced by House Ways and Means Chairman \n     Bill Archer, R-Texas, as just another welfare program.\n       One advantage of the minimum wage is that it puts money in \n     people's pockets quicker and throughout the year. EITC is a \n     vital supplement, but it is a one-time payment geared to tax \n     season, and people who file returns.\n       The twin helping hands of a higher wage and the EITC \n     recognize the effort millions of Americans are making to help \n     themselves.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 5, 1996]\n\n                         Boost the Minimum Wage\n\n       There is a strong case for raising the minimum wage by a \n     modest amount.

Yes, but there is widespread agreement among \n     economic studies that the impact would be very small. A 90-\n     cent wage hike would probably wipe out fewer than 100,000 of \n     the approximately 14 million low-paid jobs in the economy--\n     less than a 1 percent loss. Indeed, 100,000 represents only \n     about half the number of jobs the economy typically creates \n     each month.\n       The benefits of a higher minimum wage would be substantial. \n     At $4.25 an hour, minimum-wage workers cannot count on \n     earning their way out of poverty. But at $5.15 an hour, or \n     $10,700 a year, the goal is in reach. By combining earnings, \n     food stamps worth about $3,000 and tax credits of $3,500, \n     such workers can clear the poverty threshold for a family of \n     four--about $16,000--even after payroll taxes. That would be \n     a victory for public policy.\n       The best antipoverty strategy is to mix the tax credits and \n     minimum wages. At President Clinton's urging, Congress \n     recently raised the [Earned Income] tax credit. The next step \n     is to raise the minimum wage by the modest amount the Senate \n     Democrats have proposed. The Democrats should try again. \n     Republicans supported such policies in the past. perhaps \n     Senator Dole can summon the will to do so this election year.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       [From the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Apr. 3, 1996]\n\n                        Workers Due for a Raise\n\n       President Clinton has picked a good time politically and \n     economically to push for a modest increase in the minimum \n     wage.

Last week, \n     in a 55-45 roll call, Democrats in the Senate fell five votes \n     short of forcing a vote on an amendment to boost the wage. In \n     other words, most senators wanted to increase the wage, but \n     GOP leaders blocked the vote.\n       Republican reasons for opposing the wage increase are weak. \n     If the country were in a recession, blocking the raise would \n     make sense because higher labor costs could cause more \n     unemployment. Certainly, a higher minimum wage is not always \n     a good idea: Timing is important.\n       But this is the right time. In today's economy, low-wage \n     jobs are being created at an incredible pace. The \n     unemployment rate is at a mild 5.5 percent and inflation last \n     year ran at just 2.5 percent.\n       Several highly respected economic studies in recent years \n     have suggested that few jobs would be lost if the minimum \n     wage were to rise slightly. Robert Solow, a Nobel prize-\n     winning economist, says that among members of the American \n     Economics Association, a consensus has emerged that ``the \n     employment effect of a moderate increase in the minimum wage \n     would be very, very small.''\n       Polls show that about three in four Americans want the wage \n     to rise. Republican senators, whose pay has increased by a \n     third over the past five years, ought to get out of the way \n     and allow the majority to increase the minimum wage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Apr. 2, 1996]\n\n                    The Politics of 90 Cents an Hour\n\n       President Bill Clinton made some interesting observations \n     the other day about Congress' failure to raise the minimum \n     wage.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that, \n     measured in current dollars, the value of the minimum wage \n     has fallen 31 percent since 1979.\n       At the same time, the percentage of hourly wage earners who \n     make the minimum has also declined, meaning that an increase \n     would affect proportionately fewer workers.\n       Opponents of the increase often portray the typical \n     minimum-wage worker as a teen-ager peddling french fries to \n     earn gas money for his car.\n       But Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich points out that most \n     such employees are age 20 and over, and 40 percent of them \n     are the only wage earner their family has.\n       Given such facts, the strong support that pollsters find \n     among Americans for raising the minimum wage is \n     understandable. Harder to fathom is Republican opposition. \n     The traditional GOP argument, that a higher minimum wage \n     means smaller payrolls, has lost credibility; a study by two \n     Princeton professors of the effects of a higher minimum in \n     New Jersey showed no drop in employment at 331 fast-food \n     restaurants.\n       Bob Dole and his Senate colleagues can stick to that tired \n     logic if they want, but it only highlights the differences in \n     philosophy and compassion between him and Mr. Clinton.\n       The majority in the Senate blocked the increase last week, \n     but when Congress returns from its spring recess, the issue \n     will return, too. As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt \n     put it, ``We're going to bring it back and back and back and \n     back until we finally prevail for America's families and \n     workers.'' Those families and workers are also voters, and \n     come November, they won't forget who stood in the path to a \n     decent wage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Apr. 8, 1996]\n\n                        Rewarding the Work Ethic\n\n       The minimum wage is approaching a 40-year low in terms of \n     its purchasing power.\n       For those fortunate enough to have no idea what the minimum \n     wage is these days, it is $4.25 an hour.

Of the 10 million \n     people earning $4.25 an hour, 69 percent are age 20 and \n     older.\n       It is, indeed, a tough living. Ninety cents an hour--or \n     $1,800 a year for a full-time worker--can make a difference \n     for someone at the poverty line.\n       Politicians like to talk about restoring the work ethic, \n     about encouraging people to leave public assistance. Millions \n     of people are answering the call--and getting too little in \n     return.\n       Congress should vote them a raise.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Apr. 1, 1996]\n\n                       Let's Vote on Minimum Wage\n\n       Now that he has clinched the Republican nomination for \n     president, Bob Dole is back at work in the Senate. Last week \n     the Senate majority leader spent most of his energy trying to \n     keep Democrats from bringing a proposed minimum wage increase \n     to a vote.\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\n       Dole should end the debate and allow senators to vote. \n     Democrats say they will keep trying to force a vote. Everyone \n     knows a minimum wage increase has little chance of clearing \n     the House. But that hasn't kept either side from trying to \n     score political points on this issue.\n       Disregard for the country's poorer workers, those who try \n     to live on an annual salary of $8,500, is one of the \n     hallmarks of the Grand Old Party. As usual, opponents of a \n     minimum wage increase claimed they were acting in the \n     interests of the working poor. Allowing those workers another \n     90 cents per hour, they argued, actually could do them more \n     harm than good.\n       Similar arguments have been made against every previous \n     increase in the minimum wage, and each has been proved wrong.\n       The proposed legislation would raise the $4.25 minimum wage \n     by 90 cents in two increments over 15 months. That may be \n     small change in Washington, but to those trying to live on \n     the minimum wage, who earn about three quarters of the \n     $12,500 income that marks the federal poverty level, another \n     90 cents an hour is real money.\n       Dole says he is a doer, not a talker. Fine. Stop the debate \n     and bring the issue to a vote. It's time to raise the minimum \n     wage.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, these are typical editorials from across \nthe country, and they go on and on and on with the two themes that, \none, it is time to act it is time to act here in the Senate now; and it \nis also an issue of fairness and decency north, south, east, and west.\n  Mr. President, with this depth and breadth of support among editorial \nboards for a higher minimum wage, and the broad support among voters \nfor a higher minimum wage, the question is obvious. Why are Republicans \nobstructing action on the minimum wage?\n  Every day Congress fails to vote on this issue is one more day that \nmillions of hard-working Americans have to survive on less than a \nliving wage.\n  While Americans sit around their kitchen tables trying to pay their \nbills, Republicans in Congress are huddled in back rooms plotting new \nparliamentary maneuvers to duck their responsibility to America's \nworking families.\n  The people are ahead of the politicians on this issue. While the \nRepublican majority in Congress dithers and delays, working men and \nwomen across the country are waiting for our answer.\n  Republicans love to talk about work. But when the chips are down, \nthey deny the value of work. They refuse to support a fair day's wage \nfor a full day's work.\n  One of the biggest issues of 1996 is the declining standard of living \nfor the vast majority of American families. The economy may be doing \nwell, but the gains are flowing primarily to those at the top. The vast \nmajority of Americans are being left out and left behind, and those at \nthe bottom of the ladder are being left the farthest behind.\n  Millions of working families are struggling to survive on the minimum \nwage, which is now only $4.25 an hour. They have not had a pay increase \nin 5 years. The value of the minimum wage is now near its lowest level \nin 40 years. It is no longer even enough to keep a working family out \nof poverty.\n  Republican Senators have voted themselves three pay increases in that \n5-year period--thousands of dollars in pay raises for themselves, but \nnot one thin dime for families struggling to survive on the minimum \nwage.\n  How can the majority leader keep saying no? Raise the minimum wage. \nNo one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.\n  We want a vote--a clean, yes or no, up or down vote on increasing the \nminimum wage.\n  The American people look to the Congress for action on the minimum \nwage--and all they see are cloture petitions, quorum calls, and \nprocedural gymnastics to avoid taking action. I say, end the gridlock, \nend the deadlock--act on the minimum wage. Let's get the Senate out of \nthe Doledrums.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I inquire of my distinguished \ncolleague with respect to the time?\n  There was some thought earlier that some additional time might be \nyielded from that side to this side. I wonder if I could ask for 10 \nminutes such that I do not inconvenience my colleagues at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nknows that I have just come to the floor to speak and do not control \ntime. But I see no other Senator on this side seeking to speak. If my \nfriend from Virginia wants 10 minutes, I would be happy to, and I will \nassume the position that I can yield that time and would be honored to \ndo so with the understanding as I shall listen with close attention to \nwhat he says for 10 minutes, that he might undertake to do the same.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I propose to discourse at some length on Alfred \nMarshall's ``Principles of Economics'' published in 1890.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might follow my \ndistinguished colleague. I would profit greatly from the erudition that \nI assume will be displayed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the erudition is from Alfred Marshall, \nnot of this poor student of his or his successor three times removed.\n  Mr. President, it fell to me, then chairman of the Committee on \nFinance, to reach agreement on our Democratic side on the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993. There was no Republican involvement \nand no Republican support, for perfectly straightforward reasons. It \nfell to me to negotiate among ourselves the 4.3-cent increase in the \ngasoline tax which is suddenly under discussion today. The President \nhad originally proposed an increase in the Btu tax. And I suppose it is \nnot inappropriate if I am going to be speaking from Alfred Marshall's \ntext, he having been a distinguished professor in Great Britain, to \nrefer to the Btu, which stands for ``British thermal units.''\n  The House voted a larger Btu tax increase, but the matter came to the \nSenate, and there was no disposition here to address the general range \nof energy uses--that involved coal and gas and other sources of \nenergy--as against simply gasoline.\n  It was not easy to reach agreement on the 4.3 cents. That was the \nlast part of the budget deficit reduction that we had to put together, \na total reduction of $500 billion, half of it by raising--I will use \nthat dread word ``taxes''--not fees, not premiums--taxes, and a \nsomewhat smaller proportion from reducing, cutting, and, in many cases, \neliminating Federal programs.\n  The last bit we had to get was that 4.3 cents. We had to get up to \n4.3 to reach our $500 billion mark. I record this simply to say it was \nnot easy. It took 1 week with the Finance Committee Democrats in room \n301 of this building, some of the longest days I have spent in the \nSenate. In the end we did it because it had to be done. And we have \nresults to show for it.\n  So much of what happens in Government, as in other aspects of life, \nhas indistinct or very long-run consequences not easily seen. To the \ncontrary, today, the American economy is the wonder of the world. There \nis no nation in the OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, formed just after World War II, that comes anywhere close \nto our rate of growth, our unemployment rate, our price stability, and \nthe long, sustained period of growth which we are in.\n  We are now, sir, as of May, in the 63d month, more than 5 years, of \ncontinued economic expansion--not the longest, as in the 1960's, but \nsomething that would have been considered beyond imagining 50, 60, 70 \nyears ago.\n  The budget deficit, Mr. President, has been cut in half. The numbers \nare astounding. We went from a budget deficit of $290 billion in 1992--\nthese are fiscal years--to what, if you average out OMB, which says \n146, and CBO, 144, is a deficit of $145 billion in the current year.\n  Half--we have cut it in half in 4 years. The deficit now is the \nlowest, in proportion to our annual gross domestic product, it has been \nin 15 years.\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n Real growth rate is at a solid 2 percent, which is very impressive, \ngiven the fact that we have full employment and no inflation.\n  Our distinguished Director of the Congressional Budget Office--and I \napologize for the initials CBO--Dr. June O'Neill, recently testified \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee:\n\n       CBO continues to believe that the U.S. economy is \n     fundamentally sound and estimates that the chances of a major \n     downturn in the next two years are not high.\n\n  Now, one of the reasons things are very good is that we did what was \ndifficult to do in 1993, and we did it on our own on this side of the \naisle. We are not complaining whatever about that. If it was to be our \nbudget, let us do it. I could wish it was bipartisan. It was not. But \nthat has nothing to do with the fact we found 50 votes here plus the \nVice President. It was close. And that last tenth of a cent on the \ngasoline tax did it.\n  In January 1994, our eminent Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nAlan Greenspan, testified before the Joint Economic Committee as \nfollows:\n\n       The actions taken last year--\n\n  Referring to our budget deficit reduction measure with the gasoline \ntax.\n\n     to reduce the Federal budget deficit have been instrumental \n     in creating the basis for declining inflation expectations \n     and easing pressures on long-term interest rates. . . What I \n     argued at the time is that the purpose of getting a lower \n     budget deficit was essentially to improve the long-term \n     outlook, and that if the deficit reduction is credible, then \n     the long-term outlook gets discounted upfront. Indeed, that \n     is precisely what is happening.\n\n  The term, sir, is the deficit premium on the interest rate, the \nexpectation upfront that inflation will increase so that interest rates \nwould be higher than they otherwise would be. They are now down. And \nthat added another $100 billion of deficit reduction.\n  That is how we were able to cut the deficit in half. Do we have \nproblems in the outyears? Indeed, we do. But are we on the right track \nnow? Indeed, we are. Unemployment for April was 5.4 percent. That is \nroughly full employment in our present jargon. Inflation is in check. \nThe Consumer Price Index, which overstates inflation, is at 3 percent--\nsomething unprecedented -- and real wages and salaries increased in the \nfirst 3 months of this year by 1 percent, a very handsome rate.\n  One of the consequences, Mr. President--and I hesitate to use another \nchart on the Senate floor, but this one, I think is important. The \npublic is watching and my colleagues might find it interesting. For the \nfirst time, sir, since the 1960's, the Federal budget has a primary \nsurplus. A primary surplus is the difference between revenues and \noutlays for programs.\n  I came to Washington in 1961 with the Kennedy administration, and I \ncan report something that may have been lost to the memory of many of \nus. Our biggest problem as then seen by the economic advisers to the \nPresident was that the Federal Government was taking in more money than \nit was spending and hence depressing our move toward full employment. \nThe term was ``fiscal drag.'' The efforts to get Federal revenues out, \nback into circulation, were extraordinary.\n  I can recall my first visit, the first time I was ever in the Oval \nOffice. It was with the beloved Secretary of Labor, Arthur Goldberg, \nand we were bringing to the President a proposal to increase the pay of \npublic servants, postwar and such. And the President looked at our \nproposal and said, ``Is that all?'' Walter Heller, the chairman of the \nCouncil, said, oh, surely we need to do more than that; he added up the \nnumbers on the page, just like that.\n\n  We were about to propose revenue sharing. If Congress would not spend \nthe money, perhaps Governors would. I am not speaking lightly of what \nyou spend, but there is such a thing as seeing that you do not keep the \neconomy depressed by taking in more revenue than goes back into the \neconomic stream. In the 1960's we had those surpluses. Those blue marks \nindicate a slight surplus, primary surplus, not big, but big enough to \npreoccupy us.\n  Then we had the oil crisis of the 1970's and deficits came. Then the \n1980's and deliberate deficits of enormous amounts and the debt that \nwent from $995 billion at the end of fiscal year 1981 to where we just \nnow, just recently, raised the debt ceiling to $5.5 trillion. We added \nalmost $5 trillion to our debt. The debt is huge and the interest has \nto be paid and it will be. But in the meantime, if you can look at this \nchart, we are back to a primary surplus--we did a good job in 1993--a \nprimary surplus averaging about $66 billion for the next 4 years. A \nlittle good news does not do any harm, sparingly. And this is solid \ngood news.\n  Now, suddenly, we are asked to dismantle that last, painful mile we \nhad to travel in 1993, that 4.3 cents. It took 1 week to get from 4 \ncents to 4.3 cents and then bring it to the floor where it passed just \nbarely, with the remarkable results we now see.\n  If a reasonable case could be made that to eliminate this gasoline \ntax right now would save consumers money, then it should be considered. \nSome have tried to make that argument. But it is simply not the case \nthat there should be any expectation whatsoever of any impact on \ngasoline prices from a reduction of this tax, because the present spike \nin prices is the result of a series of very simple events. We had a \nvery cold winter and used up more oil reserves than we might have done. \nThere was an expectation that Iraq's petroleum might come out to the \nworld market--it did not do so. In California, a number of refineries \nthat were moving along well have ceased to do so. Then there is \napparently a development within the refining industry of just-in-time \ninventories. Perfectly good economics. It has made a big difference in \nthe profitability of firms all over the country.\n  But what happens, when you have a short-term shortage, to prices when \nyou try to do something such as this? Well, my good friend and deskmate \nand member of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Louisiana, \nearlier cited Philip K. Verleger, Jr., an economist at Charles River \nAssociates, who was quoted in the press just yesterday, in the \nWashington Post, saying, ``The Republican-sponsored solution to the \ncurrent fuels problem * * * is nothing more and nothing less than a \nrefiner's benefit bill* * *. It will transfer upwards of $3 billion \nfrom the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and gasoline \nmarketers.''\n  Is that the result of some conspiracy among the big oil companies? \nNo, sir. I have no reason to think--it may be true, but I have never \nheard it mentioned--that an oil company came to anybody on Capitol Hill \nand said, ``Would you cut that tax?'' The reason Mr. Verleger said the \nreduction in the tax would benefit refiners is that for a century it \nhas been the clearest understanding of the economics profession that \nunder short-term supply conditions, a change such as a reduction in an \nexcise tax does not affect the price paid by the consumer.\n  In 1890, Alfred Marshall, as I mentioned to my friend from Virginia, \nthe great professor of economics at Cambridge University--he taught \nJohn Maynard Keynes, the father of modern macro economics--produced his \nopus, his great text, ``Principles of Economics.'' I have here a volume \nreprinted in 1961. This was the summation of what economists knew at \nthat time, in the late 19th century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is advised the \nmajority has 13 minutes left, of which 10----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Three. I would not bring up Marshall if I expected to \nhold my audience very much longer than 3 minutes.\n  Marshall took the example--to illustrate short-term supply, a \nfascinating thing--he took the example of fish. He said, what happens \nif there is a sudden change in the situation? Weather makes fish more \nor less available--a nice point--or if there is an increased demand for \nfish caused by the scarcity of meat during the year or two following a \ncattle plague. Mad cow disease in the late 19th century. A scarcity of \nfish caused by uncertainties of the weather has its exact parallel in \nour cold winter. These things come. I do not have to tell the Senator \nfrom Vermont about cold winters.\n  Would outside intervention change the price of fish to the consumer \nin that circumstance, when there was a fixed supply? The answer from \nAlfred Marshall is emphatically ``no.'' Students of economics my age \nwill remember this book. It is a very heavy book, but it is still \naround and it works. What it propounded is very clear. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\n\n       To go over the ground in another way. Market values are \n     governed by the relation of demand to stocks actually in the \n     market. . . .''\n\n  This is something businessmen know. Mr. Mike Bowlin, Chairman of \nARCO, said on ABC's ``Nightline'' Tuesday evening:\n\n       My concern is that there are other market forces that \n     clearly will overwhelm the relatively small decrease in the \n     price of gasoline, and that alarms me, that people's \n     expectations will be that the minute the tax is removed, they \n     want to see gasoline prices go down 4.3 cents, and that won't \n     happen.\n\n  This is something we know. Or it can be said as much as things like \nthis are knowable, this we know. The businessman says it, the economist \nsays it, the grandfather of them all explained it 100 years ago. There \nis good news, which is that the futures markets show the price of crude \noil going down very sharply, from about $22 a barrel today to about $18 \nfor next September. Gas prices will go down. Can we not just let them \ngo down by normal market forces and keep the budget agreement intact, \nthe agreement which has brought us to this happy moment?\n  I do thank the President for his patience. I look forward to \nlistening attentively to my friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the TEAM Act. \nI was privileged, at the request of the distinguished chairman from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, to chair the Small Business Committee and hold a \nhearing on this subject. In my remarks today, I will refer to a number \nof very important pieces of testimony, some coming from those in \nVirginia, who came before that committee to clearly, clearly support \nthe need for this change in the law.\n  I refer back to the 1930's when the original Wagner act was enacted \nin 1935.\n  It is time that we should change the law. That is all we are asking. \nThis is not the 1930's. Today, employees are highly skilled, far better \neducated, conscious of the fact they are in a global economy competing \nnot with the company down the street or the company in the next State \nbut, indeed, with companies all over the world. While they are \nsleeping, other companies elsewhere in the world are building much the \nsame products that are flowing into this one global market.\n  Yet, here they are, nonunion employees handcuffed by a law passed in \nthe 1930's at a time when really workers were expected, like Tennyson \nonce referred to soldiers, ``Yours is not to reason why but to do or \ndie'' in the workplace.\n  Those days are gone, and today we recognize each human being for \ntheir individual worth: man and woman, experienced worker, \ninexperienced worker, young and old. Yet they are hobbled by this act \nthat goes back to 1935. All we ask is revision of that act.\n  In almost every industrial plant or workplace in America today, be it \nlarge or small, there is a suggestion box. The workers are invited to \ndrop suggestions in their suggestion box. All the TEAM Act really does \nis to enlarge the concept of the suggestion box so that they can sit \ndown and discuss with management in that company their own ideas to \nincrease productivity, to increase safety. It is just the bare \nessentials of everyday existence in a plant environment. Yet, they are \nhobbled by this ancient, ancient law.\n  This is not an act to try and thwart the right to unionize. In no way \ndoes it do that. It simply gives the nonunion worker a chance to \nexpress his or her own view, such that their plant can become more \nproductive, with the hope and expectation that their salary check might \nbe increased. And to speak about safety issues so that they can live \nand work longer in a safer environment. That is all they ask.\n  I urge my colleagues, no matter how strong your affiliation and ties \nare to organized labor, look at this law. Decide it upon its own \nmerits. Think of those people all across our Nation today who are \nworking to compete in this global market.\n  This bill, again, in no way affects the rights of workers who have \nchosen to unionize. Rather, it assists only the workers who have chosen \nnot to unionize, such as those in my State, which is, proudly, a right-\nto-work State.\n  I went back and looked at so much of the testimony from the Small \nBusiness hearing. Most people would be shocked to learn that the \ncurrent labor law makes it illegal for employees in nonunion plants, \nworkplaces, to discuss matters such as safety and productivity and work \nschedules, the daily routine, where they might have lunch, the quality \nof the food, safety of the machinery, the age of the machinery. It is \nsuch logical discourse between labor and management in today's market, \nyet this law stands there like a stone wall to prohibit the exchange of \nideas.\n  Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act just does that. \nThe NLRA casts a cloud of illegality on all types of organized employee \nparticipation in the workplace; that is, when groups get together. You \ncan drop your suggestion in, but you cannot join with four or five \nother workers and go into the boss' office, perhaps put your feet up, \nand have a discussion on these subjects. It sounds crazy. It is just \ntotally out of context with our lifestyle today.\n  Listen to the type of issues which cannot--I repeat cannot --be \ndiscussed in any organized group discussion. I am not talking about \norganized unions: I am talking about just organized group discussion, \neven if it is initiated by the employees. One has been the day care \ncenter. We did not have day care centers in the 1930's. I am not \nsuggesting I was around and in the work force then, but my parents \nwere. There may have been a work or day care center in some plant, but \ncertainly they did not exist in the breadth that is all common in \nAmerica today. But these people in their workplace cannot go in and \ntalk about day care with the management.\n  Then there are softball teams. Sports have become a part of the \nlifestyle, fortunately, in many industrialized places in America today, \nbut the workers cannot go in and discuss the after hours, \nextracurricular athletic participation of the employees.\n  Another example is the employee lounge: a reserved area in the plant \nwhere they might go for a break or have their lunch or just enjoy \nthemselves.\n  As far as vacations, no way, no discussion is allowed.\n  How about rules on arguments among employees? Today, there is a lot \nof tension in many of our workplaces, but people are not free to go in \nand just discuss that with their bosses in the hopes to alleviate this \nsituation of tension.\n  Just stop to think, dress codes cannot even be discussed. Nor can \nparking regulations, smoking or nonsmoking policies and, indeed, safety \nin labeling. And on and on it goes.\n  To me, this just defies common sense, defies good judgment. It goes \nback to the old days: Yours is not to reason why, but just to do or \ndie. And that is totally alien to today's workplace.\n  Mr. President, one of the biggest concerns of the American people and \nespecially the people of my State is that the Federal Government, \ninstead of helping them get ahead, helping them become more \ncompetitive, sets up these roadblocks to make that less possible.\n  The TEAM Act is a piece of legislation which will help lessen that \nroadblock put on in 1935 and allow the workers in our industrial plants \nall across America to use their skills, their energies and their ideas \nto create a more productive and, hopefully, safer work environment, and \nto make America collectively more competitive throughout the world.\n  Do the workers in comparable plants in Asia or Europe have these \nproblems? No. They can sit down with their bosses. As a matter of fact, \nmuch of the concept of this TEAM Act originated abroad and has been \nbrought to our shores and yet here there is a law to stop it.\n  The TEAM Act is necessary to free business and workers from the \nshackles of an ancient law.\n  Mr. President, do I note the time has arrived?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator has 30 additional \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I have met with a number of employees in the context of our hearing \nand in private meetings who have told me the actual stories and \nexperiences of those who are participating in plants where they go \nahead, despite the law, and sit down and talk with their bosses, \nrisking prosecution by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n  I have met with employees and management from some Virginia companies \nwhich have had great success with the team concept. The AMP Corp. which \nmakes electrical connectors used around the world has a plant in \nRoanoke, VA, is one such example. Employees and management established \na number of teams to help meet the challenge of foreign competition. \nOne team of workers went with management to another AMP facility, \nlearned a new stamping process and implemented it in Roanoke, creating \n20 new jobs to increase output made possible by the new process.\n  Another team of workers was assigned the task of comparing AMP's \nproduction processes to foreign competitors, a task which management \nhad done by themselves previously. The team was better able to see how \ninventory levels, technology changes, and production cycles affected \nproductivity than management had been. As a result, quality and \ndelivery is better, prices are lower, and the company and its employees \nare more secure.\n  Last, a third team of AMP, known as the community education team, \nreaches out to local schools. Through this team, AMP has been able to \nrecruit new workers from the Roanoke area with the necessary technology \ntraining rather than recruiting out of the area.\n  AMP's experiences have been mirrored at other Virginia companies. For \nexample, at the TRW plant in southwestern Virginia in Atkins, VA, one \ncustomer, a huge automobile manufacturer, requested that the employees \non a rack and pinion gear production line have a brainstorming session \nto seek ways to improve efficiency. Over 200 ideas were advanced by \nemployees and, working together with management, nearly 90 percent of \nthese were implemented. These ideas included everything from \nstandardizing shelving heights to redesigning multiple parts into one \npiece. The results have been amazing, with production up one-third per \noperator and savings of over $100,000 to the customer.\n  At R.R. Donnelly, Corp. in Harrisonburg, VA, the introduction of work \nteams to supervise various aspects of the production of hardcover books \nhas had different results than organized labor might have you believe. \nRather than being an attempt to subvert the employees, Donnelly's teams \nhave resulted in an increase of over 50 percent in production jobs and \na decrease of 33 percent in management positions. These statistics \nshould not be surprising because what teams do, in effect, is to make \nthe employees into managers of their operations.\n  I am certain there are numerous other such examples from around \nVirginia, but the last I would like to mention is Universal Dynamics in \nWoodbridge, VA, just south of the beltway on I-95. UNA-DYN, as it is \nknown, manufacturers industrial dehumidifiers and has implemented the \nteam concept throughout their manufacturing and engineering processes.\n\n  Mac McCammon testified at the hearing which I chaired last month. He \ndescribed how employee suggestions are implemented by employee teams \nwith only marginal involvement from management, these suggestion sheets \nhave been at the heart of the company's huge growth over the past 5 \nyears.\n  Unions have said that this bill is bad for workers: in fact, it is \nexactly what employees have been seeking for years. All of us know that \na job is more satisfying when you have input into your responsibilities \nand help improve the product or service you help create. Today's \nemployees give more than their sweat, they give their minds and their \nability to work together. This bill provides that opportunity.\n  In addition, more and more employees receive profit-sharing or \nbonuses based on the financial performance of their company, they have \na direct stake in improving the productivity of their business.\n  And then there is the issue of employee safety. Employees are the \nbest experts on what is dangerous in their workplaces and what are the \nbest solutions.\n  In the Small Business Committee hearing, we heard from Ms. Donna \nGooch, the human resources director of Sunsoft Corp. in Albuquerque, \nNM. In order to meet increased demand for their contact lenses, \nmanagement and employees agreed on a 7-day workweek. Not only were \nteams used to meet the increased problems with child care and \nscheduling, they were essential in structuring job tasks to avoid \nexpensive ergonomic injuries. Without full employee involvement, none \nof this would have been possible.\n  My colleagues have explained in detail the nuances of current law. My \nmain point is that most people would be shocked to learn that current \nlabor law makes it illegal for employees in nonunion workplaces to \ndiscuss matters such as safety, productivity, and work schedules with \nmanagement. Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, \nunfortunately, does just that. The NLRA casts a cloud of illegality on \nall types of organized employee participation in the workplace.\n  Among the issues which cannot be discussed in any organized fashion--\ncannot be discussed even if initiated by the employees--have been day \ncare, softball teams, an employee lounge, structuring of employee \nevaluations, vacations, rules on fighting among employees, dress codes, \nparking regulations, smoking policies, and safety labeling.\n  Now of course it would be perfectly legal for the employer to dictate \nfrom on high how employees must be regulated. Isn't it clear that work \nproductivity would be higher, that worker happiness would be better, if \nthe employees had a voice in these matters?\n  This cloud caused by the current law must be lifted. This is no time \nfor our Government, through increasingly common enforcement cases \nbrought by the National Labor Relations Board, to make it harder to \ncreate competitive and safe workplaces.\n  The Clinton administration has recognized that employee participation \nin unionized workplaces have brought enormous gains in productivity and \nsafety. President Clinton even remarked about this fact in his State of \nthe Union Address. His thought is correct, but it must be applied not \njust to union workplaces. It is time that the 90 percent of \nnongovernment employees who have chosen not to unionize be given \nsimilar rights and opportunities.\n  I am particularly concerned about small businesses most at risk under \ncurrent law. Most small businesses are too small to have \nclassifications like manager and employee--all employees have to act \nand think like managers. Second, many businesses cannot afford to hire \nlabor attorneys to analyze every employee-manager interaction. Third, \nthe expense of contesting a NLRB action is too great a threat to many \nbusinesses to even think about starting employee team programs.\n  Unions seem to fear that employees able to contribute more to their \nworkplace will be less anxious to unionize. Well, what's wrong with \nthat? Unionization works where collective bargaining is necessary to \nbalance the bargaining scale--it is not necessary for most workplaces, \nand if employees are happier and more productive without a union, the \nGovernment should not block their wishes.\n  In conclusion, the TEAM Act is not only needed to keep America \ncompetitive, it is desperately sought by American workers. The world \nhas changed since the 1930's, and the law must change as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 393, H.R. 2137.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2137) to amend the Violent Crime Control and \n     Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to require the release of \n     relevant information to protect the public from sexually \n     violent offenders.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, Tuesday night the House passed an important \nmeasure that will help protect our Nation's children from sexual \npredators.\n  By a vote of 418 to 0, the House passed legislation, known as Megan's \nlaw, that strengthens existing law to require all 50 States to notify \ncommunities of the presence of convicted sex offenders who might pose a \ndanger to children.\n  In 1994, the crime bill allowed but did not require States to take \nsuch steps. And since that time, 49 States have enacted sex offender \nregistration laws, and 30 States have adopted community notification \nprovisions.\n  But not all States have taken the necessary steps to require such \nnotification, and this is a tragedy in the making.\n  For once, let us prevent a tragedy instead of waiting for some other \nhorrific crime and then taking action. We should pass this law now.\n  How can we hesitate one moment?\n  Every parent in America knows the fear, the doubts, he or she suffers \nworrying about the safety of his or her children. Parents understand \nthat their children cannot know how truly evil some people are. They \nknow that no matter how hard they try, they cannot be with their \nchildren every second of the day.\n  And a second is all it takes for tragedy to strike.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that those who have committed such \ncrimes will not be able to do so again. This is a limited measure, but \nan absolutely necessary one.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we will act tonight on Megan's law, which \nstrengthens and improves a good law, and provides families with needed \nprotection against the most heinous of crimes. Although Megan's law \nwill not affect my State of Washington, which should, and does serve as \na model for other States around the country, it will assist those \nStates that, for whatever reason, have been slower to act or more \ntimorous in their fight against crime.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act. The act contained a number of good provisions, perhaps \nthe one I cared about most was the provision calling for the \nregistration of sexual offenders and community notification. Most \nStates have already implemented systems to require people who abduct \nchildren, or who commit sexual crimes, to register their addresses with \nState or local law enforcement officials. The provision in the 1994 \nact, however, was not as tough as I would have liked. The Act permitted \nState and local law enforcement to notify communities that there was a \nsexual predator in their midst, but it did not require this \nnotification. We are back now to improve upon that law by requiring \ncommunity notification. Even with this mandate, however, State and \nlocal law enforcement officials, still will retain the substantial \ndiscretion to determine when community notification is called for, what \ninformation to release, and how to best inform the community.\n  Parents have a right to know that their children are in danger, that \nthe person living next door to them, or down the street is a convicted \nsexual predator. The need for this notification was tragically \nillustrated in the case of Megan Kanka, for whom the law before us \ntoday is named. Two years ago, Megan was allegedly raped and murdered \nby a man who lived across the street from her, a man who twice before \nhad been convicted of being a sexual predator, and who lived with two \nhouse mates who were themselves sexual predators. Megan's parents did \nnot know this. If they had, they could have advised their daughter not \nto accept her neighbor's invitation to come into his house to see a \npuppy.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements in the bill be printed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2137) was deemed read three times and passed.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think, just for the information of my colleagues, this \nbill just passed is commonly referred to as Megan's law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4921-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE LEGISLATION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3960 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, for the information all Senators, this \ncloture vote on my new amendment, which contains only the gas tax bill, \nwill occur on Tuesday, May 14. I will consult with the Democratic \nleader prior to setting the next cloture vote.\n  Let me explain precisely what this amendment contains. My Democratic \ncolleagues have just blocked repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. They \nblocked an increase also in the minimum wage. So I have laid down \nanother amendment to repeal the gas tax. This amendment contains \nadditional funding that completely offsets the cost of the repeal. The \namendment raises $4.1 billion in fiscal 1996 and by adopting provisions \nthe President and Secretary Rubin have specifically asked for. I have \ntheir letters here for the Record. The amendment will also help avert \nanother savings and loan crisis. This is the so-called BIF-SAIF \nprovision.\n  In the spirit--I have thought about it--in the spirit of the \nPresident's press conference yesterday asking for cooperation, I have \ndecided to offer the gas tax repeal, which he said he would sign, and \npay for it with a measure that he wants desperately. In fact, on April \n14 he said that there is a proposal before Congress from the \nadministration to:\n\n       . . . restore the Savings Association Insurance Fund to \n     full health and assure that interest payments on the so-\n     called FICO bonds continue uninterrupted. With the enactment \n     of this legislation, we could all take pride in achieving a \n     resolution of the last remaining consequences of the thrift \n     industry's problems of the 1980's. Moreover, we can do this \n     without imposing additional costs on American taxpayers.\n       This necessary proposal will protect taxpayers, who have \n     already paid over $125 billion to assure that no insured \n     depositor suffered any loss as a result of these problems.\n\n  I am accommodating the President's request. I know some of the \nbankers and others may not be totally satisfied with this, but I \nsuggest they call area code 202-456-1414.\n  I also will have printed in the Record a letter from Secretary Rubin \nreceived just yesterday, pleading with us to move on this legislation \nwhich is important. Underscoring the importance of the legislation, it \nwould ``restore the Savings Association Insurance Fund.'' They said we \nhave had it before us for some time and they have ``consistently urged \nthe SAIF legislation should receive immediate action.''\n  Again in response, and I discussed this with my assistant leader, \nSenator Lott, in response to the request of the President, his \nbipartisan appeal yesterday, and the letter from the Secretary of the \nTreasury, we have offered that as a way to pay for the repeal of the \ngas tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the President and the \nletter from the Secretary printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Dole, Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Congress has before it a proposal from \n     the Administration that would restore the Savings Association \n     Insurance Fund to full health and assure that interest \n     payments on the so-called FICO bonds continue uninterrupted. \n     With the enactment of this legislation, we could all take \n     pride in achieving a resolution of the last remaining \n     consequences of the thrift industry's problems of the 1980's. \n     Moreover, we can do so without imposing additional costs on \n     American Taxpayers.\n       This necessary proposal will protect taxpayers, who have \n     already paid over $125 billion to assure that no insured \n     depositor suffered any loss as the result of these problems. \n     I believe this legislation has broad bipartisan support, and \n     I urge the Leadership to consider immediate Congressional \n     action.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole, Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I am writing to you in furtherance of the \n     President's letter of April 24, 1996. As the President \n     explained, it is a matter of great national importance to \n     enact legislation that would restore the Savings Association \n     Insurance Fund (SAIF) to full health and assure that interest \n     payments on the FICO bonds continue uninterrupted. The \n     Congress has before it a proposal from the Administration \n     that would accomplish these ends. As the Administration has \n     consistently urged, the SAIF legislation should receive \n     immediate action. Moreover, we believe that the SAIF \n     legislation would be a suitable means to help pay for other \n     appropriate legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. So, I would say hopefully on Tuesday, then, we can obtain \ncloture. Then we will decide how to deal with the TEAM Act and minimum \nwage. They are still floating around out there, or will be. We are \nstill prepared, I think, as Senator Lott has had a couple of meetings \ntoday, to pick a time certain, sometime in June--or maybe, if we can, \ndo it before the recess--to take up those questions.\n  There has also been a question raised. I have written a letter to the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, to see if he had any \nsuggestion, because he was concerned if we did repeal the gas tax it \nwould not reach the consumers. I was asked in a press conference \nyesterday about a statement by ARCO, Atlantic Richfield Co., that maybe \nthey would not be passed on to consumers.\n  But I now have statements from bus and trucking groups who say they \nwould pass along the savings from the repeal to their customers in the \nform of lower travel costs. And I also have a statement from ARCO and \nExxon and others.\n  I ask unanimous consent all these statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         Arco,\n\n                                     Los Angeles, CA, May 9, 1996.\n\n ARCO Will Immediately Reduce Total Gasoline Price if 4.3-cent Federal \n                       Gasoline Tax Is Eliminated\n\n       Los Angeles.--ARCO Chairman and CEO Mike R. Bowlin said \n     today that ``if the federal government reduces the gasoline \n     excise tax by 4.3 cents per gallon, ARCO will immediately \n     reduce its total price at its company-operated stations and \n     to its dealers by 4.3 cents per gallon.''\n       The ARCO chairman said in an interview on ABC's \n     ``Nightline'' broadcast on May 7, that he had ``simply been \n     cautioning that ARCO is not able to accurately predict \n     industry behavior, cannot legally control its dealers' \n     pricing, and that other factors may influence changes in \n     overall market prices. All other things being equal, we would \n     expect the price of gasoline to fall 4.3 cents per gallon.''\n       An ARCO spokesman said that ARCO has a proud tradition of \n     acting responsibly in its gasoline pricing decisions in times \n     of national upsets. He noted that during the Gulf War crisis \n     in 1990, ARCO had been a leader in announcing that it would \n     freeze gasoline prices. Eventually, that led to a situation \n     where ARCO was unable to meet demand for its gasoline and was \n     forced to raise prices in line with market conditions in \n     order to prevent its dealers from running out of gasoline.\n       The ARCO spokesman said that ``gasoline prices have \n     increased some 20 to 30 cents per gallon over the last few \n     months. Obviously no one can promise that even though the \n     marginal cost of gasoline is reduced by a 4.3 cents per \n     gallon tax reduction on a given day, some other factors may \n     not simultaneously influence the market price of gasoline.''\n       ARCO chairman Bowlin said: ``What we can say is that ARCO \n     will immediately reduce the total price of gasoline at our \n     company-operated stations and to our dealers by 4.3 cents per \n     gallon. I can also tell you that our internal forecasts \n     suggest that gasoline prices are headed lower. We believe \n     that the vast majority of responsible economists would say \n     that a reduction in excise taxes would be passed through \n     about penny-per-penny at the pump.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Exxon Comment Concerning Potential Market Impact of Change in Federal \n                         Motor Fuel Excise Tax\n\n       Pricing decisions are based on competitive market \n     conditions in each of our markets. Exxon cannot predict \n     future prices.\n       The marketplace decides what the price of gasoline will be. \n     If the federal excise tax on gasoline is rolled back as \n     proposed, we believe the very competitive market will result \n     in a gasoline price that is 4.3 cents less than it would have \n     been without the rollback, but we don't know what the \n     absolute price will be.\n       Retail gasoline prices at most Exxon service stations \n     (about 7,900 of the approximately 8,300 Exxon branded outlets \n     in the nation) are established by the independent dealers and \n     distributors who operate them. Exxon is\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\n     prohibited by law from dictating the price that its dealers \n     and distributors charge their customers at the retail level.\n       Retail prices at the approximately 400 outlets operated \n     directly by the company also are set in response to \n     competitive factors in the markets in which they compete.\n       Competitive factors include, among others, the supply of \n     gasoline, consumers' demand for gasoline, crude oil costs, \n     state and federal excise taxes, and the cost of complying \n     with environmental regulations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               Chevron Response To Gasoline Tax Decrease\n\n       In response to many comments in the press and from \n     customers concerning possible oil company actions in the \n     event of a decrease in the federal gasoline tax, a Chevron \n     spokesman said the following:\n       Any decrease in the federal gasoline tax would be \n     immediately reflected in the prices Chevron charges to \n     motorists at our 600 company-operated stations in the U.S. \n     through reductions which, on average, would equal the amount \n     of the tax decrease. We also separately collect these taxes \n     from our thousands of Chevron dealers and jobbers throughout \n     the U.S. and we would immediately reduce our collections from \n     these dealers and jobbers by the amount of the tax decrease. \n     However, these Chevron dealers and jobbers are independent \n     businessmen and women who independently set their own pump \n     prices at the more than 7,000 Chevron stations they operate.\n       Many factors influence gasoline prices which are set by \n     competition in the marketplace. It is impossible to predict \n     where gasoline prices may stand in absolute terms at any time \n     in the future. However, if these taxes are reduced, it is \n     logical in a free market economy that overall prices will in \n     the future be lower for our customers than they otherwise \n     would have been by the amount of the tax decrease.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Texaco Inc.,\n\n                                     White Plains NY, May 3, 1996.\n     Response to media inquiries:\n     Re Gasoline tax debate.\n       Question. If the 1993 federal gasoline tax increase of 4.3 \n     cents per gallon is repealed, what would Texaco do regarding \n     prices at the pump?\n       Answer. For the approximately 15 percent of the Texaco \n     service stations where we set the pump prices, all things \n     beings equal, repeal of the 4.3 cents per gallon tax would \n     reduce the pump prices accordingly.\n       For the 85 percent of the Texaco stations owned or operated \n     by individual business people, Texaco is precluded by law \n     from setting pump prices. Nevertheless, for the industry \n     generally, we believe lower taxes will result in lower \n     gasoline prices for consumers.\n       Retail gasoline pump prices are highly competitive and the \n     prices at individual stations are determined by the \n     competitive environment in which that station does business.\n       The repeal of the 1993 4.3 cents per gallon federal \n     gasoline tax would reduce the average nationwide state and \n     federal tax on gasoline from 42.4 cents to 38.1 cents per \n     gallon.\n                                          Anthony J.

Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: It was my pleasure to appear before the \n     Senate Finance Committee on May 3rd and testify in support of \n     your efforts to repeal the 4.3 cents fuel tax that goes into \n     the general fund. The American Trucking Associations \n     represents an industry composed of small businesses with an \n     average profit of 1.5 cents on a dollar of revenue. The \n     current spiraling fuel prices are putting many of our small \n     companies in a precarious financial position.\n       I was relieved to hear the representative of the service \n     station industry testify that they will pass along tax \n     savings to their customers. We have heard similar statements \n     from the major oil companies.\n       I am confident that, after covering the cost of rising fuel \n     prices, the savings will be passed on to our customers and \n     consumers because we are a highly competitive industry with \n     over 350,000 interstate trucking companies.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to expand upon my comments. \n     Please call me if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Thomas J.

We fully support your efforts in this regard.\n       We want to assure you that any benefits as a result of a \n     tax repeal will accrue to the consumer, in our case, the \n     intercity bus passenger.\n       With all our best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Susan Perry,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Association of American Railroads,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Dole: On behalf of the Association of \n     American Railroads (AAR), I write to advise that customers \n     should benefit from the elimination of the 4.3 cents-per-\n     gallon deficit reduction fuel tax imposed in 1993. Some \n     adjustments or ``hold downs'' may be automatic given cost \n     adjustment factors in rail contracts.\n       Competition among the freight transportation modes is \n     intense. As a result, the freight railroads are constantly \n     improving service to shippers and offering competitive rates. \n     In fact, rail freight rates have declined by 22 percent since \n     1981 in current dollars and by 51% in inflation-adjusted \n     dollars.\n       AAR supports your efforts to eliminate the 4.3 cents-per-\n     gallon deficit reduction fuel tax. AAR also urges you to \n     repeal the additional 1.25 cents-per-gallon deficit reduction \n     tax resulting from the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act which \n     is paid exclusively by the railroad industry. The inequity in \n     current law should be remedied so that the railroad industry \n     will no longer be required to pay more for deficit reduction \n     than its competitors.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Edwin L. Harper,\n\n                                                     President and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Air Transport Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We have been asked whether the reduction \n     in the 4.3 cents-per-gallon transportation fuels tax will \n     result in lower air fares to consumers. As you know, the Air \n     Transport Association has no role in the setting of air \n     fares. Moreover, we do not suggest or take any action which \n     may result in our member carriers adjusting fares in a \n     coordinated manner. However, notwithstanding those limits, I \n     would like to address your inquiry.\n       First, we know that a decrease in the 4.3 cents-per-gallon \n     tax will be reflected in the price airlines pay for fuel. Our \n     members purchase fuel from vendors, in large measure, through \n     a competitive bidding process. The 4.3 cents-per-gallon tax \n     is thus added to the price bid by the vendors. Therefore, \n     once the tax is eliminated, we are confident that the \n     industry's fuel costs will be reduced.\n       Secondly, because of the competitive nature of the airline \n     business, carriers continually try to keep their prices as \n     low as possible. The 4.3 cents-per-gallon tax has increased \n     carrier costs, thereby putting pressure on carriers' \n     operating margins. Eliminating the tax will remove one of the \n     cost pressures which individual carriers must consider in \n     setting their respective air fares. Thus, if operating costs \n     go down, there will be one less cost which needs to be \n     factored into air carrier fares.\n       Inevitably, tax changes manifest themselves in the costs of \n     doing business which will ultimately impact the prices \n     airlines charge.\n       Mr. Leader, I hope that this response to your inquiry will \n     be helpful. Please let me know if there is further \n     information we can provide.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Carol B. Hallett,\n\n                                                     President and\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. The point being they are going to pass the savings on to \nconsumers. Maybe in some cases, out of millions and millions of \ntransactions, it may not happen, but that is the intent of all those \nwho will be in the process. I think those letters might be helpful to \nsome, such as Senator Dorgan, who does have legitimate questions. We \nwant to respond to those questions. If he has a better idea than our \namendment, which is a credit, we will be happy to consider it.\n  So I would just say it seems to me we have now, sort of, on this \nsingle issue--if you want to vote for lower gas prices then you vote \nfor cloture on Tuesday. If you want to vote for lower travel costs, \nlower inflation, better job protection for employees in the \ntransportation industry, this will be an opportunity. It is something \nthe President said yesterday in a press conference he would sign. We \nhave now complied with the President's request and the Treasury's \nrequest that we pass BIF-SAIF. That is part of this amendment. It seems \nto me it is almost--it could have come from the White House. We are \npleased to accommodate the White House when we can.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have just been informed of the majority \nleader's most recent proposal. I think it is fair to say that it is \nmore of the same. It is similar to many of the other proposals we have \nbeen presented with over the last several weeks. Obviously, it is \nunacceptable.\n  We have indicated our desire to have a vote on the gas tax. We would \nbe prepared to accept that. But we would also obviously feel the need \nto have the same vote on the minimum wage. Of course, the majority \nleader has now indicated his desire to bring up the so-called TEAM Act. \nWe would be prepared to have a vote on that. But they are connected, \nunfortunately, the way the majority leader has proposed them. If we \ncould get a vote on minimum wage, we would be more than happy then to \nhave a vote on the gasoline tax reduction.\n  As I understand it, the majority leader has proposed a new offset \nthat will take care of the point of order. The BIF-SAIF is an issue \nthat has to be resolved. We recognize that. But I am not sure that we \ndo it justice simply to use it as a convenient offset, in this case for \na gasoline tax reduction amendment that may or may not go to the \nconsumer, first of all, and that, second, may or may not require the \nentire amount that BIF-SAIF will provide.\n  But the real issue is, should we have a good debate, a good \ndiscussion about the BIF-SAIF issue in and of itself? Should we analyze \nwhether or not this is the right approach? Is this exactly the right \nformulation for BIF-SAIF? Those are issues we ought to discuss.\n\n  I have not seen the BIF-SAIF proposal the majority leader referred \nto. It may be perfectly fine. To be buried in an agreement involving an \noffset for the gasoline tax reduction, in my view, does not do justice \nto the entire issue of BIF-SAIF, nor does it satisfy all of the \ndifficulties that we have, of course, with the gasoline tax reduction \nitself.\n  We still must address the issue, who gets the benefit? Will it go to \nthe consumer? Will we have the opportunity to ensure that it is not the \noil companies that benefit but the consumer? Can we offer amendments in \nthat regard?\n  I know our words sometimes come back to haunt us. I am sure in many \ncases mine have and will. But I was curious and very interested in a \ncomment made by then-Republican leader Bob Dole in 1993. This is taken \nfrom the Record on page 3934, dated March 29:\n\n       I guess the thing I need to resolve is whether or not there \n     is going to be any flexibility or whether everything is going \n     to be under the total control of the distinguished chairman \n     of the committee. Is there going to be free and open debate \n     on the amendments, or are you going to determine which \n     amendments can be offered? We cannot accept that on this \n     side.\n\n  I can identify with that. I can empathize with Senator Dole's query \nin March 1993. I, second, appreciate his question because, ironically \nand coincidentally, we find ourselves in virtually the same situation. \nI say ``virtually'' because here it says, he asks, ``Is there going to \nbe a free and open debate on the amendments, or are you going to \ndetermine which amendments can be offered?'' In our case, that has \nalready been determined. There are no amendments to be offered. There \nis no opportunity for the Democratic side to even address the issue of \namendments, because we have been precluded from doing so. We are \nfarther off the mark now than we were even back in March 1993.\n  Mr. President, regrettably, we end this week with the realization \nthat we have not resolved the matter. We want very much to have a vote \non the gasoline tax reduction. While there are very strong reservations \nexpressed throughout our caucus, some of those reservations can be \naddressed if we can adequately address the question of who will \nbenefit, if we can adequately address the question of what kind of an \noffset we will have.\n  Maybe BIF-SAIF provides an adequate numerical offset, but there are \nvery fundamental questions of policy we ought to be addressing, as \nwell, and whether or not we can do that under these circumstances, I \nthink is very questionable. For that reason, too, I am concerned about \nwhether BIF-SAIF is an appropriate vehicle, at least under these \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. President, we will not support cloture. We will oppose the vote \nwhen it is presented next week.\n  Mr. President, let me also address the issue that has been addressed \nby so many of our colleagues on the other side today with regard to the \nso-called TEAM Act. I listened with great interest on several occasions \nthis afternoon as I was in and out of my office to the remarks made by \nso many of our colleagues. This is not the time nor is it necessarily \nthe most appropriate way with which to address all of the issues \nraised. I do not intend to do so tonight.\n  I do want to make four points. First of all, it has been said over \nand over on the floor--in my view, quite erroneously--that today \nbusinesses are prevented from discussing issues ranging from safety, \nworkplace conditions, and all the other issues that may come up in a \nworking environment in any company today. Mr. President, that is \nabsolutely untrue. Untrue.\n  I hope everybody will go back and look very carefully at what has \nbeen said. In many cases--I am sure not purposely--there has been a \nsignificant level of misstatement today regarding prohibitions on \nemployers that has to be corrected in the Record and will be corrected \nas we get into this issue again next week.\n  Employers today are given many opportunities--in fact, are using all \nopportunities--to discuss issues of quality and safety and workplace \nenvironment and all of the issues that certainly would come up in the \nnormal discourse between employers and employees.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of all large businesses have team \narrangements today--95 percent, according to the Department of Labor. \nMr. President, 75 percent of small businesses have team arrangements \nwith their employees today and in workplaces everywhere all these \nissues are discussed. Let there be no doubt, those discussions, that \ndialog, those relationships, are already working. That is not the \nissue.\n  The second point, what I think a lot of employees are very concerned \nabout, is that oftentimes there are situations that arise where an \nemployer says, ``You, you and you are now selected to represent all of \nyou. You are the ones who are going to be in the room as we make the \ndecisions involving all the employees. That is the way it is going to \nbe. I do not care whether there are any elections. I do not care \nwhether there was any discussion about whether these three people are \nrepresentative of all the work force. That is the way it will be. Take \nit or leave it. Accept it or find another job.''\n  Our view is, if that situation develops, there ought to be some \nconsultation with other employees, and there ought to be some \nunderstanding that if it will affect the entire work force, the workers \nthemselves should have some opportunity to select who it is that will \nbe their spokesperson. That is what we are trying to do here: To find a \nway to ensure that if there is going to be a representative \norganization, that the employees have some opportunity to articulate \nand select the people that will make the decisions for them.\n  The third point: Current Federal law is affected, of course, by court \ndecisions. Court decisions, in some cases, have clearly obfuscated the \ninterpretation of current law. It is our view, clearly, that there \nneeds to be legislation to address the lack of clarity today about what \nemployers and employees can and cannot do. On that, there is no doubt. \nWe acknowledge that. We support it. We want legislation to address the \nneed for clarification. We will offer legislation to ensure that \nhappens, that we clarify what the arrangements can be and all of the \ncircumstances involving the workplace that need to be addressed, in a \nreasonable way.\n  So, clarification, yes. Opportunities to encourage teamwork, yes. \nWays with which to make an employment environment more effective, yes. \nWe can do that. That ought to be a bipartisan effort. We ought to find \nways with which to work together to ensure that happens.\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\n  The fourth point, Mr. President, if we are, indeed, interested in \npaycheck security, health security, pension security, the workers \nthemselves ought to have an opportunity to determine what that means \nand how they can empower themselves more effectively. If that is going \nto happen, we want to protect the rights we have established over the \nlast 60 years for workers to organize themselves. It is just not right \nto set up rump organizations where employers are negotiating with \nthemselves, therefore denying paycheck security, denying people the \nopportunity to grow in this economy along with everybody else, the \nopportunity to have meaningful health security, the opportunity to have \ngood pensions.\n  That is what collective bargaining is all about. That has worked in \nthis country and other countries, collective bargaining where we can \nensure some opportunities to workers to enjoy the fruits of the success \nof a given company.\n  Mr. President, we will get into this a lot more next week. I do \nbelieve there has been a lot of misinformation. Again, I do not accuse \nanybody of purposefully misinforming, but I have never seen so much \nmisinformation as I have seen this afternoon on any one issue.\n  We will have more opportunities to clarify it, more opportunities to \nwork on it and, hopefully, to work together. I know a lot of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle would like to see more of a \ncooperative spirit and more opportunities for comity, and maybe this \nwill lend itself to that in the end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to some of the remarks by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader. We continue to talk and work to \nsee if we can find a way to move these issues forward in an \nunderstandable and fair way. We have somewhat of a Gordian knot. We are \ntrying to find a way to untie that and move forward. That is what the \nleader has done here today.\n  Many of the leaders in the Democratic Party have indicated they want \nto vote for the gas tax repeal. The President indicated that he would \nsign that. And so the majority leader has set up a situation here where \nthe pending business is a clear, direct vote on repealing the gas tax \nof 4.3 cents a gallon, which was voted in in 1993. And that money has \nbeen going into the General Treasury, not the highway trust fund for \nhighway and bridge improvements. He has set it up so that we can \naddress the issues. Everybody says they want to address this in a fair \nway. It is not connected to the TEAM Act or connected to minimum wage. \nIt is the gas tax repeal, pure and simple.\n  Earlier today, there had been objection to considering this issue \nbecause a point of order was made that the offset did not cover the \ncost of taking this 4.3 cents out of the general budget. That has been \naddressed here. Majority Leader Dole's proposal would repeal the gas \ntax, and it would be offset by BIF-SAIF. Some people may not \nparticularly like that offset, but it is an offset that the Budget \nCommittee put in the budget resolution.\n  It is something that I believe the Banking Committee worked on and \nsomething the President has indicated he has wanted, and something the \nSecretary of Treasury has written letters seeking. So this is a good \nway to begin to unravel the situation we are in now, parliamentarily.\n  Next week, we will have a vote directly on the gas tax repeal, unless \nit is delayed and filibustered by the Democrats. The choice is real \nsimple. If you want the gas tax repeal and want it to be paid for, this \ndoes that. This is a fair solution to this problem.\n  So I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to look at what \nthe majority leader has proposed. Let us do this gas tax vote, and then \nwe can move forward in trying to find a proper solution to the other \nitems that are pending.\n  We have no problem with trying to develop an amendment that might \nfurther guarantee that the consumers get the benefit of this gas tax \nrepeal. On behalf of the leader, I have talked to Senator Daschle and \nto Senator Dorgan, who has been working on this and, great, we welcome \nany additional ideas you have. We want to make sure that happens. We \nare satisfied that the legislation we have takes care of that. Now \npeople are coming forward in writing and saying that they will make \nsure that the consumers get this 4.3-cent gas tax repeal. But I think \nthat the leader would be open to some reasonable recommendations in \nthat area.\n  Now, it has been suggested that we have not been having free and open \ndebate here. I cannot believe that. That is about all we have had. We \nhave not been able to get votes because it has been blocked by a \nvariety of delaying tactics--points of order, filibusters, if you \nwill--but that is the Senate. We have had free and open debate. We have \nbeen able to have this discussion during the past couple of days. In \nfact, in the past couple of weeks, on the minimum wage, on the freedom \nin the workplace, the TEAM Act, and the gas tax, there has been plenty \nof talk.\n  So I want to address something I have heard two or three times today. \nWe are clearly acting within the rules. We are not setting any new \nprecedents here. I can remember when the majority leader was Senator \nMitchell from Maine. I remember him offering second-degree amendments \nto block our amendments. I remember him filling up the tree so that we \ncould not offer our amendments. This is nothing unprecedented here. We \nare clearly within the rules.\n  I remind my colleagues that we are in the majority. We have some \nresponsibility to try to move the agenda forward. That is what the \nleader has done with this proposal--get the issue that everybody says \nthey are for out there where we can debate it and vote on it. So I \nthink we need to make it clear that we are strictly playing by the \nrules.\n  I might note that when the Senator from Massachusetts, who is here on \nthe floor now, offered his minimum wage amendment, I believe he almost \nimmediately sent down a cloture motion to the desk on that. At least, I \nbelieve that is true. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will wait for recognition to speak. But the Senator is \ninaccurate in that characterization, as the Senator was when he talked \nabout Senator Mitchell filling out the tree.\n  Mr. LOTT. Did the Senator send a cloture motion to the desk on that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. After we were denied the opportunity for an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Mr. LOTT. But he did send a cloture motion up to limit debate on that \nissue, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator can characterize my position in any way that \nhe likes to. It is a routine procedure around here.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the point I am trying to make.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will wait until I can be recognized in my own right, \nand I will address the Senate then.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my point. That happens around here. Cloture motions \nare not unusual. Second-degree amendments are not unusual. So we are \nstrictly playing by the rules, and we would not have it any other way. \nI appreciate the cooperation, frankly, that we get from the Democratic \nleader. We have been working together for the last 2, 3 days to try to \nfind a good solution to how we vote on these issues.\n  Now, with regard to the TEAM Act, I want to make a couple of points, \nagain, on why we are advancing this legislation and what it does. I \ncall it freedom in the workplace, not the TEAM Act, because most folks \ndo not realize what that is. We would like for employees and employers \nto be able to work together, to have teams in the workplace in order to \npromote safety and greater productivity. There are all kinds of \nbenefits that will come from that.\n  Why, then, are we pushing this? Because the point has been made that, \nwell, this is already occurring. Some 30,000 companies, maybe, have \nsome sort of team arrangements. There is a good reason for it. The \nNational Labor Relations Board, in some of its rulings, and the courts, \nhave been putting a chill on these relationships. They are beginning to \nstop them. There was one court decision that said when an employee \nnotified the employer that there was a problem with one of the \nelectrical devices, that was ruled to be improper under the current \nlaws. So there needs to be some clarification of this.\n  As a matter of fact, the President indicated he thought this was a \ngood approach. In his State of the Union Address earlier this year, he \nsaid, ``When\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\ncompanies and workers work as a team, they do better, and so does \nAmerica.''\n  So, that is what we are trying to do here. This bill simply amends \nthe Federal laws to make it clear that employers and employees may meet \ntogether in committee, or other employee involvement programs, to \naddress issues of mutual concern, such as quality, productivity, and \nefficiency. So it expressly says, also, that they cannot engage in \ncollective bargaining. It expressly forbids company unions and sham \nunions. It simply lets workers and employers try to work as a team.\n  I am amazed that there is such concern about this. But my attitude on \nthat, also, is that if there are some amendments that can be offered on \nthat and we can debate it and have votes, if they pass, fine, and if \nthey do not, fine. But this is something we ought to move on.\n  One other point, in terms of trying to block people or limit the free \nexpression of ideas here. As a matter of fact, we have done a little \nresearch, and we have found that in the 104th Congress, there has been \na need for cloture motions more than in any recent time. In fact, in \nthe 102d Congress, there were 42 cloture motions filed, and in the \n103d, 47; but in the 104th Congress, it has been necessary, already, to \nfile 63 cloture motions.\n  Let me give one example of how ridiculous this really is. S. 1, the \nfirst bill we considered last year, on unfunded mandates, had broad \nsupport and passed overwhelmingly. I think the vote was 98 to 2, or \nsomething like that. It was overwhelming, whatever the final vote \nwas. But we had to file four cloture motions to try to get it to come \nto conclusion, and get a vote on it.\n\n  So I really find it sort of surprising when our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle seem to hint that we have been trying to cut \nthem off. That has not been the case. But we have a responsibility to \ntry to get the work done around here. Yes. Let us have free debate. But \nafter a certain period of time you have to get down to voting. That is \nwhat we are trying to set up with our process this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4921-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I also am pleased to release today draft \nlegislation to reauthorize the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. The \ndraft would provide a simple reauthorization of $250 million each year \nfor the fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. It is my hope that by then, \npublic broadcasting would no longer need a reauthorization, but would \nhave the resources to thrive on its own.\n  Last year we began a very worthwhile debate about the future \ndirection of public broadcasting. Survival was never a real issue. I \nbelieve public broadcasting will do more than just survive--it will \nthrive. Public broadcasting is a success story still being written. I \nam confident of this. Public broadcasting offers a quality product \nsupported by quality individuals who care about what people, especially \nyoung people, see or hear on television and radio.\n  It was in part due to my confidence in public broadcasting that I \nproposed last year to put public broadcasting on a glide path to \nindependence from Washington--independent from Congress and independent \nfrom the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I support public \nbroadcasting. Yet, I've never quite understood the logic of the funding \nprocess. There has to be a better way to fund public broadcasting than \nthrough CPB, which soaks up a large share of funding before it ever \ngets to the 350 public television stations and 629 public radio \nstations. A large chunk comes right back here to D.C. to buy \nprogramming disproportionately produced in the largest media markets. \nThere just has to be a better way--especially for small city \nbroadcasters.\n  Last year's debate produced some much-needed innovations. Public \nbroadcasting has improved as a result. I called on public broadcasting \nto take advantage of the popularity and value of its wonderful \nprogramming. They're doing so now. Last year, new ancillary agreements \nwere reached that will see a larger portion of merchandise revenue from \npublic broadcasting products go right back to public broadcasting. \nMedia alliances have been formed with MCI and Turner to distribute \npublic broadcasting programs on video and CD-ROM's. Even PBS has \ndiscovered that its logo generates revenue. Foreign markets are an \nuntapped source for programming and products. Even the Internet offers \nenormous potential for public broadcasting, both as a conduit for \nclassroom-based, interactive educational programming and as a base to \nmarket its products. In short, we really haven't begun to tap the \nenormous funding potential of public broadcasting in the worldwide \nmarketplace.\n  I also believe we must continue to push for greater efficiencies \nwithin CPB--reforms that also can free up revenues. Will all these \npotential funding sources and markets allow public broadcasting to \nachieve financial independence? It's a question that we should explore.\n  So today I am circulating a discussion draft that would not only \nreauthorize public broadcasting, but also explore and chart a path \ntoward independence. The first way is to give public broadcasting tools \nto generate more revenue. My draft legislation would give public \nbroadcasting enhanced underwriting authority--enough to draw in new \ncorporate sponsors but not too far to undermine the noncommercial \nintegrity of public broadcasting. The draft also would allow public \nbroadcasting stations to use overlapping station capacity to generate \nrevenue.\n  These proposals would allow some stations to benefit. However, if all \nof public broadcasting is to thrive, especially smaller stations such \nas in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana, we need to bring the \nbest people in finance, government and broadcasting together to chart a \ncourse for independence. To do this, the draft proposes creation of a \nCommission on Public Broadcasting Empowerment. This commission would \nhave 2 years to submit recommendations to Congress that would: foster \nlong-term funding for public broadcasting that would not compromise its \nessential noncommercial nature; improve economic efficiencies within \npublic broadcasting; guarantee universal access to public broadcasting, \nparticularly in rural, under served areas; and stimulate the \ndevelopment of regional programming centers in order to increase \ngeographic diversity in the origination of programming.\n\n  Finally, the draft would authorize the creation of a trust fund to be \nused to generate sufficient capital for public broadcasting to achieve \nfinancial independence. This trust fund approach was first proposed by \nthe public broadcasters late last year. The public broadcasters \nproposed a more far-reaching approach that would enable a private trust \nto generate funds through the management of advanced spectrum and the \nleasing of unused spectrum for commercial purposes. This thoughtful \nproposal has merit. I support the creation of a trust fund. I believe \nthat the draft spectrum legislation I have proposed today would provide \npublic broadcasters with the resources needed to capitalize a trust \nfund in a way that would benefit the entire public broadcasting \ncommunity--radio and television, in markets large and small.\n  Because this proposal would bring major change to public \nbroadcasting, it deserves careful review. I'm already beginning that \nreview.\n  Clearly, financial independence will be a key issue. However, other \nreforms are needed, particularly in the distribution of funds for \nbroadcasting and programming. I am particularly interested in reforms \nthat will enhance the capabilities and creativity of small city and \nrural broadcasters. In small cities and towns, public broadcasting is \nvital. South Dakota Public Radio [SDPR], for example, provides pool \ncoverage to commercial stations around the State for legislative \nreporting, because it has the only radio news reporter on duty during \nthe legislative session. In some markets, SDPR is the sole radio \nprovider of local news, and the exclusive source of Emergency Broadcast \nSystem announcements.\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n  For SDPR and similar radio and television stations, continued \noversight by Congress is important to ensure they receive their fair \nshare of the public broadcasting dollar. I would like to see public \nbroadcasting be a self-sustaining operation, but I will not forego \ncongressional oversight responsibilities, nor support a disbursement of \nfunds from any trust fund until I am satisfied that there are legal and \ncontractual safeguards in place that will protect the financial and \nprogramming interests of small city and rural broadcasters.\n  What kind of safeguards? First and foremost, there should be service \nrequirements that public broadcasting should follow. As you know, \ntelephone companies are required to provide universal service to its \ncustomers, regardless of their location. Public broadcasting should be \nrequired to fulfill a similar standard--universal access for all \nAmericans.\n  Second, any future trust fund should have a formula that recognizes \nthe unique roles of small city broadcasters and the need to achieve \nuniversal access goals.\n  Third, I support giving small broadcasters a share of any revenue \ngenerated through enhanced underwriting. A similar arrangement exists \nwith major networks and their affiliates--large and small. It makes \nsense. It's simple fairness. Large and small stations that broadcast \nunderwritten programming contribute to the exposure of the corporate \nsponsor to the viewing public. They should benefit.\n  Fourth, we should be encouraging the development of regional \nprogramming outlets. At present, there is a disproportionate \nconcentration of program development in the large cities. Regional \nprogramming will not only further the diversity of public broadcasting, \nbut improve viewership in these areas.\n  So, in conclusion, there are a number of issues worth discussing. \nFunding sources and funding distribution are the two key issues. I am \nhopeful that the proposed Commission on Public Broadcasting Empowerment \nwill help lay the groundwork for both financial independence and \ndistribution fairness. The funding sources may change, new technologies \nmay emerge, but the central mission of public broadcasting--to be a \ndependable source of educational, community-based programming--is \nstrong and growing stronger. That's a credit to the people in the \ncommunities that make it all happen.\n  This draft is a starting point. I look forward to working with the \npublic broadcasting community and my colleagues on both sides of aisle \nto improve this draft and pass a bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this draft be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the draft was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to take another step in my \noverall telecommunications and information policy reform agenda. As I \nhave stated many times, the historic enactment earlier this year of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 was only the first step in a new \nnational telecommunications policy for 21st Century America.\n  Today, I am putting out for public comment a discussion draft of \nspectrum reform legislation to institute comprehensive reforms in how \nthe Federal Government uses--and fails to use--our most important \nvaluable national resource, the radio frequency spectrum.\n\n\n                       The Spectrum and Its Uses\n\n  The radio spectrum is to the information age what oil and steel where \nto the Industrial Age. Like any resource, it is finite. Therefore it \nmust be managed responsibly.\n  This valuable resource is one of the principle building blocks for \ntomorrow's ``Information Economy.'' It also is critical to delivering \nnew and valuable services to the American public.\n  All of us have seen the contribution traditional radio-based \nservices--such as public and commercial broadcasting--have made to our \nnational life. We have seen the benefits of low-cost satellite \ncommunications, which have enormously expanded the range of news, \ninformation, and entertainment\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\nchoices. We have seen the proven value of cellular radiotelephones. In \naddition, there are an array of other critical radio-based \ncommunications services--everything from the radar systems so important \nto air traffic control, to the radios policemen, firemen, and \nambulances use, to communications networks central to maintaining a \nstrong national defense.\n  From its very beginning, wireless communication has played a vital \nrole in protecting lives and property. Through the development of radio \nand television broadcasting, it has delivered information and \nentertainment programming to the public at large. More recently, \nwireless, spectrum-based telecommunications services, products and \ntechnologies have proven indispensable enablers and drivers of \nproductivity and economic growth, as well as international \ncompetitiveness.\n  Wireless technology can deliver telecommunications and information \nservices directly to individuals on the move. No longer is being away \nfrom the office desk or factory floor an impediment to doing business. \nFixed locations that cannot be served economically by wireline \nfacilities because of physical infeasibility or prohibitively high \ncosts are made accessible. Wireless services also are critically \nimportant in bringing competition to the wireline telephone network--\none of the key goals of the Telecommunications Act.\n  Today, there is an almost limitless demand for the use of this \nspectrum. In other words, the spectrum is an enormously valuable, yet \nfinite natural resource. This is the crux of the problem with our \ncurrent spectrum policy structure. Unless a reformation plan is \ndeveloped to create a more effective and efficient use of the spectrum, \na vast array of new spectrum-based products, services, and technologies \nwill go unrealized for the American people.\n\n\n                               The Future\n\n  We are on the cusp of great change. Over the past couple of years, we \nin the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] have \naccelerated the deployment of a whole new generation of pocket phones--\nso-called ``Personal Communications Services.'' Just this spring, the \nFCC authorized a new generation of wireless computers--radio-based \nsystems that may make it possible for us to interconnect our schools \nand provide our students with access to the Internet on a low-cost, \nhighly, effective basis.\n  America has pioneered the development of digital television. Later \nthis year, actual digital broadcast operations may begin. By the turn \nof the century--less than 4 years from now--we could have the \nequivalent of a digital overlay network in the United States, relying \non a new electronic infrastructure broadcasters hope to put in place.\n  These and other accomplishments have been achieved despite a \nregulatory framework that dates to the days of Marconi. It is a policy \ndesigned for an environment characterized by stable technology and \nstable, predictable demand for very basic communications. Under this \nantiquated model, the Government--not consumers--largely decides who \nuses frequencies, what they are used for, and how they are used--a \ngovernment-sponsored electronic industrial policy.\n  This system is slow. It is anticompetitive. It is antifree speech.\n\n\n                  Inefficiencies in the Current Policy\n\n  As with other systems of central planning, the spectrum management \nsystem currently utilized in the United States tends to result in \ninefficient use of the spectrum resource. Federal regulators --rather \nthan consumers--decide whether taxis, telephone service, broadcasters, \nor foresters are in greatest need of spectrum. Not surprisingly it is a \nhighly politicized process. Most important, new services, products and \ntechnologies are delayed or, worse yet, denied. This obviously harms \nconsumers.\n  Consider cellular phones, the lengthy delay in making cellular \ntelephone service available imposed tremendous cost on the economy. One \nstudy estimated the delay cost the economy $86 billion. As important, \nAmerican consumers were denied a new productivity and security tool for \nmany years.\n  Equally troubling, the system constrains competition. One of the most \nimportant qualities of a competitive industry is the ability of new \nfirms to enter the business. Yet, the bureaucratic allocation process \ntypically provides for a set number of licenses for each service. This \nprecludes additional competitors. Only two cellular franchises, for \ninstance, are allowed in each market.\n  Delays associated with the allocation and assignment processes, while \nperhaps acceptable in a slow changing world, are seriously out of step \nwith the fast-changing, high-technology world of today. Pressures on \nthe traditional radio frequency management structure are increasing. \nDemand for channels is outstripping supply.\n  The current environment hobbles progress. It makes it hard for \ninnovators to gain access to the radio spectrum resources they need to \ndeliver technology's promise to the American people.\n  Another problem with current policy is that the Federal Government \nalone claims nearly one-third of this critical resource for itself. \nSince 1992, there has been a bipartisan commitment to privatize some of \nthe spectrum the Government has warehoused. Among the benefits of that \nbipartisan effort has been a series of spectrum auctions. Those \nauctions have produced more than $20 billion for the U.S. Treasury. \nAlthough spectrum auctions have provided significant revenues for the \nU.S. Treasury, the overriding policy reason for adopting a spectrum \nauction policy is not--I repeat not--to provide more money for the \nGovernment.\n  Much more important, spectrum auctions have accelerated access to the \nresource by private sector entrepreneurs. The key policy goal achieved \nwith auctions is placing the spectrum resource in the hands of those \nwho value it most highly. Those who will put it to its best, highest \nvalued use.\n  The FCC's current auction authority expires in 1998. We need to \naddress these issues before then. We then ought to make the FCC's \nauction authority permanent.\n  But as I stated here on the Senate floor on March 13 much more \ndefinitely needs to be done.\n  Under the comprehensive discussion draft of spectrum reform \nlegislation I am unveiling today, a far reaching series of reforms \nwould be initiated.\n\n\n          Spectrum Auction Authority and Exhaustive Licensing\n\n  The spectrum reform discussion draft would expand the FCC's spectrum \nauction authority. This change would, once and for all, place the \nspectrum issue outside of the budget context and squarely in the arena \nof communications policy.\n  The FCC also would be required to exhaustively license all available \nspectrum by selecting bands of unallocated and unassigned frequencies \nto be auctioned. Any existing licensees in these bands would be \nprotected and grandfathered. Indeed, they would gain flexibility in use \nwithin their actual or implied service area and spectrum block. The FCC \nis directed to maximize the value of spectrum licenses by selecting \nbroad, low frequency bands of contiguous spectrum that are not fully \nassigned. The spectrum licensee seeking flexibility in use also may \napply for any adjacent or cochannel spectrum contiguous to its existing \nlicense that is allocated but unassigned.\n\n\n                          Spectrum Flexibility\n\n  The key reform contained in this discussion draft is freedom in \nspectrum use. While important, auctions are not the most important \nreform contained in this legislation. Much more important is replacing \nthe current Government mandated industrial policy system with a market-\nbased approach.\n  Auctions only tell you who gets a license. We now need to discuss \nwhat the license allows you to do.\n  Like land, the Government shouldn't tell people what they can do with \nfrequencies. So long as they don't interfere with their neighbors, they \nshould be able to use it for whatever consumers want.\n  Like newspapers, the Government shouldn't tell broadcasters what they \nsay or how they say it. That should be up to viewers.\n  Simply put, frequencies should be treated more like private property.\n  However, in making these policy changes we should build on the \ncurrent system. Many licensees already have a great deal of flexibility \nin what they can do. Let's build on that and give them more freedoms.\n  Mr. President, at the core of the spectrum reform I am today \nproposing is the concept of spectrum flexibility. Flexibility for a \nchanging world.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n  For instance, radio frequency management historically has limited the \npermissible uses of allocated bands and assigned channels. This, in \npart, has been a function of technology, as well as the characteristics \nassociated with particular frequencies.\n  For example, channels allocated to the Forest Products Service \ntraditionally have been quite low frequencies. This is because those \nfrequencies have been shown to have the greatest ability to penetrate \nunderbrush, leaves, and other obstructions naturally occurring in a \nforest. New digital communications technologies have gone a long way \ntoward changing this reality. Today's digital technology includes error \ncorrection and other features which lessen interference.\n  Another good example of why today's technology requires increased \nspectrum flexibility occurs in spread spectrum and digital overlay. \nThese techniques make it possible for multiple communications pathways \nto be established within the same radio frequency channel. In other \nwords, using this technology, broadcasters could transmit \ncommunications in addition to video and sound signals. Radio broadcast \nchannels today, for example, already provide local links for paging \noperations. Government policy must allow multiple, more intensive use \nof radio frequency resources where there is no perceptible adverse \ntechnical impact.\n  Allowing radio frequency licensees greater flexibility also could \nfacilitate equipment and systems modernization and upgrading in the \npublic sector. This would enhance public safety. For example, many \npublic communications systems today are in need of modernization, to \nmeet the demand for more cost-effective and responsive law enforcement, \nfire safety, and emergency medical services. At the same time, the \nfinancial resources available to many public safety communications \norganizations are quite limited.\n  If local police forces were permitted greater flexibility in use of \ntheir channels, however, this challenge would be less severe. Switching \nto new digital communications techniques typically achieves a \nsignificant increase in the total number of channels available--in some \ncases, by a factor of four or more. Thus, a local police department \ncould increase the number of channels available to support its \noperations and, at the same time, have capacity available which it \ncould lease or barter with private communications organizations. Such \narrangements could generate the funds needed to finance modernization.\n  Greater flexibility is a public interest win-win situation--an option \nthat benefits all involved and affords the general public both better \nservice and more communications options.\n  The FCC already has taken steps to allow some radio licensees more \nflexible use. The Commission's cellular radiotelephone rules, for \nexample, place few constraints on permissible communications. The same \nis true in the case of the new PCS services. What is needed, however, \nis far greater application of this fundamental principle of flexible \nspectrum use. My bill does just that.\n  Under this discussion draft, each existing and future licensee would \nhave increased flexibility in use including: The right to use assigned \nspectrum for any service, under any regulatory classification, and \nunder any technical parameters. In addition, the licenses would have \nthe right to freely transfer the license to others.\n  The flexible use would have to be within the licensee's existing or \nimplied service area and spectrum block and could not be inconsistent \nwith international treaty obligations of the United States. The \nspectrum licensee also would bear the burden of showing any new use was \nwithin the existing or implied service area and spectrum block.\n\n\n                         Spectrum Privatization\n\n  Another major feature of the draft legislation is spectrum \nprivatization. Simply put, under the discussion draft, the Federal \nGovernment would be obliged to relinquish one-quarter of its spectrum \nstockpile. Spectrum auctions would be held to place that spectrum into \nthe hands of the public as quickly as possible. In addition, Government \nagencies would be required to rely, to the maximum extent possible, on \nthe private sector to meet their radiocommunications needs. Taking into \naccount the taxes paid, if nothing else, this would definitely help the \npublic and strengthen the American information technology economy.\n\n\n                   Spectrum Management Consolidation\n\n  The discussion draft would place the responsibility for managing the \nspectrum in the United States solely with the FCC. The Commission would \nbe required to factor in critical national defense, law enforcement, \nand national policy priorities. However, the current regime divides \nresponsibility between the FCC and the Department of Commerce, would be \nstreamlined. This would improve the overall management process. It also \nwould increase accountability.\n\n\n                        Self-Managed Regulation\n\n  One of the more promising options for radio frequency management \nreform is expanded use of self-managed regulation--the use of private \nsector radio frequency coordinator groups to handle routine \nengineering, frequency coordination, and other functions which, in the \npast, typically had been undertaken by FCC staff.\n  At present, the FCC relies on frequency coordinators to handle many \nof the routine chores associated with private mobile radio systems. \nOrganizations such as the National Association of Business & \nEducational Radio [NABER], the Associated Public-Safety Communications \nOfficers [APCO], and the Special Industrial Radio Service Association \n[SIRSA] process applications, conduct engineering surveys, and \notherwise facilitate licensing and channel usage in these specific \nprivate radio services. The FCC does not generally rely on frequency \ncoordinators, however, with regard to broadcast services, satellite \ncommunications, and other large frequency using services.\n  The task of being a frequency coordinator depends, in large part, \nupon two things: Access to computerized data bases; and some expertise \nin radio frequency engineering. Access to data bases today, of course, \nis routine. At the same time the number of individuals with substantial \nradio frequency management expertise is growing. This is due in part to \nFederal Government and defense agency downsizing. There is, in short, \nno good reason to assume that multiple frequency coordinators could not \nbe sanctioned by the FCC. This would have the effect of broadening \nusers' options.\n  Competition among frequency coordinator groups, moreover, should have \nthe effect of ensuring efficient charges and effective, responsive \noperations. That has been true in virtually every market in which \ncompetition has been introduced. It should prove true in this case as \nwell. That is why the discussion draft directs the FCC to expand \nsubstantially the agency's use of private sector frequency coordinator \ngroups.\n\n\n                         Public Safety Spectrum\n\n  The draft legislation also directs the FCC to make spectrum block \ngrants to States for public safety spectrum needs. In lieu of \nprocessing, issuing, and renewing tens of thousands of public safety \ncommunications licenses--at significant cost to licensees, as well as \nthe FCC--the agency would issue 55 block grants to the chief executive \nofficer of each State, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and \nthe District of Columbia. It would then be the responsibility of State \nGovernors to determine eligibility, to ensure compliance with standard \nFCC--and other--operating rules, and to resolve disputes among public \nsafety licensees within their jurisdiction.\n\n  This reform would reduce delays and heighten responsiveness to actual \nuser requirements. It would lessen substantially the burdens of \ntraditional regulation now borne by the FCC. Most important, it would \ntend to ensure more and better public safety communications for State \nresidents.\n\n\n                     Broadcast Television Spectrum\n\n  Mr. President, this draft legislation also would resolve the \ncontroversy that has surrounded the digital--or high-definition--\ntelevision issue. It would speed up the migration of broadcast \ntelevision to digital channels. At the same time, it would firm up the \nplans which have been announced regarding the retrocession of one 6 Mhz \nchannel--assets which could be used for many purposes in addition to \nstraight broadcast television.\n  Spectrum in the VHF and UHF television bands has the potential of \nbeing extremely valuable for a variety of\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nuses. Current licensing policy, however, keeps this spectrum locked up \nin a single, narrowly defined use. The fundamental thrust of this \nalternative broadcast TV spectrum policy is to allow markets to guide \nthe spectrum to its highest valued use, while preserving the current \nlevel of free television service, noncompetitively assigning an \nadditional 6 MHz to each existing NTSC licensee, and ensuring the \npublic is fairly compensated for the use of spectrum. This alternative \nproposal recognizes the equities of incumbent full power broadcast \nlicensees in the band to fully and fairly compete in the digital era, \nmost especially their desire to convert to digital technology. At the \nsame time--and let me be very clear on this point--it will maintain the \ncurrent level of free television service for American consumers.\n\n\n                          The Need for Reform\n\n  Mr. President, we enacted comprehensive telecommunications \nlegislation earlier this year for one very simple reason. It became \nmore and more apparent to all of us that the traditional, highly \nbureaucratized telecommunications regulatory system no longer served \nthe public's best interest. There were unexplainable delays. New \nservices were not being offered. New investment and job opportunities \nwere not materializing fast enough.\n  The oldtime telecommunications regulatory system, in short, had \nbecome the classical regulatory bottleneck. It was stalling forward \nprogress. As a result--after nearly two decades of struggling with \nthese issues--this Congress developed and enacted comprehensive reform \nlegislation.\n  The discussion draft I am unveiling today is very much the other side \nof that fundamental regulatory reform equation. It addresses issues and \nchoices that Congress, the FCC, and the executive branch have wrestled \nwith for years. The approach is fair and balanced--and, balanced very \nmuch in terms of helping the American public while strengthening \nnational competitiveness. I believe it could usher in a dynamic, \nvibrant ``Wireless Era'' in which American entrepreneurial capitalism \nleads the world into a robust high-technology future that will benefit \nall Americans.\n  Congress has spent years examining the way we manage other natural \nresources--from water, grazing, and timber issues so critical to my \npart of the country, to the fisheries vitally important to the \nNortheast, the Northwest, and, of course, Alaska. The natural resource \nthis draft legislation focuses upon is just as important to America.\n  This discussion draft was crafted in consultation with a wide range \nof engineering, economic, and public policy experts. It is based, in \nlarge part, upon the extensive open hearings which the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation has conducted over the past \nfew years.\n  This is a worthy regulatory reform initiative. It could pay enormous \npublic policy dividends. Let me stress, however, that the unveiling of \nthis discussion draft is merely the beginning of what I hope will be a \nspirited, robust debate. I look forward to continuing to work \ncooperatively with all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House to \ndevelop sound, consensus legislation that can be introduced in the near \nfuture. I also want to encourage all affected parties to provide \ncomments to the committee regarding this proposal.\n  Mr. President, the radio frequency management and use reforms \ncontained in this spectrum reform discussion draft hold significant \npromise. They would reduce regulatory burdens. They would foster \nimportant public policies including advances in technology and \ninnovation, greater choice and more customer options, and more \neffective, efficient, and responsive use of this valuable national \nresource.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \ndiscussion draft together with the draft legislative language itself be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of Pressler Spectrum Bill Discussion Draft: The Electromagnetic \n        Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act\n\n\n                       Spectrum Auction Authority\n\n       Permanent Authority. FCC's spectrum auction authority is \n     extended and made permanent.\n       Expanded Authority. FCC's spectrum auction authority to \n     make spectrum license assignments is expanded with the \n     following limited exceptions: non-mutually exclusive \n     applications; public safety services; digital television \n     licenses for broadcasters; and spectrum and associated orbits \n     within an international satellite system. FCC's auction \n     authority also expanded to include allocations, where \n     consistent with the Act.\n       Exhaustive Licensing. FCC required to exhaustively license \n     all available spectrum by selecting bands of unallocated and \n     unassigned frequencies to be auctioned. Any existing \n     licensees in these bands will be protected and grandfathered \n     and gain flexibility in use within their actual or implied \n     service area and spectrum block. FCC is directed to maximize \n     the value of spectrum licenses by selecting broad, low \n     frequency bands of contiguous spectrum that are not fully \n     assigned.\n\n\n              Voluntary Reallocation--Spectrum Flexibility\n\n       Flexibility In Use. Each existing and future nonbroadcast \n     licensee will have flexibility in use which includes: the \n     right to use assigned spectrum for any service; under any \n     regulatory classification; under any technical parameters; \n     and the right to freely transfer this right to others.\n       Limitations. The flexible use must be within the licensee's \n     existing or implied service area and spectrum block and \n     cannot be inconsistent with international treaty obligations \n     of the United States. The spectrum licensee bears the burden \n     of showing that any new use is within the existing or implied \n     service area and spectrum block.\n       The spectrum licensee seeking flexibility in use may also \n     apply for any adjacent or cochannel spectrum contiguous to \n     its existing license that is allocated but unassigned.\n\n\n                       Government Spectrum Users\n\n       Flexibility In Use. Government spectrum users are also \n     granted spectrum flexibility rights, including the right to \n     transfer any spectrum rights now assigned to them to any \n     government or private sector entity and to receive \n     compensation for rights transferred.\n       Privatization. The Federal government is required to make \n     an additional 25 percent of its exclusive or shared spectrum \n     below 5 GHz available to the FCC for allocation to private \n     sector spectrum licensees using spectrum auctions.\n       BRAC-Like Commission. A Presidentially appointed Advisory \n     Committee On Withdrawal will be established to determine how \n     to make available the 25 percent of spectrum for \n     privatization and to determine what, if any, amount of \n     spectrum beyond the mandatory 25 percent which will be made \n     available to the private sector over a period of 10 years.\n       Financial Incentives. To encourage government agency and \n     personnel cooperation, financial incentives will be developed \n     to reward them for opening more spectrum for private sector \n     use.\n       Relocation Compensation. Federal government users are \n     allowed to accept compensation, including in-kind \n     reimbursement of costs, from any entity to defray the costs \n     of relocating the Federal entities operations from one set of \n     spectrum frequencies to another.\n       Additional Privatization. The Act adopts as statutory law \n     OMB's Circular A-76 which requires Federal agencies to \n     undertake an extensive cost-benefit analysis prior to \n     vertically integrating or continuing to vertically integrate \n     to meet their needs, and to take into account taxes forgone \n     when the Government chooses to make rather than buy products \n     or services to meet its needs. A-76 analysis has simply not \n     been consistently--nor continuously--applied to Government \n     radio communications requirements. The new bill changes that \n     by obliging Federal agencies to systematically review their \n     communications systems and operations, and shift to private \n     sector suppliers wherever feasible.\n       Technology Teaming. The number of communications channels \n     can be significantly multiplied if the analog communications \n     facilities used by many Federal agencies were changed to \n     digital. Federal agencies will be required to team with a \n     private company to install advanced, digital capability and \n     increased capacity, which in turn can be equitably \n     apportioned between agency and private partner.\n       Multi-Agency Systems. Federal agencies will be required to \n     explore not only the availability of private sector suppliers \n     but also other government agency suppliers. Today each \n     Federal agency maintains--and jealously guards--its own \n     system. As a result, there are very few ``common user'' \n     systems.\n\n\n         Consolidation of Federal Spectrum Management Function\n\n       NTIA Eliminated. Management of spectrum for Federal \n     government agencies, together with the IRAC Secretariat and \n     associated support activities, is transferred from NTIA to \n     the FCC.\n       National Security Safety Valve. The President may veto any \n     FCC action which limits the amount of spectrum available to \n     government users, limits the uses to which spectrum may be \n     put, or interferes with or compromises Federal use, if such \n     action substantially harms national security or public \n     safety.\n\n\n                         Non-Exclusive Licenses\n\n       For non-exclusive spectrum licenses not assigned by \n     spectrum auction, the FCC will\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n     have the authority to use other economic incentives, \n     including user fees, to ensure that spectrum is assigned and \n     used efficiently and that the public is fairly compensated \n     for the use of the spectrum.\n\n\n                        Self Managed Regulation\n\n       FCC is directed to substantially expand its use of private \n     sector frequency coordinator groups thus reducing need for \n     FCC in house engineering.\n\n\n                  Public Safety Spectrum Block Grants\n\n       Each State will assume responsibility as a block grant \n     licensee for managing the spectrum currently allocated to \n     public safety uses within its State boundaries.\n       Each State may grant licensees the same flexibility in use \n     available to private FCC licensees.\n       Interference disputes between the States will be resolved \n     by the FCC.\n\n\n  Broadcast TV Spectrum--Deposit, Return and Overlay (A Market-Based \n  Alternative To A Government Mandated And Dictated Transition Policy)\n\n       Purpose. Spectrum in the VHF and UHF television bands is \n     potentially extremely valuable for a variety of uses. Current \n     licensing policy, however, keeps this spectrum ``locked up'' \n     in a single, narrowly defined use. The fundamental thrust of \n     this alternative broadcast TV spectrum policy is to allow \n     markets to guide the spectrum to its highest valued use (as \n     up front spectrum auctions would) while preserving the \n     current level of free television service, noncompetitively \n     assigning an additional 6 MHz to each existing NTSC licensee, \n     and ensuring the public is fairly compensated for the use of \n     spectrum. This alternative proposal recognizes the equities \n     of incumbent full power broadcast licensees in the band to \n     fully and fairly compete in the digital era, most especially \n     their desire to convert to digital technology. At the same \n     time it will maintain the current level of free television \n     service for American consumers.\n       No Standards Setting. FCC is specifically precluded from \n     mandating an HDTV or digital television (DTV) standard for \n     broadcast licensees or establishing a requirement that all TV \n     sets sold or imported must be digital compatible by a date \n     certain.\n       Deposit. One 6 MHz DTV channel will be assigned non-\n     competitively to each existing NTSC licensee. Each existing \n     NTSC licensee will have the choice of receiving a DTV license \n     for payment of a fee (Deposit) or to simply keep their \n     existing NTSC license and relinquishing their right to the \n     DTV license. The deposit will be based on the market value of \n     the license determined by the auction of the overlay licenses \n     (see below). Any DTV licenses not accepted will be auctioned \n     by the FCC as part of an overlay license.\n       Return. The money deposited for the DTV license can be paid \n     in installments over a period of 15 years with the money \n     going into an escrow account. Interest accrued will go to the \n     U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. After 15 years from the \n     date the FCC assigns a DTV license, the broadcast licensee \n     can relinquish a 6 MHz license and reclaim the full amount of \n     its deposit (Return), less interest accrued, or continue to \n     maintain NTSC and/or DTV license operations as outlined \n     below. The amount of the deposit returned to the broadcast \n     licensee will decrease 20 percent for each year that the \n     return of a 6 MHz channel is delayed past 15 years.\n       DTV Flexibility/Transferability. DTV licensees will have \n     full flexibility, without imposition of economic fees as \n     required in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to use their \n     assigned DTV channels within their designated service area \n     for any service consistent with the technical limits imposed \n     by the FCC to prevent interference to NTSC and other DTV \n     assignments. DTV licensees may voluntarily transfer their \n     license at any time, separate from or together with their \n     existing NTSC channel.\n       No Mandates. DTV licensees will not be required to meet a \n     minimum service requirement or construction schedule.\n       Protecting Consumer Investment. Existing full power NTSC \n     stations will be grandfathered indefinitely. An NTSC licensee \n     will be permitted to continue providing standard NTSC \n     television service or to transfer its license to another \n     party who will then become the NTSC licensee.\n       NTSC Flexibility Subject To Replacement Of Free Service. An \n     NTSC licensee will also be given flexibility within its \n     assigned channel and service area to provide any services, \n     without imposition of economic fees as required in the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996, other than standard NTSC \n     service subject to technical limits imposed by the FCC to \n     prevent interference to DTV and other NTSC assignments. \n     Before any NTSC service may be reduced or discontinued, \n     however, the NTSC licensee must have provided a comparable \n     free replacement for such service including necessary \n     receiving equipment to allow such service to be displayed on \n     standard NTSC receivers.\n       Exhaustive Licensing. FCC will define overlay licenses \n     collectively covering all 402 MHz of spectrum in the current \n     VHF and UHF TV bands and covering the entire U.S. Each \n     overlay license will cover a block of one or more contiguous \n     6 MHz channels and a contiguous geographic area. The FCC will \n     determine the appropriate spectrum block and area size.\n       Overlay Auction. Overlay licenses to exhaustively fill the \n     entire 402 MHz allotted for television broadcasting in each \n     market will be assigned by a simultaneous, multiple round \n     auction.\n       Overlay Flexibility. Within its defined spectrum block and \n     service area, an overlay licensee will be permitted to \n     implement any service, subject to power limits defined by the \n     FCC at the boundaries of such spectrum block and service \n     area, and subject to additional technical restrictions as may \n     be imposed by the FCC to protect NTSC and DTV licensees from \n     harmful interference.\n       Overlay licenses will be freely transferable.\n       Overlay licenses may be aggregated to create larger service \n     areas and spectrum blocks.\n\n\n                            Spectrum Report\n\n       After 2 years the FCC will prepare a cost-benefit report on \n     the results of the legislation together with any \n     recommendations for additional legislation.\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electromagnetic Spectrum \n     Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) New applications of wireless communications \n     technologies await access to the electromagnetic spectrum to \n     provide innovative services to the public.\n       (2) The spectrum, however, is often characterized as \n     overcrowded and filled to capacity with current allocations.\n       (3) Capacity may now be underutilized due to the use of \n     obsolete technologies, while bands with great promise for \n     delivering better quality communications products to \n     consumers fail to realize their potential.\n       (4) This seeming paradox may be the result of a regulatory \n     structure that is increasingly inefficient in the dynamic \n     worlds of telecommunications and information technologies.\n       (5) This inefficiency results from structural defects in \n     the system itself, not in the expertise of, or competence at, \n     the regulatory agencies.\n       (6) Central allocation mechanisms provide insufficient \n     information with which to rank competing uses for spectrum, \n     or competing technologies for delivering those uses.\n       (7) Approximately one-third of the usable spectrum is \n     allocated to government or otherwise unavailable for private \n     sector use. Innovations to help and encourage the government \n     to use spectrum more efficiently should be adopted.\n       (8) The dramatic acceleration in the pace of technological \n     change and the increasing complexity of allocation and \n     assignment decisions make the case for an overhaul of the \n     current system more compelling than ever before.\n       (9) Lack of capital and outmoded equipment have led to \n     inefficient utilization of the spectrum bands used by Federal \n     agencies and public safety users.\n       (10) The management of spectrum can be substantially \n     reformed by giving most licensees the freedom and incentive \n     to use the spectrum more efficiently.\n       (11) In particular, within its explicit or implicit service \n     area and spectrum block, a licensee should be given--\n       (A) service and technical flexibility;\n       (B) freedom to resell or sublease; and\n       (C) freedom to pick regulatory classification.\n       (12) To get the full benefit of liberalizing existing \n     licenses, currently unassigned or unallocated spectrum will \n     have to be made available in an efficient manner. The \n     Commission will have to exhaustively license this spectrum \n     expeditiously. These new assignments should--\n       (A) be exclusive;\n       (B) provide new licensees marketplace freedoms similar to \n     those enjoyed by existing licensees; and\n       (C) be assigned through simultaneous multiple round \n     auctions where there are mutually exclusive applicants.\n       (13) Similar incentive-based reforms should be adopted for \n     the spectrum used by the Federal government and by the public \n     safety community, including substantial privatization, \n     flexibility in use, financial incentives and compensation for \n     relocation and band clearing, consolidation of the Federal \n     spectrum management function, and spectrum block grants to \n     the States.\n       (14) An alternative broadcast television spectrum policy is \n     needed to allow markets to guide the spectrum to its highest \n     valued use while preserving the current level of free \n     television service, noncompetitively and flexibly assigning \n     an additional 6 megahertz to each existing NTSC licensee, and \n     ensuring that the public is fairly compensated for the use of \n     spectrum.\n       (15) All reforms should encourage private dispute \n     resolution and avoid prolonged administrative delays.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This policy shall apply to all \n     radiocommunications systems first authorized after December \n     31, 1996, and shall be applied to all systems authorized as \n     of that date in accordance with regulations adopted pursuant \n     to this Act.\n       (e) Business-government Radio- communications Partnerships; \n     Technology Teaming.--\n       (1) The Commission, in consultation with the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget, within 6 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act shall adopt rules \n     applicable to all departments, agencies, and \n     instrumentalities of the United States Government that--\n       (A) encourage the utilization, to the greatest extent \n     possible, of previously conducted surveys of all \n     radiocommunications systems operated by such department, \n     agency, or instrumentality for the purpose of increasing the \n     efficiency of those systems; and\n       (B) authorize the head of each department, agency, and \n     instrumentality of the United\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\n     States Government to enter into contracts, leases, \n     partnerships, teaming agreements, and other cooperative \n     business-government arrangements, that will enable the \n     private sector to participate, in whole or significant part, \n     in the upgrading of government radiocommunications systems, \n     and permit an equitable apportionment of the use of such \n     upgraded systems to meet both government as well as private \n     sector needs.\n       (2) Application to legislative and judicial branches.--\n       (A) The congress.--As an exercise of the rulemaking power \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, \n     the regulations promulgated by the Commission under paragraph \n     (1) are deemed to have been adopted by each House of the \n     Congress, respectively, as rules applicable only to that \n     House. The rules so adopted supersede other rules of each \n     House of the Congress only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent with those other rules, and they are enacted \n     with full recognition of the constitutional right of each \n     House to change them, to the extent that they relate to that \n     House, in the same manner and to the same extent as any other \n     rule of that House.\n       (B) The federal judiciary.--The judicial branch of the \n     United States Government is authorized and requested to adopt \n     the regulations promulgated by the Commission under paragraph \n     (1) as applicable to the operations of that branch.\n       (3) Competitive procurement techniques.--Each department, \n     agency, and instrumentality of the United States Government \n     is authorized and encouraged to employ competitive \n     procurement techniques in selecting private sector partners \n     for the purpose of mutually benefiting from the upgrading of \n     technology associated with Federal radiocommunications \n     systems, except that--\n       (A) the head of any such department, agency, or \n     instrumentality may waive compliance with competitive \n     procurement techniques in whole or part, if it is in the \n     government's interests;

Mr. President, during this year when so much discussion\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nis being focused on the future of America, I think it is important for \nus to inventory what it is that has made America a place of opportunity \nand a land which has welcomed individuals with initiative and industry \nfrom around the world. I think one of the key components of the \nAmerican culture which has allowed that to happen has been the \ncomponent of growth. We have understood that the purpose of government \nis to provide a framework for growth, that growth should be the \ncharacteristic which identifies America as the land of opportunity. As \na matter of fact, that citizens and corporations, individuals, and \ninstitutions should enjoy conditions of growth--that is the reason to \nhave government. It is the reason to have public safety, so people can \ngrow and develop. It is the reason to have national defense, so the \nNation can grow. Not that we would have big government, but that we \nwould have a largeness in terms of opportunity and citizenship; so that \nwe could, indeed, meet the needs of the next generation.\n\n  It has been the kind of thing that has allowed us, as a country, to \nwelcome all comers. It is the kind of thing that inspired Emma Lazarus \nto write the poem on the base of the Statue of Liberty:\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:\n       I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\n\n  That is only available--we can only have that kind of optimism about \nthe future--if we have growth, if we promote growth; growth not for the \ngovernment but growth for the community, growth for the citizen, growth \nfor the individual. That is the purpose of government.\n  Yet, during the 1990's we find ourselves with a sense of discomfort, \na sense of dis-ease, if you will, not disease, but dis-ease. We find \nthat workers' wages are stagnant, some of them slipping. And we do not \nhave that sense of growth. We do not find ourselves with that large \nreservoir of confidence that is rightfully American. What should we do? \nWhere are we? People feel that we are adrift.\n  We have a forgotten middle class. It has been detected in the \nPresidential campaigns. It has been understood by people who have been \nout among the voters. You and I have detected it when we have talked to \nfolks. They feel like there is a flatness, there is a staleness.\n  You feel like there has not been any growth. Then you begin to look \nfor a reason. All of a sudden it becomes apparent. The Commerce \nDepartment of the U.S. Government last week told us about growth. It \ntold us about the growth in the amount of taxes that government has \nbeen taking from individuals. It told us that we have reached an all-\ntime high in terms of the taxes that individuals are paying. We tax \npeople more now in America than we have taxed them at any time in \nhistory. We tax people more than we taxed them to fight the war in \nVietnam, to win the Second World War. We tax people more now than we \ntaxed them to spend our way out of the Great Depression. We made the \nworld safe for democracy in World War I taxing people a lot less than \nwe tax people now.\n  It is beginning to dawn on America, on citizens, that we have had \ngrowth in taxes but we have not had growth in wages. People are \nbeginning to understand that what you choose to spend by government you \ncannot choose to spend as individuals. The Government has stolen the \nincrease in wages from people, the working people of the United States, \nfor the last several years. The tax increases of this decade, including \nthe 1993 tax increase of President Clinton, the largest tax increase in \nthe history of America, has literally siphoned off the pay increase, \nthe take-home pay addition that people would have had in the United \nStates. It is time for us to understand that high taxes have hurt the \nability of people to have more take-home pay.\n  I would like to correct this. I think we ought to correct this. I \nthink it is time for us to give people back the taxes which we took \nfrom them. It is time for us to restore to the American people the wage \nincreases which have been stolen by Government. So it is my privilege \ntoday to introduce a measure, which I think is important to millions \nand millions of working Americans.\n  I want to introduce the Working Americans Wage Restoration Act. This \nmeasure is a measure which is designed to increase the take-home pay of \nwell over 77 million working Americans. It is a measure which would say \nthat individuals, when they pay their Social Security taxes, have a \nright to deduct that tax payment from their income taxes. The payroll \ntaxes, the Social Security taxes, would continue to be paid. There is \nnothing in this measure which would impair the Social Security trust \nfund. But right now American workers are being taxed on a tax. They pay \ntheir Social Security taxes but they also have to pay income tax on the \nmoney they use to pay their Social Security tax. A tax on a tax is \nsomething America has never long tolerated. It is time for us to say \nthat we will not double tax American workers in this way.\n  It is especially egregious, it is especially aggravating, it is a \nspecial affront to the American people to say to them that you have to \npay this tax on a tax. Half the tax is paid by people, the other half \nis paid by corporations. And, guess what, corporations do not pay a tax \non a tax. Corporations can deduct from their income tax the amount of \nSocial Security tax they pay as a part of the payroll tax.\n  So it is time for us to provide equity to the American people. For \nmost Americans, the payroll tax is the most substantial of all taxes. \nSo my proposal, which I send to the desk, is a proposal to eliminate \nthe tax on this tax. Mr. President, I submit a bill for filing today at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this bill has endorsements of a wide \nvariety of groups and individuals. Jack Kemp, who was the chairman of \nthe Tax Reform Commission, appointed by our leader, has endorsed this. \nIt was a part of the Commission report. Carroll Campbell, of the Tax \nReform Commission; Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform; David \nKeating, National Taxpayers Union; David Keene and Bill Pascoe, \nAmerican Conservative Union; Steve Moore, Cato Institute; Jack Faris, \nNFIB; Steve Entin, of IRET; Aldona Robbins, Fiscal Associates; Tom \nSchatz, of Citizens Against Government Waste; Jim Carter, of the RNC; \nGreg Conko, of Competitive Enterprise Institute; Paul Huard, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers; Paul Beckner, Nancy Mitchell, and Decy \nGray, Citizens for a Sound Economy; Beau Boulter, of the United Seniors \nAssociation, has endorsed this; Karen Kerrigan, of the Small Business \nSurvival Committee; J. D. Foster, of the Tax Foundation; David L. \nThompson, the Business Leadership Council--all have endorsed this \nmatter, and we are grateful for their endorsements.\n\n  This matter is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Lott, DeWine, \nMack, Hatch, Smith, Craig, and Shelby and sponsored in the House by \nCongressman Nethercutt, cosponsored by Congressmen Crane, Hostettler \nand Congresswoman Dunn. I thank all of these people, along with Gordon \nJones, of the Seniors Coalition, for their participation in promoting \nthis important idea.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMissouri, John Ashcroft, in the introduction of this legislation, and I \nthank him for the thoughtfulness and, most important, the \nforesightedness that I think this legislation represents.\n  The Senator spoke well when he said Americans will not for long \ntolerate double taxation, and it is unique in the area of Social \nSecurity taxes that we allow corporate America, in their partnering in \nthis tax, to deduct it, but we do not allow the individual who must pay \nthat tax do so. So, as a result of the first $62,700 of income, the \nindividual is, in essence, double taxed.\n  My colleague from Missouri today has introduced legislation in \nessence saying that the time of that fallacy is over and that, if we \nreally want to restore the wage-earning capability of the American \nworker, we should let them keep the money they have earned, and we do \nso with this legislation today. For a typical two-income family--and \nmost families are becoming that now--the Federal income tax liability \nwould be dropped by more than $1,000.\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n  Here we are at this moment on the floor of the Senate trying to \nresolve the issue of a Federal gas tax that pulls billions of dollars \nout of the pocketbook of the American taxpayer. We have seen a \nfrustration expressed by working men and women in this country for the \nlast several years that they just do not get ahead. They keep getting a \nsalary increase, but nothing comes home, which does not translate into \nmoney in the back pocket or money to buy the new car or money to help \nfinance their children's education or money to improve their lifestyle \nin some form.\n  In fact, out of all that frustration, and while our President talks \nabout a strong economy, it is an economy that is just millions of jobs \nless strong than it ought to be for the very reason that the Senator \nfrom Missouri has so articulately spoken: the dragdown, if you will, of \nthe ability of the American producers, working men and women, to retain \nthat which they work so hard for and, therefore, to collect it, to put \nit in savings, if they will, to spend it for their own purposes, to \nprovide for their children.\n  In other words, the American dream does not quite seem to be as clear \nas it used to be. I suggest, Mr. President, that one of the reasons is \nthis kind of Government intrusion, if you will, double taxation. The \nlegislation, the Working Americans Wage Restoration Act, introduced \ntoday by my colleague, John Ashcroft, that I have cosponsored along \nwith others, in my opinion, begins to, once again, brighten the \nAmerican dream.\n  It is part of what we are here on the floor debating today. Some of \nour colleagues argue that the way you solve the human crisis in this \ncountry, no matter how that crisis is defined, is to bring about a \nGovernment program. I suggest that most Americans in our country today \ncan solve their own crises if they simply have the tools of solution. \nOne of the great tools of solution for problem solving is the ability \nto retain your own earnings so you can spend it for yourself and your \nfamily to improve your lot in society or to correct a problem that has \nsomehow gone wrong.\n  This legislation offers that opportunity, and I hope that it gets \nheard, gets debated. I relish an opportunity for the Senate to debate \nit and vote upon it.\n  Mr. President, as we will in the next little while decide whether \nthis Senate is going to vote on a gas tax repeal or whether we are \ngoing to find some loophole, as the other side now struggles to do to \nargue that this is no good, is going to be a unique challenge for all \nof us.\n  Like you, I did not vote for this gas tax increase. I am a Westerner, \nand I recognize the kind of burden you place on somebody who must \ncommute the long miles in the West, or the farmer or rancher who uses \nfuel as a tremendous tool of their production, and we lessen their \nability to profit when we increase the cost of their tools, their tools \nof incomemaking, if you will.\n  That is part of what this debate is all about. But the idea that we \nwould use a gas tax, which we have traditionally directed toward roads \nand bridges and improving the transportation of our country and, \ntherefore, improving the ability of this economy to expand that my \ncolleague from Missouri talks about--the business of growth in the \neconomy should be the business of Government not getting in the way but \nstaying out of the way and promoting that growth. The gas tax has been \none that always has. It has promoted growth in the economy by the \nbuilding of roads and bridges and allowing the kind of flow of labor \nthat has been the hallmark of our society.\n  But this President, President Clinton, said, ``I need that money to \npay for social programs,'' even when in 1992, Candidate Clinton said, \n``I won't increase the gas tax. It's the wrong kind of thing to do. It \ndoes not allow the economy to grow and expand.''\n  But of course, promises made, promises broken, tax increase, billions \nof dollars now pouring out of the economy of our country and into the \nhands of Government to be spent in social programs.\n  Is it a big part of the gas increase, the fuel costs that consumers \nare about today? No, it is not, but it is an important issue to be \ndebated and voted upon to return not only the gas tax to its \ntraditional use but to reduce the overall ability of Government to \nspend and to expand programs.\n  You are going to hear more talk today, as you have had for the last \nseveral days, that somehow this does damage to Government. I suggest \nyou just cut the spending of Government in direct relation to the \namount of revenue that will remain not as a tax but as an income to the \nconsumer in the consumer's pocket.\n  Right now, every time that consumer pulls up to a gas pump, sticks \nthe nozzle in the tank of their car, they see a tremendous outpouring \nfrom the pocketbook.\n  So, if we were to pass legislation of the kind just introduced by my \ncolleague from Missouri, if we were to repeal the gas tax and allow \nthat to remain in the pocket of the consumer, we would see the kind of \ngrowth and job creation in our economy that we have not seen, that \ncannot be talked about by this administration because of the taxes that \nhave been pushed through stifling the overall ability of that economy \nto grow.\n  Growth, progrowth, work incentives, 500,000 new jobs possibly created \nby the legislation of the Senator from Missouri, that two-income family \nbeing able to retain more of their income, $1,000-plus a year--that is \nthe type of thing this Congress ought to be talking about and doing \nsomething about instead of talking about, ``Oh, my goodness, this takes \naway from our ability to spend. We might have to reduce this program or \nthat program.''\n  Mr. President, we just left tax freedom day. We just said to the \nAmerican taxpayer, ``Today is the day when you've paid your taxes, and \nyou can start earning for yourself.'' Last week I stood on the floor of \nthe Senate and said that the first 3 hours of every working day the \ntaxpayer, or the worker, spent their time working for Government, both \nat the State and Federal level.\n  Somehow that must change if we are to get the kind of productivity in \nour economy, job creation and self-well-being to once again brighten \nthe American dream instead of progressively dimming it, as Government \ncan so successfully do if it constantly takes away from the individuals \ntheir ability to earn, save, invest, retain, provide for themselves and \ntheir families.\n  So I thank my colleague from Missouri for his insightfulness and \ninnovativeness in proposing this legislation. I hope that in the coming \nyear this becomes a major part of what this Congress is about and what \nthis Senate is about in providing for the American people.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum)\n  S. 1742. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to exempt minor parties from \nliability under the act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         THE SUPERFUND MINOR PARTY LIABILITY RELIEF ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. SPENCER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpedite the cleanup of our Nation's toxic waste sites. My bill, the \nSuperfund Minor Party Liability Relief Act, would exempt minor parties \nthat contribute insignificant levels of waste to such sites from \nliability under the Superfund law. This will reduce the litigation \nbrought by the primary polluters of toxic waste sites and reduce the \ncurrent delays in cleaning up the sites.\n  Since the 1980 enactment of the Superfund law, 1,321 sites have been \nplaced on the National Priorities List. I find it disturbing, however, \nthat 16 years later only 83 sites have been cleaned up and removed from \nthe list. I am also troubled by a recent report issued by the RAND \nCorp. which found that transaction costs for industrial firms and \ninsurance companies, representing primarily legal fees, account for up \nto 88 percent of their total Superfund-related expenses.\n  Pennsylvania has 110 Superfund sites, many of which have been on the \nNational Priorities List for years. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the average cleanup time for Superfund sites to be \napproximately 12 years. One such site, the Keystone Sanitation \nlandfill, located in Adams County, PA, was added to the National \nPriorities\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nList July 22, 1987. The Environmental Protection Agency selected the \nremedy for cleaning up the site in 1990. The site, however, remains \ncontaminated as a multitude of minor party defendants with little or no \nresponsibility for the environmental contamination of the site are \nforced to litigate to protect their rights and the courts are tied up \nwith endless motions and appeals.\n  I am concerned with the impact of such a delay on the adults and \nchildren who live and play in close proximity to the Keystone site. The \nsite continues to be a source of ground water contamination, which, if \nleft untreated, will continue to threaten the health and safety of \nlocal residents.\n  This legislation would reduce such delays in remediating toxic waste \nsites by forcing the primary parties responsible for the pollution to \nfocus on restoring sites to a safe condition instead of using their \nresources to shift blame to the multitude of minor contributors of \nnegligible amount of waste. My bill will reduce the waste of money and \ntime by exempting minor parties from liability at the outset, when a \nsite is selected for the National Priorities List. This should expedite \nthe legal proceedings and encourage major polluters to work \nconstructively with federal, state, and local governments on actual \ncleanup.\n  Specifically, this bill would exempt from liability those minor \nparties who have only contributed up to 110 gallons of liquid material \nor up to 200 pounds of solid material to a contaminated site. This \nexemption, however, would not apply to parties considered to have \ncontributed significantly to a site's contamination. Thus, on Superfund \nsites containing tens of thousands of gallons of liquid contamination, \nor tons of solid hazardous waste, we would narrow the litigation field \nto only the significant parties. I am willing to examine whether or not \nthese are the appropriate levels, but I am advised by some of the \nlitigants involved in Pennsylvania Superfund cleanups that such relief \nwill go a long way toward alleviating the undue burden they currently \nface.\n  It is unclear whether Congress will finally enact comprehensive \nSuperfund reform legislation this year. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues, many of whom represent communities with similar situations, \nto consider passing this important commonsense reform. There is a broad \nconsensus among the American people that we ought to alleviate the \nunfair cost burden placed on small businesses and cash strapped \nmunicipalities by ensuring that the parties most responsible for the \nexistence of toxic waste sites are the ones responsible for remediating \nthe sites. I believe this bill will go a long way toward simplifying \nand expediting the Superfund cleanup process and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n

Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor \nSenator Dole's and Senator Nickles' bill (S. 1740) defining marriage as \na legal union between one man and one woman.\n  Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by humanizing \nour lives. It is the social, legal, and spiritual relationship that \nprepares the next generation for its duties and opportunities. A 1884 \ndecision of the Supreme Court called it ``the sure foundation of all \nthat is stable and noble in our civilization.''\n  The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, \nand it cannot be changed by them. It is rooted in our history, our \nlaws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our nature as \nhuman beings. It is the union of one man and one woman. This fact can \nbe respected or it can be resented, but it cannot be altered.\n  Our society has a compelling interest in respecting that definition. \nThe breakdown of traditional marriage is our central social crisis--the \ncause of so much anguish and suffering, particularly for our children. \nOur urgent responsibility is to nurture and strengthen that \ninstitution, not undermine it with trendy moral relativism.\n  The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural \ninheritance. It is our duty--perhaps our first duty--to pass it intact \nto the future.\n  The distortion of marriage is sometimes defended as a form of \ntolerance. But this represents a fundamental misunderstanding, both of \nmarriage and tolerance.\n  I believe strongly in tolerance, not only for the peace of society, \nbut because it is the proper way to treat others. As individuals, we \nshould never compromise our moral convictions. But we should always \ntreat others with respect and dignity.\n  A government, however, has another duty. All law embodies some moral \nconsensus. No society can be indifferent to its moral life, because \nthere are consequences for us all.\n  Every government must set certain standards as sign posts. It must \ncreate expectations for responsible behavior. Not every lifestyle is \nequal for the purpose of the common good. This does not mean the \npersecution of those who fall short of the standard, but it does mean \ngiving legal preference to that\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nstandard. A tolerant society does not need to be an indifferent \nsociety.\n  A government that values freedom can permit some things that it would \nnot encourage or condone. But a government must also promote things \nthat are worthy examples and social ideals.\n  Government cannot be neutral in the debate over marriage. It has \nsound reasons to prefer the traditional family in its policies. As \nsocial thinker Michael Novak has written:\n\n       A people whose marriage and families are weak have no solid \n     institutions . . . family life is the seedbed of economic \n     skills, money habits, attitudes toward work and the arts of \n     independence.\n\n  When we prefer traditional marriage and family in our laws, it is not \nintolerance. Tolerance does not require us to say that all lifestyles \nare morally equal, only that no individual deserves to be persecuted. \nIt does not require us to weaken our social ideals. It does not require \na reconstruction of our most basic human institutions. It does not \nrequire special recognition for those who have rejected the standard.\n  It is amazing and disturbing that this legislation should be \nnecessary. It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep moral \nconfusion. But events have made this definition essential. The \npreservation of marriage has become an issue of self-preservation for \nour society. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4947-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4948-S4949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NANCY CHUDA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce my \nintentions to introduce in the near future, a bill that will help \nprotect the children of this country from the harmful effects of \nenvironmental contaminants. I can not think of a more appropriate time \nof the year than the time we recognize the special achievements of \nmothers, to focus this Nation's attention on protecting the health and \nsafety of our children. Mr. President, I am working hard on this piece \nof legislation, not only because I am a mother, but because I want to \npay tribute to one exceptional mother. This mother knows the intense \nsadness of losing her child.\n  This very special mother lives in my State and I am proud to call her \nmy friend. Three years ago, Mrs. Nancy Chuda came to visit me to ask \nfor help. Her little girl, all of 5 years old, had died of cancer--a \nnongenetic form of cancer. No one knows why or how or what caused \nlittle Colette Chuda to become afflicted. She was a normal, beautiful \ngirl in every way. She liked to draw pictures of flowers and happy \npeople. One thing is certain, she was blessed to have two wonderful \nparents. Nancy and Jim Chuda, despite their grief, chose to turn their \nown personal tragedy into something positive. They have labored \nendlessly to bring to the country's attention the environmental dangers \nthat threaten our children. They want to make sure that what happened \nto their Colette will not happen to another child. No mother should \nhave to go through what Nancy Chuda went through. If future deaths can \nbe prevented, I know we all will be indebted to the tremendous energy \nand perseverance of Nancy Chuda.\n  Mr. President, science has shown us that children are special. They \nare not simply a smaller version of you and me. They are still growing, \nmany of their internal systems are still in the process of developing \nand maturing, and, of course, their behavior is different. Studies show \nthat they breathe faster. They come in contact with numerous objects in \ntheir quest to learn and explore the world around them. They eat \ndifferently--children consume foods in different amounts in proportion \nto their body weight. I can remember, when I was a kid, I ate \nmayonnaise sandwiches and I consumed whole boxes of cereal while \nwatching TV. Today, there are more questions than ever with respect to \nchildren's developmental health. And Mr. President, I am sad to say \nthere are very few answers.\n  The factors behind the special environmental risks that children face \nneed special attention. A recent study issued by the National Academy \nof Sciences (NAS) reported on the effects of pesticides in the diets of \ninfants and children. The study concluded that the Federal Government \nis not doing enough to protect our children from exposures to \npesticides. The NAS study essentially confirmed what many in the \nregulatory community were already worried about. Although we may have \nthe highest quality and the safest food in the world, the fact is that \nrisk assessments of pesticides and toxic chemicals do not differentiate \nclearly enough between the risks to children and the risks to adults.\n\n  It has been estimated that up to one-half of a person's lifetime \ncancer risk may be incurred in the first 6 years of life. There is \ncurrently not enough information to know exactly how to account for all \nof the differences when conducting a risk assessment. We need to know \nmore about what health risks our children are exposed to. We need to \ncollect exposure data not only on our children's diets, but also, on \nour children's exposure to air pollutants and surface pollutants. The \nfact is that we do not have the data that allows us to quantify and \nmeasure the differences between how adults and children respond to \nenvironmental pollutants.\n  The absence of this data often precludes effective government \nregulation of environmental pollutants. In my bill, I intend to change \nthis. We must ensure that our regulators have the data they need to be \nable to assess the risks of these substances to children. This would \nlet them do their job of protecting our most vulnerable sector of \nsociety from environmental pollutants.\n  Although most people associate pesticide use with agriculture, \nchildren may be exposed to far greater health risks by other common \nuses of pesticides such as lawn and garden uses, household uses, and \nfumigation uses in schools.\n  Children come in contact with pesticides and other toxic substances, \nnot only from the food they eat, but from the air they breathe, and the \nsurfaces they touch. In communities with contaminated air, improving \noverall air quality for disease prevention is of vital importance. Some \nstudies suggest that pediatric asthma is on the rise and is exacerbated \nby air pollution. Pollutants from tobacco smoke, stoves and fireplaces, \nhousehold cleaners and paints, even glues and the synthetic fabrics \nused in furniture are all thought to be contributing factors. One EPA \nstudy showed that 85 percent of the total daily exposure to toxic \nchemicals comes from breathing air inside the home.\n  I firmly believe that citizens have a right to know what substances \nthey are involuntarily subjected to, whether they live next to a farm \nor in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles. My bill will require \npesticide applicators to keep records and submit reports to the EPA. \nSubsequently, EPA is directed to publish annual bulletins informing \ncitizens of the types and amounts of pesticide chemicals that are being \nused in and around their neighborhood, in their apartment buildings, \nand most importantly in their schools. My bill would give parents the \nability to make informed decisions to protect their family. Public \nhealth and safety depends on its citizens and local officials knowing \nthe toxic dangers that exist in their communities.\n  EPA's Toxics Release Inventory [TRI] collects chemical release \ninformation from manufacturing and several other industries. It is the \nNation's most popular and highly successful community right to know \nprogram. TRI is generally well supported through voluntary compliance \nof industry. The program has prompted many companies to set ambitious \npollution reduction goals as well as voluntary restrictions and \nimprovements. My bill will apply a similar philosophy to other kinds of \nenvironmental contaminants. I am betting on the same outcome emerging \nfrom applicators and users of pesticides and believe this will benefit \neveryone concerned.\n  I strongly support the administration's policies over the past few \nyears to place greater emphasis and attention on the environmental \nhealth issues that affect children. I especially applaud the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency for taking the lead. Last year EPA made \nit an agencywide policy to consider the risks to infants and children \nconsistently and explicitly in every regulatory decision. EPA's stance \nhas inspired me to include its policy in my bill and to expand its \nphilosophy to other Federal agencies charged with regulating toxic \nsubstances and environmental pollutants. The factors behind the special \nenvironmental risks that children may face\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nneed and deserve special attention so that in the future we can prevent \nthe kinds of problems that children have suffered from lead in paint, \nasbestos in schools, and pesticides in food.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4948-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MAGRUDER PRIMARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to have the \nopportunity to give well deserved recognition to an exemplary \nelementary school. Magruder Primary School in Newport News has been \nselected as a U.S. Department of Education Title I Distinguished \nSchool.\n  At Magruder Primary, ``hard work pays off'' isn't just a motto, it's \na way of life. In 4 years time Magruder's reading scores leapt 79 \npercent--from 1 percent of second-graders reading at or above their \ngrade level in 1992 to 80 percent for the most recent school year. \nHaving placed last in reading achievement tests in 1992, the school is \nnow number five in Newport News.\n  Many hard workers are to be commended for this outstanding \naccomplishment: teachers, administrators, parents, business leaders \nand, of course, the students.\n  As a strong believer in parental involvement, I am thrilled that \nMagruder's home-school coordinator makes certain that parents are \nactively involved in their child's education. This individual's \nresponsibilities run the gamut--from retrieving forgotten permission \nslips to providing parents with homework enrichment tips.\n  I would also like to offer a special acknowledgment to the business \npartners who sponsored home reading programs, special assemblies and \nstudent incentives.\n  Mr. President, as stated in a recent Newport News Daily Press \narticle, Magruder's demographics had the school destined for supposed \nfailure. Eighty-four percent of its students receive free lunches; 69 \npercent live with only one parent. Other schools should take note.

Mr. President, last month, when the Senate passed \nthe Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity amendment by an \noverwhelming vote of 68 to 30, during our deliberations on the health \ninsurance reform legislation, it was, in my judgment, a historic \noccasion.\n  Since President Jimmy Carter established his Commission on Mental \nHealth, it has been clear to a number of us that, eventually, it would \nbe in our Nation's best interest to ensure that those afflicted with \nmental illness are treated in the same manner as those afflicted with \nany other physical ailment. Unfortunately, probably primarily due to \nthe stigma long attached to receiving mental health care, this has been \na long and difficult process.\n  As I listened to the debate that Thursday evening and watched our \ncolleagues vote, I kept thinking to myself how one individual, Senator \nDomenici, truly made a difference in the lives of our Nation's \ncitizens. During the years we have served together in the U.S. Senate, \nI have been very pleased to work closely with him in a number of \ncapacities, for example on the various Senate Appropriations \nsubcommittees and, most recently, on behalf of our Nation's Native \nAmericans.\n  Throughout our deliberations, our colleague has always made \nexplicitly clear the importance of ensuring that the Congress and the \nadministration, and ultimately the private sector, must, in fact, treat \nthose afflicted with mental illness and their families in a humane and \ncompassionate manner. Senator Domenici was willing to share with us his \npersonal family experiences. I have no doubt that his resolve and \npersistence are the reasons that most of us voted on behalf of this \nimportant amendment.\n  I sincerely hope that the House-Senate conferees will ultimately \naccept the provisions of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment, as it \nrepresents excellent public policy. However, at this point, I just \nwanted to share my appreciation with my colleagues for the Senator from \nNew Mexico's efforts over the years--he is truly the consummate public \nservant. All of us can learn from his dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4949-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4949-S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with my colleagues a unique conference which took \nplace earlier this week--the sixth annual Southern Women in Public \nService conference hosted in Birmingham, AL, by the John C. Stennis \nCenter for Public Service. The theme of this gathering was ``Coming \nTogether to Make a Difference.'' Over the past 6 years, this event has \nbecome the most significant annual bipartisan gathering of women \npolitical and business leaders throughout the South. The event has \ngrown each year but the purpose remains the same: to make government \nbetter, more effective and more responsive by bringing women into \npublic service leadership.\n  As a board member of the Stennis Center, I have watched this \norganization consistently enable women to pursue public service careers \nby providing an avenue in an area of the country which needs it more \nthan any other. This challenge is illustrated by the fact that only 1 \nof 8 women in the U.S. Senate is from the South; 1 Southern State has \nnever elected a woman to statewide executive office while another has \nnever sent a woman to Congress; 9 of the 11 States which rank lowest in \nthe percentage of women in State legislatures are in the South and no \nSouthern State currently has a female Governor. I can tell you however, \nMr. President, this will not be the case for much longer. This \nconference is changing attitudes by its very visibility in training and \ninspiring women for appointed and elected office each year. In fact, \nthe Stennis Center was credited this week as the last great glass \nceiling breaker. Much credit goes to former Congresswoman Lindy Boggs, \nwho serves as the chair of the conference year after year. She is an \ninspiration for many women and she is continuing to use her platform to \ndefine public service for others. Quite simply, Lindy is contagious.\n  Recently, our Nation celebrated the 75th anniversary of women's \nsuffrage--to coin a phrase, women have come a long way, baby. We now \nhave women serving in the public policy arena in nearly all capacities, \nyet the pace is agonizingly slow. In the early 1970's, only 4.5 percent \nof all State legislative seats were held by women. Today, 21 percent of \nthe 7,424 State legislative seats in this country are held by women. \nWomen hold 56 or 10.5 percent of the 535 seats in the 104th Congress. \nOne State in the Union has a woman Governor--New Jersey, led by \nChristine Todd Whitman.\n  In 1994, four States had women Governors, including my own State of \nOregon which was led by Barbara Roberts. Governor Roberts is currently \nteaching at the John K. Kennedy School at Harvard University. My State \nhas a strong history of capable women serving in statewide and locally\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\nelected positions. Currently, the mayor of Portland is Vera Katz, a \ntalented legislator. Our chief State school officer, Norma Paulus, \nserving in a nonpartisan, statewide elected capacity, has been the \ntrailblazer for women in government in Oregon. Even with this history, \nOregon only has women serving in 28 percent of its elected positions. I \nhope that the Stennis model can be duplicated in other regions across \nthe country, with the Northwest at the top of the waiting list.\n  Among the reasons for increasing the number of women in public \nservice leadership is to improve government at all levels. Women make \nup 52 percent of the population and the majority of all registered \nvoters. Without large numbers of women in government, America is \nmissing out on some of its most capable, effective leaders who can \nimprove the quality of life not just for women, but for all Americans.\n  I would like to just add a word of personal tribute to all of the \nforms of public service women give. Some of our strongest role models \nwere never elected but served in one of the most difficult positions of \npower--from Eleanor Roosevelt to Nancy Reagan to Hillary Clinton--all \nof these First Ladies deserve our gratitude for blazing the trail to \nserve their country. Their example will serve the initial ``First \nGentleman'' quite well.\n  The Stennis Center, established in 1988 to exemplify the life of \npublic service defined by Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi, is \ndoing quality work not only for women in the South, but for many of our \nown staff family. This is the second year of the John C. Stennis \ncongressional staff fellows--a program which provides senior \ncongressional staff with an opportunity to focus on improving the \nperformance of Congress as an institution. The center also operates the \nJohn C. Stennis National Student Congress, a State executive \ndevelopment institute, a legislative staff management institute and a \nnational black graduate students conference--an activity designed to \nrecruit minorities to be congressional aides. All of this work is done \nby a small staff led by the very capable Mr. Rex G. Buffington II, the \nexecutive director of the center. We all owe Mr. Buffington and his \nstaff a debt of gratitude for the time and effort they are expending, \nin the name of my friend John Stennis, to insure that young people are \nattracted to careers in public service, that training and development \nopportunities exist for those in public service and that congressional \nstaff are better equipped to perform their duties more effectively and \nefficiently.\n  This week's conference provides just the most recent example. As one \nof the conference participants shared this week ``If this conference \ndidn't light your fire, then check your wood, because it must be wet.'' \nMr. President, I suspect that many flames are burning bright right \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4949-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, each year an elite group of young \nwomen rise above the ranks of their peers and confront the challenge of \nattaining the Girl Scouts of the United States of America's highest \nrank in Scouting, the Girl Scout Gold Award.\n  It is with great pleasure that I recognize and applaud young women \nfrom the State of Maryland who are this year's recipients of this most \nprestigious and time honored award.\n  These outstanding young women are to be commended on their \nextraordinary commitment and dedication to their families, their \nfriends, their communities, and to the Girl Scouts of the United States \nof America.\n  The qualities of character, perseverance, and leadership which \nenabled them to reach this goal will also help them to meet the \nchallenges of the future. They are our inspiration for today and our \npromise for tomorrow.\n  I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nrecipients of this award from the State of Maryland. They are the best \nand the brightest and serve as an example of character and moral \nstrength for us all to imitate and follow.\n  Finally, I wish to salute the families, Scout leaders, and the Girl \nScouts of Central Maryland who have provided these young women with \ncontinued support and encouragement.\n  It is with great pride that I submit a list of this year's Girl Scout \nGold Award recipients from the State of Maryland, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n                         Gold Award Recipients\n\n       Laura Lee Albright, Jessica Bolyard, Andrea Bedingfield, \n     Ashley Berger, Melissa Boyle, Kelly Brooks, Lauretta Burgoon, \n     Angela Comberiate, Teresa Crocker, Virginia Dentler, Jennifer \n     Hafner, Shawn Hagy, Angie Henderson, Susan Hoffman, Karyn \n     Kahler, Rachel King, Melissa Lauber, Tiffany Lee, Christina \n     Mauzy, Amanda Morgan, Rebecca Morgenroth, Erin Morrow, Meriel \n     Newsome, Kerry Nudelman, Lori Odom, Rebecca Otte, Elizabeth \n     Palmer, Karen Phillips, Ilisa Pyatt, Allison Rachford, \n     Shannon Smoot, Tecoya Shannon, Heather Simons, Faith Stewart, \n     Kathleen Thorn, and Heather Wilson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4950-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REAR ADM. IRVE C. LeMOYNE\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rear Adm. \nIrve C. LeMoyne, the U.S. Navy's highest ranking and longest serving \nSEAL. Admiral LeMoyne retires this month after 35 years of service to \nour Nation. His extraordinary accomplishments have been instrumental in \nthe evolution of this country's special operations forces and will have \na lasting impact as the U.S. military enters the 21st century.\n  Admiral LeMoyne began his Navy career as an ensign in 1961. Following \ngraduation from underwater demolition training and service with \nUnderwater Demolition Team 22, he served in Vietnam with SEAL Team 1 \nand Underwater Demolition Team 11. During his tours in Vietnam, he led \nnumerous successful combat operations and served as a senior provincial \nreconnaissance unit advisor. While commanding Underwater Demolition \nTeam 11 he also participated in the recovery operations of Apollo 10, \n11 and 12.\n  During several high-level assignments in Washington, DC, Admiral \nLeMoyne held key positions where he was responsible for integrating \nnaval special warfare into the U.S. regional military strategy and was \na driving force behind the modernization of the community.\n  In 1987 Admiral LeMoyne became the first commander of the Naval \nSpecial Warfare Command which was formed as the result of the Nunn-\nCohen amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1987. His leadership of this command brought together the many \ncomponents of Naval Special Warfare into a single community which was \nsuccessfully integrated into the joint structure of the newly formed \nU.S. Special Operations Command.\n  As the Director of Resources and then as the Deputy Commander in \nChief of the U.S. Special Operations Command, Admiral LeMoyne further \nensured that not only Naval Special Warfare, but all special operations \nforces were prepared to meet the demands of Operations Desert Shield \nand Storm and the numerous contingency operations of the 1990's.\n  Throughout his career Admiral LeMoyne has been a driving force behind \nthe modernization of Naval Special Warfare. His accomplishments have \npaved the way for special operations forces as this country approaches \nthe 21st century. The legacy of his leadership and foresight will carry \non well into the next century as special operations forces meet the \nchallenges of the battlefield of the future.\n  I bid Admiral LeMoyne, his wife, Elizabeth, his son Irve C. Jr., and \nhis daughter, Christian fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4950-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4950-S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BOEING'S 777 WINS PRESTIGIOUS ROBERT J. COLLIER TROPHY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored and proud to \nrecognize the Boeing Co. from my home State of Washington as the 1996 \nwinner of the prestigious Collier Trophy presented by the National \nAeronautic Association. The Collier Trophy, the industry's highest \nhonor for aeronautics achievement, will be presented to the Boeing 777 \nteam this evening here in the Nation's capital.\n  According to the National Aeronautic Association, Boeing was cited \nfor, ``designing, manufacturing and placing into service the world's \nmost technologically advanced airline transport.'' These words are high \npraise, yet they only begin to describe the awesome innovations \nachieved by the 777\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nteam. The 777 was developed under the theme ``Working Together'' and \nrepresents the work of thousands of Boeing employees, Boeing customers \nand program partners, thousands of suppliers, regulatory authorities, \npassengers, pilots, and flight attendants. The Working Together concept \nand process will be a model for future research and development efforts \nfor U.S. industry.\n  The 777, with approximately 300 aircraft on order, positions the \nBoeing Co. and its family of aircraft to compete and succeed in the \ncompetitive global market for years to come. The 777 is the fourth \nBoeing Co. Collier Trophy winner; the B-52, the 747 and the 757-767 \nprograms also received this coveted award.\n  The Boeing 777 is the first commercial jetliner designed and \npreassembled entirely by computer simulation. More than 235 design-\nbuild teams, linked electronically through advanced computers, worked \ntogether to create the airplane's parts and systems and to evaluate the \naircraft from every perspective. This new and innovative development \nprocess enabled the 777 program to exceed its goal of reducing change, \nerror, and rework by 50 percent. Importantly, Boeing plans to apply \nthis new development model for maximum efficiency to other airplane \nprograms.\n  The most exhaustive flight test program in commercial jetliner \nhistory helped the 777 earn simultaneous certification from the Federal \nAviation Administration and the European Joint Aviation Authorities. \nThe 777 is the first airplane in aviation history to earn FAA approval \nto fly extended-range twin-engine operations routes at service entry. \nThis allowed airlines to offer the most direct routes between \ntransoceanic cities beginning on the aircraft's first day of service. \nBefore entering into service, the 777 set National Aeronautic \nAssociation-certified speed records between Seattle, Washington and \ncities in Sweden, Thailand, France, Germany, and Switzerland.\n  The 777 contains numerous other technological aircraft advancements. \nThe fuselage is wider in cross-section than any other jetliner with \nsimilar seating capacity. Advanced composite materials have lowered \ndirect operating costs, improved aircraft safety, and created new cargo \nopportunities for airlines. More than 7,000 hours of flight deck pilot \nsimulation will provide more reliability, longer service life and \nbetter visibility for pilots. The landing gear features better weight \ndistribution on runways while reducing weight and maintenance costs. \nThe 777 will carry approximately 100 more passengers and has a noise \nfootprint less than half that of the older jets it is designed to \nreplace.\n  On May 15, 1995, United Airlines took delivery of the very first \nBoeing 777. This momentous occasion was marked by a special ceremony at \nthe Seattle Museum of Flight. On June 7, 1995, the 777 entered \ncommercial service with United as Flight No. 921, traveling from \nLondon's Heathrow Airport to Dulles Airport in Washington, DC.\n  More than 20 airlines have signed orders to purchase and fly the \nBoeing 777. Importantly, virtually all of the airlines are foreign \ncustomers including British Airways, China Southern, Cathay Pacific, \nKorean Air Lines, Thai Airways, Japan Airlines, South Africa Airways, \nand Saudi Arabia Airlines. This ensures that the Boeing Co. will remain \none of America's premier exporters. I want to stress to my colleagues \nthat this international aircraft is a job generator for my home State \nas well as Americans in virtually every State.\n  Congratulations to the 777 team, the Boeing Co., and the thousands of \nindividual Washingtonians who labored to design and build this historic \naircraft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4950-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF M.D. PORTMAN OF COLUMBUS, OH\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to a great \nAmerican, a great Ohioan, and a man who might truly be called ``Mr. \nColumbus''--Maury Portman.\n  On May 20, Maury will retire as a Columbus City Councilman--and thus \nclose a career that has spanned not only 42 years in Columbus city \ngovernment, but also 3l years on Council and l2 of those as council \nPresident.\n  I think it's fair to say that no single individual has done more to \nhelp Columbus grow from a mid-sized town in the l950's to the Nation's \nl6th largest city in the l990's than M.D. Portman. Indeed, virtually \nevery major piece of progress Columbus has made over the past few \ndecades has Maury's fingerprints on it. He wrote and sponsored the \nlegislation creating the Columbus Department of Development, sponsored \nthe legislation allocating city funds for the arts, sponsored the \nlegislation creating the Municipal Airport Authority that runs Port \nColumbus, established various committees to curb racial tensions in the \ncity, helped plan the outerbelt expressway around Columbus, worked to \nbring the Columbus City Center development to fruition and tirelessly \nlobbied me and my colleagues here in Washington to obtain Federal funds \nfor a variety of neighborhood renewal projects.\n  In short, it can accurately be said of Maury Portman that Columbus \ncould not have held the last half of the 20th century without him.\n  I think the editors at his hometown newspaper, the Columbus Dispatch \nput it well when they said: ``Portman has been able to function so \neffectively because he never had a personal agenda. His energies were \ndirected not to what would help him get ahead, but what was in the best \ninterest of the community.''\n  Mr. President, Maury Portman is a one-of-a-kind original. He \npersonifies all that is best about public service. And the city of \nColumbus will miss his leadership greatly.\n  I feel fortunate to have known and worked with Maury--and I am proud \nto call him my friend. And now that his retirement is imminent, I know \nI speak for thousands upon thousands of people in central Ohio when I \nsay: ``Thank you, Maury.'' Thank you for caring; thank you for always \ngiving your best; thank you for always being there. We all wish you and \nyour beautiful wife, Alice, good luck and Godspeed in whatever you \ndecide to do next. And please know that just as you always remembered \nColumbus, Columbus will never forget you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4951-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SARAH EMILY MOORE JONES\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to call to the \nattention of my colleagues the upcoming birthday of Mrs. Sarah Emily \nMoore Jones, a native Marylander. On Saturday, May 11, 1996, Mrs. Jones \nwill become 92 years young. I know my colleagues join me in extending \nheartfelt birthday wishes to Mrs. Jones.\n  Mrs. Jones was born in Wetipquin, MD, the fourth of seven children. \nShe attended Wetipquin Elementary School and Salisbury High School and \nreceived a degree in education from Bowie Normal, which is now Bowie \nState University. Mrs. Jones taught in the Wicomico County public \nschool system in elementary and adult education. She is a faithful \nmember of St. James Free Methodist Church, in Head of Creek, MD, where \nshe served as the musician for over 40 years.\n  On June 27, 1925, Sarah Emily Moore married Matthew Jones of Head of \nCreek, MD. To that union, four children were born: Thelma Martin and \nMatthew Jones of Washington, DC, Linfred Jones of Quantico, MD, and \nMary Hilda Elsey of Nanticoke, MD. Mrs. Jones has one stepson, Samuel \nBoslee of New Jersey. She is also a grandmother, a great grandmother, \nand a great great grandmother.\n  After her husband of 60 years passed away on September 6, 1985, Mrs. \nJones continued to live independently until December 6, 1995, when she \nincurred a hip injury. As a result of her injury, and the surgery and \nrehabilitation that followed, she began living with her daughter, \nThelma.\n  The ever soft-spoken, perpetually happy Sarah can be found smiling \nand composed through any circumstance.

Mr. President, this Sunday is Mother's Day, when \nmillions of sons and daughters will gather to pay tribute to the women \nwho raised them. Mother's Day is a joyous celebration for most, but for \nfamilies touched by the epidemic of gun violence, it can be a cruel \nreminder of what they have lost.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  I want to speak today about one such family, and I want to tell \nSenators how a mother from Orange County, CA, Mary Leigh Blek, chose to \nhonor her son's memory by becoming a leader in the fight against \nviolence.\n  On June 29, 1994, Mary Leigh Blek experienced every mother's \nnightmare--a 3 a.m. phone call from the police, telling that her \nbeloved son Matthew had been shot and killed. Matthew Blek was walking \nhis date home that night when three teenagers on a violent rampage shot \nhim twice in the head.\n  The weapon used in that terrible crime was a junk gun, probably \nmanufactured in southern California. Congress has prohibited the \nimportation of these cheap, poor quality, and easily concealable \nfirearms, but has allowed their domestic manufacture to soar unchecked.\n  For the past year, Mary Leigh Blek and her husband Charles have been \non a crusade to stop the proliferation of these junk guns. ``Silence is \nconsent,'' she says, and Mary Leigh Blek has been anything but silent. \nShe has become a tireless organizer in the anti-gun-violence movement--\nmaking speeches, attending rallies, and most recently testifying before \na Committee of the California Legislature.\n  Mary Leigh Blek is determined to spare other mothers the pain that \nripped her family apart. When I introduced the Junk Gun Violence \nProtection Act, a bill that would apply the same standards to \ndomestically produced handguns as are currently applied to imports, \nMary Leigh Blek was there. Once again, she told the story of how her \nson was slain and why these poor quality, easily concealable handguns \nshould not be on the streets. I know it is hard for her to keep talking \nabout this tragedy, and I admire her courage and the sense of public \nservice that motivates her to keep up the fight.\n  This Mother's Day, I will think of Mary Leigh Blek.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nstudents and faculty at Cresskill High School in my State for proposing \na weeklong focus on HIV/AIDS, from May 27 to June 2, 1996.\n  It's true that this is one of many spotlights that have been trained \non this epidemic; and it's true that there have been many seminars and \neducational forums designed to inform the public about the devastation \nthis disease causes and the medical and other support services \navailable to sustain individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS.\n  But the fact is that despite statistics clearly demonstrating that \nAIDS is no respecter of racial, religious, ethnic, or economic lines, \nmost people prefer to think it can't happen to them. The idea for this \nparticular AIDS Education Week in New Jersey came from Jessica \nPomerantz, a student at Cresskill High School, a suburban school in an \narea where families are not faced with problems of the inner cities. \nJessica felt the need to talk about this precisely because she sensed \nthat her fellow classmates were like most people--they believed they \nwould never be the ones to get the AIDS virus. The fact is, as she \nsays, AIDS is an equal opportunity killer. The fact is this AIDS \neducation week is very significant.\n  AIDS has become a defining facet of modern life: The 80,000 Americans \nreported with AIDS in 1994 alone represented one-fifth the total number \nof cases ever reported in the United States; AIDS infects one of every \n92 young American men ages 27 to 39; it's the leading cause of death \namong all 25-44 year olds and the fourth leading cause of death among \nall women.\n  In New Jersey, some 50,000 people are infected with the HIV virus. \nWe're fifth in the United States in reported AIDS cases, third in \npediatric AIDS cases. Women represent 26 percent of all reported AIDS \ncases in New Jersey, the highest proportion of women with AIDS in the \nentire country. And women are the fastest-growing group of people with \nHIV/AIDS.\n  Last December, the eighth observance of World AIDS' Day took as its \ntheme, ``Shared Rights, Shared Responsibilities.'' Jessica and her \nfellow students at Cresskill High School have taken that message to \nheart. They understand the stake they have in this fight. They know \nthey shouldn't and they cannot ignore it for the sake of their own \nfuture and the future of generations all over the world. ``We must \nprotect our future,'' they say, ``by taking responsibility for our \nactions if we are to accomplish our goals.''\n  Mr. President, I'm tremendously proud of these young people from New \nJersey. I ask my colleagues to join me today in wishing them continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR TREATMENT OF SOME MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE \n                                VETERANS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I'm pleased and honored to \nannounce my intention to introduce legislation in the coming days which \nI believe will demonstrate the cost effectiveness and feasibility of \nMedicare reimbursement to the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] for \ntreatment of some medicare-eligible veterans at VA health care \nfacilities.\n  There are two very important reasons I intend to introduce and press \nfor passage of this legislation which I would like to briefly outline. \nFirst, reforming veterans' health care is one of my top priorities. I \nstrongly believe that if we don't reform the archaic and arcane rules \ngoverning veterans access to VA medical care, it will be impossible for \nthe VA to provide America's veterans with 21st Century health care. To \naccomplish this, the VA must be authorized to receive Medicare \nreimbursements for treatment of some Medicare-eligible veterans. Two \ndifferent proposals prepared by major veterans service organizations \n(VSO's) provide that the VA be authorized to receive Medicare \nreimbursement for treating Medicare-eligible veterans. The GAO, \nhowever, has questioned both the feasibility and cost of providing \nMedicare reimbursement to the VA. While I lean toward the VSOs' view \nthat Medicare reimbursement would be both feasible and cost-effective, \nthe only way to prove this is by means of a demonstration project that \nwill determine both the feasibility and cost effectiveness of Medicare \nsubvention. That is precisely what my legislation will authorize.\n  Second, I believe that because the VA is facing and will likely \ncontinue to face severe funding constraints that will reduce its \ncapabilities to provide access to quality health care, the VA will be \nunder strong pressures to deny health care to Medicare-eligible \nveterans who are not in the mandatory category for outpatient or \ninpatient treatment. For many years VA medical costs have lagged behind \nmedical cost inflation and under the budget resolution adopted by \nCongress last year the VA medical care budget would be frozen for 7 \nyears, lagging behind overall inflation and probably even further \nbehind medical cost inflation. As a consequence, the VA may be \ncompelled to ration care, with veterans 65 and over one of the groups \nlikely to be affected. Even before the VA was faced with a flat health \ncare budget, many of its facilities were compelled to resort to \nrationing. Despite the bold and imaginative efforts of Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Jesse Brown and his Under Secretary for Health Ken \nKizer to modernize, streamline and decentralize VA health care, a flat \nVA health care budget for 7 years can only lead to more extensive \nrationing of health care for veterans. This will further fray our \nsolemn contract with the men and women who selflessly defended our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am planning to introduce is intended to \nensure that our aging veterans population is not denied access to VA \nhealth care at a time when they need it most. Improving and \nsafeguarding health care for our country's veterans should be a \npriority issue for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I hope all \nof my colleagues will carefully review my bill after it is introduced \nand will carefully consider supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4952-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4952-S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 13, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I wanted to just correct the record with \nregard to the suggestion of the Senator from Mississippi about actions \nthat were taken by those of us who favor having an up-or-down vote on \nthe minimum wage and the action that was necessary to try to keep the \nissue of the minimum wage before the U.S. Senate because, as the record \nshows very clearly, we have demonstrated a majority support for \nincreasing the minimum wage as an amendment on legislation earlier this \nyear, and at the time that the Senate voted by 55 votes, Republicans \nand Democrats, to increase the minimum wage. Our Republican majority \nleader made a motion to recommit the pending legislation, sending it \nback to the committee and having it returned to the floor without that \namendment that was pending which would have effectively denied us any \nfurther debate or discussion of the minimum wage. And, before that \naction was processed, I filed a cloture motion on the minimum wage to \nat least assure that the Senate would have an opportunity to vote on \nthe minimum wage issue and which we have been denied the opportunity to \ndo.\n  The Senator from Mississippi can continue to talk about the various \nprocedures, processes, and actions that can be used by the Republican \nleadership to avoid this institution taking a vote up or down on the \nminimum wage, which they have been successful in doing. But I do not \nthink there is an American today that does not understand that it has \nbeen the Republican leadership position in the House of Representatives \nand the Senate of the United States that is frustrating the \noverwhelming sentiment of the people of this country--in all regions of \nthe country and among all ages of the country--that believe \nthat fairness and decency ought to permit the Senate of the United \nStates and the House of Representatives to vote on a modest increase \nfor those men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, \nto try to provide for themselves and their families.\n\n  That is not favored by the majority leadership. That is opposed by \nthe Republican leadership, and the Senator from Mississippi, as \noutlined earlier, which may be of interest to I do not know who at this \nhour of the day here in the Senate, about various procedures that are \nutilized to deny us that opportunity. But I can tell you that there are \nfamilies that are gathered around the kitchen table at this moment at \n6:30 at night, and there are the mothers of children that are gathered \nthere at the kitchen table at this very moment that are wondering how \nthey are going to pay the utility bill, or the emergency room bill, or \nthe rent, or food on the table, or the clothing for their children. \nThat is happening now. And, if they could afford a television and watch \nwhat is happening on the floor of the U.S. Senate, they have to ask, \n``Why? Why is the Republican leadership demanding or forbidding the \nopportunity to have an up-or-down vote on this measure one more day, \none more day?''\n  They denied it yesterday, denied it the day before, denied it the day \nbefore that, denied it last week, and denied it in the weeks before, in \nspite of the fact that the majority leader has voted for an increase in \nthe minimum wage four times, voted against it eight times, but voted \nfor it on four different occasions, and in spite of the fact that \nRepublican Presidents Eisenhower, Bush, and Nixon have all supported an \nincrease in the minimum wage. So, it is an interesting perhaps story \nabout the procedural steps which have been taken by various Senators to \ndeny an increase in the minimum wage.\n  But, Mr. President, there is no doubt in the minds of the American \npeople about what is taking place here in the U.S. Senate; Republican \nleadership denying working families on the bottom rung of the economic \nladder the opportunity to have a living wage, a living wage for \nthemselves and for their families, and that is wrong. No parliamentary \nprocedure is going to change that fundamental fact.\n  Now, Mr. President, in recent days a number of commentators have \npointed out that the Senate seems to be in the doldrums, ``D-o-l-e-d-r-\nu-m-s.'' I believe the normal spelling leaves out the ``e''--d-o-l-d-r-\nu-m-s. I thought it might be worth listening to some of the dictionary \ndefinitions for that word.\n  The Random House Dictionary of the English Language defines it this \nway:\n\n       A state of inactivity or stagnation;\n       A belt of calms and light baffling winds;\n\n  Or, three:\n\n       A dull, listless, depressed move; low spirits.\n\n  The Oxford English Dictionary refers to the doldrums this way:\n\n       A vessel almost becalmed, her sails flapping about in every \n     direction.\n\n  It goes on to call it:\n\n       A region of unbearable calm broken occasionally by violent \n     squalls.\n\n  The American Heritage Dictionary defines it this way:\n\n       Ocean regions near the equator characterized by calms, or \n     light winds, and the calms characteristic of;\n\n  Or, second:\n\n       The calms characteristic of these areas;\n\n  Or, third:\n\n       A period of inactivity, listlessness, or depression \n     probably influenced in form by the word ``tantrum.''\n\n  That seems to fit the Senate precisely. First our Republican friends \nhave a tantrum over the Democratic efforts to raise the minimum wage. \nThen our Republican friends go into the doldrums.\n  The American people look to the Congress for action on the minimum \nwage, and all they see are cloture motions, quorum calls, and \nprocedural gymnastics to avoid taking action.\n  I say end the gridlock, end the deadlock, end the doldrums. The way \nfor Senator Dole to find his way out of the doldrums is clear: Raise \nthe minimum wage.\n  Finally, Mr. President, on one other matter that was raised by my \nfriend from Mississippi about cloture motions; and there will be those \nthat will\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nstudy this period of history in the 102d, 103d, and the 104th Congress.\n  What they will find is that the times when the cloture motions were \nfiled was to close off the prolonged debate which was taking place in \nthe Senate. But they will also find that when our Republican leadership \nhas been filing the cloture motions in this Congress, it is not to \nterminate debate. It is to block out debate, to close out the \npossibilities to offer amendments to the underlying measure, a very \nsignificant and important difference. It can be made light of on the \nfloor of the Senate, but every Member of this body ought to know what \nthe significance and the difference is about in the application of \ncloture during this period of time--to close out debate, to deny the \nopportunity for Members to be able to express the interests of people \nthey represent. It is unbecoming for this institution to be put in that \nposition because this is the institution which has debated the great \nissues as well as less important issues over the period of the history \nof this Nation. Denying that opportunity for debate does not serve this \ninstitution or its tradition well. To the contrary.\n  I wish to make just a final observation, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent to be able to proceed for 3 or 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In every case where cloture was filed on an amendable \nvehicle during the 103d Congress and Republicans sought to offer \namendments, amendments sponsored by or cosponsored by Republicans were \nvoted on before the cloture vote. Do we hear that? In every case where \ncloture was filed on an amendable vehicle during the 103d Congress and \nRepublicans sought to offer amendments, amendments sponsored by or \ncosponsored by Republicans were voted on before the cloture vote. Not \ntoday in terms of where we are on proposals of Democrats and on \nproposals that are cosponsored by Republicans, because the minimum wage \nincrease is cosponsored by a Republican. In no case was the amendment \ntree completely filled to prevent Republicans from offering amendments \nafter cloture was filed. In no case. In no case. I have heard that \nclaim to be the case by the Republican majority leader and again \nrepeated this afternoon. But the facts do not support that statement.\n  Cloture was most frequently filed to close off debate in situations \nwhere amendments were not in order--conference reports, nominations, \nmotions to proceed to bills. The only bill on which cloture was filed \nduring the 103d Congress and no Republican amendments were offered was \nS. 414, the Brady bill. In that bill, cloture was filed on the \nMitchell-Dole substitute amendment. There were no votes on Republican \namendments because a unanimous-consent agreement was reached dictating \nwhich amendments would be permitted--unanimous consent--a completely \ndifferent history than has been described either earlier this evening \nor by the majority leader on yesterday.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as I mentioned, the people in my State who are \nreceiving the minimum wage have been fortunate in that my State \nincreased the minimum wage. Fortunately, it has been in effect since \nJanuary of this year, and the unemployment has gone down. It has gone \ndown. In our neighboring State of New Hampshire, where they have not \nincreased it, the unemployment has gone up.\n  So I will welcome the opportunity to debate the issue of whether the \nminimum wage adds to inflation, whether it adds to unemployment, about \nwhat the economic impact is going to be. We have ample examples of that \nfrom history. We have at other times reviewed that for the benefit of \nthe Senate, and we will welcome the chance to either do that again or \nnot do it.\n  We continue to deny an increase in the minimum wage to hard-working \nAmericans, most of whom are women. A good percentage of those women \nhave small children. This is a women's issue. It is a families' issue. \nIt is a children's issue. It is an issue for justice. It is an issue on \ndecency. It is an issue on fairness. The American people understand \nthat.\n  So perhaps as we come to the conclusion of this week of Senate debate \nand discussion, those families are going to wonder why the Senate did \nnot address this issue again. It is more and more difficult for this \nSenator to explain to families that are trying to provide for \nthemselves and their families why Republican leaders refuse to give \nworking families a livable wage that we have been prepared to do at \nother times in our history with Republicans and Democrats alike. The \nlast time we increased it, we had a Democratic controlled Congress and \na Republican President. Now we have a Republican Congress and a \nDemocratic President, but the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate of the United States has refused to do \nit.\n  In a final point, I will say it is going to get done. It is going to \nget done, and those families ought to understand that it will get done. \nIt will get done, I believe, sooner than later. We will continue to \noffer this amendment on the legislation, and if the Senator from \nMississippi or the Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, want to go \nto this arcane procedure of denying any debate or discussion on either \nthe minimum wage or any amendments thereto, they are going to have a \nvery long spring and a very long summer, but we are going to prevail on \nthis issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/09/senate-section/article/S4953-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 13, 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
