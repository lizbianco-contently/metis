Mr. President, back when we had the telecommunications \nbill up, I had an amendment that would have permitted some enlargement \nof ownership in radio stations, but kept a cap on. The bill we passed \ntook the cap off completely. In this morning's newspapers, on the front \npage of the New York Times and Washington Post, are stories about \nWestinghouse buying a huge chunk of American radio. The business \nsection of the New York Times says: ``Westinghouse would own 32 percent \nof top markets.''\n  That is not a healthy thing. I would like to read the honor roll. I \nsay to my colleagues on the other side, I regret there are only two \nRepublicans listed here, because we end up in partisan mode so often in \nthis body, and I am sure this is one of those cases where others might \nhave voted with us if that had not happened. But those who voted for \nlimitation, and not taking the cap away are: Senator Daniel Akaka; \nSenator Joe Biden; Senator Jeff Bingaman; Senator Barbara Boxer; \nSenator Bill Bradley; Senator Dale Bumpers; Senator Robert Byrd; \nSenator Kent Conrad; Senator Mike DeWine; Senator Chris Dodd; Senator \nByron Dorgan; Senator Russ Feingold; Senator Dianne Feinstein; Senator \nTom Harkin; Senator Jesse Helms, who has some background in this \nbusiness of radio; Senator Bennett Johnston; Senator Ted Kennedy; \nSenator John Kerry; Senator Bob Kerrey; Senator Frank Lautenberg; \nSenator Pat Leahy; Senator Carl Levin; Senator\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nJoe Lieberman; Senator Barbara Mikulski; Senator Pat Moynihan; Senator \nPatty Murray; Senator Claiborne Pell; Senator David Pryor; Senator \nHarry Reid; Senator Chuck Robb; Senator Jay Rockefeller; Senator Paul \nSarbanes, and Senator Paul Wellstone. Voting ``present'' was Senator \nNancy Kassebaum.\n  That was a great mistake, lifting that cap off completely. Now, we \nare in a situation where one corporation, or even one individual, \ntheoretically, could control radio in this country. I think it is not a \nhealthy thing. I do not know what happens, but I hope that in the next \nsession of Congress--and I recognize it will not happen in this \nsession--there will be some kind of a cap put on. I do not think it \nwould be a healthy thing if one corporation, for example, in Alaska, or \nGeorgia, or Washington, or Delaware, or Illinois, held all the radio \nstations. I think this tendency toward concentration of ownership is \nnot a good thing for our country, and I simply want to commend my \ncolleagues--particularly, Senators Mike DeWine and Jesse Helms, who \nwent away from the party lines to vote for that amendment. I commend \nthem, particularly.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6633-7", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6634-S6643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are now in the 61st day of the \nobjection of Senator Kennedy to the appointment of Senate conferees for \nhealth care reform--a commonsense health care reform issue. It raises \nthe question, why ought not everyday citizens be given the opportunity \nto share in the massive benefits that this health care reform proposal \nwould bring to America? Why would they be denied this? What does the \nbill do, and why can we not get on with it and get this job done? I \nknow every American across the country is asking that question.\n  Under this legislation, for the first time, working Americans will be \nable to leave their jobs without having to worry about losing their \nhealth insurance due to a preexisting condition. The question to \nSenator Kennedy is: Why not get on with this and just do it? We have \nbeen talking about it now for years. It makes health care coverage more \navailable and affordable for small businesses and the self-employed. \nWhy not just get this done? Let us move on with this.\n  It allows tax deductions for long-term health care needs, nursing \nhome coverage, home health care coverage, and allows terminally ill \npatients and their families to receive tax-free accelerated death \nbenefits from their insurance companies. That allows a family in a time \nof enormous crisis an option to help deal with that crisis. Why not \njust do it? Let us get this done.\n  We have been badgering around here now 61 days trying to get \nconferees appointed so that we can move on with the business of helping \nthe American family in the critical health insurance market.\n  Here is the point. It creates a medical savings account program--the \nHouse version does, the Senate did not; there are many, many Senators \nwho want to agree with the House--effective next January, according to \nthe compromise proposal people are trying to work out, for self-\nemployed and those who work for small businesses with 50 or fewer \npeople. I have heard several versions of this. I know it is a moving \ntarget. But medical savings accounts are a creature of the market that \nmany, many people want to take advantage of.\n  This is the principal reason, although there are others, apparently, \nthat Senator Kennedy has raised ongoing objections to. The bill fights \nfraud and abuse with new and tough provisions in the health care \nmarket.\n  So here we go. We make it possible for families to take insurance \nbenefits and endless job lock, where somebody might get a chance to \nhave a new job but they cannot move because they are afraid they will \nlose their insurance. This corrects that. Let us just do it.\n  It makes health care coverage more available and affordable to small \nbusinesses and the self-employed. This is something America needs. Let \nus just do it.\n  It allows tax deductions for long-term health care needs. It lets \npeople in a time of tragedy accelerate benefits. It creates, yes, a new \nmedical savings account, which is a version where the ensured has an \nopportunity to lower their costs, and they actually became paying \nconsumers in the marketplace. It fights fraud and abuse.\n  We should do these things for the country. By the time we get back, \nwe will have waited 63 days just to appoint conferees.\n  So America is sitting out here waiting and waiting, and families are \nsuffering and suffering and suffering because the Congress will not get \non and pass this meaningful reform.\n  Who supports this commonsense health reform approach? It is a wide \nrange of support. The American Hospital Association, Farmers Health \nAlliance, National Association of Manufacturers, National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, National Association for the Self-employed, \nAlliance for Affordable Health Care, American Small Business \nAssociation, as well as many others, have endorsed this commonsense \napproach to making the health insurance market a friendlier place, an \neasier place for America's families and America's businesses. And they \nare all put on hold because the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nWhite House are objecting to an open market and a new product for the \nmarket called medical savings accounts.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has \nhad a lot of things to say about these medical savings accounts. There \nis an article in Investors Business Daily written by John C. Goodman, \nwho says this:\n\n       Medical savings accounts give people a new way to pay for \n     health care. The option is a high deductible health insurance \n     paired with a personal savings account. The individual uses \n     his or her account to pay for routine and preventive medical \n     care while the policy pays for major expenses. Individuals \n     who have money left over in the MSA at the end of the year \n     can withdraw it, or roll it over to grow with interest.\n\n  This is a great idea. This is a way in which many Americans have \nsaved thousands of dollars in automobile insurance. They bought \npolicies where they have high deductibles so they pay lower premiums, \nand they are in a sense self-insuring and paying for small costs \nthemselves so that they can lower their overall cost. So the idea has \nbeen brought over to the health insurance market.\n  Some 2,000 employers have adopted some version of an MSA already. \nSenator Kennedy from Massachusetts says that MSA's are only for the \nhealthy. The Rand analysis says no. It says no, that that allegation \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts is not correct.\n  Rand researchers conclude that MSA's would be attractive to those who \nexpect to face high health care costs. That is because potential out-\nof-pocket expenses under traditional health insurance, which requires \ndeductibles plus copayments, are higher than under MSA plans.\n  Senator Kennedy says MSA's are only for the wealthy. There are just \nreams of research that say that is not the case. We have example after \nexample, person after person, school bus drivers, secretaries in a \nlibrary, in MSA plans. These are not wealthy people. And they are \ncoming to the Congress and saying, ``Give us these options, make MSA's \ncopartners in the health insurance market so that our costs are \ndeductible.''\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield at this point after this opening \nstatement. I am going to yield to the Senator from Washington, who I \nappreciate very much being here this morning.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time is yielded to the Senator from \nWashington?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am convinced that the Senator from \nGeorgia is correct in his analysis in what he has told us here in the \nSenate. We have now waited for more than 2 months facing a filibuster \neven of a procedural motion formally to appoint a conference committee \nto settle a set of vitally important health care issues for the people \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, there is little controversy over the desirability of \nportability of health care insurance, over\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\ncertain restrictions on health care limitations because of preexisting \nconditions and a number of other features of the bill that passed the \nSenate. But the senior Senator from Massachusetts is so vehemently \nopposed to a concept called medical savings accounts that he and those \nwho support it will not even permit a debate in the Senate, a vote in \nthe Senate, on the issue.\n  The Senator from Georgia pointed out that this is not a new concept. \nIt is very much like the automobile insurance that all of us purchase \nin which we can make a set of value judgments and choices. Do we want \nto pay a high premium and have even minor damage to our automobiles \npaid for by the insurance companies, or are we willing to accept a high \ndeductible up to an amount which we feel we can afford to pay ourselves \nin return for a much lower premium for an automobile insurance policy \nthat will take care of the situation if our car is totaled or badly \ndamaged?\n  A medical savings account is essentially the same thing except \nbecause we place such a high value on health care insurance that we \nwill offer certain tax advantages to that high deductible health care \ninsurance, saying that people can save an amount of money up to that \ndeductible on a tax-free basis to pay for the everyday health care \ninsurance costs out of it and end up having the money itself if they do \nnot actually use it and, at the same time, have a catastrophic health \ncare plan which will keep families from bankrupting, or from tremendous \nfinancial distress in the case of major health care needs.\n  One of the reasons that many people lack health care insurance today \nis the fact that they are in States or communities with community \nratings, which means that young people with young families are required \nto pay far more for standard health care insurance policies than they \nare likely to use. And so they choose to have no insurance at all, \nrunning a very real risk in the process. As a consequence, if this \nproposal works, more people will have health care insurance against a \ncatastrophic event in their lives than have it today.\n\n  Perhaps the true objection of the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nis that as more people are insured against health care disasters in a \nfree and voluntary system, there will be less demand for the \nnationalized health care system that he so vehemently supported in the \nlast Congress and which failed when the American people decided that \nthey did not want the Government of the United States to be running \ntheir health care.\n  Personally, I think that may be the real objection, because it \nappears to me that there can almost be no other, to at least an \nexperiment involving those who are self-employed or those who are \nemployed by small businesses, many of which do not provide health care \nfor their employees at the present time. If we go into this experiment \nand if this experiment works, more companies will provide health care \nfor all of their employees on this catastrophic basis because it will \ncost them less. More employees will be encouraged to say more of us who \nare all consumers of health care will pay more attention to what it \ncosts and we may end up with a far more efficient system than we have \ntoday.\n  Right now, we are not only being denied that experiment, we are being \ndenied even those other elements on which there is full agreement \nbecause one group of Members of this body says, no, this is such a \nterrible idea; it is so dangerous to let people make their own choices \nthat we will stop the whole thing, the entire health care reform in \norder to prevent this from taking place.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue and seek the \nattention of the Senator from Georgia, who was kind enough to lend me \nthis time, to ask him as a leader in this effort whether or not he \nagrees with these sentiments. Does the Senator from Georgia not agree \nthat perhaps the central real objection here is an objection to \nallowing people a greater degree of choice over how they fund their \nhealth care, a greater degree of choice over ways in which insurance \nmay be provided, a greater degree of attention to costs, simply a \ngreater degree of control over their own lives?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think the Senator from Washington has very \neloquently described this condition and the source of the disagreement \nbecause, after all, it was the senior Senator from Massachusetts and \nhis colleagues who came forward with an all-inclusive Federal takeover \nof medicine, and the medical savings account is the antithesis of it \nbecause there is a freedom there, the freedom to the buyer of the \ninsurance. There is an access in the system and, indeed, it will reduce \ndramatically the number of people who do not have insurance.\n  I tell you a clue, a clue to the objective on the other side is that \nin the negotiation as to whether to allow the experiment, one \nsuggestion was that the only business that could buy an MSA was one \nthat already had a low deductible plan now. So it was actually \nconstructed, the suggestion is constructed to prevent small businesses \nthat have no insurance from exercising the MSA option.\n  Mr. GORTON. To try to see to it that we did not have more people \ncovered by health care insurance.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. But have a statistic that you could go out and argue we \nneed a national system, we need a national health care system because \nthere are millions of people who are uninsured, rather than reduce that \nnumber by this new and constructive experiment.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First of all, those who oppose it have articulated \ntheir opposition and I think with specious arguments. Second, they want \ncaps on it, they want parameters all around it, so you can draw the \nconclusion that the effort is to prevent people from getting to this \nkind of coverage.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have only one more comment and I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Georgia agrees with this proposition. Does he not believe, as I \ndo, that if this bill were to come back to the Senate with this modest \nexperiment on medical savings accounts included, it would have a \nsignificant majority of the votes of the Members of this body, \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, and would easily go to the President, \nand that one of the reasons for this filibuster is to prevent that \nmajority view from prevailing and to prevent the embarrassment of the \nPresident either having to veto this proposal as he has threatened to \ndo or actually to back off and sign it?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think we can safely draw that conclusion.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me this \ntime.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Washington. I think he has \nmade a very, as I said, eloquent statement with regard to this debate.\n  I now yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as my distinguished colleagues have already \npointed out, we have been waiting for nearly 2 months to move forward \non critical health insurance reform legislation. The holdup, we are \ntold by the White House and some of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, is this provision to create a tax-free medical savings \naccount as a health insurance option for Americans.\n  Tax-free medical savings accounts are something Americans want, \nalthough you would never know it from the hyperbole being used by some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. A poll released this \nmonth shows that 77 percent of working Americans would start a medical \nsavings account if MSA's were available to them. Americans who have \nMSA's like them, and Americans who do not have MSA's want them.\n  MSA's exist now. They have been tested by thousands of companies with \ngreat success. What we want for MSA's is equal tax treatment with other \ntypes of employer-provided health insurance for the self-employed, the \nability to contribute to a medical savings account and receive a 100-\npercent deduction for their contribution up to $2,000. This provision \nwould end the current Tax Code discrimination against MSA's by ending \nthe taxation on MSA deposits.\n  Republicans in the House and Senate have been willing to compromise \non MSA's. We have addressed many of the administration's and Senator \nKennedy's concerns about MSA's. We have\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nput forward proposals that are small, small enough to be considered as \ndemonstration projects. This was one of the often-stated criteria of \nthe White House and some of our Democrat friends. The American Hospital \nAssociation this week endorsed our compromise. Both of the latest \ncompromises extending MSA's to companies with either 50 or 100 or fewer \nemployees would extend this tax free status to the segment of the work \nforce that has the highest number of uninsured employees--small \nbusinesses.\n  MSA's are of such importance in our effort to address our health \nconcerns that on September 8, 1992, several of my distinguished \ncolleagues signed a letter calling for the introduction of MSA's as \npart of their bill.\n  Let me quote a portion of that letter.\n\n       Unlike many standard third-party health coverage plans, \n     medical cost savings accounts would give consumers an \n     incentive to monitor spending carefully because to do \n     otherwise would be wasting their own money. Once a Medical \n     Savings Account is established for an employee, it is \n     fully portable. Money in the account can be used to \n     continue insurance while an employee is between jobs or on \n     strike. Recent studies show that at least 50 percent of \n     the uninsured are uninsured for four months or less. . . . \n     Today, even commonly required small dollar deductibles \n     (typically $250 to $500) create a hardship for the \n     financially stressed individual or family seeking regular, \n     preventative care services. With Medical Savings Accounts, \n     however, that same individual or family would have this \n     critical money in their account to pay for the needed \n     services.\n\n  Mr. President, these are important arguments that were made for MSA's \nover 3 years ago. They are equally--if not more--important today. And \nthat letter was signed by Senators Breaux, Boren, Daschle, Lugar, \nCoats, and Nunn--a formidable bipartisan coalition of Senators taking a \nnecessary stand on a critical issue.\n  Medical savings accounts promote portability. It's that simple. After \na few years of relatively low health expenses, the excess funds in an \nMSA can be available for an unexpectedly high health care cost. Those \nfunds can be available for health care during times of unemployment, \nand they can provide extended coverage for long-term needs. These, of \ncourse, are critical issues when it comes to portability.\n  The MSA is an attractive alternative for families. It gives the \nAmerican family the greatest flexibility in choosing its own health \ncare provider. With MSA's, you, the patient, are able to select the \ndoctor or provider you desire, without interference by the bureaucracy. \nAnd this can be very important to people, especially when confronted \nwith serious illness or disability.\n  MSA's provide flexibility for families to purchase insurance in the \nevent the family loses its job or if it wants to buy long-term health \ninsurance. Under our legislation taxpayers will be able to use money in \ntheir medical savings accounts without penalty to make COBRA payments--\nto continue their catastrophic health insurance policy in the event \nthey lose their jobs.\n  MSA's allow funds from the account to be used to purchase long-term \ncare insurance. Thus, MSA's help provide nursing home care, which, in \nturn, helps relieve those costs borne by Medicaid.\n  MSA's will go a long way toward containing health care costs. They \nwill encourage consumers to shop wisely, to reject unnecessary \ntreatment and conserve scarce medical resources. Why? Because with \nMSA's it's the consumer and not some third party who pays the bills.\n  Medical savings accounts will offer millions of employees and self-\nemployed individuals an affordable health care option. A high-\ndeductible insurance policy coupled with an MSA is less expensive than \ntraditional insurance.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries reports that MSA's will be \nattractive to small businesses and their employees as well as to self-\nemployed Americans. Many of these individuals do not have health \ncoverage, and MSA's have the potential to increase health insurance \ncoverage among this group.\n  Medical savings accounts are proven. They have been used, and they \nhave been used successfully by hundreds of companies all across \nAmerica. These companies have found that by empowering their employees \nto take charge of their own care, spending costs have declined.\n  Unfortunately, the companies currently using MSA's are limited \nbecause our tax laws basically penalize employees who choose to be \ncovered by MSA's. Under current law, at the end of the year, employees \nhave to include the full amount of the money deposited into his or her \nMSA in their taxable income. This is absurd. These people are being hit \nfor being responsible, for being self-reliant, for taking charge of \ntheir own health care needs.\n  This must be corrected, Mr. President. In a campaign of \ndisinformation the administration claims that MSA's will be a tax break \nfor the rich. This is not true. Companies that provide MSA's find them \nto be very popular among their low- and middle-income employees. In \nfact, the Joint Committee on Taxation reports that 78 percent of MSA \nusers will have incomes of less than $75,000.\n  As Congressmen Torricelli and Jacobs wrote in a letter to the \nPresident, dated April 17:\n\n       You also should know that the current contract of the \n     United Mine workers provides its members with MSA's. We do \n     not believe the UMW qualifies as healthier and wealthier than \n     the general population--a charge leveled by uninformed MSA \n     opponents.\n\n  The administration predicts that MSA's will discourage preventive \ncare. In fact, Mr. President, many companies with MSA's find the \nopposite to be true. Medical savings accounts encourage people to get \npreventative care because they have money in their account to pay for \nthis care. It is interesting to note that many traditional low \ndeductible insurance policies do not cover preventative care.\n  The administration asserts that MSA's will be attractive to the young \nand, healthy, leaving the less healthy to pay higher insurance \npremiums. Unfortunately for the administration, this again is not true. \nThe hundreds of companies that offer MSA's to their employees find them \nto be attractive to workers of all health status. This is because an \nMSA provides first dollar coverage for many medical expenses not \notherwise covered by traditional low-deductible health insurance.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting to note that 12 States and at least \n1 city have passed medical savings account legislation and dozens more \nare moving to pass similar legislation. It is the Federal Government \nthat must now move ahead with this idea.\n  Again, the need to move ahead is nothing new. Three years ago, \nSenators Daschle, Breaux, Boren, and Nunn joined Senators Lugar and \nCoats to pass what they firmly believed was a much needed program. \nToday that program is needed--now more than ever.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to end their blockade of health \ninsurance reform, and work with us to make affordable health insurance \na reality for more Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis very authoritative remarks on this MSA account and on health care \nreform in general. We appreciate his dedication to this work. I yield \nup to 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a legislative \nfellow on my staff, Dr. Jonelle Rowe, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to expand a bit \nupon the Health Insurance Reform Act, where it stands today, but \nfocusing on the area under discussion--which is currently, in essence, \nbeing filibustered--and that is the medical savings account issue. On \nboth sides of the aisle it is apparent that, for the first time, at \nleast since I have been here over the last 2 years, we are very close \nto passing a health insurance bill that is market based, that is \nincremental, and that reaches out to many people who do not have health \ninsurance today, directly and indirectly. But even more important, I \nthink, and more specifically, this bill addresses the issues of \nportability and preexisting illness for people who do have health \ninsurance today and who are in group plans; portability being if you\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nare in a group plan now and you have insurance, and either you lose \nyour job or you go from one job to another job, you can take that plan \nwith you.\n  It is not quite that easy, but you will have access to a health care \nplan when you switch jobs or if you lose your job, and that is the \nportability concept. The preexisting concept being, if you have heart \ndisease and have had a heart attack, you can still get insurance if you \ngo from one job to another.\n  The Senate has debated again and again, before I was in this body, \nthese issues, really for the past 6 years. There is general agreement \non these two particular issues.\n  But today that bill, which is a positive bill, the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill, is being held up by this filibuster on medical savings accounts.\n  We hear a lot about medical savings accounts, and it is important \nthat, on both sides of the aisle, people understand what they are.\n  It is very, very simple. A medical savings account is a high-\ndeductible, say $2,000, catastrophic insurance plan. So, if you have \nmedical expenses that are greater than, for example, $2,000, your \ncatastrophic insurance plan would kick in and you would have coverage \nfor your health care expenses.\n  That high-deductible catastrophic plan is coupled with a tax \ndeductible personal savings account, in which you would take, for \nexample, $2,000 a year over which you have some sort of tax relief, and \nthat is placed in a personal medical savings account.\n  It is out of that personal medical savings account, a little bit like \na medical IRA, that you can draw to pay for your routine medical \nexpenses, whether it is going to the dentist or paying for \nprescriptions or paying for that annual checkup or paying for that \ntreatment of heart disease, whatever it is. The point is, you have \naccess to that money and you use that money, you have control over that \nmoney. It empowers the individual.\n  I say that as background, because the issues that are debated on this \nfloor again and again are: Will it save money? Will there be just \nhealthy people coming in or will it be just the sickest people coming \nin? What will it do to the insurance industry?\n  There was a wonderful article that the Senator from Georgia referred \nto earlier that was published just this past week in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association. That article was this past week. The \narticle itself is called ``Can Medical Savings Accounts for the \nNonelderly Reduce Health Care Costs?'' At this juncture, Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from the study be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the Journal of the American Medical Association, June 1996]\n\n  Can Medical Savings Accounts for the Nonelderly Reduce Health Care \n                                 Costs?\n\n (By Emmett B. Keller, Ph.D.; Jesse D. Malkin; Dana P. Goldman, Ph.D.; \n                        Joan L. Buchanan, Ph.D.)\n\n       Objective.--To understand how medical savings account (MSA) \n     legislation for the nonelderly would affect health care \n     costs.\n       Design.--Economic policy evaluation based on the RAND \n     Health Expenditures Simulation Model.\n       Setting.--National probability sample of nonelderly \n     noninstitutionalized households.\n       Participants.--Persons in 23,157 sampled households from \n     the 1993 Current Population Survey.\n       Interventions.--Medical savings account legislation would \n     allow all Americans who are covered only by a catastrophic \n     health care plan to set up a tax-exempt account that they can \n     use to pay medical bills not covered by their health \n     insurance. The interventions we evaluate differ in the \n     deductibles of the catastrophic plan and in whether the \n     employee or employer funds the MSA.\n       Main Outcome Measures.--Changes in national health \n     expenditures and net social benefits of health care.\n       Results.--If all insured nonelderly Americans switched to \n     MSAs, their health care expenditures would decline by between \n     0% and 13%, depending on how the MSAs are designed. However, \n     not all nonelderly Americans would choose MSAs; taking into \n     account selection patterns, health spending would change by \n     +1% to -2%.\n       Conclusions.--Medical savings account legislation would \n     have little impact on health care costs of Americans with \n     employer-provided insurance. However, depending on the size \n     of the catastrophic limit, waste from the excessive use of \n     generously insured care could be reduced, and MSAs would be \n     attractive to both sick and healthy people.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is a fascinating article, and I had the \nopportunity to meet here in Washington with the principal author on \nthis particular study, Dr. Emmett Keeler. We had a chance to talk about \nthe study. I do think Members on both sides of the aisle should read \nit. In the conclusions, in the abstract, it goes on, but the last \nsentence basically says:\n\n       Depending on the size of the catastrophic limit, waste from \n     the excessive use of generously insured care could be \n     reduced, and MSAs would be attractive to both sick and \n     healthy people.\n\n  I just quote from the conclusions. I do encourage my colleagues to \nread this study. The cost issue talked about is a great model. It is \ndeveloped from a policy standpoint projecting ahead. I think that is \nterribly important to do.\n  I do think we need to come back and say, fundamentally, that we are \nnot going to be able to answer whether it is going to cost a little bit \nmore or a little bit less with the data that is out there today. \nTherefore, I would like to turn to what nobody talks about--the policy \npeople do not talk about, the think tanks do not talk about. I have not \nheard it yet in the debate over the last 18 months on this Senate \nfloor. I have not heard it among the think tanks in Washington. I have \nnot heard it talked about among the economists. And that is the \nperspective of where health care is delivered, and that is at the \nphysician-patient level. It simply has not been talked about yet.\n  The debate here 3 years ago, or 4 years ago, when we were debating \nthe one-size-fits-all Clinton health care plan, failed in this regard \nas well. There were about 500 people involved, much of it was behind \nclosed doors. The public did not have input in those discussions, and \nreal-life people and physicians were not even in the room, people who \nare involved in that doctor-patient interaction everyday.\n  Why is it important to look at that level? And this is the key point \nthat people miss or do not talk about, and that is because it is at \nthat level that behavior is actually changed, the behavior of the \npatient who comes in who is suddenly empowered to ask certain \nquestions. Why? Because they are spending their own money. Not like \ntoday, in most cases, where the insurance company is paying for it or \nthe public dole is paying for it, or Medicare is paying for it or \nGovernment is paying for it. It changes the dynamics of that \nrelationship because we have empowered that individual who is coming \nin, knowing they are going to be drawing money from their personal \nsavings accounts in order to buy health care, to buy health care \nservices.\n  Let me give you my own experience as a physician who has been \ninvolved in the field of medicine for the last 20 years before coming \nto this body. And it is this: When somebody comes into that office and \nthey have chest pain and they are spending their own money and not \nspending the insurance company's money or spending the Government's \nmoney, they ask three questions. Those three questions are asked very \ndirectly, looking you in the eye. Basically, they are:\n  ``What are your credentials, Dr. Frist?''\n  Second: ``How much do you charge?''\n  Why do they ask that? Because they are going to be paying for it out \nof their own personal savings account.\n  And third: ``What kind of results do you have?'' ``Are the results \ngood or bad?'' ``How do you compare to other people?''\n  Why? Because that individual coming into the office is empowered for \nthe first time because it is their money they are spending.\n  How are these questions really asked? People will come in, with \nregard to credentials, and they will look at your wall to see where you \ngraduated from school. All of us, when we go into a doctor's office, \nsee the diplomas, but they go beyond that:\n  ``Where did you do your internship?''\n  ``Where did you do your residency training?''\n  ``Do you participate in writing peer review articles in your \njournals?''\n  ``Do you participate in your professional societies?''\n  ``Are you board certified?''\n  Those are the sort of questions that are asked, once you empower \nsomebody who comes into your office.\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\n  What is the end effect of that? The effect of that to me as a \nphysician, when people ask me those questions, is to do what? Is to \ntake off a week, a year and do that continuing education course. If I \ndo not have my boards, it is for me to go back and pass my boards or \nget board certified, because they are asking me that question. If \nenough people ask me that question, I know they are going to be going \nto the board-certified surgeon rather than the nonboard-certified \nsurgeon.\n  That is the power of having an individual--many individuals--come \ninto your office and ask you what your credentials are.\n  No. 2, that person is going to come in, because that money is coming \nout of their personal savings account, which, if they are not going to \nspend it, rolls over to the next year by the bill we are proposing, \nthey are going to ask, ``How much do you charge?''\n  I guess it was 4 weeks ago I went camping with my son, and we did not \nhave a flashlight. So I went down to a store here locally and looked at \nthe flashlights. There were $25 flashlights that had emergency lights, \nbuttons you could push, actually had a horn on it, down to the little \n$3 flashlight, down to the $1 little pen light. I asked, ``How much do \nyou charge? What do you get for that?''\n  In truth, that is what we are doing when a patient comes in and they \nsay, ``How much do you charge to do a heart transplant?'' You would \nthink people ask that all the time. It really was not until about 1988, \nmaybe 1987, that the first patient, having been doing heart transplants \nsince the early eighties, came into my office and said, ``Dr. Frist, \nhow much is this heart transplant going to cost me?''\n  Why do most people not ask? Because Medicare will pay for it, \nMedicaid would pay for it, large insurance companies will pay for it. \nThey knew they never would have to pay for it.\n  This fellow came into my office. ``Why do you ask,'' because I did \nnot know exactly how much a heart transplant cost. Nobody ever asked \nme.\n  Here, I was doing as many heart transplants as anybody in the State \nof Tennessee. But nobody ever asked me. I said, ``Why do you ask?'' He \nsaid, ``Because I'm going to have to pay for it. I do not have any \ninsurance. I'm not 65 years of age, so Medicare is not going to kick \nin. And I'm not poor enough for Medicaid to kick in. It is coming out \nof my pocket.''\n  What was my response? My response was, ``I don't know exactly how \nmuch it is. I know how much my surgical fees are, but I don't know how \nmuch the hospital charges, I don't know how much the pathologist \ncharges or the rehabilitation specialist or the physical therapist. But \nI'll find out.''\n  So what did I do? I went back, pulled everybody into a room--\ntransplantation is fairly complex. It involves lots of people. For the \nfirst time--I was the director of this transplant center--for the first \ntime we had all these physicians in the room deciding how much a heart \ntransplant should cost, based on the services they deliver; where in \nthe past people just got the bills, passed them to the insurance \ncompany, paid, with no questions asked, or sent them to the Federal \nGovernment, and there were no questions asked.\n  My point is, if you have one person coming in, asking the right \nquestions, it changes my behavior, but also the behavior of the whole \ntransplant center, of all the physicians that had, for the first time, \ngotten in the room.\n  The third question that people ask, beyond how much you charge, is, \nwhat is your outcome? Because people want to know the value. Just like \nwhen I went to buy those flashlights, do I want a flashlight that will \nwork for 1 year, 5 years, 1 month, 3 months? You ask the question. For \nthe first time, if somebody is paying for it themselves, they will say, \n``What are your results?'' not ``Am I going to live or die,'' but ``How \ndo you compare to''--I was in Tennessee--``How do you compare to \nAlabama or Georgia or Baltimore, other transplant programs? What is \nyour outcome? When do people go back to work? What is your rate of \ninfections? What is the rate of rejection over the period of the first \nmonth?'' People just do not typically ask those questions. But the \nempowered patient does.\n  And what do I have to do? All of a sudden, I say, people are going to \nbe looking at me and comparing my quality of care, my standards--I \nthink my infection rate is the best in the country, but I do not know. \nNobody has ever asked me or forced me to report that data. You do not \nhave to report that data. But with that one person asking me, I start \ncollecting, all of a sudden, that data.\n  So do my colleagues in Georgia and Alabama. We start comparing each \nother. Why? Because that patient that is looking for a heart \ntransplant, that is going to change their life, is going to go shopping \naround. If he is going to be paying $100 or $150 or $1,500 he is going \nto be shopping around. How is it going to change--this is my point--my \nbehavior, the health care industry behavior? What does it do? It is \ngoing to cost me more because I have to hire a nurse to help me collect \nthat data. I have to put it in a computer. I might have to put it in a \ncomputer, but it improves the quality of care broadly.\n  The point of all this is, that medical savings accounts, to work, you \ndo not have to have 20 percent of the American population come into the \nmedical savings accounts to have a huge impact on the value of health \ncare. You do not have to have 10 percent take advantage of it or 5 \npercent or 1 percent.\n  The real beauty of it is that one person coming into my office and \nasking the right questions--what are your credentials? How much do you \ncharge? What are your outcomes?--changes my behavior in the way I treat \nthat individual, but also the way I treat all of the other 95 percent \nof the people in the health care system, because I go back and get \ncontinuing education, I start recording my data that can be compared to \nother people. I have an incentive to do what? Deliver a higher quality \nof care to all Americans because we have empowered those individuals \nthrough medical savings accounts.\n  I say all this, because what I want the other side to do--the other \nside is filibustering this bill of preexisting illness, of portability, \nusing this guise of medical savings accounts. I just ask the other side \nto do a simple thing. And that is, to forget the policy for awhile, \neven forget the policy studies and the economic studies, because it is \ngoing to be hard to make a decision just on that, but tonight or this \nafternoon call your physician, call the physician who delivered your \nchild, call the physician who fixed your broken arm, call the physician \nwho treats your heart disease or your family's heart disease, and just \nask them a very, very simple question. And that question is, ``By \nempowering individuals to have some control over their health care \ndollar''--and that is all medical savings accounts do--``will it change \nthe way you practice medicine? Will it result in a higher quality of \nmedicine? Will it empower that empowered individual to ask you \ndifferent questions than the person who has no incentive to ask the \nquestions, like `How much do you charge?' or `What are your outcomes?' \n'' And if that physician, if that health care provider, if that nurse \ncomes forward and basically says, ``Yes, it will improve quality, it \nwill improve value,'' then I encourage you to drop this filibuster and \nendorse medical savings accounts and support this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his remarks. He \nhas introduced a matter into the debate we have not heard before, and \nthat is very basically from the provider standpoint, what happens when \nthe consumer has a role to play for the first time. It was very \nenlightening. I appreciate the comments from the Senator from \nTennessee. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague from \nGeorgia for putting this time together, and also congratulate my \ncolleague from Tennessee. I have heard this MSA discussion many, many \ntimes, but I do not think I have ever heard it as eloquently expressed \nas he has just expressed it.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n  There is just no substitute for personal experience, and there is no \nsubstitute for coming to this floor and knowing what you are talking \nabout. Senator Frist clearly has demonstrated that he knows what he is \ntalking about. As my colleague from Georgia has said, he has really put \na different perspective on this. What empowerment means is, not only \nare dollars going to go further, but the quality of medical care is \ngoing to go up, consumers are going to be able to choose, and there is \ngoing to be a reaction on the other side of that table or the other \nside of that examining room where the doctor may in fact change some of \nthe things that he or she does.\n\n  So that was, I think a very, very great testimonial to the power of \nempowerment, giving people the right to make their own decisions and \nthe reason why, frankly, we need to end this 61-day filibuster that has \nbeen occurring on this floor. We need to move this bill forward. We \nneed to get the conferees appointed. So I just urge my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, who have been holding this up, to stop it \nand let us move forward. Let us get the conferees appointed and let us \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, last month the Ohio General Assembly approved \nlegislation to establish medical savings accounts. The Ohio legislation \npermits Ohio families to make contributions to an MSA, and then deduct \nthe contributions from their State taxes. In effect, the State of Ohio \nis telling people, ``We want you to save, we want you to save for the \nfuture when it comes to your own health care. And we think that you, \nthe Ohio taxpaying family, would do a better job of deciding how to \nspend your health insurance dollars than the Government bureaucracy \nwould.''\n  I think it is time here in Congress that we did the same thing, we \nfollow the lead of Ohio and some other States that have passed similar \nlegislation. Mr. President, it is a simple fact of human nature. People \nwill make wiser choices when they are spending their own money. As my \ncolleague from Tennessee said, he gave ample examples of that, real-\nworld examples of how people come in and see the doctor and ask the \nright questions.\n  An MSA is basically, Mr. President, an IRA targeted specifically at \nhealth care expenses. An MSA gives the health care consumer both the \nfreedom and the incentive to shop intelligently for health care \nservices.\n  Here is basically how an MSA would work for a typical working \nAmerican family. The worker's employer puts, let's say, $2,000 a year \ntax free into the worker's medical savings account. The worker uses \nthat $2,000 to pay for checkups, emergency treatment, and whatever \nother medical necessities arise during the course of that year. If the \nworker's family has medical costs above $2,000, catastrophic coverage \nwould pay for it, catastrophic coverage would then kick in. If the \nfamily's medical costs are lower than $2,000, the family could keep \nwhatever money is left over. It would be theirs.\n  This is a major improvement over current standard practice, I believe \nin a number of ways. First, MSA's offer first-dollar coverage. They pay \nthe first dollar of cost the family incurs, the immediate expenses they \nface at the doctor's office or at the emergency room.\n  Under the current system, workers have to pay--the current system \ntoday--workers have to pay a high deductible or high copayments for \ntheir medical care. The MSA will cover--will cover--that cost for them. \nTo the typical American family, this is very important. There are not \ntoo many Americans, Mr. President, who have hundreds of dollars just \nsitting around in a bank account waiting for a medical emergency.\n  Washington Post columnist Jim Glassman tells the story of a woman \nnamed Penny Blubaugh, who earns $16,000 a year as a secretary in the \nDanville, OH, school system. Her daughter stepped on a nail in their \ngarage, and Penny took her to the emergency room.\n  Cost: $375 for the emergency room, $70 for the x rays, for a total \ncost of $445. That is $445 that Penny did not have. Fortunately, Penny \nwas in an MSA, and MSA paid the bill--no deductible, no copayment. They \npaid the bill--first dollar coverage. That, Mr. President, is a \ndramatic concrete benefit to the typical working family that \nparticipates in an MSA.\n  The second benefit to both the individual working family and the \ncountry as a whole is the opportunity to save money. If the money in an \nMSA is left unused, at the end of the year the working family gets to \nkeep it. I can imagine no better incentive for intelligent consumer \nchoices when it comes to health care. A family spending its own money \nwith the prospect of keeping whatever is unspent will mean that money \nsimply is not wasted.\n  It is simple, common, basic sense. It is also the conclusion of a \nstudy that was conducted by the Rand Corp. between 1974 and 1982. Will \npeople make very bad choices, denying themselves essential care to save \na few dollars? We do hear that argument being made. The Rand Corp. \nstudy found that was not true. People would not do that. People would \nnot act against their own self-interest.\n  Mr. President, if you give an American family some resources and \nfreedom, they will tend to make the right choices. What we need in \nAmerican health economics is more people making the right choices. For \ntoo long we have limited the freedom of American health care consumers \nto make these right choices. It should not be a surprise, therefore, \nthat we have rapidly rising health care costs at a time when inflation, \nin general, is pretty much under control.\n  A recent Cleveland State University study examined 27 Ohio \nbusinesses, each with under 200 employees, that offered MSA's to their \nemployees. The results were remarkable--a triumph of cost containment \nthat demonstrates how promising the MSA alternative really is.\n  On average, individuals in the MSA plan had lower out-of-pocket \nhealth care costs than those who had the more traditional kind of \nhealth insurance. The average savings were $317 for individuals who \nused MSA's and $1,355 for families who used MSA's. The employers saved, \ntoo. On average, employers saved 12 percent more than they would have \nfrom the traditional plans, had they been in the traditional plan.\n  That, Mr. President, is the right direction for America. That is why, \nas of last year, 17 States had passed MSA laws. That is why Ohio moved \nforward with MSA legislation just this past month. That is why we are \nhere today, pressing for the enactment of this extremely promising \napproach on the Federal level.\n  I again urge colleagues who have been blocking this now--we are in \nour 61st day of a filibuster--to let us move forward, appoint the \nconferees, let the American people have the benefit of these MSA's, \nwhich we clearly think, and the evidence is very strong, will make a \ndifference.\n  I again thank my colleague from Georgia for setting up this time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement on \nthis very important matter. I yield up to 10 minutes to the senior \nSenator from Alaska.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was pleased to be here during the \nperiod of presentation of the distinguished occupant of the chair. As a \nphysician, the Senator from Tennessee brings a great deal of \ninformation to us in a direct way.\n  I might say, as I begin my comments, starting in 1987 there was a \ngroup of us that decided we would meet once a week while the Senate was \nin session to review the problems of health care and insurance reform. \nIt has been most enlightening to this Senator to be a participant, \nparticularly with regard to these medical savings accounts. When they \nfirst came up, I realized what a great thing it would be for my State \nto have them put into Federal law.\n  In my State, over 90 percent of the employers are small businesses. \nCommunity ratings often give us very high health insurance costs. Many \nof these small businesses, though they would like to do so, just cannot \nafford to provide health insurance coverage for their employees. We \nlive on the edge, under very costly circumstances. It is very difficult \nfor these employees to bear the cost of health insurance. Many times \nthey are like that person that the Senator from Tennessee indicated \nthat came to his office: They are without health insurance, and \noftentimes face real difficult problems.\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\n  I do believe the concept of a catastrophic insurance really fits into \nthe frontier problems, because the situation often develops that our \npeople would like to deal with someone they know, not only as a \nphysician but as an insurance carrier. Catastrophic insurance is \navailable through almost all small insurance firms. It is something you \ncan deal at home with, and have a strong relationship with a person who \nhas sold you the insurance.\n  For that reason, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill. I think it is high time Congress got around to passing \nthis bill.\n  I personally do not believe it should be a right of any Senator to \nobject to the appointment of conferees. I think that ought to be a \nmatter of right of the leadership to say when conferees should be \nappointed, and they should not be subject to any debate. We are being \nheld up now by a debate on whether or not conferees should be \nappointed. This is probably one of the most important bills we will \nwork on during this Congress. Time is running out.\n  This objection to allowing medical savings provisions in this bill is \nwhat is really holding up the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Under a \ncompromise worked out by the House and the Senate, only employers with \n50 or fewer workers and those who are self-employed could participate \nin medical savings accounts. Most employers who have used medical \nsavings accounts that I have heard of know them as the Senator from \nTennessee indicated: Medical savings accounts concepts allow people to \nchoose their own doctors, hospitals, and their on form of care. They \nencourage preventive health care and eliminate out-of-pocket costs.\n  Medical savings accounts allow people to use their savings to buy \nother forms of health insurance like nursing home coverage or long-term \ncare. Medical savings accounts allow individuals to control their own \nhealth care dollars and to support the free enterprise system.\n  There is just no question that this is a kind of provision that ought \nto be in a health care insurance reform bill. It is a very limited one, \nvery limited. It will benefit thousands of Alaskans who change their \njobs and lose their jobs, enabling them to maintain vitally important \nhealth insurance coverage for themselves and their families.\n  In my State, Mr. President, 65 percent of our women of childbearing \nage work out of the home. They are women that, because they go in and \nout of the work force in order to take time off to bear their children, \noften end up without insurance coverage during the very period of their \nlife they really need it. This medical savings account concept ought to \nbe involved in this law to help us meet the problems of those women in \nour work force.\n  It will also benefit Alaskans who have the so-called preexisting \nconditions, which in the past have prevented many Alaskans from getting \nhealth insurance coverage because they have changed their jobs or they \nhave gone through a period of unemployment. When they go to a new job \nor they go back to work, they find their health insurance is not \navailable because when they reapply, they now have a preexisting \ncondition which was covered under their prior insurance policy, but \nthey lost coverage. I do not think many people realize how many, many \nindividuals in a State like ours change jobs, work part time, and find \nthemselves without coverage because of this problem of preexisting \ncondition.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is a moderate, sensible approach to \nimproving our health insurance system. Its benefits will be felt by \nsome 25 million Americans in total, according to a report of the GAO.\n  I cannot believe that this could be a program only for the rich, if \nit is going to apply to 25 million Americans. I can say, without \nquestion, that it will affect hundreds of thousands of Alaskans, \ndespite our small population.\n  Of particular importance is that this will make health insurance \navailable to Alaskans who are self-employed by making it more \naffordable, by increasing the deduction for health insurance premiums \nfrom the current 30 percent to 80 percent over a 10-year period. I do \nnot think anybody has mentioned that. This will bring about a change. \nAs we all know, currently self-employed people can only deduct 30 \npercent of their health insurance premiums. This bill before us now \nwill gradually change that so that discrimination against self-employed \npeople, as far as health insurance premiums, is eliminated over a 10-\nyear period.\n  I might also mention a substantial benefit to Alaskan seniors. Long-\nterm care insurance policies would receive the same tax treatment as \ntraditional health insurance under this bill. Unreimbursed long-term \ncare expenses would be treated as medical expenses for itemized \ndeduction purposes--a change, Mr. President, which will make a \nsubstantial change in the ability of people to pay for long-term care, \nparticularly for the children of those people who need long-term care. \nThey are the ones that are paying these expenses.\n  This legislation will not affect the right of Alaskans to receive \nhealth care from chiropractors or alternative medicine people. My \noffice has received a slew of telephone calls from Alaskans who fear \nthis legislation because of the fraud and abuse provisions added \nthrough the amendment to title V. They feel that that amendment would \nstop them from seeing a health provider of their choice, especially \nunder the Medicare Program. I think I should assure Alaskans and all \nAmericans that that is not true. I support the right of Americans and \nmy Alaskan people to seek health care from alternative health \nproviders. This bill will allow Alaskans and all Americans to get \nhealth care from the provider of their choice, including alternative \nmedicine and chiropractors licensed by the State.\n  I believe this legislation will make a vital contribution to the \nwell-being of thousands of our people in my home State, who now have \nthe prospect of losing health care for themselves and their families \nwhen there is an interruption in their employment.\n  I urge the Senate to name conferees and get this bill to conference \nand to the President as soon as possible. This should not be an \nelection year political issue. This is an issue which should rise above \npolitics. I challenge anyone in the Senate to defend holding up this \nbill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. I \nparticularly appreciate his knowledge of the parliamentary nature of \nthis body and his expertise. When the Senator from Alaska says we have \na bolt out of whack on our policy here, the bolt is probably out of \nwhack. I join the Senator in an effort to get that straight.\n  Mr. President, the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee reminded me \nof a friend in the medical practice that I know in Georgia. Several \nyears ago, we were musing, and he talked about a time when the exchange \nmight involve something other than money. Somebody might offer, in some \nof the rural areas of our State, crops or produce. He said it was \nalways a very serious negotiation, determining what the cost of the \nmedical procedure would be.\n  Now, you are dealing with a far more sophisticated process. But the \nSenator from Tennessee makes me remember that. He said that the \ncustomer--or the patient--really paid attention when they were about to \ncontract for a medical service. He was convinced that that interaction \nbetween the patient and the doctor, and the patient and other medical \nproviders, was the missing element and was a core reason for the \ngeometric escalation in medical costs.\n  Senator Gramm from Texas addressed this issue in the health care \ndebate, and he said that if we bought groceries the way we buy medical \nservices, he would eat a whole lot better, and so would his dog.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the Senator from Utah, who \nchaired the health care task force that the Senator from Alaska was \nreferring to a moment ago.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I am \ninterested that he refers to the Senator from Texas and his comment \nabout groceries, because I have a somewhat similar analogy that I think \nillustrates the issue we are talking about here.\n  Come with me in your mind's eye, Mr. President, to a job interview at \nan imaginary company that operates\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nunder the principle that we use for health insurance in this country \ntoday. You are going through the interview, and you have arrived at a \nsalary discussion and arrangement. You know your job duties. Now you \nsay to your prospective employer, ``Tell me about the benefit package \nthat you have.'' Your employer says, ``Well, Mr. Frist, we have a \nwonderful clothing care system here at XYZ Industries. You will really \nlike it. Clothing, of course, is absolutely essential to your survival. \nIt goes back as long as civilization because people have had to have \nclothing to protect them from the elements. We have the greatest \nclothing program in the world.''\n  You say, ``Wonderful, I will come to work for XYZ Industries, and \nunder your clothing benefit plan, I will be properly taken care of.'' \nThen you come to clothe your family and you are told, ``Well, at XYZ, \nwe cover two suits a year and one sport coat.'' You say, ``Well, I \nwould like to buy two sport coats.'' They say, ``No, you cannot have \nit. Our benefit package only covers two suits and one sport coat. And, \nby the way, we only provide for black shoes and not brown shoes to go \nwith those suits. Now, under the benefits that are covered by our \nclothing plan, we will cover walking shoes, but not running shoes. And \nthere is a limit, of course. We have cost containment, as clothing \ncosts have been going through the roof. There is a limit on the number \nof pairs of socks that will be covered under your clothing plan that we \nhave decided is the appropriate number of socks.'' And you then get a \nmemo through the mail that says, ``Our clothing costs at XYZ industries \nhave gone out of sight, and so we have changed to a clothing \nmaintenance organization, and now we have made a deal with Sears \nRoebuck. You go down to Sears Roebuck and they will provide all of your \nclothing.''\n  You have to go through a clothing counselor, who will meet you when \nyou walk through the door of Sears, and he will size you up and may \nsay, ``Well, before we will replace the suit you are wearing, we will \nmake the decision that it has more wear left in it and, therefore, we \nwill not authorize a new suit until there is more wear and tear in the \nknees of the suit that you currently have on.''\n  That is how we will get some cost containment and cost control. I \ncould go on and on. But I think you understand, Mr. President, how \nabsurd this looks to American workers and American wage earners. They \nwould say, ``Please, Senator, eliminate this vision and take us back to \nthe present circumstance where our employer does indeed pay for all of \nour clothes, but he does it by giving us some money. And we decide how \nmany suits we want. We decide what color shoes we want. We decide \nwhether we want to shop at Sears, or Nordstrom's, or the Gap, or Wal-\nMart, or wherever. Leave it up to us to make the choices.''\n  We do not do that in health care. The health care circumstance is \njust as I have described it with clothing. No, you cannot decide that \nyou want this kind of treatment because it is not covered under our \nplan. You cannot decide you want this particular doctor. We have \ndecided that we are going in another direction. What if we did the same \nthing with health care that we do with clothing, or food, or shelter, \nor transportation, or any of the other necessities of life, and said, \n``You make your own decisions and pay for it with dollars that you have \nset aside in savings''?\n  What if we recognized that we have, in fact, destroyed the insurance \nprinciple in health care by saying we are not ensuring against risk; we \nare, in fact, paying for everything?\n  Let me shift analogies for just a minute. I have said on the floor \nbefore in the health care circumstance that I have a homeowner's policy \non my home, and it is a wonderful policy. If my house burns down, I get \neverything I need. The paintings on the wall get replaced. The silver \nin the drawers in the kitchen gets replaced. The dishes, my clothes--\neverything that is destroyed in the fire gets replaced. The fire is a \ncatastrophe. I have insurance against catastrophe. But there is nothing \nin my homeowner's policy that covers the cost of mowing the lawn. There \nis nothing in my homeowner's policy that covers the cost of repainting \nthe front door when the dog scratches it.\n  Do you know how much my homeowner's policy would cost if I had to \nfile an insurance claim every time I wanted the lawn cut? ``How do you \npay, Senator Bennett, for the cost of mowing the lawn and painting the \nfront door?'' I have a savings account, and I pay American money to the \nson of my next door neighbor to come over and mow the lawn. And \ninsurance is reserved for catastrophe.\n  I am insured against catastrophe, and my insurance policy is very, \nvery reasonable. Why are we not smart enough to do that with health \ncare, and say, all right, the little things that we handle in health \ncare we pay for out of savings, and we have insurance to cover the \ncatastrophic circumstances?\n  I have talked to insurance people. I have said, what is the number \nthat we need as a deductible in order to make this kind of a system \nwork? We have heard, for medical savings accounts, the figure of \n$3,000. The insurance people say the difference between a $1,500 \ndeductible and a $3,000 deductible is de minimis. It really does not \nmake that much difference. If you had a $1,500 deductible, you are only \nsaving pennies, if you go to a $3,000 deductible.\n  I then went to the leading hospital in Salt Lake City. I said, ``What \nwould happen if every bill that was less than $1,500 was paid for in \ncash?'' They kind of blinked at me because they assumed that everything \nthat comes in gets paid for by filing an insurance claim. They said, \n``Senator, 80 percent of our emergency room admissions come to less \nthan $1,500.'' I said, ``How much administrative savings would you have \nif you didn't have to process insurance claims for that 80 percent of \nyour business?'' They said, ``Good heavens, it would save us \nenormously.''\n\n  We have a control group that we can refer to, Mr. President, that \ndemonstrates the wisdom of paying for things with cash as opposed to \nfiling insurance claims for a flu shot, filing insurance claims for an \noffice visit, filing an insurance claim for everything that comes \nalong. You may have heard of it. I hope more people have heard of it. \nThe Shriners Hospital system. The Shriners are a fraternal organization \nthat raises money that it spends to take care of children who cannot \npay. The only requirement for you to get into a Shriners Hospital is \nthat you do not have the capacity to pay for the treatment. That is it. \nYou have to be sick, of course. But if you are sick, and you do not \nhave the capacity to pay for your treatment, you can get into a \nShriners Hospital.\n  Here are the numbers from the Shriners Hospital in Salt Lake City, \nUT: 4 percent of their budget goes for administration; 96 percent goes \nfor health care. Why? Because they do not deal with a single insurance \ncompany, and they do not deal with a single Government agency. They do \nnot have to fill out any forms or screen anybody for eligibility beyond \nconvincing themselves that these people cannot pay.\n  What is the cost of treatment in the Shriners Hospital? Here is the \nnumber: $95 a day. I have said this, somehow you are missing a decimal \npoint. It has to be $950 a day. That is what it cost in a modern \nhospital: $95 a day because they do not have any of these \nadministrative costs. It does not pass the Bob Newhart test.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I might have another 3 minutes to \nexplain the Bob Newhart test.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Utah 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Here is the Bob Newhart test. Have you ever heard Bob \nNewhart discuss, as if he had no previous experience at all, the \nsmoking of tobacco with Sir Walter Raleigh?\n  Bob Newhart is on the phone, and he is saying, ``Let me get this \nstraight, Walt. This is a weed, right? This has no food value, and you \nwant to bring it over here? Tell me, Walt, what do you do? You roll it \nup? And, yeah, OK, Walt. Now you stick it in your ear. Right? No, no. \nYou stick it in your mouth? Come on, Walt. What do you do with it? You \nroll this weed up and stick it in your mouth? Yeah, Walt. You set fire \nto it, and you start breathing the fumes?''\n  Bob Newhart has made a great comedy career out of doing that kind of \nanalysis of the stupidities of the things that we do in our lives. Our \nmedical system of insurance does not pass the Bob Newhart test.\n  I have tried to put it in that context by saying this is what would \nhappen if\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\nwe bought clothing the way we buy health care, if we had to file an \ninsurance claim for the cost of mowing the lawn, and everybody laughs. \nBut that is where we are, and the people who are opposing medical \nsavings accounts are the people who do not realize the absurdity of the \npresent circumstance, who have gotten themselves in the mindset that \nsince we have done it this way, this is the way it always has to be. If \nyou can only step back and look at it honestly, you realize how many \nproblems you solve if you say that health insurance should be like car \ninsurance and homeowners insurance and flood insurance and earthquake \ninsurance and tornado insurance. Health insurance should insure us \nagainst a catastrophe, just as we use money to make the decision \nwhether we want brown shoes or black shoes, just as we use money to \nmake our own decisions on whether we want to replace the suit or wear a \nsport coat. We should use money to say, ``I am going to get a flu shot; \nI am going to take care of this hangnail; I am not going to file an \ninsurance claim with all of the administrative costs connected with \nthat.''\n  It is just plain common sense, and it more than passes the Bob \nNewhart test.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah not only \nfor these remarks but for the extended effort that he has made on the \nissue of reform for our health care system. The Senator from Utah has \ndedicated many, many hours to that.\n  We have been joined by the Senator from Iowa, and in a few moments we \nare going to hear from him on this vital question. I do want to point \nout in the national journal Congressional Daily this morning it says, \n``A group of moderate to conservative House Democrats Thursday sent a \nletter to President Clinton urging him to accept some form of \ncompromise on medical savings accounts in health insurance reform \nlegislation.'' The letter was authored by Representative Gary Condit, \nDemocrat of California, and it asks the President to sign off on the \nevolving Republican compromise already accepted by Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources chairwoman, Senator Kassebaum of Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent the time under our \ncontrol be expanded by up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I now yield to the Senator from Iowa for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I congratulate each of my colleagues \nunder the leadership of the Senator from Georgia for discussing this \nvery important issue of making sure that we get health insurance reform \nlegislation through, that this reform legislation operates in a way so \nit minimizes Federal Government bureaucracy interference in the \nmarketplace and in the doctor-patient relationship, and that we \neventually reduce the cost of health care.\n  I think every one of these are motives for this legislation, in \naddition to creating a situation where people who can afford health \ninsurance and are denied health insurance because of preexisting \nconditions will be able to have that guarantee of health insurance and \nits renewability, and also for the individuals who find it difficult in \nbargaining with the insurance companies for an affordable package, and \nalso for small businesses that have a difficult time doing that, that \nwe allow these people to come together in health insurance purchasing \ncooperatives to be able to do this. So I thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor promoting this discussion at this particular time.\n  Regardless of all the good aspects of this bill, there is one aspect \nholding it up, and it is an aspect of the bill that I very much \nsupport, and that is the drive for the medical savings accounts. When I \nsay it is a drive for medical savings accounts, it is not a drive \nwithin Congress for medical savings accounts. Medical savings accounts \nare an established fact of the delivery of health care in America \nbecause they have been proven out there in the private sector, but they \ndo not have the advantages that other types of health insurance or \nvehicles for paying for health care have like their tax deductibility.\n  So if we are going to promote medical savings accounts which are \nproven worthy and effective in the private sector already, then they \nought to have the same tax treatment that a lot of other instruments we \nhave used for a half century have had in order to give people effective \nhealth coverage. And so this debate is about medical savings accounts. \nAll the other good things in this bill are kind of forgotten. All the \nattention is on medical savings accounts, I think for one simple \nreason, and that one simple reason is that there are people in \nWashington who still believe that Washington knows best, and they do \nnot want a system of medical savings accounts where the individual is \ngoing to make the decision of spending money on health care. They only \nthink it can be a big insurance company or some Washington bureaucrat \nthat can make this judgment for the individual. The success of medical \nsavings accounts proves that tradition wrong, the tradition that \nWashington knows best. And so we need this legislation. It should not \nbe held up.\n  Mr. President, the American people are waiting for final action on \nthe Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform legislation. They have \nbeen waiting 2 full months.\n  The American people want this legislation enacted because they \nunderstand that it promises portability of health insurance. They want \nit enacted because they understand that it would limit the practice of \ndenying health insurance coverage to people because of preexisting \nconditions.\n  This legislation passed the House on March 28. It passed the Senate \non April 23. We should have sent it to the President weeks ago, Mr. \nPresident. Why have we not?\n  We have not because some obstinate Senators of the other party refuse \nto allow the conference between the House and the Senate to proceed. \nThey refuse to allow it to proceed because they oppose the medical \nsavings accounts provisions. They refuse to allow it to proceed despite \nconcessions on the MSA provisions by the Republican leadership. They \nrefuse to allow it to proceed because the President will not tell them \nhe wants to sign it with an MSA provision in it.\n  I say some Senators of the other party because many Members of the \nother party have supported medical savings accounts. Many still do. \nThirty-eight Democrats in the House of Representatives voted for the \nHouse health insurance reform bill which included medical savings \naccounts. I understand the Democratic Representatives Bob Torricelli \nand Andy Jacobs wrote to the President 6 weeks ago to urge him to \nsupport MSA's. In the past, leading members of the other party have \nspoken favorably of MSA's. Two short years ago, in 1994, Representative \nGephardt is quoted as saying on CNBC: ``I think its a great option.'' \nThen, just today according to Congress Daily, a group of moderate-to-\nconservative Democrats in the House of Representatives sent a letter to \nPresident Clinton asking him to sign off on the evolving GOP compromise \non MSA's.\n  I am having a hard time understanding why some Senators are putting \nup such die-hard opposition to medical savings accounts, Mr. President. \nAnd I am having a hard time understanding why the President of the \nUnited States will not tell his troops in the Senate that he will sign \na bill with an MSA provision in it.\n  Because they are a good idea. They are basically IRA's. Everybody \nunderstands IRA's. Medical savings accounts are IRA's that can only be \nused to pay for medical care. Individuals who have a medical savings \naccount would also have to purchase conventional health insurance with \na high deductible. This high deductible health insurance policy would \nprotect them against truly catastrophic health care costs.\n  They are a good idea for several reasons:\n  They should make health care coverage more dependable for those who \nhave them because they are completely portable.\n  Medical savings accounts are easy to administer compared to \nconventional insurance or to managed care plans. Therefore, \nadministrative savings will be realized when people use them.\n  They put the patient back into the health care equation. People with\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\nMSA's would have complete freedom to choose their doctor. Because \npatients would be spending their own money, doctors would be under \npressure to provide economical treatment and to discuss with their \npatients the costs and the benefits of particular treatments to a \ngreater degree than they do now.\n  They would level the health insurance playing field by making the tax \ntreatment of health insurance fairer. Now, employers who pay for health \ninsurance for their employees get a tax break for what they spend. The \nemployees get a tax break for what is essentially compensation. But in \nthose businesses which can not afford health insurance, neither the \nemployer nor the employee gets tax help from the Federal Government. \nThe self-employed, who pay for their own health insurance, get no help \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  Medical savings accounts should increase personal savings. The tax \nbenefit associated with Medical savings accounts should be a strong \nincentive to save.\n  They will ultimately contribute to retirement savings for many \npeople. In the future, many people would become eligible for Medicare \nwith substantial medical savings account balances. These could be \nwithdrawn for any purpose at age 65.\n  Finally, they will help cover long-term care expenses because one of \nthe permitted uses will be for the purchase of long-term care \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, the Republican congressional leadership has offered \nthe President and the Democrats a compromise. The compromise would \nlimit the opportunity to have an MSA to where the core uninsurance \nproblem is--in the small business community and among the self-\nemployed.\n  Still, some Senate Democrats refuse to let us send the Kassebaum bill \nto the President.\n  They say that the MSA provisions are in the bill only as a pay-off to \na single insurance company. This is really one of the most preposterous \nallegations made in this debate.\n  A single insurance company? Then why are the MSA provisions supported \nby the farm community, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, \nCommunicating for Agriculture, the National Wheat Growers, the National \nGrange, the National Milk Producers Federation, and the National \nCattleman's Beef Association?\n  Why are they supported by the small business community, including the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, the Business Coalition \nfor Affordable Health Care which includes the National Association of \nthe Self-Employed, the U.S. Federation of Small Business, the U.S. \nBusiness and Industrial Council, the National Food Brokers Association, \nand many other business groups.\n  Why are the MSA provisions supported by many physician organizations, \nled by the American Medical Association? Why are they supported by not \njust one, but several insurance companies?\n  A single insurance company? I do not think so, Mr. President. It is \nclear to anyone who wants to open their eyes. The medical savings \naccount concept, and the specific provisions in the Kassebaum bill, are \nsupported by a broad coalition of Americans.\n  Those holding up the bill say that MSA's will be used only by the \nyoung and the healthy. They say that the sick will prefer regular \ninsurance or HMO's. Maybe they really believe it. But now we have \nevidence to the contrary from a recent study by the Rand Corp. The Rand \nstudy concluded that MSA's could be attractive to both the sick and the \nhealthy.\n  In fact, the Rand study concluded that MSA's might not reduce health \ncare costs as substantially as MSA proponents have claimed. Why not? \nBecause they probably would be attractive to the sick. Furthermore, \nthose who are sick will probably prefer to have the unrestricted \nfreedom of choice of doctor that would come with an MSA.\n  If the sick and the poor would use MSA's, it hardly seems likely that \nMSA's would fragment the insurance pools because of adverse selection, \nanother concern of those opposed to MSA's.\n  Those holding up the Kassebaum legislation argue that MSA's would \nappeal only to the wealthy. But Rand concluded that the ``median user \nwould be only slightly wealthier than people in conventional insurance \nplans and HMOs. * * * '' Furthermore, a recent survey by the Marketing \nResearch Institute of 1,000 workers found that a large majority of \nlower income workers, if given the choice, would choose MSA's.\n  What is really going on here, Mr. President, is that the Senators \ntrying to stop medical savings accounts really do not want individual \ncitizens to take charge of their own health care. They do not want the \nsystem to be controlled and driven by individual consumers in \ncooperation with their doctors. They are frightened to death that \nmedical savings accounts will prove so popular with the citizenry that \nthere will be an irresistible demand to make them available to \neverybody. If that happens, their dream of a nationalized health care \nsystem will be impossible to realize.\n  In any case, Mr. President, it seems to me that we can add medical \nsavings accounts to the things a great many Americans want in the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill. Many other Americans \nare probably more concerned about the Kassebaum bill's portability \nprovisions. Or about the bill's limits on the ability of insurers to \ndeny coverage to people because of preexisting conditions. These \ncitizens are going to have a very hard time understanding why some \nSenators, and the President, are denying these reforms because of \nopposition to the medical savings account compromise the Republican \nleadership is offering them.\n  The American people are going to get none of these reforms unless the \nSenators obstructing the legislation stop playing dog in the manger, \nand get out of the way so the American people can have the benefits of \nthe legislation. The President needs to tell his troops in the Senate \nthat he wants to see this bill enacted. He should tell his troops to \nlet the conferees be appointed and to accept the MSA compromise he's \nbeen offered.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado should be advised \nthe next 90 minutes is controlled by the Democrat leader or his \ndesignee.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask also since the time has gone over 12 \nminutes or 13 minutes, let me extend it past the 12:30 hour so there is \nequal time for both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6634-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6643-S6654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have seen take place here in the \nlast hour or 45 minutes is what has been going on in the Senate for the \nlast 8 or 10 months. We cannot do things quite perfect enough. There is \nalways some kind of a problem.\n  With the balanced budget, we agreed to a balanced budget but there \nwas always a poison pill that was involved. The poison pill with the \nbalanced budget was Medicaid, Medicare, whacking the environment. It \nwas not good enough that the President and Democrats agreed there would \nbe a balanced budget in 7 years using the figures from the CBO. That \nwas not good enough. What they had to do was the majority had to ruin \nit. They ruined it with their poison pills, with excessive cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  Welfare reform--remember, we had a welfare reform bill. It passed \nhere in a bipartisan basis. But the majority in the House and Senate \ndecided they wanted to block grant Medicaid. They wanted to cut off a \nmillion disabled children from welfare. That made it so we could not \npass welfare reform.\n  Minimum wage, something that is long overdue, about 90 percent of the \nAmerican public think it is the fair thing to do, to increase the \nminimum wage, but, no, they have to tie on to that something called the \nTEAM Act, some kind of small business exemption which is a disguise, \nthat is all it is, to, in effect, gut the minimum wage. Everyone knows \nthe jobs in America are not created by General Motors, Lockheed and the \nbig corporations, but by small businesses. So what is the poison pill \nthat the majority attaches to minimum wage? We will make a small \nbusiness exemption with the minimum\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nwage; we will do indirectly what we cannot do directly.\n  So everything that comes out that is good for the American public, \nthe majority throws in a poison pill. They have done it with their \nsmall business exemption with the minimum wage. They have done it with \nthe TEAM Act.\n  We should be on the floor here, talking about the things that we do \non a bipartisan basis. The American public is not concerned about big \ngovernment or small government, they are concerned about good \ngovernment. And good government means we must act together.\n  We could do that with health care reform. Everyone knows that on the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill the senior Senator from Massachusetts represents \none constituency, the senior Senator from the State of Kansas \nrepresents another constituency, and they got together. People who are \nsenior Members of this body got together and came up with a bill that \nwas not everything that everyone needed, that did not take care of all \nthe problems with health care delivery in this country, but certainly \nit went a long way to answer two of the major problems that face the \nAmerican public and that is, what do we do about portability of health \ninsurance and what do we do about preexisting conditions?\n\n  The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill took care of that. It basically said we \ncan help get portable insurance. If you have a job and you have \ninsurance and you quit your job, leave your job, you can take your \ninsurance with you. If you have a preexisting condition you can have an \ninsurance company insure you. They cannot refuse you. Everyone in \nAmerica has had conditions with family, loved ones or neighbors, who \nhave problems with preexisting conditions. It may be a bad back, it may \nbe diabetes--these conditions are such the insurance companies simply \nturn people down. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill said no, you cannot do \nthat anymore.\n  Here we go again, just like as has happened for the past 18 months. \nWe have something which can solve a problem on a bipartisan basis and \nanother poison pill comes along. This time it is MSA's. Mr. President, \nMSA's is something we should take a look at. Everyone has acknowledged, \non the minority side, we are willing to take a look at MSA's. Let us do \na pilot project. Let us see how they would work. Everything that has \nbeen said about MSA's by the majority may be right. I mean, I think we \nshould take a look at it. They may be right. But whether they are right \nor wrong, why do we not go ahead and do what Kennedy-Kassebaum \noriginally said we should do, take care of portability and take care of \npreexisting conditions? That would go a long way to solving the \nproblems of health care delivery in America today.\n  No, we cannot do that because now we are not talking about a balanced \nbudget and ruining that with Medicare and Medicaid devastating cuts; we \nare not talking about minimum wage and the poison pill thrown in there \nwith the small business exemption; we are not talking about welfare \nreform, the poison pill there block-granting Medicaid and eliminating \nabout a million handicapped children. No, what we are doing now is we \nhave another poison pill with health care reform that is the medical \nsavings accounts. We are not willing to test, do a pilot project on \nmedical savings accounts. We want it all. If we cannot get it all we \nare going to ruin portability and preexisting conditions.\n  I, personally, believe that medical savings accounts should be \ntested. I think there is some merit to them. We should have a \ndemonstration to project to see what the benefits and drawbacks are of \nMSA's. But the insurance reform bill which the Senate overwhelmingly \npassed did not contain MSA's and the addition of MSA's is now \npreventing a bipartisan step toward real health care reform. We failed \nto pass real health care reform 2 years ago. But we did learn something \nat that time. We must approach health care reform step by step. We \ncannot get everything we want. But it seems the majority is saying we \nwant everything that we think is appropriate. If we do not get it, we \nare going to kill health care reform.\n  The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill primarily targets two hurdles to insurance \ncoverage for the American public: Hurdle No. 1, preexisting conditions; \nNo. 2 is portability. By addressing these two major barriers to \ninsurance coverage we can help 25 million Americans.\n  We can stand on this floor and debate for weeks, months how good or \nbad MSA's are. But let us do that and at the same time take care of 25 \nmillion Americans and take care of preexisting conditions and \nportability.\n  The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill is a straightforward measure combining \nitems from the 1994 health care debate that are both noncontroversial \nand bipartisan. We should not be holding up this bill with a debate \nover MSA's.\n  I think, when it is all said and done, after we do the demonstration \nprojects, I think I would probably support MSA's.\n  But we really do not know just now. Why do we not go ahead and pass \nwhat is good, and that is Kennedy-Kassebaum. The majority attempts to \nadd MSA's to the benefit, some say, of special interests. I think that \nthis special-interest legislation may just be threatening the coverage \nof preexisting conditions and portability, because this is the poison \npill they found to kill that program.\n  If the majority is serious about helping millions of Americans \nmaintain their health coverage, they should abandon their attempts to \nattach this overall, all-encompassing MSA provision to S. 1028.\n  The debate today is not about MSA's. That can wait for another day. \nThe debate is about whether Congress is going to help individuals who \nchange or lose their job to help maintain health coverage.\n  We can pass this bill today, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week \nif the majority will agree to stop loading this bipartisan bill with \namendments that can be debated at another time.\n  Mr. President, there is a real question about what we are doing here. \nWhat are the dangers of MSA's? Some of the concerns I have, that I hope \nwith the demonstration project can be overridden, is that they siphon \noff the healthy and the wealthy and the young. They fragment and \nundermine the current insurance market, and they cause premiums to rise \nfor others. They discourage cost-saving preventive care. They lack \nconsumer protections. They increase employer health care spending, and \nthey cost taxpayers, some say, almost $2 billion. In fact, who says \nthat is the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  What the majority will not talk about today on this floor, or any \nother time, about MSA's and the reason, perhaps, they are unwilling to \ngo forth with a demonstration project, is that the MSA provision added \nin the House bill contains no standards for high-deductible \ncatastrophic plans that accompany these MSA's, forcing many individuals \nto pay more in out-of-pocket costs than they might expect.\n  Here are some costly facts about this catastrophic insurance plan \nthat the majority will not be talking about during this debate. For \nexample: Once the deductible is reached, not all costs are covered.\n  Even after an individual or family meet their high-deductible, most \ncatastrophic plans require a copayment for health care services. The \nmajority wants individuals to think all their health care will be \ncovered. That is not the fact. They think they should be covered free \nof charge once the high deductible is finally reached. It just will not \nhappen.\n  Also, only medically necessary services are covered. So many of these \nplans only pay for those medical expenses that are medically necessary. \nAs determined by whom? Of course, by that all-knowing insurance \ncompany.\n  Furthermore, insurers may count only medically necessary services \ndefined as indicated by the insurer toward the deductible. If it is not \ncovered by the insurer, the individual will get no credit for the \npayments they have made toward the deductible.\n  We heard a lot 2 years ago when we debated health care reform, and \none of the things that the health insurance industry--and their \nspending over $100 million in advertising trying to confuse and \nfrighten the American public, which they did--one of the things they \ntalked about a lot was people would lose their choice of physicians. \nWell, those in the majority should understand that here is a question \nwith MSA's about whether you lose your choice of physician.\n  Individuals are free to choose their own doctors while paying for \nmedical\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\ncare in full. However, under their insurance plan, they may have to pay \nmore to stay with their own family physician. Many catastrophic plans \nrequire individuals to use specific doctors, and if they are not \nwilling to use specific doctors, they pay more, thereby adding \nunexpected costs after meeting that high deductible.\n  Another problem we need to look at--and the reason we think there \nshould be a demonstration project and we should go forward with \nportability and preexisting conditions and leave this debate for a \nlater day, and that later day would be based upon having a \ndemonstration project or projects where we would have all the \ninformation that can answer these questions that are being raised today \nby this Senator--exclusions to services coverage.\n  Many of these plans currently on the market today contain a long list \nof services not covered by the plan. Some plans exclude pregnancy and \nroutine newborn care among their exclusions. Individuals would be \nresponsible for the cost of these services, even if the deductible has \nbeen reached. Should we not look at this in a demonstration project?\n  I say to my friends in the majority, if you can answer all these \nquestions, then we should all be here joining arms and going with \nMSA's. Why do we not pass what we think is good? That is, the \nportability, preexisting conditions.\n  Another problem: Employers are not required to contribute to the \nsavings account. There is nothing in the House bill to require \nemployers to contribute an amount to cover the deductible or make a \ncontribution at all, forcing the individual to cover much, if not all, \nof their medical expenditures.\n  Finally, with a demonstration project, we could determine if \nemployers could contribute to the premium cost or merely provide \ninformation about plans available. Individuals alone may have to cover \nthe cost of the insurance again.\n  So, I say the time is here to help millions, 25 million people. Let \nus set up some demonstration projects around the country and see if the \nMSA's work, and then pass quickly, on a bipartisan basis, the Kennedy-\nKassebaum bill. That is what we should do. It would provide protection \nfor 25 million Americans who need that protection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use. I ask \nthe Chair to notify me when 20 minutes is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator when 20 \nminutes is up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise on the floor of the Senate to \naddress the issues of medical savings accounts. I want to address some \nof the observations that have been made by some of our colleagues this \nmorning, and over the last few days; and that have also been raised in \na number of their statements and speeches and press releases in the \nnewspapers.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question prior to my leaving \nthe floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, who has had a lot of experience in this \nbody, if the medical savings account provision were dropped, how long \ndo you think it would take to pass this bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think, as suggested by the Senator's question, I think \nwe could pass that in just a few moments here in the Senate. I expect \nthat would be true in the House of Representatives as well. It would \npass well within a day and be on the President's desk by tomorrow and \nput into effect to protect the 25 million Americans who have some \ndisability and give protections to millions of Americans who are moving \nfrom job to job to guarantee that portability.\n  The Senator is accurate in his questions. Why aren't we doing today \nwhat was passed out of our committee with a unanimous vote of \nRepublicans and Democrats several months ago; and passed the Senate of \nthe United States by 100 to 0, and could pass the Senate of the United \nStates by 100 to 0 again this afternoon? We could send it to the \nPresident to be signed into law and provide relief to the 25 million \nAmerican families that have some preexisting condition and know that \nthey will be excluded from any kind of health insurance; or know that \nif they stay with a small group, that the costs for their insurance \nwill go through the roof; or that they will be excluded or canceled. \nThey could be canceled after having paid into their insurance program \nfor a lifetime under the existing rules.\n  We heard a lot of talk about freedom here this morning and over the \nlast few days. Well, there will be freedom for the insurance company to \ndrop that family. There will not be freedom for the family to look \nafter a child that has cancer. There will not be freedom for a husband \nto look after a wife who has breast cancer. But there will be freedom \nfor the insurance company to drop them.\n  So I hope we will have an opportunity to talk a little bit about what \nfreedom really means. It is bandied around here loosely and generally \nby people who have been in the vanguard of undermining Medicare and \nMedicaid and protection for children. But I will get to that in a few \nmoments.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator one more question. Does the Senator see a \npattern, as I see a pattern, that during the past 18 months the \nmajority, every time we are on the verge of passing something \nmeaningful, that a poison pill is thrown into the mix?\n  We passed Kennedy-Kassebaum 100 to 0, and suddenly we have MSA's. A \nbalanced budget, we agree on all the terms. The President agrees to the \nyear 2002, to use Congressional Budget Office figures. Welfare reform \npassed here, I do not know, almost 100 to 0, big numbers, 80, a vast, \nvast majority passing it, and suddenly we have block granting of \nMedicaid and cutting off handicapped children. The minimum wage, which \n90 percent of the American public wants. We have the small business \nexemption. Is it just me or does the Senator see a pattern here that we \nare not being able to pass meaningful legislation in this body because \nof these poison pills?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will add to the Senator's list. We have a very \nimportant program to which Senator Kassebaum provided great initiative. \nIt had been worked out over the period of the last 2 to 3 years in \nhuman resources, to restructure and reorganize all the youth training \nand job training programs, to eliminate--there are 148 different \nprograms, $20-odd billion in those programs, 11 different agencies, and \nwe had tried to work to consolidate those programs. It overwhelmingly \npassed in the Senate by more than 90 votes. I think it was 92 to 4 or \nsomething of that nature. Now we find out that we are stalemated in the \nconference.\n  We passed our immigration bill. That was passed in a bipartisan way \nby more than 90 votes. It is so interesting listening to my Republican \ncolleagues talk about the inappropriateness by some of us to resist a \nstacked deck of conferees, when I happen to be a conferee on the \nimmigration bill, and have never even been invited to a single \nconference, while the Republicans are meeting day after day.\n  Or whether it has been on the issue of health care, there are a whole \nseries of different items that we have passed overwhelmingly. And now \nthey are getting caught up, whether it is immigration or the job \ntraining or the health care program. They have all passed \noverwhelmingly. Now for some reason, as the Senator points out, there \nis a desire to refuse to permit the process to work.\n  There was enough credit in here for our Republican friends. They \ncould get a share of the credit. It is true that this President has \nsupported this program. The American people have elected this \nPresident. They might not like that. But the President ought to be \nentitled to sign those pieces of legislation and not have that \nsuccessful effort of bipartisanship, which had been part of this effort \nhere, to be effectively denied. So I thank the Senator for raising this \npoint because it is an extremely important one.\n  Mr. President, let me just start off by observing that what this \nissue is really all about, is to see where we are in the course of this \ndebate and discussion on the underlying legislation, the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill. As I pointed out on other occasions, this legislation was \ndeveloped with the leadership of Senator Kassebaum in the wake of the \n1994 debate on comprehensive health care. I\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nhope comprehensive health care is still an objective of the American \npeople. I know that there are those in this body who believe that we \nshould not, as a matter of national policy, try to get quality health \ncare for the American people that they can afford. I know that this is \nan offensive idea to many of them.\n\n  I still believe that we ought to find ways to accomplish this in a \nmanner that maximizes the involvement of the individual and the private \nsector. In the areas where there are gaps there would be a public role, \nparticularly for the neediest individuals in our country. I am \nreferring to working families and their children who are on the lower \nrungs of the economic ladder. Families that work hard 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year, knowing that their child is without health insurance. \nThey worry that their child will be injured playing in a sport or will \nfall from a bicycle, or have a skating accident, and they will not have \nthe resources to be able to pay for medical care. We need to provide \nrelief from that kind of anxiety.\n  I know that I will still feel strongly about that as long as I am in \nthe U.S. Senate. We have not been able to do that yet. But, Mr. \nPresident, as I have pointed out on other occasions, under the \nleadership of Senator Kassebaum, what we have effectively done is taken \nthe common elements in all the various proposals of Republicans and \nDemocrats. I remind my Republican friends, go back and read Bob Dole's \nprograms. Read John Chafee's programs or read the other Republican \nprograms.\n  They will find that portability and also preexisting conditions \nprovisions were common to all of those. How many times do we have to \nrepeat those statements by the Republican Presidential nominee that \nsaid: Let us just try and find the common ingredients and pass them. He \nsaid it before. He said it on the floor. He has said it repeatedly. \nThat is all we are trying to do here: find the common ground, and pass \nlegislation. That is what we did in our Labor Committee. That is what \nwe did on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  That is what we should be doing here this afternoon. The President \nought to be signing these provisions into law. And every day we delay, \nMr. President, every hour we delay, we are saying to those families, 25 \nmillion American families, ``No. We're more interested in the politics, \nthe politics of this issue.'' If you want to have an MSA program that \ngoes beyond a demonstration that is a true test, bring it up tomorrow. \nBring it up next week. Let us debate that issue at another time. But \nwhy tag it on here? Why tag it on here?\n  Why are you not going to give that relief for 25 million Americans? \n``We're going to deny you, workers, hard-working Americans. We're going \nto deny you because we want it our way. We want a stacked conference \ncommittee. And we're telling you now, we're either going to take it our \nway or no way.'' That is what this debate and discussion is about.\n  Who are those wonderful Members? Whose interests are being advanced \nby the medical savings accounts? Well, let us see who is on their side \nand who is saying, ``No. We shouldn't go ahead. Consider the MSA's at \nanother time.''\n  Who are the ones that are saying, ``Go ahead. Please, Congress, go \nahead and pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill''? Who are they? They are the \norganizations that represent the disabled individuals in this country. \nWe made progress with the Americans With Disabilities Act. We have made \nprogress on disability policy with regard to education. We have made \nprogress in mental health research at NIH.\n  Who are those that are saying, ``Put this off to another day?'' Is it \nall of the representatives of the disability groups. I challenge the \nother side. I challenge the other side, next time they organize and put \nout their briefing sheets so that they will all have the same talking \npoints in the morning, answer the question. Tell us which leaders in \nthe disability groups are supporting your program. Give us one \norganization. We are not asking for 10 or 5. Give us one organization--\none organization--that supports your position. Just give us one \norganization.\n  Who do you want to stand with? The Golden Rule Insurance Co.? They \nleft the State of Vermont when it outlawed their abusive practices that \nwere so egregious that they nearly constituted fraud.\n  We will have Members come out here, ``We will document the fraud and \nspend time going over that.''\n  I suggest to my colleagues they go over and read how they left the \nState of Vermont. They are the principal supporters, they are the \nprincipal gainers in medical savings accounts. We know that. They have \nalready contributed hundreds and thousands of dollars, over a $1.5 \nmillion to our Republican friends, to our Republican friends that are \nthe principal spokesmen for the medical savings accounts.\n  All right, so they have the Golden Rule that supports it. Who else? \nFind us a serious senior citizen group. Find us one. The elderly \nunderstand what this is all about. They understand what is going on \nhere. They understand that the principal critics of the position that \nwe are supporting here today are the same ones that want to cut back on \nthe Medicare Program.\n  I watched very briefly the debate here this morning. They are the \nprincipals that voted aye in cutting back the Medicare Program, to \nraise the premiums, double the deductibles. Where were all of these \nvoices when we were talking about protecting Americans for freedom? \nThey were stripping away the standards to protect the elderly in the \nnursing homes. Where were all those voices then? ``We want to protect \nfreedom, but we will not protect freedom for the senior citizens that \ngo to nursing homes. We will take those guarantees and those \nprotections away from them. We will take those away from them, and we \nare going to also take away the various additional protections for \nchildren under the Medicaid Program--5 million.''\n  Find me one Senator that has spoken out in opposition to medical \nsavings accounts; not one of them this morning voted against knocking 5 \nmillion children out of our Medicaid system, 85 percent of whose \nparents work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year. Do not tell us who \nis on whose side in terms of protecting Americans' health care. Each \nand every one of them that spoke out here this morning were prepared to \ncut out children in the Medicaid Program.\n  They have cut back about 20 percent of the mental health assistance \nprogram. They permitted double buying of our elderly people under the \nMedicare Program when it came back from the conference report.\n  It goes on and on. And all for what? To take those savings and give \nthem for tax breaks--tax breaks. Who are you kidding about your concern \nabout freedom and competition in the health care system when you are \nbusy undoing the present program, when your Republican leader in the \nHouse of Representatives, Mr. Gingrich, said you want to have Medicare \nwither on the vine, and the Republican nominee has indicated he is \nproud of the fact he voted against Medicare in the beginning, and he \nhas restated it again.\n  We are supposed to believe those individuals who do not believe in \nMedicare, who have been assaulting Medicare, who have been assaulting \nMedicaid and protections for children and senior citizens, that, all of \na sudden, here they are, they are so concerned, because certain \nSenators will not permit us to try out a new program, a new program \nthat is allegedly going to provide freedom.\n  This Senator is not going to let them have the freedom to go to the \nFederal Treasury, because that is what you are asking about. They can \nhave all the freedom today to sell their medical savings account.\n  Understand this: My colleagues who have been complaining about our \npositions on medical savings accounts, they can go out and sell them \ntoday, and some of them do. But, no, no, that is not what they want. \nThey want the freedom to go into the Federal Treasury, put their hand \nin the pocket of every working family and the pocketbook of every \nworking family. What do we mean by all that?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will finish this one thought.\n  It is very interesting that the Joint Tax Committee estimates that \nthe costs to the Federal Treasury would be $3 billion in additional \ndeficits over a 10-year period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from \nMassachusetts he has used 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes additional.\n  The Federal Treasury says the additional deficits for 10 years is $3 \nbillion; $3 billion for a test with one million people.\n  What is the suggested program that is being supported by Mr. \nGingrich? Mr. President, 43 million American working families. That is \na test? Three billion for one million people--he is talking about a \nrange of 43 million Americans. It is the freedom of Golden Rule to put \nits hand in the Federal Treasury and take out billions of dollars. That \nis the freedom that those individuals are talking about in terms of \nmedical savings account.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator has been talking about freedom. \nI have a quote that the Senator did make, and I ask if the Senator \nrecalls this statement having been made from the majority leader of the \nU.S. House of Representatives, Dick Armey, who says, ``Medicare has no \nplace in a free world.''\n  Do you recall that statement having been made by the majority leader \nof the House of Representatives saying, ``Medicare has no place in a \nfree world''?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It has a familiar ring to it, Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Just so there is no misunderstanding, I want to state what \nwas said by the Republican nominee for the U.S. Presidency in October \nof last year: ``I was there fighting the fight''--a direct quote--``one \nof 12 voting against Medicare, because we knew it wouldn't work in \n1965.''\n  Is that the reference that the Senator made?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is exactly the reference. We have leaders that are \nnow out there every day with their mimeograph machines saying those \nreally blocking this program are the same ones that were opposing the \nMedicare Program before, oppose it now, cutting back and putting at \nrisk our senior citizens, and also other health programs of this past \nbudget.\n  Mr. REID. Briefly, does the Senator from Massachusetts recognize this \ndirect quote by the Speaker of the House in October of last year:\n\n       Now, we didn't get rid of it in round one because we didn't \n     think it was politically smart, but we believe Medicare is \n     going to wither on the vine.\n\n  Is that the reference the Senator was making?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct. They are the ones that \nwant to put these medical savings accounts in, same ones that want to \ndo that.\n  Mr. REID. I will close by giving the direct quote of the majority \nleader of the U.S. House of Representatives:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a \n     rotten trick. I think we are going to have to bite the bullet \n     on Social Security and phase it out over time.\n\n  Now, we have heard from the Republican nominee, we have heard from \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives, we have heard from the \nmajority leader of the House of Representatives. I think it indicates \nwhere they stand on Medicare and Medicaid, and I think the reference \nmade to how they feel about health care reform is pretty clear, is it \nnot?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It certainly is, Senator. I appreciate you bringing \ntogether these points. But the point about it is, we are trying to \ndetermine who is on whose side here. Who is on the side of working \nfamilies, and who is on the side of the special interests? Special \ninterests, Golden Rule. Special interests, Golden Rule.\n\n  What I was mentioning just a moment or two ago is that we have \nchallenged the other side to find out any reputable group that \nrepresents the disabled, who are at such risk from the cutbacks \nproposed by our Republican friends, find the senior citizens, and come \nback here this afternoon after our time is up, and give us those \nexamples of those senior organizations. Give us those quotes of our \nseniors that say that this is a good idea.\n  You cannot get them. They are not there. They are not there. They are \nnot there from the disabled groups. They are not there from the seniors \ngroups. They are not there from the representatives of workers--the 128 \nmillion American families that are working in this country and their \nprincipal representatives--you cannot get it. Then do not bring that \nphony mine workers study that you have. You keep trotting that mine \nworkers study out, and it is absolutely wrong. They have denied it and \nsaid it is completely inaccurate and wrong.\n  So, Mr. President, on the one side we have the disabled, the elderly, \nthe representatives of the working, and the principal spokesman for \nchildren. Why children? Because what you are going to find out is that, \nunder these programs, they will not pay for preventive care programs \nfor children. It is going to discourage preventive care, which is a \nscandal for children in our country--an absolute scandal. With our \ninfant mortality being the 18th or 20th--or 22d, I guess, this year, in \nterms of the world. The fact is that we produce 80 percent of the \nvaccines in the world, and we still have a quarter of the children not \nvaccinated. We are still not providing the comprehensive screening for \nchildren.\n  Those numbers are being reduced every year in the last 4 years. The \nnumber of uninsured children in my State of Massachusetts--160,000--has \ndoubled. It has doubled in the last 4 years. Have we heard any of those \npeople that are out there now saying they want medical savings \naccounts? Where were they when we were talking and battling about \nchildren and the priorities earlier this year? Where were they speaking \nabout it? Oh, no, we want freedom, medical savings accounts. We want \nfreedom.\n  Now, Mr. President, is this just the position of those that allegedly \nspeak for the disabled or for the consumers in this country? Find a \nconsumer organization that wants to go down to the rope with the \nmedical savings accounts, full-blown medical savings accounts, which \nare untested, untried.\n  They used to have the old adage in medicine to ``do no harm.'' Well, \nthis is a turkey, Mr. President, that has not been tried, has not been \ntested, and could cause premiums to go up. It is a threat to insurance \nthat exists for millions of Americans at this time. That is believed to \nbe so.\n  We are asked to buy this pig in a poke. We are saying, let us debate \nit and discuss it at another time. Let us agree on what is a reasonable \ntest and pilot. Many of those who support the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill do \nnot even think we ought to do that. But there are Members on our side \nand on that side, as well, that think we ought to have a trial and a \ntest. I would not oppose that trial and test if it meant the passage of \nthis bill. But, I will tell you, I am not going to buy on and sign on \nfor an untested, untried program that can threaten--not only will \nwealthy individuals just be able to purchase it, and healthy \nindividuals will benefit by it, but I am not going to represent to \npeople in my State who have some health insurance today and risk their \npremiums escalating and going out of sight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his additional 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 more minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I will just mention here, this is sort of an isolated \nposition. I ask those who come and are addressing the status of this \nwhere we are with this issue.\n\n  Today, we found that the House leader, Mr. Armey, urged the White \nHouse to ``call off Senator Kennedy on the health care bill.'' And \nthen, ``Why is Senator Kennedy stopping health care reform?''\n  Then we had the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, an ad \nhoc committee established 3 years ago to lobby against the President's \ncomprehensive health care. They say, ``Senator Kennedy is killing the \nhealth care bill today to socialize American medicine tomorrow.'' I did \nnot believe, when we had a 100 to 0 vote, that those supporting the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill were going on to socialized medicine.\n  You better get it straight, Business Coalition. We had a 100 to 0 \nvote on the position that I take today, saying the bill that passed in \nthe Senate should be passed now, today. And you are saying, ``Senator \nKennedy is killing the bill in order to socialize medicine''?\n  All I want to do is pass what we passed. Then we have the Coalition \nfor Patient Choice. It is interesting that they all came out the same \nday. Included in that was, ``Yes, Kennedy would kill health reform. He \nstill wants big government.''\n  All I want is what Senator Kassebaum stated that she wants, too, on\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nhealth care. Also, we have the Eagle Forum. That is a well-known \norganization on health care, and the Christian Coalition, and Phyllis \nSchlafly knows a lot about it. She has testified frequently on health \ncare. Then the list goes on. You can expect it from the Republican \nNational Committee. The list goes on.\n  Well, Mr. President, I would ask those groups to take a look at some \nof these editorials, take a look at the Washington Post editorial by \nRobert Samuelson and his analysis on MSA's. Look at the L.A. Times \neditorial on June 6. Take a look at the New York Times on May 30. Take \na look at the Dallas Morning News. Take a look at the Baltimore Sun of \nApril 25. Take a look at the Washington Post on June 3.\n  Take a look at the June 13, Tacoma, WA, News Tribune:\n\n       Stick to the basics in the New Health Bill.\n\n  It says:\n\n       Many medical economists warn MSAs would be used mostly by \n     healthy and more affluent people, leaving older and sicker \n     people in the common insurance pool. That would force \n     insurance rates up for everybody else . . . The original \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was a good one. More than 20 million \n     Americans would benefit from its modest reforms. Save the \n     fight over MSAs for the next Congress . . .\n\n  Come on, Mr. President. Do you think the News Tribune is for \nsocialized medicine?\n  Here is the San Francisco Chronicle article of June 10:\n\n       There may well be some merit to MSAs to the extent they \n     encourage health consumers to be more cost-conscious. But \n     that possible benefit is still outweighed by the virtual \n     certainty that MSAs would encourage healthy and wealthy \n     Americans--those who could afford the high-deductible \n     catastrophic coverage--to abandon the prevailing insurance \n     system, making it even more expensive for the poorer and less \n     healthy Americans left behind.\n\n  The Harrisburg Patriot wrote:\n\n       While the idea of medical savings accounts has a lot of \n     appeal on the surface, the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and other \n     experts in health insurance have warned that it poses dire \n     consequences for the overall health care system. MSAs would \n     remove significant amounts of money from a pool of funds that \n     go to pay the Nation's health care bill, while their tax-\n     deductibility would pose another drain on the Treasury . . . \n     They ought to be considered separately.\n\n  A June 10, Columbus Dispatch article, entitled ``Clean Health Bill; \nGet Rid of Those Two Killer Amendments,'' says that MSA's could \n``appeal only to healthy people, throwing seriously ill people into a \npool whose costs would escalate. This proposal should be in separate \nlegislation, so the clamor it kicks up would not endanger the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill.''\n  These are just a sample of the commentary from around the Nation. It \nis time for Republicans to stop playing special interest politics.\n  I welcome being their target quite frankly, Mr. President. I do not \nresent it. If they want to target me, I am glad to get in and debate \nthis, and will at any length at any time that they want to. The fact of \nmatter is we mentioned 15 or 20 recent editorials, and they are in \nthere every day. Maybe we ought to come up--I think I will--and start \nputting them in from every part of the country representing every \ndifferent group.\n  Why is it that just the Republican National Committee and the \nBusiness Coalition and Phyllis Schlafly care more about the American \nhealth care system than all of the other kinds of commentaries that are \ncoming from all parts of America and from all different groups? Why are \nall these people wrong? And they are right?\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would just hope that when our friends come \nout to talk about this issue I hope they will come out and address some \nof the questions that are raised about this program. They have a $5,000 \ndeductible and $7,500 per couple. Are we to assume that the employer is \ngoing to provide the money up to $5,000? Absolutely not. It is not in \ntheir program. If it is, they ought to come on out and tell us. Who do \nthey think is going to contribute the $5,000? Guess who? The workers \nare going to contribute, and then the workers will be able to take \nback. How many working families are going to be able to afford $5,000 \nper individual, or $7,500 in their family to put that aside? Come on. \nCome on. Freedom? Freedom? Come on.\n  Then what happens if the doctor charges $8,000 but the insurance \ncompany only recognizes $5,000 because of a fee schedule? Will the \ninsurance company help you out? How about answering that question. I am \nwaiting to hear the answer. Will that insurance cover that particular \nproblem? Are there no limits? Are there no lifetime ceilings? I am \nwaiting to hear the answer. You do not hear them talk about the \nsubstance of this proposal. You do not hear them talk about that \nbecause it is not there. All you have to do is look at what the Golden \nRule Insurance Co. has done and other companies are doing. They stop \nthere, and the person is stuck with the additional. The deductible is \nnot the same thing as a cap. How much will the individual have to pay \nafter they finally reach the $5,000?\n  Mr. President, I hope our friends who are supporting their position \nover there about the MSA's tell us about the deductible. How much does \nthe individual have to pay after they finally reach the $5,000? Does \nthat mean there is no co-pay? I have not heard them talk about that. \nThey are trying to suggest that once you get to $5,000 you are not \ngoing to have a co-pay. They find the Golden Rule Insurance Co. does \nnot guarantee. That is not guaranteed by their proposal. What is going \nto be the co-pay on that $5,000? Why do you not talk about out of \npocket limits? What are ``out of pocket limits''? Out of pocket limits \noccur in most of all of the programs that are out there--that an \nindividual pays up to so high and then does not pay anything above it. \nAre there any out of pocket limits in the MSA's? I hope that those who \nare supporting it are talking about it.\n  Is the sky the limit? No. There are no out of pocket limits as there \nare in many of the insurance companies at the present time; an \nimportant consumer issue. Maybe our friends who are so enamored of this \ngreat freedom of getting into the Federal Treasury are going to talk \nabout that issue.\n  Mr. President, is there anything in their bill that requires the \ninsurer to cover all the services that they need? One of the continual \nchoruses that we heard last year from those that are opposed to health \ninsurance was, ``Let us have the list of services that are covered.'' \nAre they prepared to give us the services that are going to be covered? \nI cannot tell you how often we heard that talked about, and we provided \nthat last year. Do you think any of us have any idea about what \nservices are going to be covered and what are going to be excluded \nbefore we put in a program that is going to raise the Federal Treasury \nand maybe applicable to a third of the working families of this \ncountry? Absolutely not. No one has talked about that.\n\n  What services are going to be covered? Are they going to be different \nfrom what the IRS recognizes as being a legitimate medical deduction if \nan individual has medical expenses? Is this going to mean that is going \nto be a contribution to the deductible, or the co-pay for the purposes \nof insurance? That is going to make a lot of difference to a lot of \nfamilies. Maybe they could elaborate a little bit on some of this.\n  Mr. President, is there anything in the bill that requires the \nemployer to contribute one thin dime to MSA's to cover the $5,000? I \nhope they will address that. Are they saying that with the $5,000 \ndeductible that the employer is going to contribute to and give \nbenefits to the working families to begin to say, ``OK, that is not \nsuch a bad deal''? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. They are not saying \nthat they will provide one nickel up to the $5,000.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the chance to go through these questions \nbecause we ought to have a good discussion and debate. Certainly before \nwe put in anything like this, we ought to have the answers to some of \nthese questions. We do not have them now. We do not have them; no \nSenate hearings, no report, no deep analysis, nothing--nothing except \nthe strong lobbying of the Golden Rule.\n  Mr. President, when you put in the MSA's you are providing, the way \nthat this is structured at the present time, a lavish tax break for the \nrich, the handout to the Golden Rule Insurance Co.; the threat to the \nexisting health insurance premiums for working Americans.\n  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, after this goes into effect, \nthe next thing they are going to do is move\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\nit over into Medicare. Our seniors understand that. The seniors \nunderstand that. The relentless assault and attack on the Medicare \nProgram. It just does not stop. They go at it any which way they can. \nThey went at it in this last Congress, and are continuing now with \nthese unjustified cuts because they wanted tax breaks for the wealthy. \nNow they are at it again.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the chance to speak on this issue and to \ninclude those editorials in the Record. We will have more to say. I \njust say in the final minute, why do we not just pass the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill? That has the overwhelming support. I think it is the one \npiece of legislation that has come out of a committee unanimously, \nRepublicans and Democrats. It came to this floor and passed \nunanimously. Senator Dole's amendment was accepted to expand \ndeductibility for small business. We welcomed it. We also provide \nextended long-term care--we support it--to provide some provisions to \ndeal with terminal illness, which is the humane approach on it. Senator \nDole has added an important ingredient to this bill. Senator Kassebaum, \nthe distinguished chairman, was the one who wrote this legislation. \nSenator Dole has amended this legislation. We are supporting this \nprogram. Why not just pass the program? Why not just pass it and let \nthe President sign it. And if we want to come back and debate the \nmedical savings account, let us do that. Let us have votes on those \nparticular provisions. Let us let the Senate make its will on it.\n\n  But, please, Mr. President, do not say no to the 25 million Americans \nwho have some form of preexisting condition and every single day that \nwe delay they are at risk. I do not know how you quantify in terms of \ndollars their anxiety worrying about illness and sickness, wondering \nwhere the next nickel or dime was going to come from so as to not bleed \nthe education funds for their children or eat up the retirement funds \nof their parents. That is happening in every city of America. And that \nis being held up by these various groups that pontificate as to who is \nmore concerned about the health care of the American people. That is \nwrong.\n  I continue to believe that medical savings accounts are the poison \npill that could kill health reform. The House and Senate Republican so-\ncalled compromise offer on medical savings accounts is a capitulation \nto House Republicans, who are more interested in creating an issue and \nserving a special interest constituency than in passing needed reform.\n  Discussions are continuing to see whether a genuine compromise can be \nreached, without jeopardizing the health insurance that protects \nmillions of Americans today. I hope these negotiations will be \nsuccessful. But the American people need to understand why the current \nRepublican proposal is unacceptable--and why medical savings accounts \nin the form proposed by the House Republicans are too extreme and have \nno place in this consensus bill.\n  Medical savings accounts are an untested idea. Their great danger is \nthat they are likely to raise premiums and make health insurance \nunaffordable for large numbers of citizens. Medical savings accounts \nwill clearly discourage preventive care and raise health care costs. \nThey are a multibillion-dollar tax giveaway to the healthy and wealthy \nat the expense of working families and the sick. Their cost could \nballoon the deficit by tens of billions of dollars.\n  With all of these obvious defects, it would be irresponsible for \nCongress to impose medical savings accounts on the Nation without \ntesting the idea first. The entire controversy today is over whether \nNewt Gingrich and the other extremists in the House Republican \nleadership are willing to accept a reasonable test of their \ncontroversial idea.\n  The current Republican offer is a sham. Their cynical negotiating \nattitude is my way or the highway. Take it or leave it. They would \nobviously rather attack me than defend their indefensible proposal, \nwhich is no compromise at all--it is merely a transparent figleaf over \ntheir cynical attempt to force their untested bad idea on the Nation.\n  Let's look at the record. Let's count the defects in the Republican \nplan on medical savings accounts.\n  First, the Republican plan allows deductibles as high as $5,000 per \nindividual and $7,500 per family. That means a family needing medical \ncare must spend $7,500 out of their own pocket before their insurance \npays a dime. I ask Mr. Gingrich--``How many families can afford to pay \nthis much for medical care, and why in the world would you give a \nspecial tax break for a policy providing such meager protection?''\n  Medical savings accounts are described as providing catastrophic \nprotection. Once you hit the cap, they say, you do not have to worry \nabout how to pay the doctor or hospital.\n  Actually, almost all conventional insurance policies already have a \nfeature like this--called a stop-loss--which caps your maximum spending \nfor covered services. Even among policies offered by small businesses, \nwhich are typically less generous than those provided by large \ncompanies, 90 percent have a stop-loss. And for virtually all of these \nplans, the stop-loss is less than $2,000.\n  Contrast that to the House Republican plan. Protection does not even \nstart until you have spent $5,000--and there is no stop-loss. None \nwhatsoever. The plan even allows the insurer to charge a 30-percent \ncopayment for charges in excess of the deductible.\n  Forty thousand dollars doctor and hospital bills are usual for a \nsignificant illness or surgery. In such cases, patients would owe \n$15,500 for bills the policy would not pay. Under a conventional \ncurrent plan, their costs would be limited to $2,000 or less.\n  Instead of attacking the Democratic messengers who bring this bad \nnews, why don't the House Republicans explain to the American people \nwhy their plan has no stop-loss requirement? How can they possibly \ndefend their view it's all right to make a family pay $7,500 before \ntheir insurance covers them at all--and then leave them exposed to \nunlimited further costs even, after they have paid the first $7,500?\n  The House Republicans claim that people can cover these huge gaps in \ntheir insurance protection by using their medical savings accounts. \nPerhaps their wealthy friends--who will get the GOP elephant s share of \nthe tax breaks under this plan--will be able to afford high medical \ncosts. But how are working families supposed to set aside the $5,000, \n$10,000, $20,000 or even more that they would need to give them true \nprotection in the event of a serious illness? There is nothing in the \nRepublican plan that requires employers to contribute even one thin \ndime to a medical savings account for their workers.\n  It is no coincidence that the leading proponents of medical savings \naccounts are the Golden Rule Insurance Co. and other insurance firms \nwith close ties to the House and Senate Republican leadership that have \nbeen the worst abusers of the current system. These firms specialize in \nselling medical savings accounts. They have given millions of dollars \nin political contributions to try to get their way.\n  Golden Rule's record, in particular, is so shameful that Consumer \nReports ranks it near the bottom of all companies because of its \ninadequate coverage, frequent rate increases, and cruelty in canceling \npolicies.\n  These defection policies are a scandal, and the companies know it. In \nfact, Golden Rule had to pull out of Vermont, because it was unwilling \nto compete on the level playing field created by that State's insurance \nreform.\n  So what happened next? Responsible insurers--Blue Cross and Blue \nShield took over the policies. They found that one in four Golden Rule \npolicies included unfair fine print. Arms, backs, breasts, and even \nskin were often excluded from coverage. Newborn babies were excluded, \nunless they were born healthy. Clearly, Congress should not be \nconferring lavish tax subsidies on that kind of disgraceful insurance \ncoverage. Yet that is exactly what Republicans want to unleash on the \nAmerican people.\n  The details of the Republican plan will shock the American people \nwhen they understand it. That is obviously why the Republican \nleadership is engaged in this unseeingly campaign to whisk their \ndefective plan into law, before its flaws can be discovered. And that \nis why I intend to do all I can to insist on a fair test of their \nproposal.\n  By any standards, medical savings accounts are a dubious experiment\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nwith the American people's insurance coverage.\n  The most troubling aspect is the skimming factor--the risk that \nmedical savings accounts will price conventional insurance out of reach \nof most American families, by encouraging the healthiest people to \nleave the insurance pool. As premiums rise for everyone else, more and \nmore working families will be forced to scale back their coverage or \ndrop their insurance altogether.\n  Ask the people who have studied these plans In the words of the \nCongressional Budget Office, medical savings accounts ``could threaten \nthe existence of standard health insurance.''\n  Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice-president of Blue Cross and Blue \nShield, concluded that MSA's will destroy ``the whole principle of \ninsurance.''\n\n  Separate studies by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Urban \nInstitute found that premiums for conventional insurance could increase \nby 60 percent--60 percent--if medical savings accounts become \nwidespread.\n  The Republican leadership pretends that their current compromise \noffer is nothing more than a test--a fair attempt to deal with concerns \nabout medical savings accounts before they are sold broadly. But it is \nnothing of the kind. Under their proposal, medical savings accounts \ncould be sold to all small businesses and the self-employed \nimmediately. MSA's would start out with a massive market consisting of \nmore than 40 million workers--one-third of the Nation's entire labor \nforce. I continue to believe that the so-called compromise is not a \ntest--it's a travesty.\n  Experts agree that the small business sector of the health insurance \nmarket is the most vulnerable to the disruption that medical savings \naccounts would cause. The Joint Tax Committee itself has concluded that \nsales of medical savings accounts would be concentrated in small and \nmedium-sized firms.\n  The proposal would clearly go beyond the bounds of what is \nacceptable, even if it stopped there. But it doesn't. After 3 years, in \nwhich medical savings accounts would be launched in this vast market, \nthey would be open to everyone else, unless both the House and Senate \nvote to stop the expansion.\n  In addition, instead of a neutral and objective evaluation of the \nfirst massive phase, the evaluators would be chosen by the chairmen of \nthe Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, \nwho are both strong proponents of MSA's. That is a stacked deck, and \nthe Republicans know it.\n  The strongest opponents of medical savings accounts are organizations \nrepresenting working families, senior citizens, consumers, and the \ndisabled. They are the ones who have the most to lose if the current \nsystem of insurance is weakened or destroyed. We know whose voices \nshould be heard when Congress decides this issue--not the voices of \ngreedy special interests, but the voices of those who depend on \nadequate insurance to get the care they need at a price they can \nafford.\n  The American people need the basic bipartisan insurance reforms \nincluded in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. These reforms will guarantee \nthat Americans will not lose their coverage or be subjected to \nexclusions for preexisting conditions when they lose their job, or \nchange jobs, or because their employer changes insurance carriers. They \ndeserve to know that their insurance cannot be canceled if they become \nsick. They should be protected against the worst abuses of the current \nsystem.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of \n100-0. If it were sent to the President today, it would be signed into \nlaw tomorrow. It should not be held hostage to the partisan, special \ninterest Republican agenda that would foist an untried and dangerous \nconcept on the American people.\n  Last week, I placed into the Record editorials from a number of \nleading newspapers around the country on the danger of medical savings \naccounts. Today, I would like to place additional editorials in the \nRecord demonstrating the broad public opposition to MSA's.\n  The Tacoma, WA, News Tribune published an editorial on June 13, \nentitled, ``Stick to the Basics in New Health Bill.'' It says,\n\n       Many medical economists warn MSA's would be used mostly by \n     healthy and more affluent people, leaving older and sicker \n     people in the common insurance pool. That would force up \n     insurance rates for everybody else. . . . The original \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was a good one. More than 20 million \n     Americans would benefit from its modest reforms. Save the \n     fight over MSA's for the next Congress. . . .\n\n  The San Francisco Chronicle wrote on June 10 that,\n\n       There may well be some merit in MSA's to the extent they \n     encourage health consumers to be more cost-conscious. But \n     that possible benefit is still out-weighed by the virtual \n     certainty that MSA's would encourage healthy and wealthy \n     Americans--those who could afford the high-deductible \n     catastrophic coverage--to abandon the prevailing insurance \n     system, making it even more expensive for the poorer and less \n     healthy Americans left behind.\n\n  The Harrisburg Patriot wrote that\n\n       While the idea of medical savings accounts has a lot of \n     appeal on the surface, the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners and other \n     experts in health insurance have warned that it poses dire \n     consequences for the overall health-care system. MSAs would \n     remove significant amounts of money from the pool of funds \n     that go to pay the nation's health-care bill, while their \n     tax-deductibility would pose another drain on the Treasury . \n     . . They ought to be considered separately.\n\n  A June 12 editorial in the Columbus Dispatch was entitled, ``Clean \nHealth Bill; Get Rid of Those Two Killer Amendments.'' It says that \nMSA's could\n\n       . . . appeal only to healthy people, throwing seriously ill \n     people into a pool whose costs would escalate. This proposal \n     should be in separate legislation, so the clamor it kicks up \n     would not endanger the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorials I \nmentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Tacoma (WA) News Tribune, June 13, 1996]\n\n                   Stick to Basics in New Health Bill\n\n       So close, and yet so far. Only a few months ago it looked \n     like Congress might pass a modest health insurance bill that \n     would help millions of Americans worried about their health \n     coverage.\n       Now it looks like election-year politics could doom the \n     effort. Republicans and Democrats would rather have a \n     campaign issue than successful legislation.\n       The strategy behind the bipartisan legislation crafted by \n     Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA.) and Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) \n     was to follow the KISS rule: Keep it Simple, Stupid. That way \n     Congress could avoid getting sucked into another morass like \n     the one that swallowed the Clinton administration's massive \n     health care package.\n       Kassebaum, chairman of the Senate labor and Human Resources \n     Committee, and Kennedy, the committee's ranking Democrat, won \n     strong bipartisan support for their proposal, which sailed \n     through the Senate in April. The Senate measure allows people \n     losing or changing jobs to continue their health coverage; \n     the bill also forbids insurers to refuse coverage for pre-\n     existing conditions.\n       But the House version includes a provision for medical \n     savings accounts, which couple high-deductible catastrophic \n     health insurance policies with tax-exempt savings accounts. \n     Proponents content MSAs would promote individual choice and \n     responsibility in making personal health-car decisions.\n       The concept is attractive, but many medical economists warn \n     MSAs would be used mostly by healthy and more affluent \n     people, leaving older and sicker people in the common \n     insurance risk pool. That would force up insurance rates for \n     everybody else. Even Kassebaum thought MSAs were too untested \n     to include in the Senate bill.\n       But MSAs have become a kind of Holy Grail to House \n     conservatives, who insist MSAs be included even it means a \n     certain presidential veto. This week Senate and House leaders \n     agreed on a compromise that initially ``restricts'' MSAs to \n     self-employed workers and employees of businesses with 50 or \n     fewer workers. After two years, everyone else would become \n     eligible, unless Congress intervenes.\n       Kennedy and the White House have signaled they might accept \n     a limited test of MSAs. But the Republican proposal is hardly \n     limited; Anywhere from 25 to 40 million people would be \n     eligible, and expansion in two years would be almost \n     automatic. That's no test.\n       The original Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was a good one. More \n     than 20 million Americans would benefit from its modest \n     reforms. Save the fight over MSAs for the next Congress and \n     the next president.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, June 10, 1996]\n\n                           Key Test for Dole\n\n       House and Senate conferees have come within one stubborn \n     whisker of passing the most significant health-care reform \n     since\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\n     the Clinton administration's national health insurance \n     proposal went down in flames in 1994. But the window of \n     opportunity could slam closed with the Tuesday retirement of \n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, whose legislative skills are \n     needed one final time.\n       The problem is the medical savings account provision that \n     House Republicans added to the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health \n     Insurance Reform bill. That bill's main objectives are to \n     make insurance ``portable'' when workers change or leave jobs \n     and to make it more difficult for insurers to refuse coverage \n     to people with pre-existing medical problems. Those \n     provisions would greatly enhance the health security of \n     millions of Americans who are otherwise vulnerable to falling \n     into the ranks of the uninsured whenever they change or lose \n     jobs.\n       Because the Senate bill would mend a gaping crack in the \n     health insurance system--and do so without favoring any \n     special interests--it has won broad bipartisan support: it \n     passed 100 to 0. The problems have been with the House \n     version, which was loaded down with some hot-button GOP \n     proposals that would--and should--elicit a sustainable \n     presidential veto.\n       While most of the veto bait has been negotiated away--\n     including the Senate's call for ``parity'' on mental health \n     coverage--Republicans have shown little willingness to \n     compromise on the most contentious issue, the medical savings \n     accounts.\n       The MSA concept, which Dole favors, appeals mainly to \n     healthy and well-to-do consumers, who could use a tax-\n     deductible savings account--similar to an IRA--to cover the \n     costs of routine medical expenses, such as checkups and minor \n     treatments, as an alternative to health insurance. The \n     accounts would be coupled with high-deductible insurance \n     plans to deal with costly, catastrophic illness.\n       There may well be some merit in MSAs to the extent they \n     encourage health consumers to be more cost-conscious. But \n     that possible benefit is still far out-weighed by the virtual \n     certainty that MSAs would encourage healthy and wealthy \n     Americans--those who could afford the high-deductible \n     catastrophic coverage--to abandon the prevailing insurance \n     system, making it even more expensive for the poorer and less \n     healthy Americans left behind.\n       While President Clinton has properly threatened to veto any \n     bill containing MSAs, he has also left the door wide open to \n     an obvious compromise: permitting a pilot MSA program in \n     specific states for a long enough period to ensure that they \n     will not add to health insurance costs and thereby increase \n     the number of the uninsured.\n       Some form of that approach is what Dole now has to sell to \n     House Republicans if the 104th Congress--and candidate Dole, \n     himself--is to take credit for accomplishing at least a \n     portion of the health-care reform that the president tried \n     and failed to do. If he fails, we all lose.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Harrisburg (PA) Patriot, Apr. 3, 1996]\n\nToo Much Reform--House Amendments Weigh Down Effort To Make Health-Care \n                           Insurance Portable\n\n       It represents the most modest of health-care reform, so \n     modest it is almost embarrassing. But progress, however \n     small, in helping people deal with medical expenses is \n     welcome progress nonetheless.\n       There is little visibly active opposition to the bipartisan \n     proposal jointly sponsored by U.S. Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, \n     D-Mass., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan. Nonethless, their basic \n     proposal to ensure that people do not lose health coverage \n     when they change or lose their jobs is in some trouble.\n       Last week, the House of Representatives approved a bill \n     incorporating the basic features of the Kennedy-Kassebaum \n     bill. But also included were a number of odd controversial \n     items that dramatically alter the scope of the legislation.\n       Without much debate or consideration, the House tacked on a \n     scheme that would provide for tax-deductible medical savings \n     accounts and another that would cap punitive damages in \n     medical-related lawsuits at $250,000, or three times economic \n     damages, whichever is greater.\n       President Clinton has indicated that he could not accept a \n     bill with either of these provisions. The Senate is expected \n     to vote on the legislation this month.\n       While the idea of medical savings accounts has a lot of \n     appeal on the surface, the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners and other \n     experts in health insurance have warned that it poses dire \n     consequences for the overall health-care system.\n       MSAs would remove significant amounts of money from the \n     pool of funds that go to pay the nation's health-care bill, \n     while their tax-deductibility would pose another drain on the \n     Treasury.\n       But the important point here is not whether MSAs or capping \n     punitive damages represent good or bad ideas. It is that they \n     generate sufficient objection to threaten to sink the modest \n     Kennedy-Kassebaum effort that most lawmakers agree has the \n     potential to help many of the 25 million Americans who change \n     jobs every year.\n       This legislation will not help the 41 million Americans who \n     already are uninsured, though it may serve to limit their \n     numbers from growing.\n       To the extent that more far-reaching reforms are proposed, \n     such as MSAs, limiting punitive damages or genuine health-\n     care reform, they ought to be considered separately.\n       If they aren't, it's pretty clear with will happen. There \n     will be no reform, just as nothing materialized out of the \n     major effort to pass health-care reform in 1994.\n       Modest though it is, the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill is better \n     than no reform at all.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Columbus Dispatch, June 12, 1996]\n\n   ``Clean'' Health Bill; Get Rid of Those Two ``Killer'' Amendments\n\n       It sounded so simple. Congress would pass a modest health-\n     care reform bill. Most significantly, it would prevent \n     insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. \n     Also, workers would be able to change jobs or start their own \n     businesses without losing health insurance.\n       This is the kind of scaled-down legislation that was \n     suggested when various well-financed lobbies smothered the \n     admittedly too-ambitious bill from the Clinton administration \n     two years ago.\n       The current measure is sponsored by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, \n     Republican from Kansas, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. This is \n     Kassebaum's last year in the Senate, and she sees the bill as \n     her farewell accomplishment. Former Senate Majority Leader \n     Bob Dole, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, also \n     supports the bill, but his leaving takes him out of the loop \n     for using his influence.\n       Unfortunately, ominous storm clouds are forming. Several \n     ``killer amendments'' may doom this altogether worthy effort. \n     The amendments make sense to many, but they are not \n     universally admired and any one might doom the bill.\n       The solution? Strip the legislation down, so it is a \n     ``clean bill,'' dealing only with the modest approaches in \n     the original proposal.\n       A provision for medical savings accounts is the most \n     contentious item in the plan. This would allow people to \n     build up tax-free accounts to pay medical bills. Sounds \n     constructive.\n       But there is some concern this would appeal only to healthy \n     people, throwing seriously ill people into a pool whose costs \n     would escalate. This proposal should be in separate \n     legislation, so the clamor it kicks up would not endanger the \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n       Also, states have the option of passing their own MSA laws, \n     as Ohio just did. President Clinton has threatened to veto \n     the bill if it contains the MSA provision.\n       The other sticky measure would require employers to provide \n     coverage for mental illness. While this sounds sensible, \n     there is enough opposition so that this, too, could kill the \n     whole bill.\n       Mental-health coverage could be accomplished on the state \n     level, as is being attempted in Ohio.\n       Experts say there are hidden costs in mandated mental-\n     illness coverage. There has been a welcome suggestion that a \n     national commission be appointed to research this issue and \n     make recommendations.\n       Interest groups could make spirited defenses for medical \n     savings accounts and mental-illness coverage. Indeed, the \n     former has had the benefit of expensive lobbying. But keeping \n     touchy items in the health-reform legislation is a sure way \n     to defeat the whole bill. Better to settle for half a loaf. \n     That, at least, would provide some nourishment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These editorials are just a sampling of commentary \naround the Nation. It is time for Republicans to stop playing special \ninterest politics with health insurance reform. The Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill passed by a bipartisan vote of 100-0. It should not be blocked \nbecause some Republicans want to line the pockets of their campaign \ncontributors.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been an interesting discussion, \nand an energetic discussion, I might say, in this Chamber this morning. \nEarly on this morning, beginning I believe at 9:30 for 1\\1/2\\ hours we \nhad a team come to the floor of the Senate, and it is a disciplined \nteam, all headed the same direction, all pulling in the same harness, \nto tell the country that the problem with the health care bill, the so-\ncalled Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that has been addressed this morning, is \nthat the Democrats are holding it up because of something called MSA's, \nor medical savings accounts.\n  In truth, of course, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which is a very \nimportant bill, is being held hostage by people who voted for it; 100 \nto nothing it passed this Chamber, by those who insist that they want \nto add something to it, and if they cannot add something to it they \nwill not let it pass.\n  Let me describe briefly what this bill is. Most of it has been \ndescribed. Let me go back a bit, if I can, to put it in perspective. I \ncome from a small town, 300 people, in southwestern North Dakota, down \nnear farming and ranching country, and we had one doctor in my \nhometown. He was a wonderful doctor named Dr. Simon Hill. He came to my \nhometown in the early 1900's, and he practiced medicine until he was \nnearly 80 years old.\n  When he was practicing medicine in my hometown in the mid 1900's, \nthere\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\nwas no Medicare Program. A fair number of people had no insurance. What \nthey had for health care in my hometown was one doctor. He had an \noffice. He had the drugstore on the ground floor. His doctor's office \nwas above the drugstore. When people came to see him, he would lock the \ndrugstore and walk upstairs to the examining office, or if people were \ntoo sick to come to see him, he would get in his car and drive to see \nthem. He did, like most doctors did back then, make house calls. And if \npeople did not have any money and were sick, Doc Hill still drove out \nto their place and administered medicine, administered health care, and \nif they had no money but had a couple of laying hens or fryer chickens, \nthey gave him a couple of chickens or a half a beef. If they were \npeople with a fair amount of money, he would charge them an arm and a \nleg, I guess.\n  He ran his own health care system in my little town. He charged those \nwho could afford a substantial amount and gave free health care to all \nthose who had no money, and that is the way the health care system \nworked in Regent, ND, because one doctor did health care 24 hours a day \nfor some 60 years.\n  Now, was it a good health care system? It was the best he could do. \nMy neighbor had a toothache. We had no dentist, so his dad, Alvin, took \nhis son, Alton, to Doc Hill, who pulled his tooth. Doc Hill was not a \ndentist, but he pulled his tooth. It turns out he pulled the wrong \ntooth, but he did not get sued because we did not have a lawyer in my \nhometown either.\n  It was a wonderful system--simple, administered by one person who was \nhumane and knew what the needs of the community were.\n  Back then, when someone had a cardiac problem, they were likely to \ndie when they had a heart attack. We were also 55 or 60 miles from a \nhospital. When someone had a problem with cataracts, they could not \nsee. When someone had a problem with their hips, they went into a \nwheelchair. If someone's knees gave out, they could not walk; they, \ntoo, were in a wheelchair.\n  Of course, what has happened over time is Dr. Hill died, and my \nhometown does not have a doctor anymore. Health care changed \ndramatically, some of it in wonderful ways, breathtaking changes. Now, \nif someone has a cardiac problem, eats too much fat all of their lives \nor has a hereditary problem with their heart and it gets all plugged \nup, what they do is they lay that person out on a table and unplug the \nheart muscle and invest $50,000 or $75,000 and sew the person up and \nthe person feels like a million dollars 6 weeks later. Now they replace \nthe knees. Now they replace the hip. Now they offer cataract surgery, \nand that person walks and sees and lives a new life with open heart \nsurgery.\n\n  All of that is wonderful. It is remarkable. It is expensive. Most all \nof, it comes from breathtaking research done at the National Institutes \nof Health and elsewhere, I would say, with substantial Federal grants \nin order to achieve these health care breakthroughs and new \ntechnologies. All of it is wonderful. But, of course, what has happened \nin the intervening years is health care has also become very, very \nexpensive. It is full of near miracles because of this breathtaking new \nmedical technology, but it is also very expensive.\n  We have a lot of folks in this country who have no health care \ncoverage at all. Upwards of 40 million Americans are walking around \ntoday with no health care coverage, and if they get sick, they do not \nhave any money to pay and they do not have insurance to cover it.\n  We also have a fair number of people in this country who work at a \njob somewhere and they have a health insurance policy in a group plan \nthrough their employment. But, of course, if they leave that \nemployment, they lose that insurance. There are a fair number of people \nwho cannot afford under any circumstances to leave their job because \nthey have someone in their family with a preexisting condition. And if \nthey leave that job and lose that health care insurance, they will \nnever get another policy anywhere. I have a daughter with a cardiac \nproblem. My expectation is that if I did not have health care coverage \nhere and went out on the open market to try to buy health care \ncoverage, no one is going to ensure someone with a preexisting \ncondition, with a cardiac problem. Millions and millions of Americans \nconfront that condition every day, a preexisting condition for which \nthey cannot now get health care insurance, a job that they are now \nlocked into because if they leave they cannot take their insurance with \nthem.\n  So Congress did something to address that. Congress said let us pass \na piece of legislation called the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that does a \nseries of things that have great merit. Among them, you can take your \nhealth care with you when you change jobs.\n  That makes an enormous amount of good sense. Among them is that a \npreexisting condition shall not be a cause for denying health insurance \ncoverage to a family. Boy, that is going to help millions and millions \nof families in this country.\n  So we passed that piece of legislation, and everyone now knows what \nthe vote was because Senator Kennedy this morning has talked about it \nseveral times. The vote in this Senate, which is very, very rare, was \n100 yeas and zero nays. By 100 to nothing, the Senate said let us pass \nthis legislation that does the right thing to address these health care \nproblems--100 to 0. That was many months ago. Why, after many months, \nhaving passed a bill 100 to 0, do we not have that bill back through \nhere out of a conference and to the White House for signature? Why is \nthat bill not now law? It is very simple; because there are some who \ninsist on holding that bill hostage because they have other things that \nthey want to load onto that bill. They are saying if we cannot put what \nwe want on that bill, if we cannot add to it, then you are not going to \npass the bill. We insist, we demand that medical savings accounts be \nadded to that bill.\n\n  Let me describe medical savings accounts from my perspective. I do \nnot have the foggiest idea whether these things called medical savings \naccounts are good or bad. I do not know, nor do I object to some sort \nof demonstration project or some kind of approach that would give us \nthe ability to determine will this sort of thing, the medical savings \naccount, be good for our health care system or be inherently bad for \nour system. I do not know the answer to that.\n  There is one company that has marketed these things aggressively. \nThey have been heavy, heavy contributors to Speaker Gingrich and \nothers, and they have just pushed and pushed and pushed this issue. But \nI am not one who automatically says this is a bad thing to do. I do not \nknow. We probably ought to find out does this work or does it not work. \nI do not object to some kind of demonstration project to find that \nanswer. But I do object to those who believe we should hold hostage the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, with the meritorious health care changes that \nare desperately needed by many families in this country--hold that \nhostage to the medical savings account legislation.\n  We had, I think, six or eight speakers come to the floor in the first \nhour and a half this morning, arranged by the majority. That has been \nhappening often. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a deliberate \nstrategy to get a number of people to say the same thing, say it loud, \nsay it often, and get the American people to believe what they are \nsaying is somehow where we are. It is not where we are with respect to \nthis important issue on health care.\n  We are deadlocked on Kassebaum-Kennedy, an important health care \nmeasure that will help millions and millions of American families, \nbecause we have people in this Chamber who are doing to this bill what \nthey have done to every other piece of legislation that has had merit \nin the last 1\\1/2\\ years or so. They are saying yes, that might have \nmerit, we might support that, but we will not allow it to move unless \nwe add our burdens to it, even though what they are adding to it they \nknow represent the kind of poison pills that will doom the legislation.\n  It is now Friday. On Tuesday, we could pass, once again 100 to 0, 100 \nto 0 the fundamental health care reform that is embraced in the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill. We can do that. We should do that. But we \nprobably will not do that, notwithstanding what six or eight people \nsaid earlier this morning. We probably will not do that because those \nfolks are saying we must insist on having medical savings accounts \nattached to it or we will not\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\nsupport it any longer. That makes no sense at all. I hope there will be \na compromise reached, there will be common ground found, so those who \nhold this kind of bill hostage will decide and understand, finally, the \nfoolishness of doing so.\n  It is not just this bill. It is a whole series of other initiatives. \nThe minimum wage--should we adjust the minimum wage? Yes, I think so. \nIt was 1989, was the last time it was adjusted. We have a couple of \nmillion people, 40 percent of whom are the sole breadwinners in their \nfamily, who work for the minimum wage.\n\n  It is easy for someone to stand up here and blithely say the minimum \nwage doesn't matter, it is a bunch of kids frying hamburgers. It is a \nbunch of school kids. There are school kids working for minimum wage. I \ndo not disagree with that. But 40 percent of the people on minimum wage \nare the sole breadwinners of their households. I ask you to read some \nof the letters from those folks who are struggling to try to make ends \nmeet.\n  The kind of troubles some families have are pretty hard for some \npeople here to understand, I think. A family wrote to me some while ago \nthat I described. I read, late one evening, a four-page handwritten \nletter from a woman in North Dakota. Her trailer house burned down. \nThey lost everything. She described the troubles she and her husband \nhave had, people who have not had the opportunity for education, people \nwho have four children, who lost everything. They struggle, they work \nfor minimum wage. Their only complaint was that she was hoping maybe we \ncould see some adjustment in the minimum wage at some point, it has \nbeen 6 years they have been frozen at the bottom of that ladder. She \nsaid,\n\n       You know, I do not know how to tell my sons who want to \n     play summer baseball I do not have the $25 to pay for their \n     registration, let alone buy them a baseball glove.\n\n  These issues sound like theory here in this Chamber, but they are \nreal to people who are trying to make a living; trying to deal with \nfamily issues and family needs every single day.\n  The interesting thing I find is this. This floor is crowded, \nliterally cluttered with traffic when we are talking about things that \nhelp the big interests in this country. When you talk about some tax \nbreak that is going to help the biggest economic interests, the biggest \ncorporations, you can hardly get in this place. Everybody is rushing \ndown to vote ``aye.''\n  We have proposals now that say we want a balanced budget amendment \nbut we also want tax cuts. Of course, much of which will go to those \nwho already have plenty in this country. The bulk of those tax cuts are \ngoing to go to the upper income folks, people who are making hundreds \nof thousands of dollars a year. In fact, last year we offered an \namendment that said, if you insist on proposing tax cuts at a time when \nwe have deficits, let us at least agree on one thing. Let us agree we \nwill limit the tax cuts to those families under $100,000 in income. The \nanswer was, ``No, of course not, we will not do that.'' It was rejected \nby a partisan vote.\n  ``All right, if you will not do that, how about at least limiting the \ntax cuts to families making less than a quarter of a million dollars a \nyear?'' They said, ``No, we will not agree with that. We insist the tax \nbenefits we are going to give go to people earning over a quarter of a \nmillion dollars a year.''\n  We said, ``All right, what about a million? Would you at least limit \nthe tax cuts at the time when we have deficits and you are demanding we \ncut people's taxes, would you at least limit them to people whose \nincomes are less than $1 million a year? Would you at least do that?'' \nThe answer was, ``No, no, we do not want to do that.''\n  Why would the answer be no? Because the bulk of the benefits are \ngoing to go to those very upper income folks and they know it. That is \nthe problem around here. We have a lot of needs and we have a lot of \nthings to do. We should balance the budget. But, in my judgment, you do \nnot balance the budget by starting with tax cuts.\n\n  I know it is popular. I have a couple of children who love to eat \ndesert before dinner. But to suggest that tax cuts come before we \nbalance this Federal budget, especially tax cuts that are so \nfundamentally opposed to what we are trying to do--let me give an \nexample, a tax cut that says let us make it easier to move American \njobs overseas. Let us spend $300 million of the American taxpayers' \nmoney by giving that in tax breaks to companies who will take their \nAmerican jobs and move them overseas. Think of this. We are up to our \nneck in debt, we are struggling to figure out how do we reduce the \nFederal deficit, and we have people coming to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate saying--at the time when not only do we have this debt but we \nare losing jobs, our manufacturing base is being diminished, jobs are \nmoving overseas, we have people saying--``By the way, we want to change \nthe Tax Code so we provide more tax benefits to those who move their \njobs overseas.''\n  This simply does not add up. It is an agenda that does not relate in \nany way to the interests or needs of people who are working for a \nliving and struggling, trying to make it in this economy.\n  I think you can summarize the baskets of issues in about three areas \nthat we need to address and address appropriately in this Congress. We \ncan, I suppose, just fight for the rest of the year and quibble and \nhave a tug-of-war and accomplish nothing, which would not very well \nserve the interests of this country, in my judgment. Or we can find \nways to decide on something, for example like the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill, which everyone in this Chamber believes has merit because every \nsingle person voted for it. The vote was 100 to nothing. We can decide, \nall right, we cannot agree on everything but we can agree on that.\n  Instead of spending all day trying to figure out what we cannot agree \non, let us spend part of the day trying to figure out what we can agree \non and advance that and pass it and make it law. That is exactly what \nwe ought to do on the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. We know we agree \non that. We have already had the vote. There was not one person in this \nChamber who disagreed. So, instead of exerting all of our energy trying \nto figure out where we disagree, why do we not exert some energy to \nunderstand where we agree and move it to the President and make that \nlaw?\n  Mr. President, tens of millions of families will benefit by the \npreexisting condition, by the portability of insurance--tens of \nmillions of families are waiting for this legislation to pass. It is \nbeing held hostage by those who say that if they cannot add their \nprovision to it, if they cannot add their idea on MSA's, we are not \nletting it go anywhere.\n  That is inherently selfish, in my judgment, to say, ``If I don't get \nmy way, you can't have your way.'' It just does not make sense to me to \ncontinue to believe that the right approach for our country is to put \nthe brakes on good proposals, good ideas that the American people want \nand deserve.\n  I think you can break these things down into three areas that I \ndiscussed before: First is kids; second is jobs; third is values. Kids, \njobs, and values. If we address those, all of us, we ought to have a \ncommon interest. There ought not be much difference in how we would \nrespond to the needs of American children, between Republicans or \nDemocrats. We all ought to understand this.\n  All of us ought to have one goal. We all ought to believe that, with \nrespect to our kids, our future is in educating our kids. Thomas \nJefferson once said, anyone who believes that a country can be both \nignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can \nbe.\n  Everyone in this Chamber, I expect, should believe that we want to \nhave the best education system in this world--the best in the world, \nnot second place, not 10th place, the best education system in the \nworld. Now, if that is our goal, then let's just spend the rest of the \nyear to figure out how do we work with others in our country who are \ninvolved in our education system to accomplish that goal. How do we \naccomplish having the best education system in the world, because that \ndetermines who wins in the international economic competition, and the \ninternational economic competition means you are going to have winners \nand losers. The winners are going to have jobs, expanding economies and \nopportunities, and the losers are going to suffer the British disease \nof long, slow economic decline that we saw at the end of the last \ncentury.\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n  So, educate our kids? Does it make sense then when we understand \nsomething that works, like a Head Start Program where you take a 3- or \n4-year-old kid coming from a home of poverty, from a circumstance of \ndisadvantage, and we say to them, ``We're going to invest money in you \nin a Head Start Program, and we know it works, and it makes life better \nfor those kids,'' does it make sense for us to say, ``Look, there are \n60,000 of you who have names, Jim, Bill, Mary, Donna, and we've got \nnews for you; we can no longer afford to have you in a Head Start \nProgram''? Does that make sense?\n  Does it make sense, especially at a time when we are saying, ``By the \nway, we have money to give tax breaks, especially to people over $1 \nmillion a year in income, but we can't afford to keep 60,000 of you \nkids in a Head Start Program''?\n  The answer is, no, of course, it does not make sense. It is nuts. It \ndoes not make any sense to establish priorities that are so far out of \nbounds. Our kids matter. Investment in our kids matters to all of us.\n  The Head Start Program works. I use that simply as an example of the \nneed, the desperate need, to get our priorities straight.\n  Jobs: No one comes to the floor on any regular occasion and talks \nabout the merchandise trade deficit in this country. The merchandise \ntrade deficit is higher than our fiscal deficit. What does that mean? \nJobs that used to be here are elsewhere. Jobs that used to be American \njobs are now in Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh. I know the \nAmerican people contribute to this. You cannot wear Mexican shorts and \nChinese pants and shirts made in Taiwan and television sets made in \nThailand and drive cars made in Japan and then complain about, ``Where \nhave American jobs gone?'' People do that, but you cannot do that.\n\n  American jobs are leaving to go to where the international \nenterprises want to produce, where they can pay a dime an hour, a \nquarter an hour, 50 cents an hour, $1 an hour to compete against \nAmerican workers, where we pay a living wage, minimum wage to those who \nwork in factories that are safe because we demand they be safe, compete \nin circumstances where we will not allow 12-year-olds to work in \ntextile mills because we have child labor laws.\n  The jobs have left this country because we have not dealt with our \ntrade problem in a straightforward way, but you cannot get many people \non this floor to talk very thoughtfully about that. People just do not \nwant to discuss it.\n  But the issue of jobs is at the root of interest of families that are \ngoing to sit down for supper tonight and talk about their lives and \ntheir future and what they want for their kids. It is going to be, \n``Are we going to have an opportunity to get a good job that pays a \ngood income?''\n  Values? The fact is the American people are very concerned about \ncollapsed values in this country. Just go out the door and look around \na bit--the rate of crime, the rate of violent crime--and understand \nwhat is happening.\n  Look at the accelerated rate of teenage pregnancies and understand \nwhat is happening. Look at the number of people who have fathered \nchildren in this country and, once having fathered the child, said, \n``Sayonara, I'm out of here,'' and takes no responsibility for that \nchild and refuses to make a payment.\n  Collapsed values? You bet. Teenage pregnancy, deadbeat dads, crime \nepidemic, epidemic of violent crime--these are the issues that we have \nto work on, and we have to work on them in a way that responds to the \nway the American people want us to respond to these issues.\n  Welfare reform: That is part of the values issue. It is also part of \nkids, but two-thirds of people on welfare in America are kids under 16 \nyears of age.\n  But with respect to values, it seems to me our public policy ought to \nbe--there ought not be great debate about this--to say those who are \nable-bodied in the welfare system have a responsibility to work.\n  We have offered a proposal called the Work First Program. What we \nhave said is, we want to turn welfare offices into employment offices. \nWe are not interested in paying welfare. We are interested in making \nsure people who are able-bodied go to work. But while doing that, we \ninsist that we not subject America's children to lives of poverty and \ncircumstances that none of us in this room would allow our children to \nlive in.\n  We cannot decide that while we solve the welfare problem, we are \ngoing to say to the poorest people in this country, and especially poor \nchildren, ``By the way, you're not entitled to health care if you're \nsick.'' Does that make any sense to anybody, at a time when we are \ntalking about tax cuts for the upper-income folks in this country? It \ndoes not to me.\n  This week--the reason I recite some of this--is on the floor of the \nSenate, on the heels of the proposal for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, which I will not go into, but it misuses the Social \nSecurity trust fund to balance the budget, on the heels of that, with \nall of the people saying, ``We want to balance the budget,'' the first \njump out of the chute this week is, again, adding money, adding \nhundreds of millions of dollars, for a star wars program. Yes, a star \nwars program. We cannot afford the basic things, but we can afford a \nstar wars program.\n\n  It seems to me at some point we are going to have to reconcile in \nthis Chamber what we say with what we do. At some point, we ought to \ntry to figure out, as I said when I began, what we agree on rather than \nwhat we disagree on, and at least enact those things and move those \nthings that represent common interest.\n  Finishing where I started, one area of common interest, I think, is \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, unless those who voted for it were not \nvoting their hearts. Mr. President, 100 people voted for Kassebaum-\nKennedy to reform this health system in a way that will benefit every \nAmerican family. One hundred Senators voted for it, and now it is being \nheld hostage in some legislative prison because someone is insisting \nthat something else be added to it or they will simply not allow it to \nmove. What an outrage.\n  I hope next Monday or Tuesday that those who are insisting they get \ntheir way or we will not have health care reform will finally decide \nthat is not in the public's interest. Let Kassebaum-Kennedy move and \nbring your bill up the following day. That is just fine. None of us \nobject. You can do that. We are going to have a vote on that.\n  If you have the votes here, you win. We do not weigh votes here. We \ncount votes. If you want to bring it up, bring it up, but do not hold \nhostage a health care reform bill that this country needs that passed \nthis Chamber 100 to 0.\n  Mr. President, I have gone on longer than I needed to. I know that my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, is on the floor. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Lieberman be allowed to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from North \nDakota. Mr. President, I appreciate his final request, and I express to \nhim and my colleagues my fervent desire not to use--particularly I \nexpress this to the occupant of the chair--it is my fervent desire not \nto use the full 20 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lieberman pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolutions 270 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6643-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6654-S6657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FILEGATE\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to express a concern about the \nrecent discussion, both publicly and in Congress, concerning what has \nbecome to be called Filegate--that is, the questions regarding the use \nof FBI files and the secret, confidential material contained therein.\n  I am deeply troubled. I am troubled because it appears that the \nreaction of the White House is not to be forthcoming with regard to \nthis crisis. My belief is that the appropriate responses is for the \nWhite House to, frankly and directly, respond to the issues, spell out \nwhat they did, indicate their corrective action, and put this question \nbehind us. It is not one that should occupy a lot of time with regard \nto the congressional inquiries. It is not one that should occupy a lot \nof time with regard to public concerns. It ought to be dealt with and \nput out of the way.\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\n  To that end, Senator Hatch, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \naddressed a letter involving pertinent questions to the White House and \nto the Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta. That was on June 13. It had \nincluded in it what I thought were fair questions, ones reasonably \nraised by the questions that are involved and asked for the appropriate \ninformation.\n  That letter was answered on the 19th, 6 days later. But Chief of \nStaff Panetta did not choose to respond. Instead, he delegated that to \none of the counsel, Jack Quinn.\n  Mr. President, I think that is unfortunate. This is an important \nmatter, and while it can be dealt with quickly, I think it does deserve \nthe attention of the Chief of Staff. I think it is unfortunate that he \nchoose not to address it. Jack Quinn answers the letter.\n  I want to express my concern about the answers. Frankly, Mr. \nPresident, what happened in those answers was simply to stonewall the \nquestions. I know that is a harsh and strong judgment, and I invite \nMembers to make their own decisions about whether or not it is \naccurate. But I want to share with the Members--just for the questions \nthat I felt were relevant questions that were reasonable to ask under \nthe circumstances--the answers. Members can make up their own minds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the response letter from Jack \nQuinn of the White House, be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Leon Panetta,\n     Chief of Staff to the President, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Panetta: I have several questions concerning the \n     White House's acquisition of various FBI files, such as those \n     of Billy Dale, as well as at least 330 other individuals, \n     including persons who worked at the White House under \n     Republican Administrations who no longer had access to the \n     White House. I would appreciate your prompt response to these \n     questions:\n       1. Please list the names and titles of those persons who \n     had the authority, in December 1993, to send a memorandum \n     under Bernard Nussbaum's name to the FBI requesting the FBI \n     to send its background files to the White House.\n       2. Please provide a copy of the December 20, 1993 \n     memorandum on White House stationary to the FBI requesting \n     background files on Mr. Billy Dale.\n       3. A. Who caused this memorandum to be sent to the FBI and \n     for what purpose(s)?\n       B. Did anyone direct, request, or otherwise cause such \n     individual to send the memorandum to the FBI, and if so, \n     please identify any such person by name and title.\n       C. Who is the person referenced in paragraph 4 of the June \n     9, 1996 declaration of Anthony Marceca (enclosed)?\n       4. A. When were the FBI files on Mr. Dale received by the \n     White House?\n       B. Who at the White House received the FBI files on Mr. \n     Dale?\n       C. Where have the FBI files on Mr. Dale been stored since \n     their arrival at the White House?\n       D. Who had access to the FBI files on Mr. Dale at the White \n     House since their arrival at the White House?\n       E. Did everyone who had access to the FBI files on Mr. Dale \n     have to ``sign out'' the files when viewing them?\n       F. Did anyone at the White House review the FBI files on \n     Mr. Dale, and, if so, please identify any such person by name \n     and title.\n       G. Did any such person provide information from these files \n     to other persons, and, if so, please identify any such other \n     person by name and title.\n       5. A. Please identify by name and title any person(s) who \n     directed the initiation of ``Project Update,'' referenced in \n     paragraph 3 of the June 9, 1996, declaration of Anthony \n     Marceca, and identify by name and title all persons who \n     participated in ``Project Update.''\n       B. Did Mr. Marceca request files from the FBI on \n     individuals not included in ``Project Update?''\n       6. In updating security files at the White House for \n     purposes of continuing to grant access to the White House, is \n     it routine for the White House to request all of the FBI \n     files on each individual, regardless of how far back in time \n     the date of the file?\n       7. With respect to the requests for the FBI files for at \n     least 330 individuals based on, according to news accounts, \n     outdated lists of White House pass holders provided by the \n     Secret Service:\n       A. Please provide a copy of the lists upon which these \n     requests were made.\n       B. Please identify by name and title the person or persons \n     who sent the requests for FBI files, based on these lists, \n     from the White House to the FBI.\n       C. Please identify by name and title those persons in the \n     chain of custody who provided the lists to the person(s) who \n     sent the requests for files to the FBI.\n       D. Please identify by name and title anyone who reviewed \n     any of these FBI files after their delivery to the White \n     House, and the date of such review.\n       E. Please identify by name and title anyone who was \n     provided information based on any of these FBI files, and the \n     name and title of anyone who provided such information to \n     such individual(s).\n       F. Please identify by name and title the person(s) who \n     discovered the error of relying on the lists from which these \n     requests to the FBI were made.\n       G. On what date was the error of relying on these lists \n     discovered?\n       H. Upon discovery of the error, what action(s) were taken \n     and on what date(s)?\n       I. Upon discovery of the error, why weren't the files \n     immediately returned to the FBI?\n       J. Please identify by name and title the individual who \n     halted the requests for FBI background files based upon the \n     list reportedly provided by the Secret Service.\n       7. A. Why did Ms. Beth Nolan, of the White House Counsel's \n     office, send a memorandum dated August 19, 1993 to the \n     Department of Justice inquiring as to whether the White House \n     Counsel could release information from FBI background checks \n     on the seven White House Travel Office employees fired on May \n     19, 1993?\n       B. Did the White House receive any oral or written response \n     to this memorandum? If so, please identify by name and title \n     anyone who provided such a response, the date of such \n     response, and any written record of such response.\n       C. Was any information from FBI files on these seven \n     employees disseminated by anyone in the White House?\n       8. Has the White House requested FBI files on any member of \n     Congress or any person employed by Congress, other than in \n     connection with an employment related security clearance \n     check or a background review for purposes of possible \n     employment within the Executive Branch, or appointment to the \n     Judicial Branch?\n       9. Please provide a copy of all White House Counsel \n     policies or guidelines on contacts between the White House \n     and the FBI.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of June 13, 1996 to Leon Panetta.\n       As you know, the investigation of the FBI files matter has \n     been handled by both the Office of the Independent Counsel \n     and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The White House has \n     been cooperating fully with these investigations. As a \n     result, we are not undertaking our own investigation or \n     conducting file searches. However, we will provide the \n     information we have available that bears on your inquiries.\n       1. We have not undertaken to determine the identity of all \n     persons with authority to request background files from the \n     FBI in December 1993. In December 1993, the Office of \n     Personnel Security's Director was Craig Livingstone, the \n     Executive Assistant was Mary Anderson, and the staff \n     assistant was Lisa Wetzl. Also detailed to that Office was \n     Anthony Marceca. Mr. Livingstone reported to Mr. William \n     Kennedy, Associate Counsel to the President, who in turn \n     reported to Mr. Bernard Nussbaum, Counsel to the President.\n       2. We are not aware of any memorandum on White House \n     stationery regarding Billy Dale that was sent on December 20, \n     1993. However, the request to the FBI for copies of Mr. \n     Dale's previous reports is attached.\n       3. With respect to your questions about the request for Mr. \n     Dale's file, please see the attached declaration of Anthony \n     Marceca. We believe that the person referred to in paragraph \n     4 of Mr. Marceca's declaration is Nancy Gemmell.\n       4. Regarding the receipt and maintenance of Mr. Dale's \n     file, please see the attached statement of Jane Sherburne.\n       5. Regarding your questions about ``Project Update,'' in \n     addition Mr. Marceca, we understand that Lisa Wetzl, \n     Executive Assistant to the Director of Personnel Security, \n     also worked on the Update Project.\n       6. With respect to whether it is routine for the White \n     House to request prior FBI reports for all holdover \n     employees, we understand from the recently completed FBI \n     Report that it is indeed routine to request all prior FBI \n     reports.\n       7. To the extent we have information responsive to your \n     questions about the requests for and chain of custody of any \n     of the mistakenly obtained FBI reports, please see the \n     Sherburne statement, the Marceca Declaration and the attached \n     Declaration of D. Craig Livingstone. Further, we understand \n     that Lisa Wetzl is the person who identified Mr. Marceca's \n     mistake.\n       8. The memorandum that Ms. Nolan wrote to Walter Dellinger \n     at the Department of Justice did not request advice on the \n     release of FBI background information. Instead, as part of \n     its investigation into the Travel Office matter, the General \n     Accounting Office had requested the personnel files (which do \n     not include FBI reports) of the seven fired individuals. Ms. \n     Nolan was seeking advice as to whether fulfilling that \n     request would be\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\n     appropriate. Copies of relevant documents, which have been \n     provided to the House Government Oversight and Reform \n     Committee, are attached for your information. We are not \n     aware of a written reply.\n       9. We have no information responsive to your question about \n     requests for FBI reports on Members of Congress or their \n     staffs.\n       10. Enclosed is a statement released by then-White House \n     Counsel Bernard Nussbaum which governs contacts between the \n     White House and the FBI in the event of a potential \n     investigation. We will provide other materials that may be \n     helpful to you under separate cover as soon as possible.\n       In addition to responding to your questions, I believe it \n     would also be helpful if I explained to you the measures \n     taken by the White House in the wake of the mistaken and \n     inappropriate request for FBI background investigation \n     information in late 1993 and early 1994.\n       As indicated above, the White House has requested and \n     received background investigation reports from the FBI for \n     many years. The information is sought and used to assist the \n     White House in making determinations about the suitability \n     of individuals for access to the White House for \n     employment or other official purposes.\n       Plainly, the requests for background investigation \n     information that are the subject of your hearing were wrong. \n     Based on representations made to us to date, it appears that \n     the requests were the product of innocent errors. Obviously, \n     if we learn otherwise with respect to White House staff, we \n     will act swiftly and decisively.\n       After learning of this situation last week, President \n     Clinton informed me in the clearest terms that he wanted (1) \n     the American people to know the truth about what happened in \n     this matter, (2) disciplinary action to be taken, as \n     appropriate, and (3) policies and procedures to be initiated \n     that would guarantee to the American people that this mistake \n     could not happen again.\n       I will address each of these points in turn.\n       First, we have made clear that the White House not only \n     welcomes but also encourages a complete and vigorous \n     investigation into the matter by the appropriate law \n     enforcement office. As you know, the Attorney General has \n     directed the FBI to conduct a prompt and thorough \n     investigation. I have said publicly and I say here again that \n     the White House welcomes that investigation, and we will work \n     cooperatively with the FBI to facilitate the prompt \n     completion of its investigation.\n       Second, the President's directive that any appropriate \n     disciplinary action be taken will be implemented based upon \n     the facts developed in the upcoming review by the FBI. \n     Earlier this week, Craig Livingston, who headed the personnel \n     security office, asked to be placed on paid administrative \n     leave, and we agreed that that was appropriate. Mr. \n     Livingstone will not return to the White House unless and \n     until this matter is clarified to the satisfaction of the \n     Chief of Staff. If he does return to a position in the \n     Administration, it will be to one that is appropriate and not \n     to the White House Office of Personnel Security, which, as \n     described below, has been absorbed into the Executive Office \n     of the President (EOP) Security Office.\n       Third, at the direction of the President, I have instituted \n     new policies and procedures to prevent any recurrence of the \n     events in question. We are confident that these reforms will \n     help restore public confidence in the integrity of the \n     personnel security system. These new procedures, which are as \n     rigorous as they are unprecedented, include requirements \n     that:\n       Control of the White House background investigation process \n     be placed in the hands of a personnel specialist who is a \n     career, non-political employee;\n       Current, express, written consent of an individual be \n     obtained before the White House seeks his or her background \n     investigation information from the FBI;\n       The Counsel to the President or a specifically designated \n     Counsel's Office attorney approve each White House request to \n     the FBI for background information;\n       The security or vetting officer who initiates the request \n     certify that the request is made for official purposes only; \n     and\n       Access to background investigation information is \n     authorized only to those White House employees designated in \n     writing by the Chief of Staff and the Counsel to the \n     President.\n       No prior Administration had in place policies and \n     procedures designed so effectively to prevent the type of \n     mistake that occurred in this matter. The Report of the FBI \n     General Counsel, dated June 14, 1996, found that the \n     procedure by which the FBI provided background investigation \n     information to the White House ``has changed remarkably \n     little over the intervening three decades'' since the Johnson \n     Administration. I am confident that our reforms will more \n     effectively safeguard the privacy of the individuals whose \n     background files are sought and obtained by the White House.\n       Below, I elaborate on some of the key changes in our \n     policies and procedures:\n       On June 14, 1996, I initiated a series of reforms focusing \n     on the process by which the White House requests background \n     investigation information from the FBI. We will now require \n     that White House requests to the FBI background information \n     be made only with the express written consent of the \n     individual who is the subject of the investigation. The \n     individual's consent must be signed within thirty days of, \n     and must accompany, the White House request to the FBI. No \n     information may be obtained without the individual's consent \n     except in extraordinary circumstances set forth in a letter \n     of justification to the FBI from the Counsel to the President \n     concurred in by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney \n     General.\n       Each request to the FBI must also be approved and signed by \n     the Counsel to the President or a specificially designated \n     Counsel's Office attorney whose regular duties require the \n     review of such information. In addition, each request must be \n     signed by the Counsel to the President or a specifically \n     designated Counsel's Office attorney whose regular duties \n     require the review of such information. In addition, each \n     request must be signed by the security or vetting officer who \n     initiates the request, and that person must certify that the \n     request is made for official purposes only. These new reforms \n     also require identification of the specific reason why the \n     information is being requested.\n       Today, I also recommended a restructuring of the personnel \n     security functions at the White House to further accomplish \n     the President's objective of ensuring that the mistake will \n     not happen again. I suggested--and Chief of Staff Leon \n     Panetta and the President agreed--that the administrative \n     personnel security functions currently performed by the White \n     House Office of Personnel Security be incorporated into the \n     EOP Security Office. This change will be implemented \n     immediately.\n       The EOP Security Office currently conducts personnel \n     security functions for all EOP offices except for the White \n     House Office, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of \n     Policy Development, the National Security Council, and the \n     Executive Residence. The restructuring announced today will \n     bring the administrative personnel security functions for \n     those offices within the purview of the EOP Security Office \n     so that the EOP Security Office will have unified authority \n     over all EOP personnel security functions.\n       The EOP Security Office is currently supervised by Charles \n     ``Chuck'' Easley, a career employee who has served for ten \n     years as the EOP Security Officer since joining the office in \n     the Reagan Administration. Before coming to his current job, \n     Mr. Easley had a twenty-year career in the U.S. Army, \n     including eight years as the Technical Security Advisor to \n     the Security Officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Easley \n     heads a career staff at the EOP Security Office and reports \n     to the Associate Director for Human Resources Management of \n     the Office of Administration, a career personnel specialist.\n       The EOP Security Office will perform its work on White \n     House personnel in accordance with the procedures announced \n     last Friday and described above. In addition, access to the \n     background investigation information will be limited to those \n     EOP and White House employees so authorized in writing by the \n     Chief of Staff and the Counsel to the President whose \n     assigned duties require the review or processing of such \n     information.\n       I believe that the reforms we have now instituted will \n     restore the public's confidence in the integrity of the \n     process by which the White House decides who appropriately \n     may have access to the White House complex.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the first question that I thought was quite \nclear and, perhaps, most appropriate was this: Basically, who had \nauthority to request the FBI files?\n  That is a reasonable question and one that I think is important in \norder to understand the issues that came about.\n  What did the White House answer in response to that question? Let me \nread it:\n\n       We have not undertaken to determine the identity of all \n     persons with authority to request background files from the \n     FBI in December 1993.\n\n  Then they go on to explain they have statements from some of the \npeople involved.\n  Mr. President, that is not an answer. A reasonable, direct question \nwas asked, and it was absolutely stonewalled in the White House \nresponse. Mr. President, that is not adequate. The American people \nunderstand mistakes can be made, but they do not understand a stonewall \nfrom the White House with regard to those questions that arise.\n  The second question dealt with the chain of custody of the list. They \nare referring to the list that was put together that requested files \nfrom the FBI, the custody and who had that list. That is a reasonable \nquestion, and it is my belief that that is an appropriate one to try to \nidentify and get answers to.\n  Here is the White House response:\n\n       To the extent we have information responsive to your \n     questions about the requests for and chain of custody of any \n     of the mistakenly obtained FBI reports, please see--\n\n  And they list statements by people. When you look at those \nstatements, they are not responsive to this question at all. Some of \nthe statements do\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nnot even deal with the question or even relate to the question. What \nthe White House has done to a reasonable question for the chain of \ncustody, who had the list, is simply stonewalled. Mr. President, that \nis not adequate. Nor do I think it is in the interest of the White \nHouse to simply stonewall reasonable questions.\n  The third question: Were the FBI files' information disseminated by \nWhite House employees?\n  Mr. President, that is a reasonable question. Did they--which is \nreally a violation of the law--disseminate the highly confidential \ninformation included in those files outside the White House?\n  How did the White House choose to answer that? Well, the fact is, \nthey answered it in the same style they used in the last question, in \nNo. 7 of their response. They refer you to statements that are not \nresponsive. It is a reasonable question, and it is relevant to \npotential criminal activity, and it is totally stonewalled by the White \nHouse.\n  The Hatch letter asks: Has the White House requested FBI files on any \nMembers of Congress or employees of Congress?\n  That is a reasonable question, and here is the answer:\n\n       We have no information responsive to your question about \n     requests for FBI reports on Members of Congress or their \n     staffs.\n\n  What does that mean? Mr. President, that is a stonewall. That is a \ntotal refusal to deal with the questions that are reasonably asked and \nraised by this inquiry.\n  Those are four specifics, but there are others.\n  I note that on CNN news this morning it was reported that a source \nclose to Mr. Livingstone told CNN that Livingstone said the White House \nhas another list that contains the names of top key Republicans whose \nFBI files they want or may have requested. But the White House has \nchosen not to share this list with the press.\n  Mr. President, I have no idea if that is accurate. I assume in due \ncourse we will understand. But it comes back and relates to the fact \nthat the committee asked. Had they requested White House files, FBI \nfiles, on Members of Congress, or its employees? The White House \nabsolutely stonewalled the question. My sense is this, Mr. President: \nIt is in the interest of this Nation--both Democrats and Republicans--\nto get this issue behind us, and the White House ought to respond to \nthe questions, get the facts out, solve the problem and move on. But, \nif they continue to follow the course of totally stonewalling this \ninquiry, it will not inure to their benefit, and it will not be taken \nas an appropriate action by the American people.\n  Mr. President, my own sense is, just as in Watergate, that a dose of \nhonesty and candor is absolutely the best thing that the White House \ncan do.\n  I mention the following things because I am concerned that the White \nHouse has chosen not to follow that path of honesty and candor.\n  That is a serious charge. Let me be specific, because I think it \nmerits specifics.\n  In response to the questions about this issue about Travelgate, the \nWhite House on June 6 came back and said, ``Yes. Files were requested, \nbut the GAO did it.'' This is on Billy Dale. They blamed the requesting \nof the files on the GAO. The facts turn out that the GAO denied it. And \nit turns out that the GAO did not do it at all. The White House \nstatement was inaccurate.\n  On June 6 the White House indicated that they had requested 338 \nfiles. Mr. President, that was inaccurate. On June 13 the same White \nHouse admitted that they had really requested 132 more for a total of \n470 files. Mr. President, that statement was inaccurate.\n  On June 15, the FBI Director indicates that the White House had \nrequested 481 files. Now the reports are that that may be too low as \nwell.\n  Is the point how many files they requested? Well, it is relevant. We \nought to know it. But I think it is much more important that the White \nHouse has chosen not to be forthcoming and give us accurate answers on \nthese questions.\n  On June 10 the White House said that this whole incident was an \naccident because the Secret Service had given them an outdated list. \nThat is, the request had gone in and included names that were \ninappropriate because the Secret Service had given them the wrong list. \nBut on June 13 the Secret Service responded, and indicated and pointed \nout that their system is incapable of providing a list that the White \nHouse used to request files. The statement of the White House on June \n10 appears to be inaccurate. It appears to have been impossible for the \nSecret Service files to produce the list that the White House said that \nthey got because of inaccurate action on the part of the Secret \nService. Moreover, it appears that their suggestion that they could not \nhave a current list from the Secret Service was inaccurate; the Secret \nService had produced a number of lists updated that could not have \npossibly included any of those names.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the White House has said this was a low-level \nbureaucratic mistake. That is the White House explanation--a ``low-\nlevel bureaucratic mistake.''\n  Mr. President, I will leave it up to Members and their own judgment. \nMr. Livingstone's position was head of White House personnel security. \nThat is not a low-level bureaucrat. Head of security at the White House \nis not a low--level bureaucrat. He was paid $65,000 a year, or \nthereabouts, at least from the indications we have gotten from the \ncommittee. I do not believe--Members can make their own judgment--that \nsomeone paid $65,000 a year is appropriately called a low-level \nbureaucrat.\n  Mr. President, the point is not just that the White House has made \ninaccurate statements, or the White House has refused to answer \nquestions.\n  The point is this: Where do we go from here? My hope is that the \nWhite House will do a couple of things: Get the facts out, be honest, \nand let us get this issue behind us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6654-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6657-S6658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     STALEMATE IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT/CAREERS ACT CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by very partisan, \npolitical tone that is beginning to cloud deliberations over the \nWorkforce Development/Careers Act legislation now in conference. The \nblame for this development cannot be placed at the doorstep of any \nindividual or any political party. I am afraid that everyone is at \nfault, and that there is enough blame for everyone.\n  I voted for the Senate bill in committee and on the floor. I did so \nfor several reasons. It brought a sweeping reform and a consolidation \nof a multiplicity of existing programs that simply were not working \nvery well. It represented a new and innovative Federal-State \npartnership in administering programs that are so very important to the \neducation and training needs of our Nation. And most important to me, \nit contained a series of very strong vocational and adult education \nprovisions.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that is being developed in conference differs \nconsiderably from the one the Senate passed. The concept of a new \nFederal-State partnership that was a key element of the Senate bill is \ngone. The Senate provision that continued support for School To Work \nPrograms appears doomed. A strong within-State formula that sends \nvocational education funds to those districts most in need is \nendangered.\n  Equally important, the need for reform is being lost in a battle for \npolitical gain. The lines of differences are hardening, and there is an \nall-or-nothing attitude beginning to develop on all sides. We have a \nRepublican majority in both Houses of Congress and a Democratic \nadministration. Yet, instead of a good give and take, instead of \ncompromises in which both sides, we are reaching a stalemate that \nliterally ignores the needs of millions of adult and young people who \nneed these education and training services and who could rightfully \ncare less who gets the credit.\n  Mr. President, I deeply regret this situation. I would implore both \nsides to erase the lines that have been drawn in the sand, and get back \nto the table in a serious spirit of bipartisanship. I would urge my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to refrain from anything that \nmight be labeled a ``Republican'' bill. I would urge my fellow \nDemocrats in both the Congress and the administration to refrain from \nan uncompromising insistence on provisions that will ultimately doom \nthis\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\nimportant legislation. I would ask everyone to lay their political \nlabels aside and move ahead with one thing in mind: the need to produce \na good bill that helps Americans who need our help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6657-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, 1996 is fast emerging as one of the most \ncritical years of the post-cold-war period. Earlier this year, Taiwan \nconcluded Presidential elections, taking a firm step toward a pro-\ndemocratic course under China's watchful eye. India and Israel recently \nheld elections that resulted in dramatic shifts of power in both \ncountries. Russia just concluded the first round of balloting in its \nPresidential elections, and a second round is scheduled shortly in \nwhich Russians will face a stark choice between the West-leaning \nYeltsin and the former communist Zyuganov. Later this year, Bosnia is \nscheduled to hold elections as well, the outcome of which may well \ndetermine whether that war-torn, fragmented country will continue to \nexist.\n  As President Clinton said recently, ``we live in a moment of hope.'' \nThe demise of the cold war, the emergence of democratic trends across \nthe globe, advances in telecommunications and the exchange of \ninformation--all of these are helping to create a new international \nenvironment, which will force a realignment in the fundamental \nrelationship between States, and augurs for a more stable and \ncooperative world.\n  As we complete what appears to be a transition period into an era of \nunprecedented opportunity, the world will look to the United States--as \nthe only true remaining superpower--for guidance and moral authority. \nAny President of the United States, of course, immediately plays an \nepic role on the world's stage. But President Clinton seems to be \npaying a more critical role than most.\n  During the past 4 years, the Clinton administration has worked \nassiduously to exert influence over and capitalize on the momentous \nchanges that have occurred. President Clinton's solid record of \nachievement, I would argue, demonstrates beyond all doubt that he has \nthe requisite vision and courage to steer the ship of state into the \nnext century. If you will permit me, I will give a brief tour of the \ninternational horizon to underscore my point.\n  In Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Clinton administration has \nachieved some of its greatest foreign policy successes. Clinton's \nactive engagement in Bosnia--a mine field where Presidents, \npolicymakers, and pundits once feared to tread--has brought a halt to \nthe bloodshed and killing in one of Europe's most destructive and \nintractable conflicts. The presence of U.S. troops--whom early critics \npredicted would be drawn into a fighting war--has proven to be the key \ningredient in setting the stage for the return of stability. In the \nnext several months, the administration looks to be equally engaged in \nensuring that the proper circumstances arise for free and fair \nelections to take place, which would go a long way toward paving the \nway for a U.S. withdrawal and bringing the issue to a close.\n  Russia follows close on Bosnia's heels as a major foreign policy \nsuccess. The recent conclusion of the first round of the Presidential \nelections is a remarkable development in and of itself. For the first \ntime in Russia's history, a Russian leader has endeavored to seek \nreelection, further strengthening prospects for the emergence of a \nRussian democratic culture. And the Clinton administration's policy of \nengaging--without actually endorsing--Yeltsin appears now to have been \nbrilliantly conceived and well implemented.\n  Turning to Asia, one simply cannot neglect China. China is the most \nimportant country in the region, and the United States-China bilateral \nrelationship is one of the most critical in the world. Our relations \nwith China are so complex and multifaceted that it is difficult to do \nthem justice in so brief a discussion. I would only say that in such an \nintricate relationship, there are bound to be successes as well as \nfailures. I, for one, credit the Clinton administration for pursuing a \nbetter trade relationship with China, which can promote cooperation, \nand ultimately progress, in other areas. I think the agreements on \ntrade the administration has achieved so far constitute a good \nfoundation, but the key challenge from here is to ensure that \nagreements are enforced and commitments honored in order for broader \nprogress to come.\n\n  Elsewhere in Asia, the administration's actions with regard to North \nKorea deserve special mention and commendation. It is indeed no small \nmatter that the Clinton administration has, in essence, prevented one \nof the world's most dangerous rogue states from going nuclear. In doing \nso, the administration has set a strong precedent and learned \ninvaluable lessons that it can apply to other aspiring nuclear powers.\n  In the Middle East, the Clinton administration has made a superb \neffort to stabilize the region and broaden international acceptance of \nIsrael. Israel's peace agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians \nrepresent achievements that are, in my view, irreversible. I am sure \nthat the election of a new government in Israel will prompt some \nchanges in the calculus for a comprehensive peace, which ultimately \nshould include Lebanon, Syria, and the Persian Gulf States. But I would \nargue that whatever changes occur are more likely to have an impact on \nthe timing, rather than the inevitability, of normal relations between \nIsrael and the Arab States.\n  In the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration can say with \npride that democratically elected governments exist in every country of \nthe region save one. And the one exception, Cuba, has become the target \nof particularly vigorous sanctions effort, which the administration \nhopes will hasten the fall of the Castro regime and open the way for \nthe transition to democracy. Although I must confess to having opposed \nthe tightening of sanctions, I cannot argue with the administration's \nintent.\n  The administration's effort to restore Haitian President Aristide to \npower represents, of course, a milestone in the hemisphere's transition \nto democracy. In Haiti, much as in Bosnia, this administration \ninherited a seemingly insoluble problem, to which it brought energy, \ncourage, creativity, and ultimately, a resolve to use justifiable \nforce, and thereby achieved its goal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would say a word about Africa, where United \nStates interests have not been so easily defined as they have \nelsewhere, and which consequently has suffered occasionally from a lack \nof attention from Washington. Not so with the Clinton administration, \nwhich has made a real effort to promote stability, encourage the \nemergence of democratic trends, and disburse U.S. assistance \neffectively to promote sustainable development. The obvious high point \nis, of course, the peaceful transfer of power and the domestic election \nof President Mandela in South Africa. But there are equally important--\nif lesser known--success stories such as Botswana, which enjoys a \nfreely elected government and recently graduated altogether from United \nStates assistance.\n  To sum up, each of the highlights that I have touched upon represent \nsignificant achievements in their own right. In and of themselves, they \ncommand respect and recognition of a job well done by the Clinton \nadministration in the foreign policy area. Collectively, they provide \noverwhelming evidence that the administration is up to the challenge of \nleading the United States into the next millennium, which holds promise \nfor tremendous opportunity for our country and its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6658-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6658-S6659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROGRESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish today to emphasize the hope all \nTexans and all Americans have for continued progress in the Middle East \npeace talks as heads of state of Arab countries begin a summit meeting \nin Cairo, Egypt.\n  These leaders are meeting the same week that Prime Minister-elect \nBenjamin Netanyahu presented his new cabinet to the Israeli Knesset for \napproval. Prime Minister-elect Netanyahu has expressed his own support \nfor peace by listing as a guideline of his new Government that ``Israel \nwill work to broaden the circle of peace with all of its neighbors.''\n  Mr. President, the United States must continue to be an important \ninfluence for peace in the Middle East\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\nand throughout the world. President Clinton himself recently stated \nthat he hopes the Arab leaders who attend this summit will ``give Mr. \nNetanyahu an opportunity to constitute his government and set a policy \nand not presume that we can't pursue peace.''\n  Under these circumstances, Mr. President, I know that it is the hope \nof my colleagues here, and people all across America that the \ngovernments attending the summit in Cairo, and governments throughout \nthe Middle East, reaffirm their commitment to a comprehensive peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  I believe, too, that it will be particularly important that these \nleaders express their willingness to work with the democratically \nelected government of Israel to pursue a meaningful peace.\n  Mr. President, through great courage on all sides, we've made \nsignificant strides toward peace. We hope and pray that we continue \ndown that path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6658-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \napply the act to a greater percentage of the U.S. work force and to \nallow employees to take parental involvement leave to participate in or \nattend their children's educational and extracurricular activities and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n     the family medical and parental involvement leave act of 1996\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in my nearly 16 years as a U.S. \nSenator few accomplishments have given me as much pride as the day in \nFebruary 1993 when President Clinton signed into law the Family and \nMedical Leave Act.\n  Passage of this legislation was an exhausting, lengthy, and sometimes \nexasperating process. But in the end, through the hard and courageous \nwork of Senators from both sides of the political aisle, the vast \nopportunities for family and medical leave were made available to \nmillions of Americans.\n  In an era when the American people bemoan the lack of bipartisanship \nand compromise in Washington, when they decry the blatant and nasty \npartnership, the Family and Medical Leave Act stands in sharp contrast.\n  Family and medical leave is an issue that truly goes beyond partisan \npolitical differences. It is something that\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\nevery American, be they Democrat or Republican, can relate to and \nunderstand.\n  Enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993 threw millions \nof struggling Americans a lifeline. It made it easier for people to \nbalance the responsibilities of work with their responsibilities to \ntheir family. And most important, it said to the American people: If \nyou or a loved one becomes ill, you won't be forced to choose between \nyour family and your job.\n  But, my involvement with the issue of family and medical leave did \nnot end with its enactment. There is more work to be done.\n  Across America, working families, teachers, and school boards \ncontinue to lament the lack of parental involvement in their children's \nlives. With more and more families working outside the home, with \nmothers and fathers too busy and too stressed from working long hours, \nchildren are losing the guiding hand they need from their parents.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act performed a genuine need among \nAmerica's working families to allow them take leave in times of medical \nand family emergency. This legislation would continue that process by \nproviding parents with the time they need to make a difference in their \nchildren's education.\n  For that reason, I am today introducing legislation that would build \non our earlier successes while at the same time offering greater leave \nopportunities and flexibility to our Nation's families.\n  First, it would lower the threshold of coverage to include worksites \nwith 25 or more employees. Today, 40 percent of private sector \nemployees remain unprotected by the Family and Medical Leave Act \nbecause their worksite does not meet the current 50-or-more employee \nthreshold.\n  Second, the bill would grant eligible parents 24 hours of unpaid \nleave per year to participate in their children's school or community \ngroup activities. Parents would provide their employers with at least 2 \nweeks notice and could take only 4 hours per month, unless otherwise \nagreed to by the employer.\n  These are commonsense reforms that build on the successes of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act while providing expanded opportunities for \nAmerican families.\n  For those of my colleagues who doubt the success of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, I urge them to examine a recent bipartisan report, \nwhich indicates that the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act is \nclear cut.\n  When this legislation passed in 1933, provisions of the bill \nestablished a commission to examine the impact of the act on workers \nand businesses. The commission's analysis spanned 2\\1/2\\ years, \nincluding independent research and field hearings across the country to \nhear first hand about the act's impact from individuals and businesses.\n  Additionally, through the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we commissioned \ntwo major research surveys to gauge the impact of family leave policies \non employees and employers. These surveys provided us with the first \nstatistically valid, nationally representative data on the impact on \nthe legislation.\n  And, the overall findings of this commission are quite clear--family \nand medical leave is an overwhelming success. What's more, according to \nthe commission's final report, the law represents ``A significant step \nin helping a larger cross-section of working Americans meet their \nmedical and family caregiving needs while still maintaining their jobs \nand economic security.''\n  Due to this legislation, Americans have significantly greater \nopportunities to keep their health benefits, maintain job security, and \ntake leave for longer and for greater reasons.\n  While the American people have seen expanded opportunities under this \nlegislation, there is plenty of good news for America's businesses as \nwell.\n  The conclusions of the bipartisan report are a far cry from the \nconcerns that were voiced when this law was being considered in \nCongress. The vast majority of businesses--over 93 percent--report \nlittle to no additional costs associated with the Family and Medical \nLeave Act. More than 92 percent reported no noticeable effect on \nprofitability. And nearly 96 percent reported no noticeable effect on \ngrowth.\n  Additionally, 83 percent of employers reported no noticeable impact \non employee productivity. And of those that have seen an effect nearly \nas many are as likely to note a positive effect as a negative one. In \nfact, 12.6 percent actually report a positive effect on employee \nproductivity from the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  While the benefits of family leave have been clear, millions of \nAmericans continue to face painful choices involving their competing \nresponsibilities to family and work. Those not covered by FMLA are \nstill often told that they must choose between sick family members and \ntheir jobs. And parents, who want to participate in their children's \nschool and community activities, even to attend parent-teacher \nconferences, find their employment responsibilities are forcing them to \nmake impossible choices.\n  More and more parents are simply too busy to take the time necessary \nto play an active role in their children's education. This comes at a \ntime when not only is a strong education so important to our Nation's \nyouth, but ample evidence indicates that parental involvement in school \nactivities has a dramatic impact on academic performance.\n  Studies have shown that academic achievement is much higher at \nschools when parents are strongly involved. In fact, a recent study by \nthe Department of Education found that parental involvement is a key \nfactor in the development of children's reading skills. And a Carnegie \nCorp. study released this spring found that, ``Parents who want their \nchildren to do well in school must remain involved in their education \nthrough the middle and high school years.''\n  So many parents, however, simply don't have the time to participate \nin school and community activities while balancing responsibilities to \ntheir job. A survey of 30,000 PTA leaders found that 89 percent of \nparents do not get involved in their children's education because they \ndo not have enough time. Yet another study indicates that 66 percent of \nemployed parents report that they don't have enough time for their \nchildren. And as the number of single-parent families, and families \nwhere both parents have to work, continues to rise the constraints \nplaced on parents are only going to increase.\n  The bill that I introduce today represents a genuine and commonsense \neffort to tackle these problems. It would take a giant step toward \nwidening the opportunities provided under the Family and Medical Leave \nAct while giving parents the chance to play a greater role in their \nchildren's education.\n  While I'm fully aware this is an election year, I introduce this \nlegislation with the hope and expectation that we can put aside our \npolitical differences and build on the success of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act.\n  It's common sense that hard working people should not only be able to \nplay a role in their children's lives, but face family crises without \nlosing their jobs.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend certain programs relating to the National Institutes of Health, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  THE NIH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich supports the important work of the National Institutes of Health. \nThis bill, the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of \n1996, will reauthorize the ongoing work of this outstanding Federal \nresearch institution.\n  We all can take great pride in the exceptional contributions that the \nNIH has made to the improvement of the health of our citizens.\n  NIH grants constitute the bulk of support for biomedical research \nthroughout this country--almost $10 billion every year, distributed in \nnearly 25,000 separate grants. This unique investment of talent and \ndollars has one simple, overriding goal--the advancement of the health \nof Americans.\n  This agency is, indeed, an extraordinary success story. To cite just \none illustration: An NIH grant made possible the discovery of the BRCA-\n1 gene, a genetic marker for an important form of breast cancer. Such a \ndiscovery offers great promise for new strategies for diagnosis and \ntreatment of breast cancer and other serious illnesses.\n  As long term commitment to further support of research into the \nmysteries of the human genetic code, this bill authorizes the creation \nof the National Human Genome Research Institute. The elevation of the \nNational Center for Genome Research to institute status, while budget \nneutral, will ensure a continued focus of NIH resources for this \nimportant work.\n  Mr. President, in addition to reauthorizing the lifesaving work of \nthe two largest institutes, the National Cancer Institute and the \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the bill authorizes a number \nof other important institutes and initiatives. Among them is research \ninto new and resistant infections such as tuberculosis; and an Office \nof Rare Diseases to support research on over 2,000 uncommon diseases \nthat, together, afflict thousands of Americans.\n  Another critical area that this bill addresses is the education and \ntraining of the next generation of clinical researchers, the biomedical \nscientists who perform research that directly involves patients. This \nbill provides for greater support for expert training of young \nbiomedical scientists who have elected the difficult, and increasingly \ncompetitive, careers in scientific inquiry. In addition, it provides \nimportant resources for the 75 general clinical research centers that \nexist in academic medical centers throughout the country.\n  The role of NIH in clinical research is critical, since academic \nhealth centers in the 21st century will be posed with an unprecedented \nchallenge: how to maintain their research mission in the face of a \nfundamentally changed health care system. These changes are the \nconsequence of dramatic market shifts that are taking place in health \ncare in this country. They have a potentially deleterious effect on the \nirreplaceable work of this country's academic health centers. Cost \ncompetition has made it particularly difficult for the continuation of \nmany of these established institutions that frequently care for the \nsickest, as well as the poorest, citizens of our communities.\n  This bill also makes substantial efforts to reduce administrative \nexcess and duplicative infrastructure at NIH. It reduces redundant \ncommittees and reports. Every dollar saved from unnecessary \nadministrative burdens is another dollar freed up for support of \nbiomedical research.\n  By its very nature, ever-expanding scientific knowledge places \npressure on the limited resources for biomedical research support. \nAccordingly, this bill provides for a Biomedical Research Trust Fund \nwithin the Treasury. This trust fund is a first small step toward \naffording additional funds for the indispensable research mission in \nthis era of shrinking Federal resources.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, reauthorization of the important work \nof the National Institutes of Health represents for the American people \nan investment beyond compare or valuation. I am pleased to welcome \nSenators Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, and Hatfield as original cosponsors \nof this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of \nthe National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1996.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the NIH Revitalization \nAct of 1996. The National Institutes of Health is the premier health \ncare research center in this country and the world. Reauthorizing a \nstrong NIH should be a bipartisan goal.\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\n  This bill reauthorizes the present Institutes, and provides a \nframework for the NIH to respond more effectively to the health issues \nof today and the future.\n  Clinical research is addressed by incorporating many of the \nprovisions of the Hatfield-Kennedy clinical research enhancement bill. \nGeneral Clinical Research Centers, which serve as an infrastructure for \nclinical research and training, are authorized. Clinical Research \nCareer Enhancement Awards and Innovative Medical Science Awards are \ncreated to support individual careers and research projects in clinical \nresearch. In addition, existing research assistance, training and loan \nrepayment programs are expanded to include those involved in clinical \ninvestigations.\n  The human genome project which has been so productive becomes the \nNational Human Genome Research Institute. The Office of Rare Diseases \nis formally established. A national fund for health research is created \nto provide additional financial resources. A number of other changes \nare made to streamline the administrative processes at NIH.\n  All of us recognize that a number of concerns require further \ndiscussion. NIH's desires for maximum flexibility have been addressed. \nWe must also meet the research and treatment needs of particular \ndiseases. I look forward to working together to find ways to address \nParkinson's disease, the pediatric research initiative, and diabetes.\n  We must also find ways to deal with the impact of managed care on \nmedical training, education, and research. That problem that was the \ntopic of our final NIH hearing this year.\n  Investment in health care research is one of the soundest investments \nwe can make in the Nation's future. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1996 \nis designed to maintain and strengthen our return on this investment, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to secure its enactment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am honored to join my friend and \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, in sponsoring legislation to \nrevitalize the crown jewel of medical science in this country, the \nNational Institutes of Health. Senator Kassebaum deserves the Nation's \ngratitude for her commitment to biomedical research and her efforts to \nensure that the wealth of this country is measured by the health of its \ncitizens.\n  The NIH has enhanced the health of our Nation immeasurably, and \nthrough the efforts of its scientists and staff continues to place us \non the cutting edge of biomedical research. Yet, as all of us in this \nbody know so well, all institutions must evolve if they are to continue \nto thrive. The legislation introduced today provides the elements \nnecessary for the NIH to evolve successfully in the years to come.\n  Every year, medical researchers uncover more mysteries of the human \nbody. Because of their efforts, today we have therapies, drugs and \ntechnologies that were unimaginable just a decade ago. Of great \nimportance to all Americans is the outcome of our investment in \nbiomedical research. We want to know, what has been cured lately? How \nhave the billions we invest in NIH each year reached Americans and \neased their suffering? How has the chasm between the scientist in the \nlaboratory and the physician administering treatment been bridged? To \naddress that gulf, I believe we must heighten our support for \ntranslational--or clinical--research. To that end, I introduced S. 1534 \nthis year, the Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1996. This bill \nwill increase funding for clinical research, improve training for \npersons planning clinical research careers, and modify the focus of the \nNIH to make it more receptive to clinical research proposals.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Kassebaum has included components of \nS. 1534 in her legislation. The bill authorizes the General Clinical \nResearch Centers which are the frontline troops not only in the \ntraining of clinical researchers but in performing many of the clinical \nstudies in our academic medical centers. The 75 current centers have \nnever been authorized despite their continued congressional support \nsince 1965.\n  The bill also establishes two new award programs: the Clinical \nResearch Career Enhancement Awards and the Innovative Medical Science \nAwards. These awards will provide both young and established \ninvestigators with the resources needed to bridge unfunded periods \nwhile promoting continued clinical research and training. At present \ntraining opportunities for persons considering clinical research \ncareers are few and fragmented.\n  The bill also expands loan repayment opportunities for young \nphysician scientists to pursue research careers. Currently the average \nmedical school graduate has a debt of $63,000. This burden has resulted \nin a decline of physician researchers to just 2.2 percent of the \nphysician population of the United States.\n  Last year, Congress acknowledged the importance of biomedical \nresearch when it restored proposed cuts to the NIH budget for 1996. As \na result, we are now enjoying a 5.7-percent increase in funding for the \nNIH. However, we have far to go in stabilizing funding for medical \nresearch, and we must now turn our attention toward insuring \nsustainable growth in the coming years.\n  I am pleased that Senator Kassebaum's legislation also includes my \nbill, S. 1251, to establish a national fund for health research. This \nfund will supplement annual appropriations to the NIH by contributing \npublic and private donations to enhance research grants. While the \nlanguage in this bill does not specify a funding source, I am hopeful \nthat when the bill comes to the floor we will have several options to \nconsider to secure its financial future. I have proposed a 25-cent \nincrease in the tobacco tax, as well as a voluntary Federal income tax \ncheckoff in the past, and would be willing to look at other options in \nthe future such as some sort of managed care set-aside. I believe this \nproposal marks the beginning of a longer-term strategy for biomedical \nresearch funding and I am gratified by its inclusion in this bill. \nSenator Tom Harkin has been my long-time partner in this matter and I \nknow he is as pleased as I am that the foundation for the fund has \ntoday been further advanced.\n  Finally, Senator Kassebaum has included one additional piece of my \nlegislative portfolio, S. 184, a bill to establish an Office for Rare \nDisease Research at the NIH to assist our citizens who have the \nmisfortune of suffering from uncommon diseases. This legislation has \nalready passed the Senate this year, only to languish in the House. I \nam hopeful that this vehicle will carry it through to enactment.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, is essential for the continued \neffective functioning of the National Institutes of Health, and for the \ncontinued health of our citizens. I believe this legislation deserves \nour strong support and I urge my colleagues to endorse its contents. At \nthis time, I would like to publicly commend Senator Kassebaum's staff, \nDavid Stevens, Kent Bradley, and Ann Rufo, for their work in crafting \nthis revitalization package. They have been mentors to my staff and \nhave represented Senator Kassebaum with great dedication and commitment \nin putting this vital piece of legislation together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6662-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6665-S6666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bennett, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 901, a bill to \namend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 \nto authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the \ndesign, planning, and construction of certain water reclamation and \nreuse projects and desalination research and development projects, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1794\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the names of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas], the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] were added as cosponsors of S. 1794, a bill \nto amend chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, to provide for the \nforfeiture of retirement benefits in the case of any Member of \nCongress, congressional employee, or Federal justice or judge who is \nconvicted of an offense relating to official duties of that individual, \nand for the forfeiture of the retirement allowance of the President for \nsuch a conviction.\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 56\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 56, a \njoint resolution disapproving the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to the products of the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6665-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6666-S6667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 268--RELATIVE TO THE SUMMIT OF ARAB HEADS OF STATE \n                          BEING HELD IN CAIRO\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 268\n\n       Whereas, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected to the position of \n     Prime Minister of Israel on May 29, 1996;\n       Whereas, Prime Minister-elect Netanyahu presented his \n     cabinet for approval to the Israeli Knesset on June 18, 1996;\n       Whereas, the guidelines of the new Government of Israel \n     specifically state: ``The Government of Israel will work to \n     broaden the circle of peace with all of its neighbors.'';\n       Whereas, Egyptian President Mubarak has invited heads of \n     state in Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, \n     Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi \n     Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab \n     Emirates, Yemen, and the Palestine Liberation Organization to \n     attend an Arab summit in Cairo beginning on June 21, 1996; \n     and\n       Whereas President Clinton has stated his hope that Arab \n     leaders who attend this summit will ``give Mr. Netanyahu an \n     opportunity to constitute his government and set a policy and \n     not presume that we can't pursue peace.''; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the governments attending \n     the June 21, 1996, summit in Cairo and other governments in \n     the Middle East to--\n       (1) reaffirm their commitment to a comprehensive peace in \n     the Middle East;\n       (2) express their willingness to work with the \n     democratically elected Government of Israel in the pursuit of \n     a meaningful peace; and\n       (3) refrain from statements directed against the new \n     Israeli government that might create an atmosphere in the \n     region unfavorable to a continuation of the peace process.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it had been my expectation that the \nSenate would have already taken up and passed a resolution to express \nthe sense of the Senate about the summit of Arab heads of state, which \nbegan in Cairo today. It is cosponsored by Senators Lieberman and \nBrown.\n  The resolution is straightforward. It urges heads of state and \nrepresentatives of Arab countries attending the Cairo summit and those \nwhich may not attend the summit to reaffirm their commitment to a \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It urges them to express their \nwillingness to work with the democratically elected Government of \nIsrael in the pursuit of a meaningful peace. Finally, it urges them to \nrefrain from statements directed against the new Israeli Government \nthat might create an atmosphere in the region unfavorable to a \ncontinuation of the peace process.\n  The resolution had been cleared by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, all Democratic Senators, the Democratic leadership, and \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. It was poised for approval by full \nSenate. However, at the last minute, the junior Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, objected to the Senate taking up the resolution \nbecause of an entirely unrelated matter. As a result, Mr. President, \nthis resolution on the Middle East was blocked. And that is very \nunfortunate because many of the nations meeting in Cairo are countries \nintent on destroying Israel. Many are avowed enemies of Israel. Apart \nfrom Senator Hutchison's objection--which, again, is over an unrelated \nissue--there appears to be virtually unanimous support in the Senate \nfor my resolution, and the message it sends.\n  Mr. President, on May 29, 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected the \nnew Prime Minister of Israel. Shortly after his election, and before he \nestablished his new government, the Government of Egypt decided to \nconvene a meeting of most members of the Arab League.\n  At the invitation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, heads of state \nfrom 19 Arab countries were invited to meet in Cairo. Representatives \nfrom Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, \nLibya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, \nSyria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization were invited to attend the summit.\n  While I have no objection to meetings by members of the Arab League, \nheads of state and government representatives attending the meeting in \nCairo have nothing to be gained by limiting options for peace \ndiscussions with the newly elected Government of Israel before its \npolicies have even been officially formulated. They have nothing to \ngain by issuing provocative statements and attempting to back the \ndemocratically elected Government into a corner. Restraint--not harsh \nrhetoric directed against the new Israeli Government that might create \nan atmosphere in the region unfavorable to a continuation of the peace \nprocess--should prevail.\n  President Clinton has stated his hope that Arab leaders who attend \nthis summit will give Mr. Netanyahu an opportunity to constitute his \ngovernment and set a policy and not presume that we can't pursue peace. \nThat is sage advice.\n  While the Arab countries may be experiencing some anxiety in light of \nthe change of the Israeli Government, it would be a mistake to let \nextremist countries like the Sudan, Libya, and Syria dominate the \nagenda of this meeting. It would be a mistake to close doors, shut off \noptions, and establish preconditions for the continued pursuit of \npeace.\n  Mr. President, the world will be watching this meeting very carefully \nin the hope that the Arab countries will remain partners with Israel in \nthe pursuit of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The road to a \ncomprehensive peace is never easy, and all must conduct themselves with \ncare and diplomacy to avoid potential misunderstandings.\n  Mr. President, the United States is not prejudging the new Israeli \nGovernment. The Arab leaders meeting in Cairo should not either.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an outstanding editorial \ncalled ``The Arabs and Mr. Netanyahu'' which appeared in the New York \nTimes last week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Arabs and Mr. Netanyahu\n\n       Nineteen Arab leaders plan to meet in Cairo next week for a \n     show of unity in the wake of Benjamin Netanyahu's selection \n     as Prime Minister of Israel. The gather is a reminder that \n     the prospects for peace in the Middle East depend as much on \n     the conduct of Arab leaders as that of Mr. Netanyahu in the \n     weeks ahead.\n       In responding to the new Israeli government, Arab leaders \n     should avoid inflammatory words and actions as Mr. Netanyahu \n     refines his course. No Arab interest would be served by \n     provoking Israel to abandon the peace effort.\n       Most of the Arab leaders headed for Cairo are involved, at \n     one level or another, in the new diplomacy of engagement with \n     Israel initiated by the Bush Administration in the days \n     following the Persian Gulf war. Jordan and the Palestinians \n     have joined Egypt in signing formal peace agreements with \n     Israel. Several other North African and Persian Gulf states \n     have extended limited degrees of diplomatic recognition.\n       No fewer than 15 Arab countries plus the Palestinians \n     regularly meet with Israeli representatives to discuss vital \n     regional issues like water and economic development. Saudi \n     Arabia, while it has regrettably shied away from recognition, \n     has invested its considerable diplomatic and economic weight \n     behind these regional peace efforts.\n       The emerging Arab peace camp, so visible at Yitzhak Rabin's \n     funeral and the antiterrorism summit meeting at Sharm el-\n     Sheik, should not step forward once again to counsel \n     restraint. More belligerent voice, like that of the Libyan \n     leader, Col. Muammar El-Qaddafi, and the militantly Islamic \n     Sudanese regime, will also be present in Cairo. Groups like \n     Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza and \n     the West Bank may try to use terrorism to force Israel to \n     break off the peace talks that these groups have always \n     rejected.\n       Syria rests somewhere between the peace camp and the \n     enemies of peace. With Mr. Netanyahu withdrawing the Israeli \n     offer to return the Golan Heights and suggesting that he is \n     more interested in strengthening relations with Jordan and \n     Egypt than with Syria, the Syrian President, Hafez-al-Assad, \n     is determined to avoid isolation. He hopes the summit meeting \n     with stiffen King Hussein's resolve to resist any Israeli \n     offers of authority over areas of the West Bank or Muslim \n     religious sites in Jerusalem. He also wants Washington to \n     continue serving as an intermediary between Israel and Syria.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n       Egypt would like to reassert its traditional leadership in \n     Arab affairs by bringing together those countries that have \n     already made peace with Israel and those that have not.\n       The Palestinian leadership, for its part, has little choice \n     but to proceed down the diplomatic road on which it has \n     embarked. While Mr. Netanyaghu has said he doubts the \n     finality of Mr. Arafat's break with terrorism, the Israeli \n     leader has no interest in pushing Palestinians into the arms \n     of Mr. Arafat's chief rivals, Hamas and Islamic Holy War.\n       Despite Mr. Netanyahu's promise to expand West Bank \n     settlements, and his opposition to Palestinian statehood, \n     there remains much for Israel and the Palestinians to \n     discuss, including economic and water issues, security and a \n     timetable for Israel's partial withdrawal from Hebron.\n       With Mr. Netanyahu forming a government and Arab leaders \n     regrouping, careless threat or provocative statement from \n     either side could deepen the mutual distrust that already \n     exists. Mr. Netanyahu has spoken with care and diplomacy \n     since his election. The Arab leaders should do no less.\n\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, Senator Lautenberg, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, submits for himself, myself, and Senator Lieberman a \nresolution that deals with the Arab summit that has been called for on \nJune 21. It calls together a number of Presidents and leaders of \ncountries in the Middle East. Presumably, included in their discussions \nwill be the peace process and its progress thus far.\n  That meeting, taking place in Cairo, is an important meeting. The \nresolution that Senator Lautenberg and I and Senator Lieberman have \noffered today expresses concerns about that. I think President Clinton \nexpressed many of our concerns, as well, when he stated his hope ``that \nthe Arab leaders who attend the summit will give Mr. Netanyahu an \nopportunity to constitute his government and set policy and not presume \nthat we cannot pursue peace.''\n  I think that is terribly important. I had hoped this resolution would \nbe considered today and adopted unanimously. Unfortunately, there have \nbeen some problems getting that unanimous-consent process today. I do \nnot believe it relates to the substance of the resolution in any way.\n  Our resolution suggests three things, and I believe all Members of \nthe Senate join in this.\n  One, that the governments in the Middle East should reaffirm their \ncommitment to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, that is vital. If economic and civil rights progress \nis to be made in the Middle East, peace has to be the lubricant that \nbrings it to the forefront.\n  Second, we believe that the Government should express their \nwillingness to work with the democratically elected Government of \nIsrael in the pursuit of meaningful peace.\n  Mr. President, we acknowledge and understand that countries disagree \nover their policies. But the fact is that Israel has a democratically \nelected government. We believe they ought to be respected and given the \nopportunity to work with those other leaders for peace.\n  Third, the resolution calls on Middle Eastern governments to refrain \nfrom statements directed at the new Israeli Government that might \ncreate an atmosphere in the region that is unfavorable to the \ncontinuation of the peace process.\n  Mr. President, it is in everybody's interest to move ahead with peace \nand the peace process. We hope very much that not only the summit that \ntakes place on the 21st, but the activities of all the governments will \nbe to that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6666-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 269--RELATIVE TO AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND \n                REPRESENTATION OF FORMER SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 270\n\n       Whereas the United Nations, recognizing the need for \n     justice in the former Yugoslavia, established the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``International Criminal Tribunal'');\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 of \n     May 25, 1993, requires states to cooperate fully with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal;\n       Whereas the parties to the General Framework Agreement for \n     Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and associated Annexes (in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Peace Agreement'') \n     negotiated in Dayton, Ohio and signed in Paris, France, on \n     December 14, 1995, accepted, in Article IX, the obligation \n     ``to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war \n     crimes and other violations of international humanitarian \n     law'';\n       Whereas the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed \n     to as Annex 4 of the Peace Agreement, provides, in Article \n     IX, that ``No person who is serving a sentence imposed by the \n     International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and no \n     person who is under indictment by the Tribunal and who has \n     failed to comply with an order to appear before the Tribunal, \n     may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or \n     other public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina'';\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal has issued 57 \n     indictments against individuals from all parties to the \n     conflicts in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal continues to \n     investigate gross violations of international law in the \n     former Yugoslavia with a view to further indictments against \n     the perpetrators;\n       Whereas on July 25, 1995, the International Criminal \n     Tribunal issued an indictment for Radovan Karadzic, president \n     of the Bosnian Serb administration of Pale, and Ratko Mladic, \n     commander of the Bosnian Serb administration and charged them \n     with genocide and crimes against humanity, violations of the \n     law or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949, arising from atrocities perpetrated \n     against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in \n     Sarajevo, and for the taking of United Nations peacekeepers \n     as hostages and for their use as human shields;\n       Whereas on November 16, 1995, Karadzic and Mladic were \n     indicted a second time by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal, charged with genocide for the killing of up to \n     6,000 Muslims in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in July 1995;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in adopting \n     Resolution 1022 on November 22, 1995, decided that economic \n     sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) and the so-called Republika Srpska would be \n     reimposed if, at any time, the High Representative or the \n     IFOR commander informs the Security Council that the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serb authorities are \n     failing significantly to meet their obligations under the \n     Peace Agreement;\n       Whereas the so-called Republika Srpska and the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have failed to \n     arrest and turn over for prosecution indicted war criminals, \n     including Karadzic and Mladic;\n       Whereas efforts to politically isolate Karadzic and Mladic \n     have failed thus far and would in any case be insufficient to \n     comply with the Peace Agreement and bring peace with justice \n     to Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas in the so-called Republika Srpska freedom of the \n     press and freedom of assembly are severely limited and \n     violence against ethnic and religious minorities and \n     opposition figures is on the rise;\n       Whereas it will be difficult for national elections in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina to take\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n     place meaningfully so long as key war criminals, including \n     Karadzic and Mladic, remain at large and able to influence \n     political and military developments;\n       Whereas on June 6, 1996, the President of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal, declaring that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia's failure to extradite indicted war criminals is a \n     blatant violation of the Peace Agreement and of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions, called on the High \n     Representative to reimpose economic sanctions on the so-\n     called Republika Srpska and on the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro);

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do rise today on a serious matter. \nThat is to submit, along with several colleagues, a resolution which we \nhope will advance the twin causes of peace and justice in the former \nYugoslavia. I am very proud to be joined in introducing this resolution \nby a bipartisan group of colleagues, Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, \nSenator Specter, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Moynihan.\n  Unfortunately, because of the ups and downs of Senate scheduling, I \ndo not think that any of these distinguished colleagues are able to be \nhere today to join me to speak on this resolution, though Senator Biden \ndid address the subject generally and mentioned the imminence of this \nresolution when he spoke on the floor on Wednesday. I hope my \ncolleagues will have the opportunity to speak to the resolution in the \ndays and weeks ahead.\n  Last October President Clinton honored us in Connecticut by speaking \nat the University of Connecticut, at the opening of the Thomas J. Dodd \nLibrary and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials \nthat followed World War II. At that time, last October, while war still \nraged in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia, President Clinton spoke \nthese very eloquent words. ``Some people,'' he said, ``are concerned \nthat pursuing peace in Bosnia and prosecuting war criminals are \nincompatible goals. But I believe,'' President Clinton said, ``they are \nwrong. There must be peace for justice to prevail, but there must be \njustice when peace prevails.''\n  I could not agree more. A very powerful principle stated very \neloquently by President Clinton.\n  Later last year, a few months later, the United States, led by former \nAssistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, in an extraordinary act \nof diplomacy, following the force that the United States operation had \napplied to the forces on the ground, particularly the aggressive forces \nin Bosnia, the parties to the conflict were brought together in Dayton, \nOH.\n  The peace agreement for Bosnia resulting from those talks in Dayton \nwas signed in Paris just about 6 months ago. There followed the \ndeployment of the NATO-led Implementation Force, or IFOR, including \nwithin it 20,000 of America's finest soldiers. The work of IFOR has \nbeen a clear success in ending the war, in separating the forces, and \nin monitoring the actual withdrawal of the previous combatant forces to \nwithin agreed areas under the Dayton peace agreement.\n  But, Mr. President, unfortunately the process of rebuilding Bosnia as \na unified, multiethnic state has been much slower and much more \ndifficult. I suppose that should not be shocking when one considers the \nscars of war, the way in which the war took a country that had become \nin so many parts of it so magnificently multiethnic and brought out and \nraised to the surface historic ethnic antagonisms that had previously \nexisted.\n  But even in that effort toward recreating Bosnia, progress has been \nmade. Yet many, understandably, have called for the elections that are \nplanned, pursuant to the Dayton agreement, for September 14 to be \ndelayed because the conditions do not yet exist for them to be free and \nfair. War criminals are still in power, refugees and displaced persons \nare unable to return to their homes, and freedom of movement is still \nseverely limited by the nationalistic barriers that have been created \nin one community or another within Bosnia.\n  But I believe strongly that our focus should not be on when the \nelections should take place. Rather we, together with the majority of \npeople in Bosnia and in the international community who favor peace and \nreconciliation, must redouble our efforts to create the right \nconditions for the elections to go forward as scheduled.\n  Mr. President, to do so, to rebuild that peace and reconciliation \nthat I am convinced the overwhelming majority of Bosnians long for so \ndeeply, we must deal with the problem of indicted war criminals, \nparticularly Karadzic and Mladic, former President and military chief \nof the Bosnian Serb aggressors.\n  These two, as is well known, remain at large. They are able to \ninfluence political and military developments. As the President said so \nwell in the statement that I quoted, there can be no peace without \njustice in the long term. To secure that peace the time has come for \nthis body to restate that the apprehension of these indicted war \ncriminals must be an urgent priority. It is time for concerted action \nto bring these indicted war criminals to justice.\n\n  So the resolution we are introducing today is really quite direct and \nsimple. It restates the clear obligation under the Dayton peace \nagreement and U.N. Security Council resolutions of all the parties in \nthe former Yugoslavia, including in particular both the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, with its capital in Belgrade, and the Bosnian \nSerb entity called Republika Srpska, to cooperate with the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal.\n  Mr. President, the most urgent element of that requirement is that \nthe indicted war criminals, particularly Karadzic and Mladic, must be \ndetained and brought to justice. That must be reaffirmed and remain an \nurgent priority, in the words of the resolution we have introduced. To \ndo that, the resolution calls for four separate actions.\n  First, it finds and urges that the International Criminal Tribunal, \nthe war crimes tribunal, merits continued and increased American \nsupport to do its work. The tribunal faces daunting challenges in \ncollecting and analyzing evidence to ascertain exactly what crimes were \ncommitted and by whom. But if this work is not done, the peace that is \nenjoyed in Bosnia will forever be a hollow peace and in fact it will \nnot be a lasting peace.\n  Second, the resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nPresident should support the request of the President of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal, the war crimes tribunal, for \nreimposition of economic sanctions on the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia with its capital in Belgrade and on the Bosnian Serbs for \ntheir clear failure to carry out the responsibilities they accepted in \nsigning the Dayton peace agreement, which is to say, their failure to \ncooperate with the tribunal in the apprehension and the bringing to \njustice of these indicted war criminals.\n  There are many flagrant pieces of evidence of this. Some months ago \nthere were television pictures of General Mladic in a parka skiing as \nif he was some American on a weekend jaunt in the winter to northern \nNew England, in my part of the country, or perhaps Colorado or Utah or \nother\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nparts of the country. An indicted war criminal, a man with blood on his \nhands, specifically indicted for being the leader involved in the \nslaughter of at least 6,000 people--6,000 people--in Srebrenica after \nthe fall of that undefended city, allegedly a safe haven in Bosnia.\n  Most recently, of course, Karadzic has been seen repeatedly walking \naround, seemingly free, in the Republika Srpska. General Mladic \nrecently carried out the responsibility of attending a funeral in \nBelgrade--quite publicly. Authorities clearly knew he was coming, and \nhe was not arrested.\n\n  I think it is clear that the Serbian authorities, in this case, \nparticularly President Milosevic, have failed to act. That failure to \nact is clear, and it is inexcusable.\n  The High Representative, Carl Bildt, overseeing so much of the \ncivilian reconstruction effort, has the clear authority to reimpose \nsanctions if the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serbs, \nare failing significantly--that is the term used--to meet their \nobligations under the peace agreement.\n  There can be no doubt that the continued leadership roles of \nKaradzic, Mladic, and others are a significant violation of the Dayton \nagreement. Mr. President, this resolution calls for reimposition of \nfull economic sanctions, which we believe is long overdue.\n  Third, the resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nNATO-led implementation force, or IFOR, in carrying out its mandate, \nshould make it an urgent priority to detain and bring to justice \npersons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal. I know that \nsome will be concerned that this call for IFOR action to arrest war \ncriminals could lead to a situation similar to the hunt for Aideed in \nSomalia, which had tragic consequences. That, Mr. President, I assure \nmy colleagues, is not the intention of those of us who have sponsored \nthe resolution. The resolution is drawn with real clarity and concern \nto make sure that is the case. The detention of war criminals, in fact, \nhas always been part of the IFOR mandate. The IFOR's authority to \narrest war criminals has never been in doubt. But the kind of house-to-\nhouse search carried out in Somalia is not called for by this \nresolution.\n  In fact, from what I have heard Secretary Perry and General \nShalikashvili say, IFOR is already mandated and, in fact, is doing just \nwhat it should be: patrolling more widely and aggressively to restrict \nthe freedom of movement of war criminals, as well as to improve the \nfreedom of movement of ordinary, peaceful citizens. If an IFOR patrol \nencounters Karadzic or Mladic or any other indicted war criminal, IFOR \npersonnel should bring to bear the necessary resources to effectively \ndetain those war criminals and to bring them to justice.\n  We did not want to go into this level of detail in this resolution \nbecause, frankly, we do not believe the Senate should be expressing \nsuch detailed directions about on-the-ground military operations. The \nintention of this resolution is to make clear that an agreed upon \naspect of the IFOR mission--to detain war criminals and bring them to \njustice--must remain an urgent priority and must be carried out \neffectively.\n  Mr. President, the reason this function is so critical, so central, \nto the IFOR mission is that otherwise all the extraordinarily \ncourageous and effective work done by this 60,000-person force, 20,000 \nof whom are Americans, all the work they have done to separate the \nparties, to move them back into agreed upon areas, to create the \ncontext for peace, will all be for naught. All the effort, all the \nmoney spent, in my opinion, will all be worth nothing and have no \nlasting affect unless these war criminals are apprehended, because so \nlong as they are free, their freedom makes a mockery of the Dayton \nagreement. It is an insult, a wound, to those hundreds of thousands of \npeople who lost relatives or who were forcibly removed from their homes \nduring the war.\n  The fact is that so long as people like Karadzic and Mladic, indicted \nwar criminals, remain free, peace will not take hold in the former \nYugoslavia. That is why we are restating, as this resolution does, that \nthe apprehension, the detention, and bringing to justice of these war \ncriminals must remain an urgent priority as part of the IFOR mission in \nthe former Yugoslavia.\n  Fourth, finally, recognizing that the lack of full cooperation on war \ncrimes goes beyond the so-called Republika Srpska, the resolution calls \nfor all States in the former Yugoslavia--this involves people on all \nsides ethnically--to be denied membership and participation in \ninternational organizations until and unless they are operating fully \nwith the tribunal.\n\n  Mr. President, as we have found over the course of the conflict in \nthe former Yugoslavia, which threatened to grow wider and threaten \nstability more broadly in Europe, if the sound of the trumpet--if I may \nparaphrase the Bible--is uncertain, who will follow into battle? If the \nsound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will hear what is behind the \ntrumpet?\n  If we allow these outrageous, provocative acts by indicted war \nfigures roaming free to go unresponded to, they will act more \noutrageously. The latest proof of this is in the newspaper this \nmorning. Page A-30 of the Washington Post carries a Reuters story from \nBelgrade: ``A local board of the Serb Democratic Party nominated \nRadovan Karadzic today as candidate for president of the Bosnian Serb \nRepublic in elections to be held later this year, Serb media \nreported.''\n  Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the outrage here? This is as \nif, at the end of World War II, someone in one of the countries that \nthe allies defeated nominated a leader in that country who had fought \nthe war against us to be a leader of the postwar country. Can you \nimagine the reaction in the United States of America if that had \nhappened?\n  Here these people are nominating Karadzic, in direct and outrageous \nviolation of the Dayton agreement, to run for President. This is \nspecifically prohibited by the Dayton agreement, but reminds us that \nunless we continue to keep the apprehension of these criminals as an \nurgent priority, unless we begin to tighten the screws again by \nreimposing economic sanctions on Belgrade and tightening the area of \nmobility that these war criminals have enjoyed in the past, as I am \nencouraged to believe we are now doing, this whole effort will have \nbeen for naught.\n  This resolution, my cosponsors and I believe, gives the Senate an \nopportunity to make clear the importance we place on the full and \nsuccessful completion of the IFOR mission, which is to say to remove \nthe conditions that will bring about clearly a return of war and \ngenocide and the absence of peace with true justice in Bosnia.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues who joined me in \ncosponsoring this resolution. I hope that other colleagues of both \nparties--there is nothing partisan about this at all--will take a look \nat the resolution and decide to cosponsor and join us as supporters.\n  Mr. President, I do also want to offer personal thanks to Frederic \nBaron who is working in my office as a fellow on loan from the State \nDepartment, who really represents a quality of service, as I have seen \nin my office, the highest standards of intellect and of principle that \ncharacterizes the American Foreign Service. I thank Frederic for the \nrole he played in assisting me in putting this resolution together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6667-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6669-S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, on Sunday, June 9, as part of \nTennessee's year-long bicentennial celebration, I traveled to \nKingsport, TN, to deliver remarks at the dedication of the Pence \nReception Center and Gift Shop, a part of Netherland Inn complex. I ask \nthat my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n Dedication of the Pence Reception Center and Gift Shop, Kingsport, TN\n\n       It's always great to be home in Tennessee, but it's even \n     more wonderful when being here gives me the opportunity to \n     help celebrate Tennessee history, and pay tribute to \n     Tennessee volunteers. And what could be more appropriate--in \n     this place that was once a favorite stop on the Old Great \n     Stage Road from Washington City to Nashboro--than that I \n     should also travel from Washington to be here with you today.\n       Two hundred years ago, our pioneer forefathers banded \n     together to forge a new future for the Southwest Territory. \n     Like the path to the West, the road to Statehood was replete \n     with obstacles--from land disputes with North Carolina to \n     Party disputes that held the territory's Statehood petition \n     hostage to Presidential politics. But the spirit of \n     Tennessee's founding fathers prevailed, and on June 1, 1796 \n     Tennessee became the 16th state in the Union.\n       One hundred years ago, our Centennial celebration \n     highlighted that pioneer spirit for Tennesseans--and for all \n     the world. Today, with ongoing Bicentennial celebrations like \n     this one in every city and county, that legacy is being \n     carried forth--not just to another generation and into \n     another century, but into the next millennium! What a proud \n     heritage to pass along.\n       Over the past 100 years, we've watched this area change \n     from one that was almost entirely agricultural to one with \n     modern cities and industrial development. But the Tennesseans \n     who live here have retained their roots in the land, just as \n     the neighborhoods in which they live still retain much of the \n     charm of early America.\n       Another thing that has not--and will not--change is our \n     volunteer spirit. Ever since that day in 1848, when Governor \n     Brown called for 3,000 volunteers to help win the war with \n     Mexico and 30,000 charged to the fight, our reputation as \n     ``The Volunteer State'' has gone unchallenged.\n       Nothing better exemplifies that spirit than this cabin \n     which we dedicate today. Like the entire Netherland Inn \n     complex, it is rich with stories of selflessness and \n     volunteerism--from the foresight of Joe Wimberly, who first \n     proposed the idea of making the Pence cabin part of the \n     Netherland Inn complex, to the generosity of the Carl Brauns \n     who donated it, to the tireless efforts of the entire crew of \n     the Bent Nail Construction Company--and countless others--who \n     helped make this project possible, especially Mr. Ben Brown.\n       For thirty years, Ben Brown has been a tireless advocate \n     for the Netherland Inn, and this project is but one example \n     of his dedicated support. As Karyn and I--and I'm sure many \n     others--have discovered, once Ben makes a commitment to \n     someone or some project, that support never waivers. We could \n     not have a better friend, nor Kingsport a better community \n     leader, than Ben Brown.\n       As a result of all your efforts, the Pence cabin will now \n     be preserved forever, not only as a part of Tennessee \n     history, but as a monument to Tennessee's volunteer spirit.\n       This year, when so much history is being made in \n     Washington, when we are struggling to restore our Nation to \n     the kind of land envisioned by our Founding Fathers--a land \n     where taxes are low and government is limited, where states \n     have rights, and people have power--I can't help but \n     appreciate even more the rich history of our State and the \n     contributions it has made to our national heritage.\n       Think about it--right here in this place three Presidents \n     of the United States stopped frequently on their trips to and \n     from Washington--Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, and James K. \n     Polk.\n       And on a personal note, as a native Nashvillian, I am \n     personally indebted to Col. John Donelson because if he \n     hadn't taken his flotilla of flatboats from Kingsport to Big \n     Salt Lick, my home town of Nashville might never have been \n     founded--and who knows where I would have been born!\n       Tennessee has a proud history to look back on. But let's \n     not forget that we also have a bright future before us. The \n     volunteers of Tennessee are no longer living on the frontier, \n     but their pioneering minds and spirits continue to drive them \n     toward success. When our descendants celebrate the next \n     hundred years of Tennessee history, I know that they will be \n     just as proud of their ancestors as we are of ours today.\n       Thank you all for coming. God bless you, and God bless the \n     great State of Tennessee!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6669-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MARTINEZ-GARCIA-NERIO-REYES AMERICAN LEGION POST 500\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on June 29, 1996, American Legion \nPost 500 will celebrate its 50th anniversary. In November 1945, after \nreturning from service in World War II, Mexican-American veterans in \nthe Saginaw area began meeting to exchange stories of their experiences \nduring combat. These veterans decided to organize and were later \nrecognized as the Latin American Club for Veterans.\n  Many Mexican-Americans came to Michigan during the 1920's to work in \nthe fields, on the railroads, and at the auto plants. These migrants \nexperienced many difficulties arising from cultural differences and \ntheir inexperience with the English language. After the war, Mexican-\nAmericans in the Saginaw area continued to experience prejudice and \ndiscrimination. The members of the Latin American Club for Veterans \nfelt it was important to have a stronger voice in Saginaw to serve the \nMexican-American community. Therefore, they decided to apply for a \nchapter charter in the American Legion.\n  On April 20, 1946, Latin American Legion Post 500 was chartered. It \nwas later decided to rename the post after the first four Mexican-\nAmericans killed in World War II. The names of Louis Martinez, Julian \nGarcia, Sifred Nerio, and John Reyes live on today at American Legion \nPost 500. Since its inception, over 1,000 veterans serving in World War \nII, Korea, Vietnam, and Desert Storm have been members of the post.\n  In addition to assisting veterans, the post has been involved in \nhelping the community. The post supports sports teams, donates food to \nthe needy, and sponsors a program where boys travel to Lansing for a \nweek to learn how our State capitol works. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in hon- \noring the Martinez-Garcia-Nerio-Reyes American Legion Post 500 on its \n50th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6670-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6670-S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALUTE TO IOWA GIRLS' BASKETBALL\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every year in March, the State of \nIowa comes to a virtual halt. Streets are quiet, schools are dismissed, \nand small towns are all but deserted. It is not some end-of-winter \nblizzard that clears the streets and shuts down communities. It is the \nannual pilgrimage to Veterans' Auditorium in Des Moines for the Girls' \nState Basketball Tournament.\n  Some States have a such strong tradition in high school athletics \nthat certain sports become part of the State's identity. Like boys' \nbasketball in Indiana and football in Texas, girls' basketball has been \na key factor in shaping the identity of Iowa. The enthusiasm with which \nIowans follow their girls' high school basketball teams is a testament \nto Iowa's competitive and community spirits.\n  Iowa was a pioneer in the growth of girls' basketball. Today's \nplayers owe a great deal to those early players and teams for the \nsurvival and development of the girls' game. Iowa girls started playing \nbasketball in 1893, just 18 months after Dr. James Naismith created the \ngame. Girls' basketball gained rapid approval from Iowans. By the turn \nof the century, basketball was the most popular sport for girls in \nIowa. The sport was played indoors and outdoors, in church basements \nand on empty cattle pastures, wherever there was room to fit two \nbasketball goals.\n  The popularity of girls' basketball in Iowa may have helped save the \nsport from extinction. In the 1920's, women and girls were discouraged \nfrom playing competitive sports because it was seen as too strenuous \nand unladylike. Girls' basketball virtually vanished from the rest of \nthe country. But Iowans took great pride in the success of their girls' \nbasketball teams. Communities banded together to support girls' \nbasketball, and the sport remained as popular as ever in Iowa. In the \n1970's and 1980's, Iowa's basketball success was used as a model for \nother States in expanding sports opportunities for girls.\n  Iowa's State tournament was first staged in 1920. It is the oldest \ncontinuously held girls' basketball championship in the United States. \nThe State tournament has consistently been played before capacity \ncrowds, drawing fans from all corners of Iowa. The tournament has \ndeveloped a national and even international following. News media from \nacross the State and around the country gather in Des\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nMoines to cover the girls' tournament. In 1990, the tournament even \nattracted a film crew from Japan. The television contract for the Iowa \ngirls' basketball tournament is the largest for any girls' or boys' \nhigh school sport in America.\n  From 1920 through 1984, Iowa high school girls exclusively played the \nsix-on-six version of basketball. The six-on-six girls' game was such \nan important part of Iowa culture that national newspapers, television \nstations, and magazines rushed to Iowa in 1993 to cover the final six-\non-six tournament. Iowa girls now play the common five-on-five style of \nbasketball, and Iowans still flock to see their daughters and sisters \ncompete annually for the State championship.\n  Whether they were trained in the five-on-five or six-on-six game, \nIowans have had a national impact on girls' basketball. This success \nhas continued beyond the high school level. Since 1935, more than 100 \nIowans have been named to the Amateur Athletic Union or Collegiate All-\nAmerican women's basketball teams. Some of the country's most notable \ngirls' and women's basketball players have come from Iowa. Denise Long \nof Union-Whitten High School set the national high school scoring \nrecord in 1969 with more than 6,000 career points. Lynne Lorenzen of \nVentura broke that same record in 1987 by scoring over 6,700 points. At \nthe college level, Molly Goodenbauer of Waterloo led Stanford \nUniversity to the 1992 national championship, and was chosen Most \nOutstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament. And Karen Jennings of Neola \nTri-Center High School was named National Player of the Year at the \nUniversity of Nebraska in 1993.\n  Girls' basketball has been a source of community pride and honor in \nIowa for more than 100 years, from small towns like Mediapolis and \nAuburn, to the cities of Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. The sport has \nbecome an expression of Iowa's qualities of competitiveness, teamwork, \nand determination. But above all else, girls' basketball has allowed \nthe State to showcase one of its most precious resources--the young \nwomen of Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY VETERINARY CORPS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nU.S. Army Veterinary Corps on the occasion of its 80th anniversary.\n  Established on June 3, 1916, the Veterinary Corps has distinguished \nitself through exemplary service in two world wars, the Korean and \nVietnam conflicts, Operation Desert Storm, and, most recently, in the \npeacekeeping operation in Bosnia. The responsibilities of the \nVeterinary Corps have evolved from that of equine medicine for the \ncavalry of 1916 to diverse roles encompassing not only the traditional \nrole of animal medicine but also food hygiene and quality assurance, \nprevention of diseases transmissible between animals and man, and \nmedical research and development.\n  The professional excellence of the 396 officers serving in the \nVeterinary Corps is exemplified by the fact that 186--47 percent--of \nthese officers are board certified in at least one specialty recognized \nby the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n  As the Department of Defense Executive Agent for Veterinary Services, \nthe U.S. Army Veterinary Corps is responsible for providing its \nexpertise to all of the military services on a worldwide basis. Through \nthe assurance of a safe and wholesome food supply, animal disease \nprevention and control, animal-facilitated therapy for hospitalized \nservice members and families, and medical and subsistence research and \nmaterial development, the contributions of veterinarians as health care \nproviders are essential to the well-being of the soldier, sailor, \nairman, and marine. It is indeed a pleasure for me to salute the U.S. \nArmy Veterinary Corps in recognition of its innumerable contributions \nto our national defense, and to extend my congratulations to the \nmembers of the Veterinary Corps, past and present, upon this 80th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6671-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STANLEY O. BROWN\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto Mr. Stanley O. Brown. It is a great pleasure to recognize Mr. \nStanley O. Brown for his 36 years of loyal service to the Missouri \nLeague of Savings Institute and its members.\n  Mr. Brown joined the Missouri League of Savings Institute in \nJefferson City, MO, on February 1, 1960. Since then his dedication and \nconstructive counsel to the State's savings and loan industry have made \nan invaluable impact on the State of Missouri and our Nation's banking \ninstitutions. His inestimable contributions and respected professional \nexperience will be sorely missed when he retires from his position as \nvice chairman of Missouri League of Savings Institute on June 30, 1996.\n  Prior to his vice chairmanship of the Missouri League of Savings \nInstitutions, Mr. Brown served as president of the Staff Leadership \nConference and was a member of both the Missouri League's Legislative \nCommittee and the Missouri League's Insurance Trust Committee.\n  It is an honor to congratulate Mr. Stanley Brown on his long-lasting \ncommitment to the Missouri League of Savings Institutions and to the \nState of Missouri. I wish him the best of luck in all his future \nendeavors and continued good health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6671-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6671-S6672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BIPARTISAN WELFARE REFORM\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a couple of days ago the Mason City \nGlobe-Gazette in my State of Iowa published an excellent editorial \ncalling on national policymakers to put partisan politics aside in \norder to pass bipartisan welfare reform. I couldn't agree more.\n  Over the past 3 years I have talked time and time again about the \nneed to enact bipartisan welfare reform which demands responsibility \nfrom day one, requires work and releases welfare families from the \ncycle of dependency. The Iowa family investment program provides us \nwith an effective model for achieving these goals. Since Iowa began \nimplementing the welfare reforms in October 1993, the number of people \nworking has almost doubled, the welfare caseload had declined, and \nwelfare costs are down. I call that a triple play.\n  Those are good reasons to look at the Iowa experience as we craft \nlegislation, but I commend the Iowa experience to my colleagues for \nanother reason. In 1993, Iowa enacted sweeping changes to the welfare \nsystem and did so with very strong bipartisan support. In fact, the \nIowa plan received only 1 dissenting vote from the 150-member \nDemocratically controlled general assembly and was signed into law by \nour Republican Governor. It shows that it is possible to work together \non welfare reform and the State of Iowa is better because of it.\n  In 1994 I sought to take a page from the Iowa play book and went to \nwork with my Republican colleague from Missouri, Senator Kit Bond to \ndevelop bipartisan welfare reform legislation modeled on innovations \noccurring in our respective States. The result was the first bipartisan \nwelfare reform legislation in that session of Congress. The bill was \nreintroduced again last year.\n  For the most part partisan wrangling prevailed in 1995. There were a \nfew instances of bipartisan cooperation, but they were quickly \novertaken by political gamesmanship.\n  There is one lesson to be learned from the past year and half--\nconfrontation and partisanship is a prescription for failure. The only \nway we can truly accomplish welfare reform this year is to stop the \npolitical games and join forces across the aisle to craft bipartisan \nwelfare reform which accomplishes the goals that the American people \nsupport--a welfare system that puts people to work and gets them off \npublic assistance quickly and permanently.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the editorial be printed in the \nRecord, and urge my colleagues to hear its message.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n        [From the Mason City (IA) Globe-Gazette, June 18, 1996]\n\n       Reforming Welfare and Partisan Politics Should be Separate\n\n       It's true that in many cases, public opinion changes faster \n     than the politicians.\n       That's certainly the case with welfare reform, according to \n     a recent Associated Press poll.\n       The poll shows that most Americans favor converting welfare \n     into a work program and that half are ready to pay more taxes \n     to make jobs available.\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n       The poll also shows that most Americans wish to limit \n     welfare funds to single mothers, and to put single mothers on \n     a work plan.\n       Those types of plans are being tested in several states, \n     including Iowa and Wisconsin. The reform agenda is clogged, \n     however, in the Washington political system.\n       A welfare system that puts people back to work, and aims to \n     get them off welfare is a good idea. The only exception that \n     should be added is that the system include some compassion.\n       One of the reasons welfare reform hasn't taken off in \n     Washington has to do with political posturing.\n       Both Democrats and Republicans are turning the debate into \n     a class issue. That's not where the issue belongs.\n       For example, both Democrats and Republicans make a major \n     issue out of single mothers. Truthfully, however, single \n     mothers make up only a small percentage of the welfare \n     recipients.\n       Both sides also talk about welfare recipients as if they \n     spend their lives on the dole. The truth, however, is that \n     most welfare recipients move in and out of the system. A \n     small percentage spend an extended amount of time on welfare.\n       A welfare reform plan that includes work or schooling \n     instead of hand-outs is a good idea. Limiting welfare \n     recipients to two years of benefits is also an improvement.\n       Both Democrats and Republicans have said they would support \n     plans similar to those currently in use here and in \n     Wisconsin.\n       But nothing will really happen until highly partisan \n     politics are removed from the picture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/21/senate-section/article/S6671-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1219\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
