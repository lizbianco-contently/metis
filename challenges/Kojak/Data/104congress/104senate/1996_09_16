Any votes ordered \non amendments today will occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Under \na previous consent agreement, Senator Bumpers will be recognized at 3 \no'clock today in order to offer and debate his grazing fees amendment. \nIt is the majority leader's hope that once Senator Bumpers offers that \namendment, we will be able to reach a reasonable time limitation for \ndebate so that we may move on to other outstanding issues on the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  Again, the majority leader asks for the cooperation of all colleagues \nas we continue to dispose of the remaining appropriations bills and \nhopes that Members will refrain from offering nongermane amendments \nthat will only continue to delay passage of these spending measures as \nwe approach the end of the fiscal year. We are also attempting to reach \nan agreement for consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill that \nwould enable us to finish that legislation in a reasonable timeframe. \nThere are also a number of other legislative matters we hope to \nconsider prior to the Senate adjournment, including the Magnuson Act. \nAnd with the help of all Senators, we can reach time agreements to \nfinish all these matters.\n  Finally, I would remind all Senators that the majority leader expects \nbusy sessions for the remaining weeks, and Senators should plan their \nschedules accordingly. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to \nfinish our Senate business on time if Members request no votes every \nevening because of other commitments. I thank all of my colleagues in \nadvance for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10569-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are going to move, later today and \ntomorrow, to the Department of Interior appropriations bill which is \nvery important to me and to my State of Wyoming. I wanted to talk just \na couple of moments about something that is very important to me and \nvery close to my heart. That is the National Park System.\n  Wyoming, of course, has two of what I think are the crown jewels of \nthe Park System, the Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park, \nas well as several others in our State. Selfishly, they are very \nimportant. But more than that, national parks are, I think, a part of \nour heritage. They are part of our past, they are part of our future, \nthey are part of our economy, and something that I feel very strongly \nabout. Of course, they are funded in the appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Interior.\n  I spent a considerable amount of time in August in the parks, both \nYellowstone and Teton. Part of the problem we talked about while I was \nthere is a financial one. It is big business. Yellowstone National Park \nhas an operating budget of somewhere over $20 million, and with other \nincome, more than a $40 million budget. It is a large activity.\n  We will be talking in this appropriations bill about priorities. Mr. \nPresident, over time, the idea of priorities, the idea of funding, will \nbecome even more difficult. We will have to set those priorities. We \nwill have to set priorities among land management agencies, Yellowstone \nPark and the Park System, the forest and the wilderness, the Fish and \nWildlife Service and the BLM. All of these competed, frankly, for \nfunding. So we have to talk about priorities.\n  Certainly my highest priority in that process is the National Park \nSystem. Part of it is my own personal history. I grew up just outside \nof Yellowstone Park between Cody and Yellowstone. So it has been part \nof my life.\n  The question, of course, is how we manage these parks. Frankly, we \nhave some problems.\n  We have some problems short term and we have some problems, in my \njudgment, long term. A part of the short-term problem, of course, we \nwill be facing today and tomorrow. But part of the longer term issues, \nI think, will be discussed over a period of time, and properly so, \nbecause there needs to be some fairly significant changes. \nSpecifically, there is funding for Park Service operations, and in the \nSenate bill is $1.1 billion. The House is somewhat less than that. This \nwill be about a $75 million increase over last year for the operations \nof the park. I support that. I hope that we maintain, when the bill is \nfinally passed, the additional funds that the Senate has put in. This \nis a good first step to deal with some of the problems that we have. \nBut it is a short term solution.\n  What are some of the other solutions? One of them is what was done \nlast year in this appropriations bill, and done again this year, in \nterms of extending a pilot fee program. One of the ways that, \nobviously, we can deal with funding for parks is to do something about \nthe fees. Yellowstone Park, I believe, is $10 per car per week. \nCompared to other recreational activities in this country, that is a \nvery low price, one that has not been changed for a very long time, and \none that we ought to take a look at.\n  We have an opportunity to do that now in the pilot fee program that \nwas passed by the Congress, which allows the parks to take a look at \ntheir fees, to temporarily extend and increase these fees, if they want \nto, on a pilot basis, and to keep in the park some 80 percent of the \nincrease. This has been one of the problems for parks like Yellowstone. \nMuch of the revenue that comes in there doesn't stay there. It goes \ninto the pot and is redistributed among all of the parks. So this gives \nan opportunity, on a pilot basis, to raise the fees, if that seems \nappropriate, and then to maintain these fees where they are collected--\n80 percent of them--in that particular park.\n  I think it is an excellent opportunity to do this as a pilot program. \nThe problem is, they have had an opportunity--the Park Service--to do \nthis now since early last winter and haven't done it yet. They haven't \nmoved on this program yet. I am disappointed in that. It is not a \nfunction of the local parks. First of all, originally, 50 of them were \ndesignated to participate in this pilot program. Now the Senate has \nincreased it to a hundred. None has been designated by the Park \nService. On the other hand, the Forest Service and, I think, BLM both \nhave already moved on this program and are making some progress with \nit. When we go to Yellowstone and talk about their needs, the park \nsuperintendent there is for it. I called the Director of the Park \nService. He is for it, too, but it hasn't happened; it hasn't happened \nbecause the Secretary of the Interior hasn't authorized it. That is too \nbad because that is part of a demonstration, a short-term solution to \nthis issue.\n  Now, I don't think that it's the long-term solution. There needs to \nbe some other things done, some fairly major things. We have talked \nabout them for some time. One of the problems, as you can imagine, is \nthe continuing authorization of more and more Federal parks. Without a \ndefinition of what a Federal park really is, I have to suggest that I \nthink a number of the parks that have been authorized in recent times \nhave been parks that, under most circumstances, could just as well be \nState parks or local parks or community parks, but Members of this body \nand others want them to be national parks so they are paid for by the \nFederal Government. So now we have a $4 billion backlog in the service \nof taking care of facilities that need to be brought up current, but we \ncontinue to authorize more and more parks, without being able to fund \nthe parks we have.\n\n  So that is one of the things that needs to be done, it seems to me--\nat least to develop a criterion as to what really qualifies as a \nnational park, what characteristics ought to be involved to qualify as \na national park.\n  Another is concession reform. For a long time, we have been seeking \nto do something about concessions. Now, the concessions are not there \nto fund the parks, necessarily; they are there to provide services for \nvisitors. But it is true, I think, that we need to revise that. First \nof all, the concession contracts cannot be removed because we haven't \npassed a bill that does it. They are operating on a short-term basis. \nSecond, there are instances in which the park should be receiving more \nmoney than they are from the concessions. Third, those concession funds \nprobably ought to stay in those parks. That is another thing that we \nneed to talk about and need to change.\n  Many of these changes are acceptable to the people who manage the \npark, but the Department hasn't moved, and indeed the Congress hasn't \nmoved. There also, of course, needs to be some management changes, as \nwell. GAO has done a study. One of the notable things was that the \nmoney that has gone to parks has not gone to the resources that the \nparks themselves say are the highest priority. That is one of the \nmanagement problems that needs to be changed. When you set priorities \nin planning, then it seems to me the funding ought to coincide with \nthose priorities. So there needs to be a lot of things done.\n  I am here to support national parks. I think they are a very, very \nimportant thing. I think they have a great future.\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\n I think we, as citizens, are willing to pay some more, particularly if \nwe are certain that the fees we pay in the particular park stay in that \npark to enhance the resources of the park that we like to see.\n  The other is that management, of course, is expected to be good. I \nthink they should implement programs that give it the opportunity to do \nit, like the pilot program. We are going to need, over time, to \ncontinue to set priorities. I have argued from time to time that there \nis a difference in the public lands. Some of them, like parks and \nforests, have been withdrawn by the Federal Government for a purpose. \nThere were unique characteristics, and they were withdrawn from the \npublic domain because they are and were unique. Lands managed by the \nBureau of Land Management were simply residual lands. Wyoming is 50 \npercent owned by the Federal Government. The State of the Senator from \nIdaho is more than that. Nevada is 87 percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Many of those lands were never withdrawn for a particular \npurpose. The parks were, the forests were, the wildernesses were. So we \nwill have to set some priorities, over time, on that.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk just a little \nbit about something I think is very important, and to encourage that \nthe funding for operations of parks, which is in this bill we will be \nconsidering, ought to be maintained, despite the fact that the House is \nsomewhat lower. I think that is a move toward the short-term \nresolution, and then I hope that my associates and I can work toward \nresolving some of the longer-term solutions over the next 2, 3 years, \nso that we can make these national parks, cultural institutions, \nfiscally sound.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with my colleague from Wyoming just having \nspoken, one would think it is ``Western day'' on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, especially when I choose to come to the floor this morning also \nto speak about Western public lands issues.\n  Certainly, the issue of national parks, in which the Senator from \nWyoming is so knowledgeable, is not just a Western issue; it is clearly \na national issue, with national parks spanning the length and breath of \nour country.\n  I come to visit about an issue that has been in the skies of the West \nall summer. It doesn't happen to be there at this moment. As I flew out \nof Idaho this weekend after a rainstorm, the sky was clear. But for \nwell over 2 months this summer, up until this weekend, Western skies \nhave not been clear. They have been filled with smoke.\n  If you had flown over Idaho or nearly any part of the West as I have \nmany times this summer, you would have been convinced that the West \ntruly was on fire. In many instances, that was true. Our Western \nforests and rangelands have burned again at an unprecedented rate this \nsummer. Smoke from extensive wildfires invaded our cities. It damaged \ntourism, it caused health problems, and homes adjacent to the public \nlands were in jeopardy and many burned as a result of the high incident \nof wildfires.\n  I know that you and others have seen this on television, it was \ntalked about oftentimes on national television and in the newspapers \nthrough the course of the summer. Wildfires were regular occurrences on \nnightly news shows in the West in States like Oregon or Idaho or \nCalifornia or Arizona or New Mexico or Montana or Wyoming or in places \nin Utah.\n  Tragically, what we heard this summer has become a regular occurrence \nwhich we in the West have had to endure. Nearly every 2 years, it \nseems, since 1988, the frequency and intensity of fire has gone well \nbeyond the historic norm. Its genesis is the increasingly poor health \nof our public forests and the fuel buildup from millions of acres of \ndead and dying trees and unforaged, or in other words, nongrazed, \ngrasslands of the West. It is a problem that we could do something \nabout in this Congress and as Americans if we chose to do so.\n  These fires are destroying our resources, trying our patience and \nexhausting our financial ability to suppress them. This year another \nrecord will be set with more than 6 million acres burned, in excess of \nthe record set only 2 years ago, and before that, in 1988. In fact, \nthis is the largest amount of acres burned in a single year since 1967.\n  Firefighting forces started the year with over $400 million of debt, \nand the deficit continues to pile up as more and more Federal personnel \nand equipment are thrown into this battle against wildfire.\n  The Knutson-Vandenburg, known as the KV, fund has been the handy \nsource from which we have borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars to \npay for emergency firefighting costs, and it is now broke. There is no \nmoney in the fund. KV moneys are collected from timber sale revenues \nspecifically to replant and regenerate public forests with new \nseedings. Because the borrowed money has not been replaced, the tree \nplanting programs are now in jeopardy.\n  In other words, what we are doing is we are borrowing all of the \nmoney to fight fires, but we are not putting the money back, so there \nis no money to replant the forests.\n  Tragically enough, there are some folks out there who say, ``Oh, \nwell, this is Mother Nature; let it be.'' I am one of those who cannot \nagree with that, and I think most of our colleagues cannot, and \ncertainly the citizens of the West cannot.\n  My question to my colleagues is simple: How long can we ignore what \nis happening in our western forests? If that smoke were blowing through \nthe urban canyons of the eastern cities, how long would the public put \nup with it before demanding action from their Representatives in \nCongress?\n  I have offered a long-term, broad-based solution with my legislation \nto restore forest health. We have a chance to pass that legislation. It \nis S. 391, which was approved by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee in June; but it has been hung up in politics, politics, and \nenvironmental politics that have no basis in science and no \nunderstanding of the tragedy that our western national forests are \nexperiencing today. It is simply the politics of politics that has \nstopped efforts to deal with forest health, and I ask that you help me \nto change that, because we should be addressing the crisis that exists, \nand will continue to exist, in the western forests.\n  I have stood in this Chamber to sustain the temporary emergency \nsalvage law which is critical to our short-term needs from the 1994 \nfires. And, yes, I have heard some people claim that there is no \nemergency.\n  If that is true, they were not listening to the nightly news this \nsummer, or they were not listening in Idaho or Oregon or Washington or \nMontana or Wyoming or Utah or Arizona or California or New Mexico. They \nare simply ignoring the fact, or they are being lulled to sleep by the \nsymphony of environmental voices that would only argue that this is \nMother Nature at her finest.\n  There is an emergency. A critical emergency. But in most people's \nminds it is not an emergency until the fire starts and is roaring up \nthe mountainside and threatening their own town. Then it becomes an \nemergency overnight, and all of the resources of the State and Federal \nGovernment, including the Army and the Marines, are brought into the \nfight. Oregon's Governor, in fact, this year declared a state of \nemergency because of the fires roaring across the State of Oregon.\n\n  Would it not make more sense to take preventive actions before the \ncrisis starts? Of course that makes sense, but then again it is not \npolitically correct right now to make sense about the idea of managing \nour forests if man is involved in that management. It makes better \nsense for some to argue that you simply lock them up and let Mother \nNature do her thing. Well, Mother Nature was doing her thing this \nsummer,\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\nand she burned well over 6 million acres of land, land whose forests \nwill now take decades and sometimes generations to restore or replace \nthemselves.\n  First of all, we must permit active management of these forests. We \nmust reduce forest fuels to restrict the size of the fires and cool \ntheir intensity. Some scratch their heads and say, ``What are you \ntalking about, Senator? Fires are hot.''\n  That is right, but some fires are hotter than others. And when you \nhave phenomenal fuel buildup of the kind we have seen because of the \ndead and dying trees on these forest floors, and ignored because of the \nabsence of management, these fires are intensively hotter than the \nnormal fires that oftentimes amble through a forest burning shrubbery \nbut not destroying and killing the trees. Those normal fires are the \nfires of Mother Nature of decades ago, those are the fires that \nperiodically cleansed our forests. But these cleansing fires were not \nthe fires of the summer of 1996.\n  Would it not make more sense to take the preventive action that I am \ntalking about? Of course, we could do that. First we must permit, as I \nhave mentioned, the active management of our forests. We must reduce \nthe fuels. One needed activity is salvage timber removal, and my guess \nis we will be back on this floor later this year, and probably the \nfirst of next year, asking for flexibility to do salvage on some of \nthese 6 million burned acres. There will be Senators on this floor who \nwill say, ``But environmental groups do not want this; it would be \ndestructive.'' And so we would let hundreds of millions of dollars in \ntrees then rot and wash away, and we would not replenish our funds to \nreplant and regenerate our forests. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand how that is good business, good environmental business, good \neconomic business, for that matter, or just good management. It is, in \nfact, poor management, poor management at its very worst.\n  Let me close by asking the cooperation of the Senate, whether it is \nthe passage of my forest health legislation or whether it is just the \nsimple awakening to the situation that exists in the western forests of \ntoday, a situation that is largely our doing, largely our doing because \nwe have been so good at putting out fires over the last 30 years that \nwe have now created the circumstance which creates the extraordinary, \nthe unusual, the dramatic fires that we saw in the West this summer.\n  So I hope that we recognize an emergency exists, and if we created \nit, we ought to be able to manage it. The science of forestry today \nargues that we can, but it is not a science of ignorance or a science \nof turning your back. It is a science that demands the kind of active \nmanagement that the U.S. Forest Service and its professionals know how \nto use, if they would only be allowed to do so.\n  Frankly, it is not the science of this administration, which has \npassively ignored the problem because of the pressure placed upon them \nby certain environmental groups to do nothing and walk away. In Idaho \nand the rest of the Western States over the next decade, doing nothing \nand walking away will simply create another summer of 1996 over and \nover again. Millions of acres will be burned, houses and private \nproperty will be lost, and the debt will mount, a debt that the public \nowes for fighting these fires in an effort to save the resource and \nsave private lands and private resources. We can avoid this. We can \navoid this by wise and responsible management.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, what is the time situation and the \nprocedure situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business right now is we are in \nmorning business until 2 o'clock; between 12 and 1 it is under the \ncontrol of Senator Daschle, and then, from 1 until 2 o'clock, morning \nbusiness will be under the control of Republicans.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. With that, Mr. President, and a thank you to my friend \nfrom Montana, Senator Burns, because I will take a few minutes, and \nthen perhaps 5 minutes of the time under our administration will go to \nhim. I will not take 15; I may take 7--maybe.\n  Mr. BURNS. You can take as much as you want.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that was a noble comment from my friend \nfrom Montana. Absolutely the generosity matches only his magnanimous \nsmile, and I love it. I will just continue now for an hour and 40--no, \nexcuse me. That just slipped. It slipped away for a moment. That is the \ntrouble with me, Mr. President. I take my work seriously but not \nmyself. That can get you in a lot of difficulty in life, but that is \nstill the best way to fly.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10571-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10572-S10573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on the issue of illegal \nimmigration. Not legal immigration; that issue is not before this body. \nI know how to legislate. It was very clear this body did not wish to \ndeal with legal immigration. That will be for others who come after me, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, to deal with that very tough issue. \nBut, on Wednesday of last week, the House appointed conferees to the \nconference on the immigration bill, the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. That is legislation that passed \nboth Houses of the Congress by overwhelming margins. There were only \nthree votes against this very popular bill in the Senate. I think the \nvote was 97 to 3. The House version passed by a vote of 333 to 87.\n  Our fine majority leader and the House majority leader have each \nstated that passing immigration reform legislation in this Congress is \na priority. Senator Bob Dole, a man for whom I have the richest \nadmiration and respect--I served as his assistant--was always a very \nstrong supporter of responsible immigration reform issues, all such \nmeasures, and candidate Dole has always expressed his support for the \npresent illegal immigration control bill.\n  The conference committee will meet this week, but already we are \nhearing about a plan now to filibuster the conference report here in \nthe Senate. We all received a letter, of course, from the President, \nexplicitly threatening a veto. That is common knowledge. His reason is \nclear to him and clear to many others, and that is the so-called \nGallegly amendment.\n  But I would refresh and remind my colleagues why this legislation \nreceived such strong bipartisan support in both Houses.\n\n  This legislation is to strengthen the border enforcement by nearly \ndoubling the size of the Border Patrol.\n  It will ensure that aliens who commit serious crimes are detained \nupon their release from prison until they can be deported, and then \nthey will be deported under expedited procedures.\n  It will provide prompt decisions for those who apply for asylum and \nensure that those who genuinely fear persecution at home can remain \nhere.\n  It will create an expedited removal process, so that those who seek \nto enter the United States surreptitiously or with fraudulent documents \ncan be promptly deported and not allowed to stay here for years while \npursuing various frivolous appeals at all levels and in all forums, \nadministrative and judicial.\n  It will ensure that the sponsor and not the U.S. taxpayer will be \nprimarily responsible for providing financial support to new immigrants \nin need.\n  And it will provide for voluntary pilot programs on systems to enable \nemployers and welfare providers more reliably to identify those who are \neligible to work or to receive benefits in this country.\n  The most controversial portion of the bill, of course, the one that \ngave rise to the veto threat and the filibuster plan caper, is the so-\ncalled Gallegly amendment, which authorizes the States to decide \nwhether or not to provide a free public education to illegal persons, \nillegal aliens--a proposal which in its\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\npresent form is presented to the conferees as including some rather \nextensive changes to that provision. Some say it does not matter what \nyou do to that provision, it is not appropriate. That may assuredly be \nso, and yet that is called legislating and it is about discussing and \namending.\n  So it is now worded so that at least those who are opposed to any \nform of illegal immigration reform are not now able to say that we are \n``kicking schoolchildren out into the streets.'' No one I know is \ninterested in ``kicking children out into the streets.'' I certainly am \nnot, and I have always had some serious problems with regard to aspects \nof the Gallegly amendment, but if that is what is to be in this \nconference report in this form, in its amended form, then it is \ncertainly acceptable to me.\n  The proposal contains generous ``grandfathering'' provisions for \nthose students now in school. They will be permitted to continue their \neducation in the elementary or secondary school in which they are now \nenrolled at no charge. If they wish to change school districts in the \nsame State or advance from elementary to secondary school, they may do \nso upon paying tuition, or a fee equal to the actual cost that others \nwho are citizens pay within that district for their education.\n  Furthermore, the proposed change will ensure that unless the Congress \nis given an opportunity to vote on repealing this provision in 30 \nmonths, the provision will sunset--be gone. At the end of the 60 \nmonths, if a bill to repeal the measures is introduced there must be a \nvote within 90 days or the provision will sunset--be gone.\n  Those changes to moderate the provision were negotiated by Senators \nHatch and Specter. They represent, obviously, substantial modifications \nto the elements that were there originally that were apparently the \nmost objectionable. I believe they might be sufficient to make the bill \nacceptable to those who truly want illegal immigration control \nlegislation.\n  But there are some very disappointing signals, I share with my \ncolleagues, some very disappointing signals from the Dole campaign. I \nthink that my fine leader, who I served as assistant for those 10 \nyears--a most wonderfully decent man--is being ill-served on this \nissue. If what I read in the papers and hear through the media is true, \nand those who know me please believe that it is, indeed, always taken \nwith a huge grain of salt by me as to what is in the media--indeed, \nthat will always be so, hopefully--but I am informed he is being \nadvised by those who advise these people who choose to submit \nthemselves to seek the role of the Office of Presidency--that he is \nbeing advised simply to let the bill die. And the reason for that, \napparently, is so, as I gather it, that the President will not have a \nRose Garden ceremony with regard to illegal immigration; that \napparently because the President had a Rose Garden ceremony with regard \nto welfare reform and with regard to health care and with regard to, I \nguess, anything else that he signs, that somehow this then cripples the \neffort of my friend, Bob Dole.\n  Thus it is rather extraordinary to me that those on my side of the \naisle often accuse this administration of cynical politics and yet I \ncan't imagine anything more cynical than not signing an illegal \nimmigration bill or working for its passage--something that was passed \nby such overwhelming margins--on the basis that it is simply going to \n``help the incumbent'' turning our backs on the singular issue that is \nreflected in polls across the country for years, and that is to ``do \nsomething'' about illegal immigration.\n  There is and always has been overwhelming public support for measures \nto reduce illegal immigration. Both candidate Dole and President \nClinton have stated their support for illegal immigration control \nlegislation. I say to my colleagues, it is in the national interest to \nachieve control over our borders, to achieve control over illegal \nimmigration and the misuse of our most generous public support and \nwelfare programs that so burden the taxpayers of this country.\n  When we have 60 percent of the live births in a certain hospital in \nCalifornia attributed to illegal undocumented mothers who then give \nbirth to a U.S. citizen; when we have people who are minorities who go \nto seek public support because they need it and are then told that the \ncupboard is bare because it has all gone to illegal, undocumented \npersons, that stirs people up. They don't like it, and it really \nshouldn't be the guiding policy of anything we do here, but it is the \nway it is.\n\n  So I just say, apparently the scenario is this now. I gather in my \nwisdom: Pass the bill in the House with the Gallegly amendment, which \nwill be adopted; send it over here, and then it will be filibustered by \nthose who do not like the Gallegly amendment. I guess they think all of \nthose people are Democrats. And then we will point our bony fingers at \nall the Democrats and say, ``They brought down illegal immigration.''\n  That is childish logic, because there are at least 10 to 12 \nRepublicans in this body who do not like the Gallegly amendment in any \nform and who will assist in the filibuster. So if anybody thinks it is \njust going to be a wonderful roundelay over here of Democrats \nfilibustering an illegal immigration bill and then we pointing the bony \nfickle finger of fate at those who destroyed the issue. No.\n  So, I guess that is where we are. We will pull the bill down and try \nto blame it on the Democrats and go home. Clever, not, because as I \nsay, there are at least 10 to 12 Republicans who will join in that \nfilibuster. Go home in October and tell voters a Republican Congress \ndid nothing about illegal immigration in an election year.\n  Then we also heard, ``Well, if we just send it to President Clinton \nand he vetoes it, we will win California.'' I never went for that \nscenario. I think that is about as boneheaded as you can get, too. But \nwhen they are telling us that my dear friend, Bob Dole, should do \nnothing and nothing should happen, and that is going to help Bob Dole, \nI must say I have purely missed out on most of the trickery and \ncynicism of the campaign, because there are many on our side who will \nhave nothing to do with the Gallegly amendment. Not me, for I am ready \nto do the modified version.\n  So what the public will see is a distorted figure of my friend, Bob \nDole. We have had enough of those. Ten years as his assistant, I know \nhim well. He will win the Presidency of the United States if the people \nof the United States come to know him as well as I do and as well as we \ndo here, as well as my friend from Montana knows him, and he surely \ndoes, as well as the occupant of the chair.\n  Each and every week for the past 2 years, Bob Dole has said to me, \n``When will we have an immigration bill, Al?'' And now we have one. Now \nwe have people pulling at Bob Dole, mewling, puling, mumbling issuing \nfrom staff and others. He is being ill-served if he is led to believe \nthat it is not a priority issue. And if California is in the balance, \nas we say in politics, by doing nothing, someone will have cut the \ntightrope wire for one great and decent man, my friend Bob Dole.\n  So perhaps we can move on now with the national interest. There is no \none who expresses it more in its most honest form than that most \nwonderfully decent and capable man, Bob Dole. We shall see how it plays \nout.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, as most people know now, over the \nweekend, our former Senate majority leader announced in very broad, \nvery specific, very forceful terms his plan to come to grips with a \nsurging, raging crime wave in the United States.\n  All the data that I have seen over the last several years have \nindicated that crime, drugs, and the related two, are at the top or \nnear the top over and over of grave concern on the part of American \ncitizens. And well they should be,\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\nbecause at least the first premise of Government is to protect the \npersons and property and citizens of the United States.\n\n  You cannot separate drugs from crime. Today, of the 80 percent of the \n35,000 prisoners that are incarcerated in my State, they are there in \nprison from drug-related actions. As our attorney general, Attorney \nGeneral Bowers, has said over and over again in Georgia, you can no \nlonger separate the two. We are in the midst of a new drug epidemic; \ntherefore, we will be in the midst of a surging crime epidemic.\n  There is no way to fully document the ill-effect that the drug \nepidemic, drug-related crimes have done to the citizens of our country, \nand in the cost of lives, personal property. It is stunning data any \ntime you look at it. It just begs for leadership to come forward.\n  Over the weekend, Senator Dole said that if he were elected \nPresident, he would cut teen drug use in half. What does that mean? \nThat means that two million youngsters would not be using drugs, when \nhe is successful, that are today. I can not think of a more important \ncommitment to make to America than to turn the drug war back on and to \nput the warning out to families and churches and business leadership \nacross our country that we would have an administration that is going \nto be highly focused on drug use among teenagers.\n  As we all know now, drug use among teenagers has doubled in the last \n36 months. It has gone up 33 percent in the last 12 months alone. And, \nin addition to the broad tragedies that we suffer by those individuals \nwho have been ensnared in the drug epidemic, there will be hundreds and \nhundreds of families, in each case, that are caught up by the reaction \nto drug use and the crime that it festers.\n  We have the distinguished Senator from Montana who has joined us here \nthis afternoon. I know he has had a long interest in the issue of crime \nand its impact on America. I yield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana on this subject.\n  Mr. BURNS. I cannot have the rest of that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We will amend that as needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from \nGeorgia.\n  We have just got in some interesting figures from Montana. I guess \nthat is why some of us are very concerned about this, not only from a \npolitical standpoint--this is the season, and nobody can lift that out \nof this, out of the element of debate--but if you ask Americans today, \n``Do you feel safer than you did 4 years ago,'' we hear an \noverwhelming, ``No.'' People are feeling threatened more and more in \nsociety. I think it comes from this old mindset of ``only obey the laws \nyou agree with.'' It is a mindset.\n  Just in my State of Montana, violent crime has gone up 8 percent last \nyear, and overall crime has gone up 16 percent since 1994. That \nconcerns me because we are a small State. We are known as a State with \nhardly any crime, but there was a murder every 10 days last year--that \nconcerns me--a rape every 38 hours; a robbery every 34.5 hours; \nproperty crime occurred every 13 minutes; and burglaries happened at a \nrate of 1 every 2 hours. That sort of concerns me a little bit.\n  Before I had the opportunity to serve here in the U.S. Senate, I \nserved on the board of county commissioners in Yellowstone County. We \nbuilt a new jail facility and went through that process of detention \ncenters, and we also received a very nice award for a youth detention \ncenter. I was convinced, as we went through that process, that \nsomewhere in this crime prevention, or how we deal with crime, there \nhas to be some common sense injected in here.\n\n  We know that we cannot outbuild the criminal element to just lock up \neverybody. So we have to find ways not only to deter--one of them is \nnot getting on television and having a low disregard for the laws of \nthe land. You know, as adults, we teach our youth every day, some days \nwe even use words. But that concerns me more than anything else because \nI have a young son, I have a daughter who will graduate from medical \nschool next year, and they are concerned about crime and crime among \nthe young people.\n  When we take a look at what we did in Yellowstone County in a youth \ndetention center, I think we have to work with States, because the real \nviolent offenders in crime, I don't think we can do much but just hold \ndown on them and keep them in confinement. I think we should work to \nabolish the very liberal parole rules that some States have. I do not \nthink there is anything wrong--and why should it be wrong--to require \ndrug testing for those under supervision in the criminal justice \nsystem.\n  I ask the American people why it is wrong to establish a registry for \nthe release of violent sex offenders, the Megan's law. I see no reason \nwhy we should not move forward on that. And child pornography, we have \nto move on that. But juvenile crime worries me more than anything else, \nbecause I guess I got into politics because of youth. I have sort of a \nsoft spot in my heart for them.\n  I have worked very much with 4-H groups and FFA groups, and those are \nkinds of groups--can you imagine any other kind of group than the \nFuture Farmers of America where you can pour 31,000 of them, with those \nblue jackets, in downtown Kansas City, and you never have to put an \nextra cop on the beat? We need to be promoting those kinds of youth \ngroups that espouse their way of thinking and the way they act. I know \nevery Senator in this body gets calls from their local FFA chapters \nacross this country.\n  So we have to do some things that deter crime. We have to promote \nthose groups and organizations that do have their values in the right \nplace. We have to ask some of the hard questions. But some of them are \ngoing to have to have common sense, too. The alarming increase of teen \ndrug use, marijuana use, between 12- and 17-year-olds has increased \nsome 200 percent in the last 2 years--200 percent. Why? We had it going \ndown for a while. We had it going down by just one little statement \nfrom the First Lady in the White House, who said, ``Just say no.'' We \nneed to help them say no; and when they say no, stick by them. That is \nwhat we have to look at. It is concerning to me that we would look at \nit any other way.\n  Do we want to prosecute juveniles as adults for adult crime? Maybe \nsometimes. Maybe we should use some common sense there and provide past \ncriminal records for juveniles in sentencing. There is nothing wrong \nwith that.\n  We came a long way in attacking the root cause of crime and drugs in \nthe inner city a few short weeks ago when we passed the welfare reform \nbill. It deals with dependency and illegitimacy in ways that have never \nbeen tried before. It is a big step in the right direction, and yet the \njob is not over.\n\n  When we take a look at what is ahead of us, we have to start \nappointing judges that interpret the law--do not make the law, \ninterpret the law. The elected officials of this country make the laws. \nJudges interpret them. We need to start appointing Federal marshals and \nprosecutors that want to prosecute drug dealers and child pornographers \nrather than making excuses for them that they were just victims of \nsociety. If there has ever been a cop-out in America, it is some \npsychologist or some person who is saying, ``Well, they're victims of \nsociety, and leniency should be shown.'' That is a one-way ticket down \nthe drain for this country, when we start making excuses for people who \nknowingly break the law.\n  Let us take another end of it--victims' rights. I think we ought to \nhave an amendment to the Constitution. Victims have to have some \nrights. All the rights are not with the felon. It is time to reform the \ncourt system, limit appeals, and punish criminals quickly. Keep violent \ncriminals behind bars so they cannot commit more crime. It is time to \nstop these election-year games and take a stand for what is right. We \nshould just do what is right.\n\n  I was in Illinois on Saturday for my friend Bob Dole. How many \nmothers did I talk to that are concerned--they have teenagers in high \nschool in rural areas. Where they have never had problems before, they \nare coming up with these problems and saying there has to be a more \nliberal way of dealing with discipline and all those elements.\n  I imagine most of us who serve in this body, when we were in school, \nif you got a licking in school, you got one when you went home. They \ndid not ask\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nwhy you got a licking. They did not even ask. My dad did not even ask \nwhether I was right or wrong. The fact is you got a licking, and if you \nwarranted one there, you warranted one here. There was a time I was a \nvictim of society. There was a time when the whole world was against me \nand I was that victim. I do not think it hurt very many of us.\n  I want to say one word. Not only can we do something here, but we \nadults, like I said a while ago, we teach every day. Some days we even \nuse words. We are going to have to get on the ground with these young \npeople and we are going to show them they have support to do the right \nthing, not the wrong thing. It has to be done here. It has to be done \nacross our Nation, and, yes, the national leaders have to set the \nexample. I am asking America, what kind of example are we setting?\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Montana. I think he would \nagree with me that this five-point plan where Senator Dole pledges to \ncut teenage drug use in half--by 50 percent--to end revolving door \njustice, to hold violent juveniles accountable for their actions, to \nmake prisoners work, and to keep guns out of the hands of criminals is \nexactly the prescription to get at the tone and the issues that the \nSenator from Montana alluded to.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the senior Senator from \nMississippi, a long and loyal colleague of our former Senate majority \nleader. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nGeorgia for yielding me this time. I join him in commending the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana for his remarks.\n  Our former colleague has proposed a very important new plan to deal \nwith what has to be the most serious challenge that our governments--\nFederal, State, and local--face today, the epidemic of crime and \nviolence in our society.\n  This plan has meat to it. It has substance to it. It is thoughtful. \nIf we will embrace it and join Bob Dole in seeing that it is enacted \nand administered in the way it is proposed, I think we will get \nresults. It is time we turned the country around, turned the country \naround from ever-increasing drug abuse and violent crime to an era when \npeople assume responsibilities for their own actions and they are held \naccountable for their own actions, whatever their age, and that they \nare treated in a way that deters action in the future that is a menace \nto innocent society members.\n  In our society we have a number of efforts that are underway to try \nto deal with the core problems. There is a wonderful program called \nCharacter Counts. In Ocean Springs, MS, during the week of October 13-\n19, the schools will have special programs to observe the importance of \ngood character in not only students, but faculty, administration \nofficials, and the communities at large across America. We need to \nrestore America to the place where we have been looked up to as an \nexample for the rest of the world in terms of community spirit, \nrecognition of what is right and wrong, a country that stands for \ndemocracy and principles of freedom that have been an inspiration to \nmany countries all over the world.\n\n  What this program suggests is there are six essential elements or \ncore pillars to good character: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, caring, citizenship, and fairness. These are important \nand indispensable individual traits if we are to have a successful, \nfree society. It is on that basis and on that premise that I think Bob \nDole establishes this five-point plan of action. An essential part of \nthis is holding juveniles accountable for drug abuse, for criminal \nacts, and for other violations that put the safety and security of \nothers in jeopardy.\n  Something has to be done about it. Something is being done about it, \nbut not enough. We need to do better. We need stronger leadership, a \nbetter example of leadership at the top. That is a part of this, too. \nAn example is that we have seen the abuse of drugs go up by 105 percent \nfor teenagers between the ages of 12-17 from 1992 to 1995. Before that \ntime, drug use was going in the other direction. It was going down. Now \nit has turned and is going up again. We have to ask why.\n  What does this lead to? A third of all juvenile criminals are under \nthe influence of drugs at the time of their criminal offense. That is \nwhat happens. There are consequences for everybody for the failure to \nexert good, commonsense, strong, committed leadership in this area.\n  I traveled one day with the sheriff of Hinds County, MS. He told me, \nas we looked firsthand at some of the problems in the largest populated \ncounty in my State, he said public enemy No. 1 in the State of \nMississippi is crack cocaine. I am sure that is the case in many, many, \nother towns and communities and cities throughout this country. What do \nwe do? We have a White House that cut the programs to deal with this. \nThey cut the Office of Drug Control Policy by 83 percent. They cut the \nnumber of drug agents. The U.S. attorneys used to be challenged by the \nPresident and the Attorney General to do something about those who are \ncommitting offenses with guns. There was an Operation Triggerlock, you \nremember, an effort to go out on the streets and get those who are \nusing guns to commit violent acts and crimes and lock them up, put an \nend to it. Take the guns away from them.\n  What is being done now? The arrests for that kind of behavior are \ndown considerably in this administration. I think we need to turn it \naround. I think the five-point program Bob Dole has recommended is just \nwhat we need. We need to make the fight against drugs a top national \npriority again. We need to support his effort to create 1,000 new \ncommunity-based antidrug coalitions.\n  There is another part of this plan that strikes me as being very \nimportant. We need to have the Federal Government assisting, \nsupporting, helping States and local communities deal with this \nproblem, not imposing arbitrary new, hard-to-follow regulations that \nare expensive, that make it more difficult to operate prisons, that do \na variety of things that really undercut the efforts being made by law \nenforcement at the State and local level.\n  He suggests that we assist the States in keeping violent criminals \nbehind bars completing their sentences.\n  There is another part--holding juveniles accountable for their \nactions. The distinguished Senator from Georgia mentioned that. Youth \nviolence is on the rise. Mr. President, 35 percent of all violent \ncrimes are committed by those who are younger than 20 years of age. \nWhat Bob Dole is recommending and what we are suggesting is a good idea \nis to revise the Federal juvenile justice system to hold juveniles \naccountable.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Fred Thompson, is chairman of the \nJuvenile Justice Subcommittee here in the Senate. He recommended a new \napproach to try to find out what programs at the local level are \nworking, support them with Federal assistance and initiatives that \nreward those for following these paths and these new procedures, and to \ndo something about those who commit crimes as juveniles; consider \ntreating them as adults in certain circumstances. No longer coddle the \njuvenile just because he is younger, because some are more dangerous \nthan adults. That is what has been overlooked.\n  This administration has done absolutely nothing about that, \nabsolutely nothing. The program that he is suggesting will authorize \nnew funds to assist in the investigation and apprehension of juvenile \noffenders, collect and distribute juvenile records to help better deal \nwith this problem, and authorize new funds to be spent on prevention \nprograms that involve parents and community based groups.\n  That example I cited a while ago, the Character Counts Program, is a \ngood example of something that could be done on the prevention side. We \nare not talking about punishing everybody in an arbitrary or cruel way. \nWe are talking about a balanced approach to doing something more likely \nto be successful in this area. One thing that I am convinced Bob Dole \nwill do, in accordance with the plan that he proposed, is that he will \nend the interference by Federal judges and Federal agencies into the \nproper administration of State prisons. It is about time.\n  There is also a part of the program that deals with keeping guns out \nof the hands of criminals. We have heard about the National Instant \nCheck Program. We had that as part of the crime\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nbill. He wants to make it a top priority in order to prevent criminals \nfrom purchasing any type of gun. There is a procedure for it. He will, \nas President, instruct the Attorney General to target violent crime by \nmaking maximum use of Federal law to get dangerous gun using criminals \noff the streets and into prison. That is reminiscent of Operation \nTriggerlock--I assume that is exactly what we will have reinstituted \nagain--which has been abandoned and turned down and discontinued by \nthis President. There was an emphasis on the U.S. attorneys going after \nthose who commit crimes using guns. There has been a noticeable dropoff \nin prosecutions for those crimes by this administration.\n  In conclusion, what does this action plan do? It provides a sound, \nsensible, thoughtful blueprint for coordinated Federal and State \nefforts to combat violent crime and reverse the current trends in the \nuse of drugs that have led to so much violence in our society.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nMississippi very much for coming forward and speaking to this critical \nissue of crime and the tragedy it is causing across our country, and \nfor highlighting these very targeted suggestions that we now have from \nSenator Dole to get at this core problem. I appreciate very much the \nSenator's remarks here this afternoon.\n  Senator Johnston from Louisiana has just come on the floor. He has a \nvery distinguished guest.\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Johnston for the purpose of this \nintroduction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10573-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   VISIT TO THE SENATE BY HIS EXCELLENCY JASSUM MOH'D AL-OWN, KUWAIT \n                           MINISTER OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON.

Mr. President, undoubtedly, Senator Dole's emphasis on \ntaking crime head-on is an outgrowth of a circumstance over the last 3 \nyears that has just turned sour on us. It has been alluded to, but I \nwant to cite some of the facts that have developed in the last 36 \nmonths.\n  First of all, I want to make it clear that there can be no doubt \nabout it that, in the last 36 months, the United States has found \nitself, once again, in a massive drug epidemic. It is fueling and will \ncontinue to fuel crime. Just to cite this, in the last 36 months, \nmarijuana use is up 105 percent, LSD is up 130 percent, cocaine up 160 \npercent. Somebody in the administration suggested that, actually, drug \nuse is down. I have no idea where that data is coming from, but it must \nbe a single source, because every other source has documented that \ndrugs were up in virtually every category. The sad thing, Mr. \nPresident, is that they are kids.\n  In the last epidemic, during the 1960's and 1970's, it was a target \ngroup from about 16 to 20. It has dropped, which is such a tragedy. Now \nthe ensnarement is occurring at age 8 to 13. This country is going to \nfeel the impact of that for a long, long time. One in every 10 kids is \nusing drugs.\n  Drug prosecutions are down 12 percent. This administration cut 625 \ndrug agents. Federal spending on drug interdiction has been cut by 25 \npercent. The drug czar's office was reduced by 83 percent. On the list \nof national security threats, compiled by the National Security \nCouncil, this administration moved illegal drugs from No. 3, as a \nthreat, to No. 29 out of 29.\n  Now, Mr. President, can there be any wonder that our children are \ngetting the wrong message, and that they no longer think drugs are a \nrisk, and that, therefore, they are using them in record numbers, and \nthat, therefore, we have an epidemic, and that, therefore, we are \nhaving the emergence of a new crime wave?\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by one of our colleagues that has \nbeen in the center of this controversy during his entire time, which is \nsince 1994. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is already making \nan impact in this area of vital concern across our country.\n  I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                 PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VETO BY LAWYERING\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, again, \nfor his efforts to bring us together here to focus on various vital \nmatters before the Senate and before the American people.\n  Mr. President, I have taken the floor on several previous occasions \nto discuss the problem of abusive prison litigation and this Congress' \nefforts to attack that problem.\n  The last time I did so was April 19, 1996. At that time, I expressed \nmy disappointment that President Clinton had just vetoed the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill.\n  Contained in that bill was the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a \ncarefully crafted set of provisions designed to stem the tide of prison \nlitigation.\n  In my view, this was a very important piece of legislation. Lawsuits \nby prisoners and lawsuits over prison conditions were completely out of \nhand.\n  One figure captures the situation very well. In fiscal year 1995, \nprisoners--inmates in prison--filed 63,550 civil lawsuits in our \nFederal court system. That is a little over one-quarter of all the \ncivil lawsuits filed in Federal courts that year. It's also far more \nthan the 45,788 Federal criminal prosecutions initiated that fiscal \nyear.\n  In short, Mr. President, we saw, in fiscal year 1995, prison lawsuits \noutnumber prosecutions under our Federal system and account for one-\nquarter of all the lawsuits brought in this country in the Federal \nsystem.\n  One prisoner sued because he had been served melted ice cream. For \nthis he claimed $1 million in damages. Fortunately, the judge ruled \nthat the right to eat frozen ice cream was not one of those the Framers \nof the Constitution had in mind.\n  Another sued because when his dinner tray arrived, the piece of cake \non it was ``hacked up.''\n  A third sued demanding LA Gear or Reebok ``Pumps'' instead of \nConverse tennis shoes. This kind of abusive litigation is not only \nfrivolous, it costs money and cost the taxpayers a lot of money.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General estimated that the \nStates were spending about $81 million to battle cases of the sort I \njust described--this even though the States win 95 percent of these \ncases early in the litigation for reasons that are obvious.\n  We were determined to do something about this problem in the \nCongress, so as part of the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill \nin 1996 we passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act. This legislation \ncharged prisoners a fee for filing any lawsuit, while making it \npossible for the prisoners to pay that fee in installments. If a \nprisoner filed more than three frivolous cases, however, the prisoner \nwould no longer be able to pay the filing fee in installments. He or \nshe would have to pay the full fee up front, unless a court found this \nwould create imminent risk of bodily harm.\n  In addition, prisoners who filed frivolous lawsuits would lose their \ngood time credits, thus making their stay in prison longer. And judges \nwere given authority to screen out frivolous cases on their own.\n  The legislation was designed to put an end to another aspect of the \nprison litigation problem: Seizure by Federal judges of the power to \nrun prison systems. These seizures have consequences that range from \nthe ridiculous to the disastrous.\n  In my own State of Michigan, judicial orders resulting from Justice \nDepartment lawsuits have resulted in\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nFederal courts monitoring our State prisons to determine how warm the \nfood is, how bright the lights are, whether there are electrical \noutlets in each cell, whether the prisoners' hair is cut by licensed \nbarbers--this despite the fact that no court has ever found that any of \nthese conditions regarding which it is giving orders violate the \nConstitution.\n  The orders issued by a judge in Philadelphia were even worse. There a \nFederal judge had been overseeing what had become a program of \nwholesale releases of up to 600 criminal defendants per week. Why? To \nkeep the prison population down to what the judge considered an \nappropriate level. Thousands of the released defendants were then \nrearrested for new crimes including in one 18-month period 79 murders, \n90 rapes, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing charges, 701 burglaries, \n2,748 thefts, and 1,113 assaults.\n  In the interest of justice and public safety, we wanted to stop this, \nand the means were simple and fully in keeping with everyone's rights. \nWe simply required in that same Prison Litigation Reform Act that no \njudge could take over a prison without first holding that it had \nviolated the Constitution and explaining how the order was necessary to \ncorrect the violation. We also directed that the judge give due regard \nto public safety in deciding what kinds of remedies to require. And we \nestablished stringent limits on the power of the courts to order \nprisoners released. Existing orders would have to meet these new \nstandards. If they did not, they would have to be dissolved immediately \non motion of the prison authorities, unless the court found that the \norders were necessary to correct an on-going violation of a Federal \nright.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that legislation. At the \ntime, the President said his veto had nothing to do with our prison \nlitigation proposals. Instead, he said, he was vetoing the bill over \nother matters.\n  We took the President at his word and included our proposals in a \nsecond piece of legislation. This time, the President signed the \nlegislation. Unfortunately, the President's top ranking officials in \nthe Department of Justice seem intent on inventing a new kind of veto, \nveto by lawyering.\n\n  This effort started almost as soon as the ink from the President's \nsigning pen was dry. A mere 11 weeks after signing the bill, his \nDepartment of Justice was filing briefs all around the country that \nwould undermine the clear intent of our legislation. The briefs claimed \nthat, far from requiring the courts to stop running the prisons for the \ncomfort of prisoners, that law authorized them to continue to do so \nindefinitely.\n  Thus, according to President Clinton's Justice Department, Federal \njudges should continue to tell Michigan how warm the food should be, \nhow bright the lights have to be, and who should cut the prisoners' \nhair. And by the logic of their position, judges should also continue \nto dictate prison population size and order excess prisoners released--\nthis even if the Constitution contains no such requirement and even if \nthe release orders jeopardize public safety. At least they should do \nthis while they are investigating whether the prison ever violated any \nprovision of the Constitution, an investigation that can take quite a \nbit of time.\n  The Department of Justice has come up with a host of legal theories \nto explain why the reform act should be read to require indefinite \njudicial supervision of prisons for the benefit of prisoners. It is \ndifficult to say which is more ludicrous, the original or the current \ntheory. The original theory, now abandoned in the face of questions \nfrom Members of this body and the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, was that the phrase ``violation of a Federal right'' includes \nviolations of the very decrees the reform act was adopted to end.\n  The current theory stands on its head the reform act's requirement \nthat existing decrees be automatically stayed 30 days after a motion to \nend one has been filed unless there has been a final ruling on the \nmotion.\n  According to the current Justice Department theory, this requirement \nin fact means the decrees are not automatically stayed, and, indeed, \nthat nothing should happen to them at all until the court conducts its \nown exhaustive inquiry as to whether conditions at the prison have ever \nviolated any constitutional provision.\n  These theories are unpersuasive, Mr. President. Even Judge Harold \nBaer, the subject of some attention for his theory that running away \nfrom the cops gave no grounds for reasonable suspicion, rejected these \ntheories and ended judicial rule at Riker's Island. Judges there had \nbeen dictating such crucial matters as the brand and exact \nconcentration of cleanser to be used in certain areas.\n  The theories are ludicrous but the end result is not. These \ninterpretations make a mockery of this Congress, they make a mockery of \nthe law, and they make a mockery of the American people's desire to \nhave prisons run to promote the public order, not to promote the \ncomfort of our prisoners.\n  Further, even if they desperately try to protect existing decrees, \nPresident Clinton's Department of Justice continues to threaten exactly \nthe kinds of lawsuits the reform act was supposed to end.\n  For example, a mere 4 days after President Clinton signed the reform \nact, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights threatened to sue \nGov. Parris Glendening of Maryland over conditions in Maryland's \nsupermaximum security prison. Supermaxes are reserved for the most \ndangerous prisoners, murderers and rapists who continue their violent \nbehavior in prison.\n\n  What were the egregious unconstitutional conditions that led \nPresident Clinton's Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights to \nthreaten suit? The fact that supermax prisoners are not allowed to \nsocialize enough and are not getting enough outdoor exercise. The \nDepartment calls these conditions unconstitutional because they are the \n``mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air \nto breathe.''\n  Fortunately, this particular veto by lawyering will ultimately \nsucceed only if President Clinton's Justice Department persuades the \ncourts to go along with it. I do not expect that it will.\n  So far the results are not promising for the Justice Department. So \nfar, the judges who have decided these issues, interestingly, all of \nthem Democratic appointees who had either taken over the running of \nprisons themselves or had inherited them from a predecessor who \nretired, rejected half the arguments urging them to retain control.\n  Mr. President, other parts of the Reform Act, the ones designed to \ncut back on individual prisoner lawsuits, which President Clinton's \nDepartment of Justice has no role in enforcing, already are showing \ntheir effects. Prisoner filings since the bill's enactment have \ndeclined sharply. Nevertheless, the Department of Justice, through its \nattempted veto by lawyering, is delaying and undermining the \neffectiveness of critical portions of the Reform Act. The Judiciary \nCommittee will be holding a hearing on this matter next week.\n  It is my intention to propose an amendment to whatever proves to be \nthe most appropriate legislation, either this year's Commerce-State-\nJustice appropriations bill or perhaps another omnibus appropriations \nbill, that clarifies once and for all it is time for abusive prison \nlitigation to end, whether it is brought by prisoners or by President \nClinton's Department of Justice.\n  It is unfortunate we must clarify once again the clear intent of such \nrecently enacted legislation. But public safety and the costs of our \nprison system are too important for us to allow this inappropriate veto \nby misinterpretation.\n  In short, I am here today to say that if we are truly serious about \ngetting tough with crime, we ought to begin immediately to take the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act and administer it in the exact clear sense \nthat Congress intended it to be administered.\n  That is not happening today. I am extraordinarily disappointed by it. \nI intend to be on the floor as often as necessary to bring about the \ncorrect interpretation of that legislation or to add new legislation \nthat eliminates any possibility of misinterpretation in the future. \nPrisons should be tough time for prisoners and the rights of victims \nshould take priority.\n  That is what I believe everybody in this Chamber is committed to \ndoing, and if necessary we will have to enact more legislation to get \nthe job done. But I am very disappointed in the actions of the \nDepartment of Justice to\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\ndate because it is certainly inconsistent with what we demand and what \nthe American people I believe want to see happen in the area of prison \nreform.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I wonder if the Senator from Michigan would stay just \na moment to see if I get the sequence of these events down. We had a \ncondition of legal frivolity--if you froze an ice cream or not. I think \nany American who would hear this just would be dumbfounded. But your \nlegislation put an end to that and put an end to judicial management of \nprisons. And the President vetoed that.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Then you came back again, passed the essence of this \nlegislation, and he signed it, but his Justice Department has \nsubsequently been engaged in an overt attempt to undo it?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is accurate. I would say to the Senator from \nGeorgia, we were told when the first veto occurred, because this \nlegislation was included in a broader bill, that the legislation, the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, was not the basis for the veto; that, in \nfact, it was supported.\n  When the second bill was signed, we assumed the Justice Department \nwould seek to make sure the provisions of that Litigation Reform Act \nwould be enacted and followed by the courts. Instead, what we have seen \nis the Department of Justice intervening in lawsuits in a way that \nwould, in fact, preclude, rather than allow, States to extricate \nthemselves from these various judicial circumstances where judges were \nrunning the prison systems with no clear evidence of a constitutional \nviolation ever having occurred. Instead, we find the Justice Department \nfinding ways to allow the judges to stay in charge and to allow for \nvarious things such as we have seen around the country, where these \nprisoner lawsuits are growing in number, where judges are requiring \nprisons and State authorities to expend millions of taxpayer dollars \nsimply to ensure and improve the comfort of prisoners. We think that is \nthe wrong direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10576-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10578-S10579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRIME IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Michigan. Again, as I said \nwhen he came to the floor, he has been very dutiful on this issue and I \nam comfortable will ultimately prevail.\n  Mr. President, a moment ago I was talking about this drug epidemic. \nThere can be no doubt but that we had a change in policies that \noccurred when this administration took office. And we have had a \nresulting change in behavior. If you start shutting the drug war down, \nI think you can expect to see a reversal and we will find more and more \nyoung people caught up in this tragic problem and then society caught \nup in their problems.\n  This administration has, as we just heard, vulnerability and \naccountability that it has to accept with regard to the condition of \ncrime in the country today. This administration has touted signing the \nassault weapon ban and Brady bill as evidence that they got tough on \nguns. This has been the effect: Federal gun prosecutions are down 20 \npercent. Federal gun convictions are down 13 percent. The U.S. \nattorneys' program to target gun crimes and to report on gun \nprosecutions, Operation Triggerlock, which the Senator from Mississippi \ntalked about a moment ago, has been dismantled--gone. Congress \nauthorized $200 million for States to help with background checks under \nthe Brady bill. Clinton's budget request has cut that figure by 68 \npercent. ``It is fine to pass the bill, but do not fund it.''\n  This administration claims to have put 100,000-plus cops on the \nstreets. Myself and Senator Biden, the Senator from Delaware, debated \nthat number a couple of months ago. The data is actually this: The \nJustice Department says the number is actually more like 17,000. Now, \n17,000 is a long way from 100,000. It is questionable whether 17,000 \nhave ended up there as well. In Florida, 30 of this 17,000--not 100,000 \nbut 17,000. In the ads we hear 100,000, but in reality it is more like \n17,000. Here is where some of the 17,000 are: They were added to the \nState Department of Environmental Protection to keep watch over a coral \nsanctuary off the Florida Keys. The cost of that was $3.5 million.\n\n  Florida received $1.8 million to hire 25 cops for State parks. At the \nsame time, Florida received $3.5 million to watch a coral reef. This \nJustice Department rejected a request from the St. Augustine police \ndepartment, in northern Florida, to fund a 1-year anti-domestic \nviolence program. That would have cost $80,000, to hire this officer. \nIn other words, we do not have 100,000, we have 17,000; and of the \n17,000 we have, we have them watching a coral reef off the Florida Keys \nbut denying the ability to set up an antidomestic violence program. \nThis is almost as baffling as some of the statistics that we heard from \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  The Justice Department admits that, of that number, as many as 14,000 \nwere already on the streets and are now just paid for with Federal tax \ndollars. Mr. President, 20 percent of the 100,000 may be officers who \nare redeployed. So the early money has gone to existing police \nofficers. In reality, only about 3,000 new cops have been added. That \nis a long way from the 100,000 to 3,000.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, the assistant majority leader. He is a strong proponent of \ncrime measures that work. I yield up to 8 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I would like to compliment the \nSenator from Georgia for his leadership on calling to our attention \nboth Senator Dole's initiative to combat crime, which I think has some \noutstanding points that need to be brought to the public attention and \npublic debate, and also some of the shortcomings we have witnessed \nthrough action or inaction from the Clinton administration for the last \n3\\1/2\\ years.\n  First and foremost in the effort to combat crime, I think we have to \ncombat the rapid rise in drug use amongst teenagers. Teenagers are our \ncountry's future, and it is very, very sad indeed to see that drug use \namongst teenagers in the last 3\\1/2\\ years has more than doubled. That \nis a frightening statistic. It may be one of the most frightening \nstatistics we could think of. Some of us are parents. I happen to have \nfour kids. To think that drug use has more than doubled in just 3\\1/2\\ \nyears should cause everybody, Democrat, Republican, independent, real \ncause for concern.\n  You might say why? Some people point a finger at President Clinton. I \nthink he shares some of the blame. I remember very well Nancy Reagan \nand her effort to say, ``Just say no to drugs.'' Try to convince young \npeople to, ``Just say no. Do not mess with them, do not experiment with \nthem, you are on thin ice, you are asking for trouble and you can start \ndown the road beginning with marijuana and maybe ending up with more \nserious drugs, cocaine, crack and others, that can destroy your life.''\n  Some people have ridiculed Nancy Reagan's statement. But as a result \nof her efforts and those continued by President and Mrs. Bush, drug use \ncontinued to decline throughout their administrations. We had a 10-year \ndecline in drug use among young people; and basically among all age \ngroups, drug use declined.\n  Unfortunately, in the last 3\\1/2\\ years drug use among teenagers more \nthan doubled. And what kind of leadership did we have from the White \nHouse? We had President Clinton making light of the fact that he had \nbroken our drug laws. He said he did not break the drug laws, he said \nhe never inhaled, not in this country, that was in England and, ``No, I \nnever inhaled.'' Then last year, on a nationally televised show, I \nthink it was MTV, when he was asked the question by a youngster, \n``Would you inhale if you had a chance to do that again?'' he said yes. \nWhat kind of example is that? What kind of leadership is that? That is \na frivolous attitude, as if it does not really make any difference. \nThat kind of cavalier attitude, I think, tells a lot of people, maybe \nit is OK to use drugs or try drugs; President Clinton tried drugs.\n  Then you see in the President's own administration, several people \ncould not get White House clearance through the FBI because they had \nrecent drug use. Not 10 years ago, not 20 years ago when they were in \ntheir early twenties or something, but recent drug use. Mr. Aldrich's \nbook indicated that there was drug use even possibly on Inaugural\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nDay. Yet, some of those people are serving in the White House today. I \nbelieve it is acknowledged by the White House, 21 current employees, \ntop-level officials in the White House are currently undergoing a drug \nprogram, a drug rehab program and surveillance.\n\n  What kind of example is that? What kind of leadership is that? And \nwhat about some of the appointments that President Clinton has made?\n  I remember we had a big battle over Dr. Joycelyn Elders to be Surgeon \nGeneral. A lot of us, mostly Republicans, said, no, she would not be \nthe proper person to be the Surgeon General, to be the No. 1 health \nofficer appointed by the President, to be the person in the bully \npulpit, because she had views that were more than liberal, they were \noff the radar screen to the left.\n  Many of us opposed her nomination, but she was confirmed. We opposed \nher nomination because she made a lot of statements that we felt should \nnot be made by the Surgeon General.\n  After Dr. Elders was appointed, it wasn't too long before she said \nsomething about, ``Well, maybe we should legalize drugs, maybe we \nshould study legalizing drugs.'' Did President Clinton fire her for \nthat statement? No. I think I heard somebody say, ``Well, the President \ndoesn't agree with her on that issue.''\n  It wasn't a month later and she said the same thing, I think before \nthe National Press Club. She thought maybe we should consider \nlegalizing drugs. Was she fired for making it a second time? The answer \nis no. She was fired later for making some other comments that were, \nagain, very irresponsible in what we should be teaching our kids in \nschool, but the point being is he didn't fire her. She made several \ncomments about legalizing drugs, and she was still the Surgeon General, \nshe was still President Clinton's appointee to a very important \nprestigious position. Again, he was aware of her background, he was \naware of her philosophy, and yet that was his recommendation to the \ncountry for that position.\n  My point being, the war on drugs needs to be fought. It was fought \nunder Ronald Reagan, it was fought under George Bush, and, basically, \nit was abandoned under the Clinton administration. The net result is, \nwe have a lot of young people today who are experimenting with drugs, \nthinking, ``Well, maybe it's OK.'' So we see drug use way up, we see \nthe number of young people who will be addicts, who will see their \nlives ruined, we will see those numbers go up as well.\n  So we need to fight the war on crime, we need to fight the war on \ndrugs, but, unfortunately, this administration has been AWOL on both. \nMr. President, I regret to say that, I hate to say that.\n  Mr. President, I am going to make a couple more comments. I looked at \nSenator Dole's announcement. He said he had a stated goal that he wants \nto reduce drug use by 50 percent during his first term. It can be done. \nIt was done under Reagan and Bush. It can be done again. You see the \ncurrent upsurge in drug use due to a very cavalier attitude by this \nadministration, the current administration, on the war on drugs. It \nwill be nice to have a change in the White House and have an individual \nand a team that is very committed, that is very dedicated, very sincere \nin saying, ``We want to let everyone know that drugs are hazardous to \nyour health.''\n  I find it interesting to see that President Clinton is attacking \ntobacco and has been silent about other drugs, such as crack and \ncocaine, marijuana use. I almost think that he made the announcement on \ntobacco maybe to kind of get this release of information talking about \ndrug use doubling under his term off the front pages. I don't know.\n  Mr. President, this war has to be fought. We need energetic \nleadership coming from the White House. I believe we will have that \nfrom Senator Dole and his team.\n  Also, I want to comment on the interdiction efforts. I remember \nshortly after President Clinton took office, he cut the office of the \ndrug czar by 83 percent. He reduced it from, I believe, 140 employees \nto 15, and cut the funding way back. That tells you something about his \npriorities.\n\n  Senator Dole said, if elected, he would reestablish the drug czar \noffice. He would redouble and rekindle our efforts on drug interdiction \nso we can stop drugs before they come into the United States. He said \nhe would increase penalties on those people who have been involved in \ndrug trafficking, particularly amongst people who have been involved in \ndrug trafficking to our young people.\n  So, Mr. President, it is vitally important that we have a leader who \nwill make change, and make change appropriately, to protect our kids \nfor the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, our control of time is nearing an end, \nbut I would like to just draw a contrast here.\n  The former majority leader has embraced a very focused attack on \ncrime in our country, and he begins--and I think it is appropriate--\nwith the first pledge to cut teen drug use in half. I can't think of a \ngrander thing to achieve that would do more good, reduce pain and \nanxiety and trouble in millions of American families.\n\n  Sometimes these numbers get out of whack. We are talking about a \nsister, a brother, somebody in the neighborhood, and we are talking \nabout 2 million of them who are now experimenting with drugs who did \nnot 3 years ago. That is a city the size of my hometown, Atlanta, GA--\nevery person in it. Every one of those is a family and is in a personal \ncrisis. So by focusing that as No. 1 is right on target.\n  No. 2, an end to revolving-door-justice, which Americans have been so \nconcerned about. One in every three persons arrested for a violent \ncrime is on parole. Sometimes people say, ``Well, it costs too much to \nkeep them in prison, $25,000, $30,000 a year.'' It costs $450,000 for \nthem to be out of prison, in property damage and personal damage.\n  No. 3, holding violent juveniles accountable for their actions. We \nall know we have a juvenile crime wave and it is tied to the drug wave.\n  No. 4, making prisoners work. Only one-third of the prisoners work \nfull time. We heard the Senator from Michigan addressing that.\n  No. 5, keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.\n  On target, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n  Conversely, this administration suffers from a lack of commitment in \nthis arena. Shortly after arriving at her job, Attorney General Janet \nReno repealed the Department of Justice policy requiring prosecutors to \nseek the most serious criminal charge they could prove in court. We all \nheard from the Senator from Oklahoma about the former Surgeon General \nsuggesting that maybe we should legalize drugs and the effect that has \nhad, with children no longer thinking that drugs are serious.\n  This administration's chief prosecutor in San Diego has released \nhundreds of captured drug smugglers and sent them back to Mexico \nwithout prosecuting. This administration's prosecutors across the \ncountry have cut back prosecutions of felons for possessing guns by 13 \npercent and have reduced prosecution for crimes involving guns 20 to 25 \npercent.\n  Many of this administration's judges have embraced the criminal as a \nvictim-of-society philosophy. The Senator from Montana talked about \nthat earlier this afternoon and how wrong that is. We heard the \nstatistics of getting these people back out on the street and the price \nsociety pays when we do that.\n  His appointees to the Supreme Court have been among the most willing \nto use technicalities to overturn death sentences for brutal murders.\n  The list goes on, Mr. President. Here we have a focused, energetic, \ncommitted Senator Dole targeting crime as a No. 1 issue in America and \ngoing after it, and over here we have a record of conciliation and a \ndrug war and a drug epidemic.\n  We need to do this not only for the stability of our country, but for \nthe compassion of our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10578-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10579-S10580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the so-called \nDefense of Marriage Act. I voted against this bill for three reasons.\n  First, there is no need for this legislation. Not one State in this \nNation has legalized marriages between gay\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nmen or lesbians. Until one does, there is absolutely no need for \nCongress to consider whether other States are, or should be, obligated \nto recognize such marriages.\n  Second, it is clear to me that this legislation is politically \nmotivated. By making this unnecessary bill a priority of this Congress, \nwhile failing to act on numerous other measures of much more immediate \nimportance, the Republican leadership has made clear its desire to try \nto embarrass those who have traditionally supported equal rights for \nall Americans, including gays and lesbians.\n  Third, I do not believe that most Rhode Islanders or most Americans \nthink that this a matter of urgent national importance requiring \ncongressional action. Prior to the introduction of this legislation, I \nhad not received one letter or phone call expressing concern about gay \nor lesbian marriages. And since the introduction of this legislation, I \nhave received only limited correspondence from Rhode Islanders \nexpressing support for it. Whoever has this bill high on their agenda \nhas not consulted with many of my constituents or with many of the \npeople from across the Nation who write to me.\n  Mr. President, I know that people of good will and strong faith can \ndiffer on this sensitive subject. And I knew that the Senate's vote \nwould be a lopsided one. But if we truly believe in family values, we \nshould remember that the gay men and lesbians whom this legislation \nwill affect are our sons and daughters, our sisters and brothers, our \nfriends and colleagues. Before we enact legislation that further \nisolates them from the mainstream of society, we should consider \ncarefully whether this legislation is needed, desired, or desirable. I \ndo not believe that it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10579-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, if the managers would agree, I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the committee amendment to offer an \namendment at this point. And perhaps it could be dealt with later, if \nthe managers of the bill would agree. It is an amendment that addresses \nconcerns confronting cattle producers in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5351\n\n              (Purpose: To promote the livestock industry)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5351.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President this amendment attempts to address many \nof the concerns confronting cattle producers in the United States \ntoday. The issues of packer concentration, lack of price discovery, \nretail price spreads and low prices have been foremost on the minds of \ncattle producers and consumers throughout South Dakota and the Nation.\n  To say these are concerns of my fellow South Dakotans is a gross \nunderstatement. Thousands of South Dakotans have written, called, or \nvisited with me on this issue. This is an issue that strikes at the \nheart of their ability to run their farms and businesses and provide \nfor their families. The time has come for Congress to take action.\n  For the past 2 years, I have been pressing the Clinton administration \nto address meatpacker concentration and utilize existing antitrust laws \nto make sure that cattle are sold in an open and competitive market. \nThough the administration has taken some steps over the past several \nmonths, I believe these measures are marginal at best. Stronger action \nis needed.\n  What is of great concern to producers is the fact that while cattle \nprices have been at or near record lows, retail prices have not shown \nany significant drop. In fact, just the opposite is happening.\n  In 1995, at Eich's Meat Market, in Salem, SD, the price of a choice \nyield grade 2 hind quarter was $1.65 per pound--that is the highest \nprice paid at this locker since it was opened. This past summer it was \n$1.60 per pound. The same hind quarter was selling for $1.57 per pound \nin 1993. In contrast, in 1993 live cattle prices were $80 or higher. \nYet, in 1995, live prices have been as low as $51.50.\n\n  This represents a combination punch to South Dakota ranchers--as \nproducers, they are getting fewer dollars for their livestock; yet, as \nconsumers, ranchers--armed with fewer dollars--are forced to pay more \nboth in terms of real dollars and as a portion of their budget to put \ntheir own product on the dinner table.\n  The influence of packer concentration on the market cannot be \noverlooked or dismissed. Fifteen years ago, the top four packers held \nabout 40 percent of the market. Today market share is over 85 percent.\n  Economic studies have shown that this kind of market concentration \nprovides these firms with the kind of power needed to control prices.\n  At a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing that I chaired on this \nsubject, it was made abundantly clear that all too often cattle \nproducers do not have free, open, or competitive markets in which to \nsell their cattle. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \nAdministration, [GIPSA] is charged with insuring a free and open \nmarketplace. GIPSA must be more vigilant in assuring this.\n  Only through enforcement of existing antitrust will we be able to \nensure the long-term economic viability of the U.S. cattle industry. \nSouth Dakota ranchers agree.\n  I have held two Senate hearings on this subject over the past year. I \nalso have introduced several bills to address concerns that cattle \nproducers have told me must be addressed. Other Senators have offered \ntheir own proposals. Some are controversial. What I have done with this \namendment is incorporate those measures that I believe we can pass this \nyear. Our cattlemen need relief now, not a promise of future action at \nsome point next year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my amendment \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not believe this is a partisan issue. Nor should \nthis amendment be treated as one. Both Republicans and Democrats from \ncattle-producing States I expect will embrace this amendment. Some may \nsay tougher action is needed. They're right. The goal here is to do \nwhat we can now. This amendment I believe is a strong step in the right \ndirect.\n  Again, while my amendment does not include everything I think is \nneeded I believe it is a measure that can pass\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\nand provide real teeth to bring real results to the problems that our \ncattle producers face.\n  We need to keep in mind that old saying ``If it ain't broke, don't \nfix it.'' Well the U.S. cattle industry is broke and it needs fixing, \nnow.\n  I would like to commend the South Dakota secretary of agriculture, \nDean Anderson, for being a national leader on this issue. Secretary \nAnderson was responsible for bringing this matter before the National \nAssociation of State Departments of Agriculture. South Dakota livestock \nproducers are proud of Secretary Anderson's efforts, as I am. As all \nSouth Dakotans know Secretary Anderson recently announced his \nretirement. He will be missed. His efforts to raise this issue to the \nnational level will be a legacy that South Dakota cattle producers will \nlong remember and be proud of. Passing the amendment I have offered \nwould demonstrate that Congress has listened to Secretary Anderson.\n  The Senate needs to carefully review this amendment and other \npossible amendments that address issues confronting the U.S. cattle \nindustry. Packer concentration, price manipulation, possible price \nfixing, and captive supply all must be looked at and a definite course \nof action implemented. I will withhold a detailed discussion of this \namendment at this time. I offered the amendment to give my colleagues a \nchance to review it. I expect others may want to seek amendments to \nthis proposal. I welcome any suggestions from all my colleagues. The \ngoal, again, is to do the right thing for our cattlemen, and to do it \nas soon as possible.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me ask my colleagues to take a \nlook at this amendment, to make their suggestions. Our agricultural \nindustry in the United States is in pretty good shape at this moment \nexcept for our cattlemen. We need to take a number of steps. We need to \nwork on packer concentration. We need to get more of our beef into \nJapan, and some of those countries, and China. We need to get some of \nthe tariffs lowered in some of the Asian countries on beef. We also \nneed to take some steps domestically to be sure that we do not overlook \nthe plight of our cattlemen at this time.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment and I ask that my colleagues \nconsider it and that we take what action we can to help our cattlemen \nin the closing days of this Congress. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                      pressler livestock amendment\n\n       Section 1. Captive Supply:\n       This section (from S. 1939) addresses producers' concern of \n     captive supplies. A better definition of captive supply and \n     more information regarding captive supplies will bring \n     greater price discovery to producers.\n       The Packers and Stockyards Act would be amended by defining \n     ``captive supply'' as livestock acquired by packers delivered \n     7 or more days before slaughter under a standing purchase \n     agreement, forward contract, or packer ownership, feeding or \n     financing.\n       This section also requires and annual report from the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture on the number and volume of U.S. \n     livestock marketed or slaughtered. This report must include \n     information on transactions involving livestock in regional \n     and local markets. The confidentiality of individual \n     livestock transactions would be maintained.\n       Finally, this section would require the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to make available within 24 hours information \n     received concerning captive supply transactions.\n       Section 2. Livestock Dealer Trust:\n       This section (S. 1707, revised) would establish a Livestock \n     Dealer Trust. This provision was part of the Senate-passed \n     version of the new Farm Bill, but was dropped in conference.\n       The section amends the Packers and Stockyards Act and \n     establishes a statutory trust for the benefit of livestock \n     sellers who sell to livestock dealers and market agencies \n     that buy on commission. To ensure prompt payment of livestock \n     sellers, all livestock purchased in cash sales by a dealer or \n     market agency buying livestock on commission shall have all \n     related property (i.e. livestock, receivables or proceeds) \n     held in a ``floating `` trust until the unpaid seller \n     receives full payment.\n       Section 3. Cooperative Bargaining:\n       This section (from S. 1939) ensures that producer \n     cooperatives are fairly treated by handlers of agricultural \n     products. The Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 would \n     be amendment to make it unlawful for handlers of agricultural \n     products to fail to engage in good-faith negotiations with \n     producer cooperatives. It would also make it unlawful to \n     unfairly discriminate among producer cooperatives with \n     respect to the purchase, acquisition, or other handling of \n     agricultural products.\n       Section 4. Labeling of Meat and Meat Food Products:\n       This section (from S. 1939) would require country of origin \n     labels on graded meats. Producers and consumers alike have \n     made it abundantly clear that meat needs to be labeled to \n     show country of origin. Under this section, the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act would be amended to require graded meat that \n     was either imported, or produced from an animal that was \n     located outside the United States for at least 120 days, be \n     labeled showing the country of origin.\n       Section 5. Interstate Shipment of Meat and Poultry \n     Products:\n       This section (S. 1862) would permit the interstate shipment \n     of state-inspected meat and poultry products. The section \n     would amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry \n     Products Inspection Act to allow states to apply to the \n     Secretary of Agriculture for the interstate shipment of meat \n     and poultry products. The Secretary of Agriculture first must \n     verify that the state's mandatory inspection requirements are \n     equal to or greater than the Federal inspection, reinspection \n     and sanitation requirements.\n       Upon verification by the Secretary, the prohibition on \n     interstate shipment of meat and poultry products inspected \n     soley by the state shall be waived. Once a waiver has been \n     granted, the Secretary of Agriculture may perform random \n     inspections of state-inspected plants to ensure that \n     mandatory state inspection requirements are equal to or \n     greater than Federal requirements. If a state does not \n     maintain its inspection requirements to Federal levels, the \n     Secretary shall reimpose the restriction against the \n     interstate distribution of meat and poultry products.\n       This section was recommended by members of USDA's packer \n     concentration commission and is strongly supported in the \n     agricultural community. Lifting the market restrictions \n     imposed on state-inspected meat and poultry processors would \n     slow the concentration in meat packing by enabling small-and \n     mid-size processors to expand their operations and create \n     more jobs. 400 state-inspected plants have gone out of \n     business since 1993 because of the prohibition. This section \n     would provide the same opportunity for small business owners \n     and operators that exists for large corporations and foreign \n     competitors.\n       Section 6. Review of Federal Agriculture Credit Policies:\n       This section (from S. 1949) establishes an interagency \n     working group to study the extent that Federal lending \n     practices have contributed to concentration in the livestock \n     and dairy markets. This interagency working group would be \n     established by the Secretary of Agriculture after \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman \n     of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and \n     the Chairman of the Board of the Farm Credit Administration.\n       Section 7. International Barriers to Trade:\n       This section (from S. Res. 277) expresses the Sense of the \n     Senate that certain actions be take to address international \n     barriers to trade. Those actions are as follows:\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture should continue to \n     identify and seek to eliminate unfair trade barriers and \n     subsidies that affect U.S. beef markets;\n       (2) the U.S. and Canada should expeditiously negotiate the \n     elimination of animal health barriers that are not based on \n     sound science. Many U.S. cattle producers are concerned that \n     Canada requires more stringent veterinary and inspection \n     requirements on U.S. cattle entering their market than what \n     the U.S. requires on Canadian cattle entering our market;\n       (3) the import ban on beef from cattle treated with \n     approved growth hormones imposed by the European Union should \n     be terminated. The European Union's ban on U.S. cattle and \n     beef is not scientifically based, represents an unreasonable \n     barrier to U.S. trade, and has cost U.S. beef producers more \n     than $1 billion in export sales since 1989; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Agriculture should use the Export \n     Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate \n     Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) to promote the \n     export of U.S. agricultural commodities to countries of \n     Africa.\n       Section 8. Animal Drug Availability Act:\n       This section (S. 773, revised) contains the Animal Drug \n     Availability Act of 1996. The Act contains recommended \n     changes to new animal drug application approvals to provide \n     the Food and Drug Administration with greater flexibility to \n     determine when animal drugs are effective for their intended \n     uses. The Act would establish streamlined approval \n     requirements for new individual animal drugs or active \n     ingredients sought to be used in combination. Currently \n     separate tests are required for approval of these drugs.\n       This section also would require the Food and Drug \n     Administration to consider legislative and regulatory options \n     for facilitating approvals of animal drugs for minor species \n     and minor uses, and to announce its proposals for legislative \n     or regulatory changes within 18 months of the date of \n     enactment. Currently, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \n     does not address animal drug approvals for minor species or \n     uses.\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we, of course, will take a careful look at \nthis\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\namendment. It is on a subject of which this Senator is well aware, as a \nmember of the Commerce Committee, of which the Senator from South \nDakota is chairman. It does address a very real need. On the other \nhand, Mr. President, it obviously has nothing to do with an \nappropriations bill for the Department of Interior and related \nagencies.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and I have, as a \npolicy, determined that we will not be friendly toward amendments which \nare entirely nongermane or entirely nonrelevant to issues before this \nbill. If we do, if amendments like this begin to pass, it is almost \ncertain that the bill itself will be taken down. The sponsors of the \namendments likely will not be successful in reaching their policy \ngoals, and we will have frustrated the appropriations process.\n  So I express the hope, and subject to what I hear from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, that the Senator from South \nDakota will be able to make a very important point, as he has, and as \nhe has done eloquently, without opening up this bill in a way that has \nfrustrated and perhaps destroyed some other appropriations bills, \nincluding the one that preceded this as a matter of debate. With that, \nas we do not have any votes to take place today, I suggest that we set \nthe amendment aside and move forward to another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment has just been laid \naside.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5352\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \n cooperative agreements for the restoration and enhancement of biotic \n                      resources on watershed land)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk involving a \nvoluntary watershed restoration effort on private lands. I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5352.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . WATERSHED RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For fiscal year 1997 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter, appropriations made for the Bureau of Land \n     Management may be used by the Secretary of the Interior for \n     the purpose of entering into cooperative agreements with \n     willing private landowners for restoration and enhancement of \n     fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources on public or \n     private land or both that benefit these resources on public \n     lands within the watershed.\n       (b) Direct and Indirect Watershed Agreements.--The \n     Secretary of the Interior may enter into a watershed \n     restoration and enhancement agreement--\n       (1) direct with a willing private landowner; or\n       (2) indirectly through an agreement with a State, local, or \n     tribal government or other public entity, educational \n     institution, or private nonprofit organization.\n       (c) Terms and Conditions.--In order for the Secretary to \n     enter into a watershed restoration and enhancement \n     agreement--\n       (1) the agreement shall--\n       (A) include such terms and conditions mutually agreed to by \n     the Secretary and the landowner;\n       (B) improve the viability of and otherwise benefit the \n     fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources on public land in \n     the watershed;\n       (C) authorize the provision of technical assistance by the \n     Secretary in the planning of management activities that will \n     further the purposes of the agreement;\n       (D) provide for the sharing of costs of implementing the \n     agreement among the Federal Government, the landowner, and \n     other entities, as mutually agreed on by the affected \n     interests; and\n       (E) ensure that any expenditure by the Secretary pursuant \n     to the agreement is determined by the Secretary to be in the \n     public interest; and\n       (2) the Secretary may require such other terms and \n     conditions as are necessary to protect the public investment \n     on private lands, provided such terms and conditions are \n     mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the landowner.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at the beginning, I want to thank my friend \nfrom Washington, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Gorton. He has \nbeen very helpful, both the chairman and his staff, in our preparation \nof this effort. I want him to know that I very much appreciate all his \nhelp. Senator Byrd is not here, but he, as well, has been very helpful \nto me. I want to thank both Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd at this \ntime for their assistance.\n  As Senator Gorton knows, in particular, the natural resources \nquestions in the West are especially polarized. They are ones where so \noften there are very heated and controversial fights between groups, \nparticularly industry groups and environmental groups.\n  I and others, and I know the Senator from Washington is interested in \nthis, are continually making efforts to look at new models, in effect, \nnew paradigms, for resolving some of these natural resources questions \nand trying to bring people together. It is for this reason that I offer \nthis amendment, Mr. President.\n  My sense is some of the most exciting work being done in our country, \nparticularly in our Pacific Northwest, involves voluntary, purely \nprivate efforts, where people look to try to get beyond some of the old \ncontroversies, some of the old battles, and come together to resolve \nnatural resources questions in a balanced way.\n  What our history in the Northwest has always been about is protecting \nour treasures, protecting our natural resources, while at the same time \nbeing sensitive to economics. It is my sense that some of the voluntary \nwatershed restoration projects on private lands give us the chance to \naccelerate the effort, to find these new models for resolving natural \nresources questions. It is for that reason that I offer this amendment \ntoday.\n  This amendment would make it possible, Mr. President and colleagues, \nfor willing private landowners to work on cooperative efforts with the \nBureau of Land Management to restore damaged watersheds so they can \nprovide habitat to salmon and other species. It is going to make more \neffective the Bureau of Land Management's watershed restoration efforts \nin a fashion that involves no extra costs to our taxpayers while at the \nsame time protecting the private property rights of citizens in our \ncountry.\n  I got particularly interested in this issue, Mr. President, when I \nmet with a watershed restoration group in Coos Bay on our south coast. \nThey had been working with a number of the natural resources agencies, \ngetting some funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to work on \nprojects that involve private landowners. The group was also interested \nin working in a cooperative effort with the Bureau of Land Management \nbut had been unable to do so.\n  This watershed restoration group, which involved environmental \nleaders, industry leaders, fishermen, a cross section of people, \napproached the Bureau of Land Management and were told by the Secretary \nthat the Bureau of Land Management interprets its authority to work on \nprojects involving private landowners as limited to what they describe \nas planning activities. The Bureau of Land Management said at that time \nto this group on the south coast in Oregon that they did not think they \nhad the authority to actually go out and fund improvements on private \nlands.\n  It is my view that the Bureau of Land Management ought to have the \nclear authority to work with willing private landowners on cooperative \nwatershed restoration efforts. In many cases, the only way to solve a \nwatershed problem or restore species habitat is to target both public \nand private lands in the watershed. You cannot solve the problem if you \nfocus just on the public lands.\n  This is the most biologically responsible approach to species \nmanagement. It recognizes that many species frequently cross property \nlines, moving\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\nfrom public to private property and back the other way. As a result, \nrestoring habitat on private lands may in certain cases be the most \neffective investment for survival of species also found on Bureau of \nLand Management and other public lands.\n  For a moment, let me take an example where 90 percent of the land in \nthe watershed is owned by the Bureau of Land Management but the source \nof the watershed problem is the 10 percent that is privately owned. In \nthis case, the problem is most likely not going to be solved if the \nBureau of Land Management can only spend money for improvements on the \nBLM land. The result will be that the watershed problem is either not \ngoing to be solved, or else the Bureau of Land Management is going to \nend up wasting money funding improvements only on the Bureau of Land \nManagement lands.\n\n  There is a simple and straightforward solution: Give the Bureau of \nLand Management clear authority to work with willing private landowners \non cooperative watershed restoration projects in cases where this will \ndo the most good for the whole watershed. This way, the public's and \nthe watershed's concerns--taxpayers', industries', and environmental \nconcerns--all get addressed.\n  To be eligible for funding under this legislation, the project site \non private land must be in the same watershed as the Bureau of Land \nManagement lands. But the private land does not have to border directly \nwith the Bureau of Land Management lands. The key consideration ought \nto be the biological and ecological connections between the private \nlands and the Bureau of Land Management lands.\n  Taking for a second what happens if salmon use both forks of a river \nin a single watershed, but only one of the forks contains public land, \nthis legislation would allow the Bureau of Land Management to spend \nmoney on private land in the other fork where this would benefit the \nsurvival or recovery of the species as a whole in the watershed. The \nBureau of Land Management would also be authorized to spend money on \nprivate lands where this would provide for immediate protection to the \nthreatened or endangered species found on the public land or where \nspending the money on private land is more beneficial to the overall \nrecovery of the species.\n  Now, at the same time, we do not want the Bureau of Land Management \nspending taxpayer money on projects that benefit only the private \nlandowners. To ensure that this does not happen, the amendment requires \nthere be a benefit to fish, wildlife, or other resources on public \nlands. The Secretary must also determine that the project is in the \npublic interest in order for the Bureau of Land Management to purchase \nthem.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my amendment provides important protections \nfor private property owners participating in cooperative watershed \nrestoration efforts. From start to finish, the process is completely \nvoluntary. Under the amendment, the Bureau of Land Management can only \nenter into watershed restoration agreements that are mutually agreed to \nby the Secretary, as well as by the private landowner. If there is any \npart of the agreement that the private landowner objects to, that \nlandowner can simply say no to the agreement.\n  What we have, Mr. President, is an amendment that, in my view, will \nbe good for watershed restoration efforts. It will be good in terms of \nmaximizing taxpayer funds during these tough times, and it fully \nprotects the rights of private landowners. I hope this will be adopted.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington. Both he and his staff have been \nvery helpful, as well as the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Oregon is, indeed, relevant to the subject matter of this bill. It \nis one, as he has already eloquently pointed out, that attempts to \nbring people together, people who have differing views often, and not \nonly individuals with differing views but Government agencies, \nespecially the Bureau of Land Management, and private landowners, in a \nway that benefits fish and wildlife, in a way that benefits the \nenvironment, and in a way which is entirely voluntary.\n  He has worked with me and my office on all of the details of this \nproposal. I am delighted to say from the point of view of this Senator \nand the managers of the bill, the proposal is not only acceptable, but \none for which I have an enthusiastic response and full support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am informed that this amendment has been \ncleared by the manager on the other side of the aisle. Under those \ncircumstances, from my perspective, it is ripe for a vote and for \nacceptance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5352) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is obvious that the Interior \nappropriations bill is open for amendment. We are open for business. We \nhave now heard an amendment proposed by the Senator from South Dakota. \nWe have accepted one by the Senator from Oregon.\n  For the information of Members, under the previous order, at 3 \no'clock, the Chair is to recognize the Senator from Arkansas to \nintroduce an amendment on grazing fees, which, obviously, will be a \nvery controversial amendment. I hope there will be a full and complete \ndebate on that amendment this afternoon so that it is ready for a vote \ntomorrow. It will not, under the unanimous-consent agreement, come to a \nvote today, but we can move this bill forward and make progress on this \nbill by having a thorough debate on that issue, one that, while it is \ncontroversial, is certainly relevant to this appropriations bill.\n  In the meantime, the floor is open for any other Member who wishes to \nintroduce an amendment to begin discussion, and perhaps conclude it if \nthe amendment is not a controversial one. I invite other Members of the \nSenate who are within the sound of this debate to bring those \namendments to the floor and we will deal with them as expeditiously and \nfairly as we possibly can.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak for 4 or 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and thank the floor manager, my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from the State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10580-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10583-S10584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMERICA'S DEPENDENCE ON MIDEAST OIL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in rising is to simply draw \nsome attention to what is certainly evident to this Senator from \nAlaska; and that is, our increasing dependence on Mideast oil sources. \nAs we have seen within the last few weeks, there has been a crisis as a \nconsequence of the efforts of Saddam Hussein to once again provide the \nworld with a reflection on how we have become more and more dependent \non imported oil from the Mideast. We had United States cruise missile \nattacks against Iraq again, highlighting the crucial dependence that \nthe United States has become accustomed to in its dependence on \nimported oil.\n  I think it is fair to say the administration's policy is one that is \nreally absent. It is difficult to identify just what our policy is, as \nfar as energy is concerned. Back in 1973 when the United States was \napproximately one-third dependent on imported oil, we entered into a \nnational security analysis because we were concerned that that \nincreasing dependence would lessen U.S.\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\nleverage in dealing with our neighbors in the Mideast. As a \nconsequence, Mr. President, we established the strategic petroleum \nreserve. That was in response to the Arab oil embargo of 1973.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that in 1973 we were approximately one-\nthird dependent on imported oil, so we authorized the creation of SPRO, \nthe strategic petroleum reserve, in Louisiana in salt caverns, where \nthere was the commitment by this Nation to have an emergency supply of \noil on hand, approximately a 90-day supply. We filled SPRO with some \n600,000 barrels, which cost us about $17 billion, because we were \npaying a relatively high price for oil at that time, about $27 per \nbarrel.\n  Today, Mr. President, we are 50.4 percent dependent on foreign oil. \nThe Department of Energy, Mr. President, predicts that by the year 2000 \nthis country will be 66 percent dependent on foreign oil. I do not \nthink there is any question about the stability in the Mideast. It \nremains one of the most unstable areas in the world. We had sent up to \nhalf a million troops over there in 1991 and 1992 during the gulf war \nto protect--protect what, Mr. President--protect the international oil \nsupply stream because it was crucial to the Western World.\n  We have seen earlier this year our troops bombed in their barracks in \nSaudi Arabia. We have seen Iraqi missiles shoot our planes down. We \nhave seen F-117 stealth fighter bombers en route to the area. They are \nthere now.\n  What is the administration doing about it? Well, they are after \nSaddam Hussein, but they are not doing one single solitary thing to \nlessen our dependence on imported oil. As we attempt to negotiate with \nthe Mideast, we see a certain reluctance by our neighbors in the \nMideast to rally with the United States to take appropriate action \nagainst Saddam Hussein, whether it be Saudi Arabia or whether it be \nKuwait. It is rather noticeable that as we attempt to address this \nrenegade, we are doing it pretty much alone. Oh, surely the thoughts of \nthe other countries are with us, and their good wishes are with us, but \nthey do not stand with us with personnel or an open commitment. I find \nthat rather ironic.\n\n  Earlier this year, Mr. President, we were looking at Saddam Hussein \nto relieve our dependence on imported oil. When we were in conflict \nwith Saddam Hussein back in 1991 and 1992, I think we were looking at \nroughly $1 billion worth of oil coming from Iraq each quarter. So here \nwe are at one time committed to try to put him in a cage, and a few \nyears later we are looking at Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein \nto relieve our dependence on other Mideast countries.\n  The point that I want to make, Mr. President, is that on one hand we \nseem to have the inconsistency of creating the strategic petroleum \nreserve at great expense when we were 33 percent dependent on foreign \noil, and now we are talking about selling a portion of it. We are \ntalking about selling a portion of it. Perhaps that will come up in \nsome of the debate on the Interior appropriations bill relative to \ngenerating revenues, but we have already seen our President in his \nbudget proposal, in the outyears, in the year 2002, propose to sell \n$1.5 billion worth of SPRO in order to meet his budget projections.\n  So, Mr. President, one can say that SPRO is now being used, to some \nextent, as a piggy bank in order to meet budgetary requirements. While \nmuch of that oil was paid for when prices were prevailing at $27 a \nbarrel, it is interesting to note we are selling it at somewhere in the \narea of $18 or $19.\n  So on one hand, Mr. President, we have a situation where we \ncontinually fail to recognize our increasing dependence on Mideast oil; \non the other, we sell down the oil that we have put aside to take care \nof whatever energy supply disruption may occur, and we fail to \nrecognize the prediction by the Department of Energy that by the year \n2000 we will be two-thirds dependent on foreign oil.\n  We produce less crude oil now in the United States than we did in \n1955. Imports of foreign oil significantly affect our economy. It has \nbeen estimated that we spend approximately $150 million per day on \nforeign oil. That is more than $50 billion per year. One looks at the \ntrade deficit. Nearly half of it is the cost of imported oil. The other \nhalf is with our trading partners, to a large degree, Japan and others.\n  But three times we have seen international oil supply interruptions \naffect U.S. economic and national security interests. We saw it in 1973 \nin the Arab oil embargo, in the 1979 Iraq-Iran war, and, of course, in \nthe 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Is the Middle East, the Persian \nGulf, any more stable today than it was in 1973? Of course it is not. \nAnd the response of the administration toward opening up domestic \nfields here in the United States, to spur employment, keep our dollars \nhome and lessen our dependence, is sorely lacking.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, to suggest that the most promising area \nin ANWR cannot be opened safely, with the advanced technology we have, \nis clearly selling American ingenuity and technology short. I recognize \nmy time is limited. Other Senators are here to proceed with debate. But \nI remind my colleagues to consider the merits of just where we are \ngoing relative to our increased dependence on imported oil. One of \nthese days we are going to have a crisis in the Mideast, and the public \nis going to blame this body. They are going to blame this Government. \nThey are going to blame this administration for not having the \nforesight to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by taking the \nnecessary measures at home to stimulate resource development \nprotection, which we can do safely with ANWR.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GRAZING FEES.\n\n       (a) Grazing Fee.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law and subject to subsections (b) and (c), the Secretary of \n     the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a \n     fee for domestic livestock grazing on public rangelands as \n     provided for in section 6(a) of the Public Rangelands \n     Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1905(a)) and Executive \n     Order 12548 (51 F.R. 5985).\n       (b) Determination of Fee.--(1) Permittees or lessees, \n     including related persons, who own or control livestock \n     comprising less than 2,000 animal unit months on the public \n     rangelands pursuant to one or more grazing permits or leases \n     shall pay the fee as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Permittees or lessees, including related persons, who \n     own or control livestock comprising more than 2,000 animal \n     unit months on the public rangelands pursuant to one or more \n     grazing permits or leases shall pay the fee as set forth in \n     subsection (a) for the first\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\n     2,000 animal unit months. For animal unit months in excess of \n     2,000, the fee shall be the higher of either--\n       (A) the average grazing fee (weighted by animal unit \n     months) charged by the State during the previous grazing year \n     for grazing on State lands in which the lands covered by the \n     permit or lease are located; or\n       (B) the Federal grazing fee set forth in subsection (a), \n     plus 25 percent.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section--\n       (1) State lands shall include school, education department, \n     and State land board lands;\n       (2) individual members of a grazing association shall be \n     considered as individual permittees or lessees in determining \n     the appropriate grazing fee; and\n       (3) related persons includes--\n       (i) the spouse and dependent children (as defined in \n     section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), of the \n     holder of the permit or lease; and\n       (ii) a person controlled by, or controlling, or under \n     common control with the holder of the permit or lease.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, grazing fees have been the subject of \nmany hot controversial debates in this body. The reason is that our \ngrazing fee policies are highly controversial. When I think about the \nfarm bill that we passed last year and the proponents of the farm bill \nsaid that it was going to take the farmers off of welfare--they have \nbeen receiving these commodity payments since the memory of man runneth \nnot, so we are going to give them some money each year for 7 years and \nthen that is the end of all farm subsidies. All farmers will be on \ntheir own after that. No more welfare state for the farmers of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I have absolutely no objection to grazing on Federal \nlands. What I object to is the amount of money we receive from the \npeople who graze livestock on public lands. Let me just start by saying \nthat we have about 27,000 permitees in this country who graze cattle on \npublic lands. That is on both Forest Service lands and Bureau of Land \nManagement lands. How much land is involved? It is 270 million acres. \nWhat do we get? What does the United States Treasury get for the 270 \nmillion acres? We get $25.2 million--$25.2 million a year for 270 \nmillion acres of land.\n  I am not quarreling about how much land is grazed. I am not \nquarreling with the permitting system where we grant permits to \nranchers so that they can graze cattle on it. I am not even quarreling \nall that much about how little money we get out of it. My amendment \nwill only add $8 million a year to that $25 million. What I am \nquarreling about is the welfare system that exists in the way we handle \nour Federal grazing lands.\n  In short, we have 27,000 permits--I want my colleagues who are \nsitting in their offices or in the Chamber to listen to these figures--\n27,000 permits in this country. Some people have more than one permit, \nso we actually have 22,350 operators who hold permits. Here is what I \nobject to and this is what my amendment is designed to correct: some of \nthe biggest corporations in America, corporations from the Fortune 500, \npeople who are billionaires--pay $1.35 per AUM [animal unit month] to \ngraze cattle on public lands. Mr. President, I am talking about 9 \npercent, look at this figure on this chart, 9 percent of the 22,350 \npermittees, 9 percent of them hold 60 percent of the 270 million acres \nof land that we allow to be grazed.\n  What does that mean? Mr. President, 91 percent of the remaining \npermittees control 40 percent of all of the AUM's. You do not have to \nbe a rocket scientist to look at this chart and know that we are being \ngrossly unfair to ourselves and we are allowing a form of corporate \nwelfare in this country that we should never permit. What would I do? \nMy amendment focuses on this 9 percent, the permittees controlling 60 \npercent of all of the AUM's. Let me digress a moment to describe what \nthat is. An animal unit month is the amount of forage needed to graze \none cow and her calf for 1 month, or one horse, or five sheep or five \ngoats. We will talk about cows because virtually all Federal lands are \ngrazed by cattle.\n  Nine percent of these people, many of whom are billionaires and the \nlargest corporations on the Fortune 500, control 60 percent of all of \nthis land. My amendment would require these 9 percent to pay the rate \nthat the State charges for grazing on State lands for any AUM's in \nexcess of 2,000. My amendment allows all permittees to pay the current \nfee of $1.35 on the first 2,000 AUM's.\n  Today we charge, per AUM, $1.35 a month. You can graze one cow and \nher calf for 1 month for $1.35 on public rangelands. Look at this. In \n1981, that figure was $2.31. In 1995, it was $1.61. In 1996, it is \n$1.35. My amendment would require that, if a permittee controls more \nthan 2,000 AUM's, that permittee must pay the average that the State \ncharges for State lands for all AUM's in excess of 2,000.\n  What's wrong with that? Somebody tell me, what's wrong with that? Why \nis it that Colorado leases their lands for $6.50 an AUM and poor old \n``Uncle Sucker'' gets $1.35? Why is it that even Arizona gets $2.18 per \nAUM and poor old ``Uncle Sucker'' gets $1.35? Look at this--Nebraska. \nNebraska gets $15.50 per AUM, and ``Uncle Sucker'' gets $1.35. South \nDakota gets $7 per AUM on State lands in South Dakota, and the State of \nOklahoma gets $10. Washington State gets $4.55. The average for all of \nthese States where Federal lands exist--the average charged by all of \nthose States is well over $5, or between $5 and $6. That is the \naverage. ``Uncle Sucker'' gets $1.35.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Gregg, who just came on the floor. He is \nmy chief cosponsor on this amendment. Our amendment allows every \npermittee to pay the current rate of $1.35 on their first 2,000 AUM's. \nWe are not trying to change the basic rate. However, if you are \nAnheuser-Busch, or Newmont Mining, or Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard, and \nyou have thousands of acres of land you are grazing, anything above \n2,000 AUM's, you ought to be willing to pay what the State charges.\n  Mr. President, I was discussing this amendment with my staff in my \noffice this morning, and I said, ``You know, I used to be a trial \nlawyer, and I know something about juries. Sometimes I got fooled about \nwhat a jury would do. But I would not be fooled on this.'' If I were \narguing this to 12 jurors, peers of mine--12 jurors, tried and true--\nthey would not be out to deliberate this issue in minutes. Why do you \nthink people are always saying, ``What on God's green Earth is Congress \nthinking about? Why do they permit things like this?'' I will tell you \nwhy they permit it. The same reason we permit a lot of other things: \nThey have a lot of clout.\n  Do you see these States right here on this chart? I would hope to get \na Senator or two from one of those States. However, right now I don't \nknow who it would be. These people who control these grazing permits \nhave a lot of political clout. I don't blame them. If I were out there \nrunning cattle on Federal lands for $1.35 a month, I can promise you I \nwould have some strong feelings about changing the law, too.\n  Look what has happened, Mr. President, since 1981. I invite all of my \ncolleagues to look carefully at this. In 1981, this green line \nrepresents the average fees in these States charged to private persons. \nIf you rent land from me--incidentally, Mr. President, until 2 years \nago, I had a 400-acre farm, and I leased it for cattle grazing. From \nthe time I was elected Governor in 1970, I never farmed again. I leased \nmy land every year. That is a private lease, and the average is $7.88 \nan AUM in 1981. But in 1995, look at the trend. Private lease rates now \naverage $11.20, which is the amount a rancher pays if he or she leases \nthese lands in the private sector.\n  If a rancher leased State lands in one of these States right here in \n1981, he or she paid $3.22 per AUM. In 1995, he or she would have paid \n$5.58. That is the average of what all these States charge. But if a \nrancher happened to be one of those lucky people that held a permit \nfrom the Bureau of Land Management, in 1981, he or she paid $2.31. The \nFederal fee was decreasing. In 1991, a Federal permittee paid $1.97. In \n1995, a Federal permittee paid $1.61. In 1996, it is $1.35.\n  Here are lands being leased in the private sector, going up \ndramatically in the last 16 years. The grazing fees charged on lands \nleased in the private sector, going up dramatically since 1981. And \ngrazing fees on lands that poor old ``Uncle Sucker'' lets out have gone \ndown. I don't have this carried out, but it would be down about here, \n$1.35 an AUM.\n\n  Even Senator Domenici's bill, which passed the Senate but which did \nnot go anyplace--nor is it going anyplace--even that bill would have \ntaken the price of AUM's up to $2.18. Now, of course, you understand \nthat is 9 years\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\nfrom now, in the year 2005. No big deal. But at least Senator Domenici \nwould recognize that $1.35 per AUM is outrageous.\n  Here is an average of the 1995 fees. I mentioned this a while ago, \nbut I did not show you the chart. Today, this figure is not $1.61; it \nis $1.35. Senator Domenici's bill was $1.97. In the State lands, the \naverage is $5.58.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was in the cloakroom, and I saw something fall down; \ndid it hit you?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am going to put it back up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But you are all right?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is about how important this debate has been \nconsidered around here for the last 20 years.\n  For private lands, $11.20 is the average of what people are paying \nprivate landowners to graze livestock on private lands. You are going \nto hear a lot of people state, ``Senator, do you realize cattle prices \nare awfully low right now?'' Yes, I know cattle prices are currently \nlow. I used to be a cattle farmer myself. Cattle prices got so low one \ntime in the late sixties, I heard a farmer say, ``I have already lost \n$100 this morning.'' I asked, ``How come?'' He said, ``One of my cows \nhad a calf.'' I know that prices of cattle are not at an all-time low, \nbut they are very cheap right now. But they are not as cheap as this \nbargain ranchers receive from the U.S. Government. Look at this. You \nare going to hear the argument that the States--because I am saying we \nshould charge these wealthy corporate farmers who are getting this big \nripoff from the Bureau of Land Management, they are going to say, \n``Well, prices are so low now. This is no longer a big bargain.''\n\n  However, remember that the private land lease rates and the State \nland lease rates have continued to rise over the last 16 years. You \ncannot argue with the trend. In addition, how many landlords have you \never known who have said, ``I will put 50 percent of all the rent you \npay me back into your apartment. You pay me $500 a month, and I will \nput $250 a month back into renovating your apartment and keeping it up, \nbuying new appliances, and so on.''\n  But that is what we do. That is what the Federal Government does. If \nwe received $1.35, that would be an outrage, but we turn around and put \nimprovements, fences, everything under the shining sun back into the \nland. Fifty percent of $1.35 goes back onto the land. What a deal.\n  The Government only gets 37.5 percent and the States get 12.5 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put a few charts up here to show you why \nI am offering this amendment. There are some people who ought not to be \npermitted to have huge, thousands and thousands of acres of grazing \npermits for $1.35 an acre per cow. As I said, my amendment would let \nthem control 2,000 animal units at the $1.35 rate, and that is what it \nis under the Public Rangelands Improvement Act right now.\n  I ask you, is a small fee increase which amounts to $8 million for \nall of them--I am talking about 60 percent of the lands, 60 percent of \nthe 270 million acres of land we lease--is it too much to ask those \npeople to pay an additional $8 million a year? And it is not the money. \nIt is corporate welfare. How many times do you hear that term used \naround here in the Tax Code. So I ask you, is this small fee increase I \nam talking about really important to these people?\n  Anheuser-Busch, I understand they make a good beer. I am not a beer \ndrinker so I cannot attest to that. But in 1994, they were ranked the \n80th biggest corporation in America--not just on the Fortune 500, the \n80th biggest corporation in America. And what do they have? They have \n8,000 AUM's, and under my amendment they would pay the State fee on the \nadditional AUM's above 2,000, or 6,000. They would have to pay a small \nadditional fee on the extra 6,000 above 2,000.\n  I do not believe that would bankrupt Anheuser-Busch. You are probably \ntalking about somewhere between $6,000 and $60,000 a year, or the \nequivalent of a 15-second spot on Sunday afternoon at the football \ngame.\n  William Hewlett, who in this body never heard of Hewlett-Packard? \nWilliam Hewlett, 100,000 acres. My guess is that he is easily a \nbillionaire. William Hewlett is probably embarrassed to pay $1.35 an \nanimal unit month. He has permits for 100,000 acres. Why do I have this \nnagging suspicion that this bill would not bankrupt him?\n  Newmont Mining Co., probably the biggest gold mining company in \nAmerica--British owned, if that matters to you. I do not believe \nBritain would lease lands to run 12,000 cows on any of its land. I am \nnot making the case. I love England. They have been a steadfast, \nreliable ally for almost 200 years. They have 12,000 animal unit \nmonths, and I am saying that is 10,000 too many without paying \nsomething extra.\n  J.R. Simplot, the Idaho potato billionaire--billionaire--50,000 \nAUM's. Think about 50,000 AUM's. That could run as high as 4,000 head \nof cattle for 12 months at $1.35 a month.\n  And here is another corporation, Zenchiku, 6,000 AUM's and 40,000 \nacres.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to belabor this any further. I have \njust made the case that we are allowing the biggest corporations in \nAmerica to run thousands of cattle on Bureau of Land Management and \nForest Service lands.\n\n  You know something else. If a rancher leases lands for grazing on the \nOuachita National Forest in the great State of Arkansas, from whence I \ncome, you have to pay almost twice that much. If you lease grazing \nlands on any of the eastern forests of the United States, you have to \npay $2.50 per animal unit month. They are not a big item in my State so \nI do not really have a dog in the fight. All I am saying is this is \nvery little money, $8 million.\n  It is not right for 9 percent of the wealthiest people in America to \ncontrol 60 percent of all the grazing lands the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Forest Service permit to be grazed. That means the \nother 91 percent, whom everybody here is going to stand up and defend--\npeople from the Western States are going to get up and say, ``Isn't \nthis terrible. Think about it. All these poor little old people out \nthere trying to graze.'' I do not touch them. This amendment has \nnothing to do with them. They will still run cattle for $1.35 an animal \nunit month. I am not talking about 91 percent of the permittees. I am \ntalking about the 9 percent who control 60 percent of 270 million acres \nfor a ravaged price of $1.35 an animal unit month.\n  Madam President, this amendment is favored by the Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, Friends of the Earth, U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, Trout Unlimited, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the \nWilderness Society, the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural \nResources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club--and almost 260 million \npeople. I have not talked to all of them, but I can speak for them. \nThey favor this amendment, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I feel like we are coming back into a \nfamiliar discussion. I do not know how many times just in the last 2 \nyears I have heard the same thing. Fortunately, the Senator can use the \nsame charts, and that is good. That is a saving.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the Sun family, ranchers in \nWyoming. There are about 20 members of this family. They have several \nplaces they live on. They run more than 2,000 AUM's. However, when you \ndivide it up by the number of family members, they run about 168 head \nof cattle per family. That is hardly the millionaires the Senator talks \nabout; characterizes as the West being full of corporations. I want to \ntell you, come to Wyoming, come to Wyoming and show me all those \ncorporations.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the Red Desert Grazing \nAssociation. These are a number of ranches that go together in \nassociation and their lease is one lease; and they have more than 2,000 \nanimal units. But when you divide it up by the families involved, what \nyou are talking about are families, who make up the bulk of this \nindustry, trying to make a living with public lands. This idea of \ntrying to characterize it as being all these big corporations simply is \nnot accurate. It is not accurate. We have been through this before.\n  Let me tell you, No. 1, this is an appropriations bill. We talked \nabout this\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\nwhen we talked about the bill of substance, the grazing bill, which \nraised the price, which the Senator opposed. We talked about that in \nthe authorizing committee. That is where it is supposed to be \ndiscussed. And the grazers--we were willing to raise the price when you \nchange some of the conditions under which grazing takes place. No, now \nwe are going to do it on the appropriations bill, where we do nothing \nto change the conditions, but we will raise the price; raise the price \non family ranchers who make a living in this country.\n  Quite different than in the Senator's State, these lands were \nhomesteaded. The homesteaders took up the river bottoms, they took up \nthe water, they took up the shelter, they took up the winter feed. What \nwe are talking about here are the residual lands that were left, the \nresidual lands left out, away from the creek, the lands they can use in \nthe summer only if they develop the water, which is not true on your \nland, Senator. So you cannot compare this with the private land in \nArkansas.\n  Come out to 7,200 feet in Laramie, WY, and take a look at it. It is a \nlittle different, a little less valuable. Come out and see who takes \ncare of the fences. Do you take care of the fences, Senator, on your \nfarm? I think so. You do not take care of the fences on the public \nland.\n  Do you provide water on your farm, Senator? I think you probably do. \nYou do not provide the water in the West. The guy who leases it \nprovides the water. It is not the same. It is not the same.\n  The Senate already voted on a very similar amendment earlier this \nyear; same thing. We are back on it again. Grazing on public land and \nprivate land cannot be compared. Productivity--there are places in my \nState where it takes more than 100 acres, for 12 AUM. It is very \nunproductive land. It takes transportation there; you have to take care \nof the livestock when it is there, you have to ride, you have to take \ncare of predators. Those are differences. Those are differences, and \nthey show up in the costs. Obviously, the price of cattle is very low. \nThese rates that you refer to, which we wanted to raise, are tied to \nthe price of cattle. That is why they are as low as they are. They were \nhigher than that when the price was higher, and they will be higher \nagain. They will be higher when our grazing bill passes.\n\n  You indicate the grazing bill is done. It is not necessarily so. The \nthings go together. You cannot pick out the price and say let us leave \nthe rest of this stuff, leave it the way it is, but we will raise the \nprice. I do not agree with that. I think it is wrong. There is a major \ndifference between private and public land. Private land pastures tend \nto be self-sufficient. They have water, grass, fences. They are close \nenough so everyone can watch them. There are no predators there.\n  Public lands are quite often dependent on privately-owned water. They \nare not year-round pastures. You have to have private land to take care \nof them in the winter; you have to have feed, you have to the water, \nyou have to have all these things.\n  You cannot compare that with private lands. Private lands tend not to \nbe intermingled; public lands quite often are. They are also multiple \nuse, you have to provide for hunters--and you should. There is access \nfor hunters, gates are left open. It is not the same.\n  There is a report that was put out by Pepperdine University, which is \nnot exactly a bastion of western grazing, that said a number of things. \nThey concluded at the university:\n\n       Montana ranchers who rely on access to Federal grazing and \n     forage do not have a competitive advantage over those who do \n     not. Livestock operators with direct access to Federal forage \n     do not enjoy significant economic and financial advantages by \n     using that.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the Pitchfork Ranch in Meeteetse, WY, has some \ngrazing. What do they get in return? They also run their pastures in \nthe winter, their hay in the winter. That is something of a tradeoff. \nIt is not unusual. They are not the same as private lands.\n  The study also showed that these Montana operators, compared to those \nwho used all private lands, realized less gross revenue per animal unit \nmonth, incurred virtually the same operating costs, are subjected to \nthe higher costs of borrowed capital.\n  There are a number of other differences between public lands and \nprivate lands. A lot of the public lands have very burdensome Federal \nrequirements, NEPA requirements, land use planning processes. \nBasically, the States are quite different as well. They look to the \nlessee to manage the land. It simply is not accurate to say these lands \nshould be the same. They are not the same. There is a good deal more \nflexibility in private lands or State lands in terms of the management \nthan there is on Federal lands. On Federal lands they tell you how many \nyou can graze, when you can graze, when you are off, when you are on, \nhow many head of livestock we will run. There is an additional fee if \nyou happen to run leased livestock. It is not the same.\n  So, even disregarding the price level, I tell you there are a couple \nof things that are not accurate. No. 1 is these are not corporate \nranchers by and large. No. 2, it is not fair to compare private land \nleases with public land leases.\n  There are a number of things that ought to be changed. We worked very \nhard this year to make some changes in Bruce Babbitt's grazing \nrequirements. I want to tell you something. Grazing is part of western \nagriculture. Livestock is the largest endeavor in Wyoming as it is in \nmost of the Western States. Very many of the ranches there are not \nindependent, without public lands; nor are the public lands able to \nproduce without the private lands that go with it. It is not a matter \nof just saying we will lease this, we will lease this--these lands are \ninterlocking. These lands do, in fact, go together. We have tried very \nhard and will continue to try, and we will succeed, in making some \nchanges in grazing. But this is not the way to do it. This is the \nannual ritual, going through this idea of corporate welfare. I suppose \nthe thing to do would be to start through everybody's corporate \nwelfare. I think there are a few instances that could be talked about \nmost everywhere. I do not think this is corporate welfare. I cannot \nimagine that term being used in this instance.\n  Madam President, there are an awful lot of things that need to be \ntalked about, but we have talked about them many times. I am not sure \nit is productive to continue to go on and on about the same things. Let \nme just make a couple of points in closing.\n  No. 1 is that if we are to talk about grazing and grazing fees and \ngrazing regulations, we ought to talk about the package so that we can \nmake those changes that do need to be made. And almost everyone agrees \nthat they should.\n  No. 2. If you are going to make price comparisons, price comparisons \nneed to be made on the relative value of the product and not on a \ncomparison to something that is not comparable, and that is what they \nare seeking to do here.\n  No. 3. We ought to deal with it in a committee of substance, a \ncommittee that has jurisdiction. The Senator is on that committee. He \nhas been through this argument in the committee and is unable to get \nsupport. He has been through this argument on the floor and unable to \nget support, but we keep coming back. It is the fall ritual.\n  Finally, if we are going to try to deal with family farms and family \nfarmers--that is what we are in Wyoming, that is what we are in the \nState of Texas, somewhat different in some places. Fifty percent of our \nState belongs to the Federal Government. Arizona is even more; Nevada, \n87 percent. I don't think that is the case in Arkansas.\n  So you need to take into account the fact that our economy depends on \nthe kinds of decisions that are made with respect to policy of public \nlands. Bruce Babbitt has more to do with the future economy of Wyoming \nthan any person living in the State. That is a shame. I am sorry for \nthat.\n  So when we talk about changes we want to make, I hope you will take \ninto account these are family farmers, these are ranchers just like \nyours, just like New Hampshire, trying to make a living, not wealthy, \nnot corporations, but trying to have multiple use of those resources so \nthat they do yield not only for them but for the communities that they \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, as they have in the \npast, and continue to work for better ways of multiple use of \nresources, but keep in mind they should be multiple use.\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first, I wish to recognize the fine \nstatement given by the Senator from Wyoming who expresses well his \nthoughts and purposes on this issue. I am not in agreement, but I have \nthe highest regard for him as a Senator and respect the fact his \nposition is one sincerely and thoughtfully reached.\n  However, I join with my colleague from Arkansas in supporting his \namendment and my amendment to address this issue of how we bring into \nbalance the cost of grazing on public lands relative to the needs of \nthe cattlemen and the needs of the taxpayer. First of all, it should be \nstressed that this is not a local issue solely. It is a national issue. \nIt is not even a western issue. It is a national issue. The 270 million \nacres of land that are subject to grazing permits belong to all \nAmericans. They are America's heritage, all Americans' heritage.\n  The current grazing fee formula produces a fee that covers only a \nsmall part of the costs of Federal grazing programs and is far below \nthe rate charged by Western States and private lessors. The current \nFederal fee, as has been stated, is $1.35 animal unit month, AUM. This \nlevel mirrors the floor set by Executive order during the Reagan \nadministration. The Department of Agriculture's Economic Research \nService predicts the $1.35 fee will remain the fee charged by the \nFederal Government through the year 2005.\n  The current fee, $1.35, means it costs less to feed a 600-pound cow \non public lands than it costs to feed your pet dog, your pet cat or \neven your parakeet, thanks to the subsidy paid for by the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Two percent--2 percent--of the 22,000 permittees control 50 percent \nof the BLM acreage that is grazed. Two percent control 50 percent. So \nwe are not talking here about the small farmer, which was referred to \nby the Senator from Wyoming. We are talking about the large cattlemen.\n  Additionally, it should be pointed out that the wealthiest 9 percent \nof the ranchers graze cattle on public lands controlling 60 percent of \nthe grange land. So what this amendment does is try to address that \ndisproportionate allocation of assets to a very small number of \nranchers.\n\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, the Economic Research \nService again, under S. 1459, the Public Rangelands Managements Act, \nwhich passed the Senate but unfortunately has stalled in the House, the \nfee paid by ranchers would have increased to $1.63. I heard it \nmentioned by the Senator from Arkansas that it actually might have been \n$2.18. Whatever, it would have increased, and that is, obviously, a \nsignificantly higher number than the $1.35 which is being paid this \nyear.\n  This increase, however, is still less than the Federal fee paid \nbetween the years 1989 and 1994. We are actually working at a fee base \nwhich is less than what was paid to ranchers back in the period 1989 to \n1994, and even if the increases were put in place, it would still be \nless than those fees that were charged just a few years ago.\n  The amendment which has been offered is a very simple amendment. It \nraises the fee charged by the Federal Government to the country's \nwealthiest ranchers--and I think this is important to stress--we are \ntalking about 9 percent who own--control--60 percent of the range. They \ndon't own it, it is owned by the taxpayers, those who graze more than \n2,000 AUM's on Federal lands. It also maintains the current fee--and \nthis is important--the current fee which, remember, as we just \nmentioned, is less than was charged a few years ago for a 5-year \nperiod. It maintains that current fee for ranchers who have less than \n2,000 AUM. So, for the smaller and the moderate-size rancher, he stays \nthe same, $1.35. For the larger rancher, it grows to a reasonable \nnumber.\n  Under this amendment, therefore, 9 percent of the ranchers, those \noperating 2,000 or more AUM's, would see an increase in the fee paid to \ngraze cattle on public lands, while 91 percent of the family ranchers, \nthe ones referred to by the Senator from Wyoming, their livestock fee \non Federal lands would remain the same, $1.35 AUM's.\n  Those companies and corporations which would be impacted are \nsignificant, and the Senator from Arkansas went through a long list of \nsome of them. There is the billionaire rancher who owns more than \n50,000 AUM's in Iowa, Oregon, and Nevada. There is Newmont Mining Co., \na wealthy gold mining company, which controls 12,000 AUM's, and there \nis Anheuser-Busch which controls 8,000 AUM's, the Japanese company, \nZenchiku which is involved here. It is ironic, the American taxpayers \nend up subsidizing a Japanese company which owns Japanese farming \nrights in the United States to ship beef back to Japan when we are \nalready running a significant trade surplus with Japan. That is the way \nit works.\n  Remember, this amendment does not impact the small or moderate-size \nfamily farmer, it impacts the big guys, that 9 percent that controls \nmore than 2,000 AUM's.\n  This amendment cannot and should not be construed as being a threat, \ntherefore, to the small rancher.\n  Under this amendment, small ranches, whose operating AUM's are less \nthan 2,000, will continue to have this $1.35 fee. Under the amendment, \nthese small ranchers will pay 43 percent less per AUM in 1997, and each \nyear thereafter, than they paid if they were ranching back in 1980. \nRemember this, under this amendment, those small ranchers, medium-sized \nranchers, in fact, will be paying 43 percent less to ranch on Federal \nlands than they paid in 1980. The point, however, is that the large \nranchers should not also be paying 43 percent less.\n  Thus, this amendment assures that the wealthier ranchers, those with \nmore than 2,000 AUM's, that billionaire rancher up in Idaho, Anheuser-\nBusch, that Japanese company, will pay a fair fee for the right to \nranch on what is public land.\n  This chart I have here, ``Public Land Grazing Fees, 1980-1996,'' \nhighlights a point I have just been making, that those ranchers on \nFederal land in 1980 were paying $2.36. And with an inflation-adjusted \nrate, it would have been $4.60, but actually today they are paying \n$1.35. So, the difference between these two prices, if you have it \nadjusted for inflation, would be the real difference in what we are now \nspending to subsidize people on Federal lands as versus the 1980 rate.\n  What we are saying is that the small rancher can keep paying $1.35, \nwhich is almost $1 less than what they paid in 1980, and we are not \nsuggesting that even the large ranchers should pay the inflation-\nadjusted rate, $4.60; we are just saying that the larger ranchers \nshould have to pay a fairer rate. In many instances, that fair rate \nwould be significantly less than the $4.60 that should be charged if \nthere was an inflation adjustment from the 1980 rate.\n  The argument is often made by individuals who oppose this amendment, \nthe Federal Government should be able to set such a low rate with \nregard to the use of Federal land for grazing due to the low quality of \nthe Federal land, if the Federal land on which the sheep and cattle are \ngrazing has little or no investment value and is of little value \ngenerally.\n  I have another chart which I think pretty much dispels that argument. \nThis chart shows exactly the opposite. In 1996, the Federal Government \ncollected receipts worth $14.5 million based upon $1.35 AUM paid by all \nranchers. However, according to the Bureau of Land Management, the \nFederal Government spent--spent--$58 million on rangeland management \nand improvement. That is a net windfall of $43 million for all ranches \nusing the public lands.\n  This funding for ranchland management improvement has a direct effect \nupon the land improvements. Improvements that are involved here include \nthe seeding, weeding, fencing, water collection on public land used by \nwealthy ranchers. These are very conservative numbers taken straight \nfrom the BLM. Some estimates of the annual loss to the Treasury, using \nthe current fee system, range up to $150 million. In fact, there was \none estimate of $400 million done by the Cato Institute.\n  But the practical implications of this is, if the land were worth \nless, it has clearly got to be worth at least what you are investing. \nIf you are investing $58 million in it and you are only getting $14 \nmillion for that investment,\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\nfirst, you are not doing very well on your return for investment, but, \nsecond, it is fairly obvious that the value of the land is \napproximately 4 times, 3\\1/2\\ times the value that is being charged for \nit.\n  So the argument that this is valueless land or land of less value \nthan States' lands or private lands simply does not hold up to the \nnumbers, to the very simple numbers which come from the BLM. Grazing \nfees are decreasing, even though the Federal Government collects only a \nfraction of the moneys spent for rangeland improvement.\n\n  This chart here, which was referred to, I believe, by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, illustrates that only about 25 percent of grazing fees' \nreceipts collected go to the General Treasury. In fact, 50 percent of \nthese funds go back to rangeland improvement. That was mentioned \nextensively by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  So not only do farmers, cattle ranchers receive a subsidized rate, \nthe fee does not even cover the cost of the Federal upkeep. These \nranchers pay much too little, causing the rest of the American \ntaxpayers to pick up the price, which is much too high.\n  The average private land fee charged per AUM since 1981 has increased \n32 percent. I have another chart which shows this. The average private \nland fee charged per AUM since 1981 has increased 32 percent, from \n$7.88 in 1981 to $10.30, in 1995. The average State fee charged for \npeople to put cattle on State land has increased 49 percent, from $2.53 \nto $3.76.\n  The payment for leasing Federal land during this same timeframe, 1981 \nto 1996, has, as I mentioned before, decreased--decreased--43 percent. \nThat, simply, is not fair to the general taxpayer. Private grazing land \nlease rates continue to remain substantially higher than the price \ncharged by the Federal Government, and, as I mentioned before, this is \nnot necessarily a function of the land being more valuable. Or, if it \nis a function of the land being more valuable, it is not the fact that \nthe Federal land has not had a significant amount of investment put \ninto it--in fact, an investment which is about 3\\1/2\\ times the amount \nof the fees raised.\n  This chart here shows the difference between the private and the \npublic grazing fee rate. The chart shows the amount of money the \nFederal Government receives in grazing fees receipts over the last 6 \nyears, $178 million, versus the amount of money the Federal Government \nwill receive in the grazing fees over the next 6 years. That is $178 \nversus $133 million. The Federal Government is estimating that it will \nreceive $45 million less, therefore, in grazing fee receipts over the \nnext 6 years than it received over the prior 6 years.\n  Is this for less grazing? I do not think so. It is because, for a \nperiod in there, we were charging a rate that was much closer to what \nis reasonable, and that rate has been cut.\n  Obviously, again, the taxpayers are taking the short end of the \nstick. This makes absolutely no sense. In a time of tightening budgets \nand higher deficits, we are on a pattern to collect less money from \nthese huge ranchers, and, unfortunately, the giveaway to the wealthy \nranchers is growing.\n  Why should the American taxpayers continue to subsidize only a select \nfew? Three percent of the Nation's cattle operators and 5 percent of \nthe sheep producers have Federal grazing permits. So 97 percent of \nAmerica's cattle operators, 95 percent of America's sheep producers do \nnot use Federal lands, so they are not getting the benefit of this \nsubsidy. Every other rancher, except those grazing cattle on public \nlands, has had to keep up with the cost of inflation, paying higher \nprices for corn, for grain used to feed their cattle. But the cost of \nusing the taxpayers' Federal rangeland is estimated to remain at an \nall-time low, $1.35 per AUM, through the year 2005.\n  This chart, which is another way of stating the chart table that the \nSenator from Arkansas displayed, shows the difference between what is \npaid on private land and State land fees versus the $1.35 AUM's. While \nthe Federal Government allows ranchers to graze for $1.35, this chart \nshows the Western States breakdown of the fees charged, and in every \ncase it far exceeds what we get at the Federal level.\n  Again, we heard the argument that is because this land is better \nland; maybe it is better land. But the fact is, this chart shows beyond \nany question of logic or debate, when you are putting $58 million back \ninto the Federal land for the $14 million you are taking out, you \nclearly have an investment in the land which far exceeds the value that \nis being charged for the lands, and thus you should at least try to \nreturn a better investment of that for the taxpayer. The land may not \nbe as good for grazing, but at least from a standpoint of investment, \nthe dollar figure is 3\\1/2\\ times that rate.\n  This amendment seeks to increase the fee charged by the Federal \nGovernment, to bring it in line with what the fair market value of land \nshould be. Under this amendment the largest ranchers--remember, we are \ndealing with just the largest ranchers, that 9 percent of the ranchers \nwho control the large acreage, who control more than 2,000 AUM's--will \nbe charged the higher of the average State fee in which the Federal \nGovernment is located or the Federal fee plus 25 percent. Small \nranchers and moderate-sized ranchers will continue to get the $1.35 \nrate, which rate remains 43 percent less than what they were paying.\n  This amendment is done on a sliding scale, meaning either the large \nranchers--the billionaire cattlemen, Anheuser-Busch, and the Japanese \ncorporation--get the first 2,000 AUM's at a lower rate, $1.35, and they \ndo not start to pay more until they exceed the 2,000, so if they have \n2,050, only the last 50 will be charged the increased fee, which of \ncourse will be some additional money. In the instance of Anheuser-Busch \nwhere they have 8,000 AUM's, 6,000 of those additional AUM's exceed the \n2,000, and will be subject to the higher fee.\n  Is that unfair to Anheuser-Busch? No, it is not, because the \ntaxpayer, as has been pointed out on a number of occasions, is already \ndramatically subsidizing the cost of Anheuser-Busch running its cattle \non public land or that Japanese company which has the 6,000 AUM's. Yes, \non the additional 4,000 AUM's they will have to pay a higher fee. Is \nthat unfair to the Japanese company? No, it is not, because the \ntaxpayer is already substantially subsidizing that Japanese company's \nrunning of cattle on Federal lands.\n  What we are suggesting is that the taxpayer receive a percentage of a \nbetter return on the investment that it is making in that public land \nfor the benefit of those cattle. It is not asking that a better return \ncome from the smaller or moderate-sized company, but is only asking \nthat the better return come from the larger--the millionaire cattlemen, \nactually the multimillionaire cattlemen in this instance--and the \ninternational companies. Some of the other companies that are involved \nin this are Texaco, Hewlett-Packard, Getty, Union Oil, Hunt Oil, and \nthe Newmont Mining Corp.\n  The amendment is estimated to save the American people about $8 \nmillion in 1997 and $40 million over 6 years. By Federal standards in \nthis Senate that is not a dramatic amount of money. It is a lot of \nmoney in New Hampshire. In fact, we could run a State government for a \nconsiderable amount of time on $48 million.\n  The fact is it is important that we make this statement. These are \npublic lands. The taxpayer does have a right to expect a reasonable \nreturn on their investment in these public lands. The fact that we have \ntargeted this amendment so it will just affect the wealthy, those who \nhave the wherewithal to pay the higher fee, does, I think on its face, \nmake it a fair amendment.\n  Thus, I join with the Senator from Arkansas and hope that the Senate \nwill favorably consider this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand there is not a request for \nany time this afternoon beyond what I use unless the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire wants to speak again this evening. I want to \nstate to the Senator from the standpoint of this Senator, and I have \nnot talked with Senator Gregg, I do not need a lot of time tomorrow \nbefore the vote. I told the managing chairman 15 or 20 minutes on our \nside tomorrow, 30 minutes max, is all I need before the vote. I want to \nproceed with some dispatch.\n\n  First of all, fellow Senators, you all voted on this amendment last \nyear and you voted it down. I do not believe anything has changed, at \nleast not in the\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\ngeneral intent of the amendment. It is obvious to everyone that in the \nWest those who are engaged in cattle ranching have gone through the \nworst of all possible times. Not only have they suffered a great \ndrought which is still affecting what they will graze and how they can \ngraze for the next 2 or 3 years, but cattle prices for some reason have \ngone into the tank.\n  As a matter of fact, I was out in rural New Mexico and somebody \nlooked out at a ranch and said if you were here 2 years ago and there \nwere 500 head out there grazing, each one on average in gross receipts \nwould be worth $1,000. Today, you have 500 out there and they are worth \n$500 each--the very same cow, the very same beef, the very same market \nbut it is only half of the price. So that cow that would have been \nworth $1,000 in gross receipts is now worth half that amount, as you \ndrive through rural New Mexico where many, many, hundreds of small \nranches exist.\n  The second point, those who propose the amendment speak of 2,000 \nanimal unit months and speak of those as if that is a very big rancher. \nLet me suggest in the State of New Mexico and a few other States--we \nare not alone--you graze cattle on the public domain and your own fee \nsimple land and any State land you might have, and you do that for all \n12 months in a year, not for 3, not for the summer months, or not for \nthe fall months or not for the winter months, but all 12, so let us put \nthis in perspective. For my State, this means 167 head of cattle for \none year. That is what 2,000 animal unit months mean.\n  When they speak today of large ranchers, make sure everybody \nunderstands in a State like New Mexico, 12-months a year of grazing is \na necessity because we have a great deal of public land that is \navailable on a yearlong basis. We are a water-based State. That is, the \nwater-on the ranch often, times serves as the base property. You graze \nthem there, and you keep them there--you do not graze them on your land \nfor 9 months and take them to the high country for 3 months where you \ngraze them on public domain or permits. Two thousand animal unit months \nis 167 head of cattle grazed year round on a ranch in New Mexico or a \nranch in Arizona where you graze them 12 months a year. Is that a large \nranch? I assure fellow Senators there is not a rancher who can even \nmake a living on 167 head. These are small ranches, run by families who \nfor decades have had a small amount of acreage for their permits, and \nthey graze 100 to 167, 180, some of them only 50, to supplement their \nincomes and stay close to the land and keep a culture alive.\n  Make sure we understand that while big corporate names are thrown \naround, in a year-round grazing area we are talking about hundreds of \nsmall ranchers who happen to be included in the definition that are \nbeing discussed here on the floor as very large corporate ranches.\n  Second, my good friend from New Hampshire had a chart. I am sorry I \ndo not have any charts today. I will just recollect one. There was one \nup there that says you only get about $14 million from grazing permits \non the public domain and that we spend in excess of $48 million--if \nthat is the number--and the Senator concluded, is that not a shame, is \nthat not a shame. We ought to collect more money for grazing because we \nare spending $48 million on the public domain but that bridges one gap \nthat should not be bridged. For that conclusion assumes the $48 million \nof taxpayers' money being spent on the millions of acres of public \ndomain, that it is all being spent for grazing permits. Quite wrong.\n  There are many other activities that yield money. In fact, timbering \nyields money, recreation yields money for the Bureau of Land \nManagement, which has the weakest kind of land, since it was generally \nthe leftover lands. I contend that in almost every Western State the \ntotal receipts from the public domain exceed what is paid out for the \npurpose of land and resource management, and one of the only exceptions \nis California where they have to spend a lot more money, and much of it \nis not spent on grazing, incidentally, but rather maintaining other \nkinds of activities on the public domain.\n  So while it sounds nice that we ought to raise the fees for grazing \nso we will get closer to $48 million, which is the expenditure for \npublic domain, we must ask the question, how much does the public \ndomain actually spend on grazing, which may benefit other resources, \nand how much does it collect from all sources? It comes much closer to \na break-even situation on what we spend versus what we take in when you \nconsider all receipts from the public domain.\n  Now, once again, the chart as it appeared, would imply that there is \nautomatically and of necessity and in some rational way a relationship \nbetween private land and public land. Mr. President, there is nobody \nwho will tell you in the Bureau of Land Management, that their millions \nof acres in all our sovereign States in the West are choice lands. In \nfact, they will tell you, by a process of selection they are among the \nleast productive of lands.\n  The private lands, on the other side, are among the best of lands. As \na matter of fact, to compare what you pay for a 1,000 acres of Bureau \nof Land Management land with what you pay for a thousand acres of \nprivate land, is not reasonable. The best analogy I have been able to \ncome up with is something like this: What you pay for an apartment that \nhas no utilities, no furniture, no telephone, just a stripped-down \napartment, compared with the next guy over is renting a fully furnished \napartment, that has all utilities, and a telephone in it. Is the price \neven because the size of the buildings are the same? Of course not. One \nis without any add-ons that come from the landlord or owner, and one \nhas many, many positives added. Most private land is well-fenced, at \nthe cost of the owner, has water on it, at the cost of the owner, is \nheavily vegetated by the very nature of it being private and part of a \nhomestead.\n  Let me go through, for a couple of minutes--I believe I tried my best \nto account for what a 2,000 animal unit month ranch really is in my \nState. It is a very small ranch. There may be some that are 10,000 and \n20,000, but I guarantee you the overwhelming number of ranches in my \nState are somewhere between 50 and 500, in terms of the number of head \nthat are raised on the public domain. Yet, many of those would exceed \nthe 2,000 animal unit months being referred to here because they must \ngraze all year round.\n  Having said that, let me give a little history of what is going on. \nOn May 25, 1995, I introduced S. 852, the Livestock Grazing Act. On \nJune 22, 1995, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a \nhearing on that bill. On July 19, they favorably reported the bill, \nwith modifications, for consideration by the Senate. Following that \nmarkup, the cosponsors determined that there was not enough bipartisan \nsupport for the legislation and that there ought to be some additional \nchanges. We initiated a number of discussions, exchanges and meetings \namong Democrat and Republican Senators and the staff, trying to find \nsome common ground.\n  On November 30, 1995, the Energy Committee again took a look at the \ngrazing reform legislation and reported out as an original bill, S. \n1459. On March 20 and 21 of this year, the Senate debated the issue of \ngrazing reform and ultimately passed a bill that would have increased \nthe grazing fee by about 40 percent, as well as to set new parameters \nby which grazing would be administered on the BLM and Forest Service \nland. During that 2-day debate, the Senate considered a Bumpers \namendment that was identical in concept with the one we are considering \ntoday. The Senate wisely, in my opinion, rejected this amendment when \nwe were debating grazing legislation in its own right.\n  Mr. President, that grazing bill is still in the House. Negotiations \nare taking place. It has a grazing fee increase, and it does not \nattempt to set grazing fees based upon whether you are a little rancher \nor a big rancher. As a matter of fact, even the Department of the \nInterior, which has been heavily engaged in trying to get more \nregulation of the public domain, has regularly been against a two-\ntiered grazing fee for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is \nthat they contend it will be difficult to manage from an administrative \nstandpoint.\n  With this history, I see no reason for us to approve a rider on an \nappropriation bill which is similar to an amendment which has been \nturned down here in a debate on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\n  There is before us now an amendment which, once again, tries to draw \ncomparisons between the public domain, which belongs to the United \nStates, some of which is under lease, and State-leased land, and in \nsome cases the Bumpers amendment would set a fee for some ranchers at \nthe level of the fee charged for State lands in that State.\n\n  I want to call to the Senate's attention a Congressional Research \nService report entitled ``Survey of Grazing Programs in Western \nStates.'' In this report, Senators can see for themselves the diversity \nof grazing programs and regulations that the States have employed on \nState land. For example, in some States, a holder of a grazing permit \nhas the right to control public access to that tract of State land. So \nin some States, if you hold a State permit, you can deny access to \neveryone because your permit grants you exclusivity in all respects.\n  In others, all improvements constructed on State land are allowed to \nbe owned by the permittee. Still in others, State land under grazing \npermits are dedicated solely to livestock production, and there are no \nallowances made for the benefit of wildlife on those lands.\n  All of these conditions add to the value of the leased land from the \nstandpoint of a livestock producer, and these regulations are in stark \ncontrast to those on Federal land. We cannot expect a rancher to pay \nthe same for State and Federal grazing permits, if we are not willing \nto allow the same regulations to be enforced.\n  So I would say perhaps the proponents of this amendment ought to \nadd--in the event we are going to charge the same fee--then we ought to \ngive the ranchers the same benefits and the same set of regulations \nthat the State land is governed by. I would think that is logical and \nfair.\n  I can tell you for sure--and my good friend, Senator Gorton, would \nagree with me--that you could not grant exclusivity to the public \ndomain for a rancher. They would talk about hunting, fishing, and \nrecreation. Yet in some States, the State property is leased for \ngrazing, and that is all it can be used for. They would like us to pay \nthat for the Federal land. I would merely say, let us add to it, that \nall the State regulations would apply, or in other words, inhibitions \nwill apply to the Federal domain which couldn't pass muster here, the \nDepartment of Interior, or anywhere.\n  For instance, in the State of Nevada, they set their fee on State \nland by bidding it, meaning they are giving different values to \ndifferent forage, a different value of the grazing land. We have never \ndone that in the United States on the public domain. We have never gone \nout and said, you ought to pay this much in the State of Oregon because \nit is a little better grazing than you pay for in New Mexico, for we \nwould have a devil of a job trying to figure that out. Yet, that is the \nway they figure it out on State land in the State of Nevada, which \nwould certainly not be relevant, nor would it work on the Federal \npublic domain.\n  I believe that this amendment was not a good idea when I alluded to \nthe dates that it was debated in the Senate earlier this year, and it \nis no better today. When the Senate considered this amendment in March, \nthe Senator from Arkansas indicated, as he has today, that the \namendment was not intended to adversely affect small- and medium-sized \nranches. He indicated in his amendment that it would only impose higher \nfees on ``corporate ranchers.''\n  Frankly, I do not see any difference between a corporate rancher that \nis big and a sole proprietorship that is big, nor between a corporate \nranch that is small and a noncorporate subchapter S partnership that is \nsmall. He indicated in March corporate ranches only, and the big ones \nare the only ones that would get an increase. As we explained in March, \nhe has missed his intended mark, and for that reason, and that reason \nalone, the amendment should be defeated. The Bumpers amendment would \nset an arbitrary number of 2,000 animal unit months as a definition of \na corporate ranchers.\n  In New Mexico, for instance, an example comes to mind as to how it \nwould work exactly opposite from what is intended.\n  Among the top five property owners in my State is Ted Turner, hardly \nsomeone who could be considered a family rancher. In New Mexico, Mr. \nTurner owns a large ranch made up primarily of deeded land. It \nsurrounds an area of Federal land for which he holds grazing permits. \nUnder current grazing regulations, he can easily arrange his allotment \nsuch that he would use only 1,999 AUM's on Federal land. This means \nthat he would qualify for the family rancher's fee, because he would \nnot meet the 2,000 animal unit month threshold. He could do this \nbecause his ranch is made up mostly of deeded land, and he has the \nflexibility to move animals from public to private without a major \nimpact on his operation.\n  Let me tell the Senate about another situation that is far more \ncommon than Mr. Turner's. This side of the story involves smaller \nranching operations that actually do provide the primary source of \nincome for real families struggling to make ends meet. These ranchers \nare more reliant on forage that is grown on Federal land, and some for \nalmost all of their forage. These ranches involve small amounts of fee \nland, small amounts of State land, and large amounts of Federal grazing \nland.\n  Additionally, a large number of these family ranchers graze their \nlivestock on Federal land 12 months out of the year. In other words, \nthey are not seasonal permits that are common in some other States. \nUnder this amendment, however, if a family owned and operated a ranch \nthat runs 167 cows on Federal land, it would be considered a corporate \nranch and subject to the higher fee. Actually, we have hundreds of \nthese kinds of ranches in the State of New Mexico. I do not know about \nother States. Certainly, I do not know about Arkansas. But in New \nMexico, it is impossible to support a family on the income derived from \n167 cows even if grazing fees are zero.\n\n  So I opposed this fee in March, and today my concern is still as \nstrong as it was, principally for family ranches in the State of New \nMexico. These concerns are compounded by the lasting impacts of severe \ndrought, from which they are beginning to recover, continuing low \ncattle and wool prices, which do not seem to be moving, and continued \nhigh feed costs. Many of the ranchers I described that would be \nconsidered corporate ranchers under the Bumpers amendment would simply \nbe forced off the land where they have struggled to make a living for \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, I would also conclude by suggesting that it is very \neasy when you have such a broad expanse of Federal land, with millions \nand millions of acres, between the Departments Agriculture and \nInterior, which are leased for grazing, and that have been leased for \nyears, it is easy to come to the floor and pick out some that are \nreally owned by giant American companies. But I believe that it is very \ndifficult to make the case that in this country we ought to treat them \ndifferently than we treat others with similar acreage under lease. \nMaybe we want to, but I believe we should not.\n  I believe you ought to treat a family corporation the same as you \nwould treat Budweiser in terms of a ranch that involves Federal grazing \npermits. But, most importantly, I want to make sure that we do not use \nthis kind of tactic to inadvertently attack small and medium sized \nfamily ranches in our States and which to some extent provide families \nwith a living, but for the most part are part of a tradition. The \nfamily must stay with it. They get other jobs. They survive, and they \nkeep a culture alive.\n  I, for one, believe we should not let ourselves get carried away with \nthese ``Uncle Sugar'' checks that are shown on these diagrams. We ought \nto look at the big, broad picture, and treat everybody the same. If we \nwant to change the law, change it for everybody.\n  We have about 5,000 permits in my State. I am far more concerned \nabout the fact that many of them are borderline right now in terms of \nnot being able to hold the permits because they cannot make a living \nand make ends meet. That is really the case, if they borrowed money on \ntheir home to stay on their ranch during these rather terrible times in \nterms of prices and costs. To add to that an increase in fees, at this \npoint, seems to be an invitation to more and more bankruptcies among \nthem.\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\n  Frankly, the bill which would increase the fees 40 percent is still \npending in the House. It passed the Senate. It has been before the \ncommittees in the House, and we are still working on trying to get that \nout. If we get it out, we will have a chance to vote yes or no on the \nincreased fees that the Senate passed, but combined with a reform of \nthe grazing regulations. It should not this fee which the Senate has \nalready rejected.\n  It seems to me that we ought to give that normal process a chance. If \nit does not work this year, it is obvious that a lot of work has to be \ndone next year and the year after. But I hope we do not burden an \nappropriations bill with a change in the grazing fee this year under \nthe circumstances I have outlined and discussed with the Senate here \ntoday.\n  I thank the Senate for yielding me time, and I thank the manager of \nthe bill--for I am not sure I will get a chance in the future--for the \nexcellent work he has done overall on this bill. I want to say that I \nhope, and will work with him and others, to see if we can't get this \nbill put into a final form and get it passed this year. I hope it is \nnot part of a continuing resolution. But if it is, I hope we are able \nto get most of the work done so the continuing resolution will carry a \nnumber of changes, and we will not simply be adopting last year's \nappropriations.\n  I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I assume the Senator from North Dakota is \nhere on a different subject. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is an unaccustomed role for me to come \nto the floor and speak in opposition to an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arkansas. I find so often I come to the floor to support a \nnumber of his amendments, but I oppose this amendment. I think it is \nnot only bad timing but an inappropriate remedy to what the Senator \ndescribes as a problem.\n  I would like to give some context for my feeling about this. I grew \nup in southwestern North Dakota out near the Badlands in ranching \ncountry. My father raised some livestock. We had some cattle. We did \nnot ever run cattle on public lands. We have never been a family that \nhad access to public lands and therefore the grazing fees that exist on \npublic lands.\n  I know something about the cattle business but not nearly as much as \nthose who are ranching full time in parts of North Dakota today. I know \na little about calving, about what ranchers go through. I understand \nwhat the ranch families go through in the spring; 4 o'clock in the \nmorning, with it snowing and cold and running across muddy fields \ntrying to deal with a difficult calving situation to save some calves \nand save some cows.\n  It is not an easy life. A lot of these ranchers have discovered, with \nthe bottom falling out of cattle prices in recent months, it is pretty \nhard to make a living doing something they love to do.\n  The question today is not about whether ranching is a wonderful \nlifestyle for those many hundreds of ranchers. In North Dakota, these \nare really people who are the salt of the earth. These are wonderful \npeople who do it on their own and battle the elements and battle the \nmarkets that they cannot control but try to control what they can on \ntheir family ranch and try to make a living out of it all. They would \nbe, I suppose, perplexed about a lot of this public debate.\n  What has been offered is a discussion about what should the \nappropriate grazing fees be on public lands. We see proposed a schedule \nof what the private lands rent for, what the State would rent its lands \nfor, what grazing fees would be on State lands compared to what grazing \nfees would be on Federal land.\n  I should start by saying we do not have much Bureau of Land \nManagement [BLM] land in North Dakota. Most of the grazing in North \nDakota is on the grasslands and that, of course, is managed by the U.S. \nForest Service. We do not have giant ranches. We do not have big \ncorporations that are ranching in my State. We do not have giant \nranchers that control land as far as you can drive in a pickup truck \nwith two tanks of gas. We do not have any of that. We have a bunch of \nfamilies out there who are struggling trying to raise some cattle and \nmake a living.\n  When these folks pay a grazing fee and have a permit to graze their \ncattle on public lands, you cannot, in my judgment, appropriately \ncompare that to what private rent is on private lands or what the State \nis proposing for grazing fees or charging for grazing fees on State \nlands.\n  Now, why is that? Because if you are raising cattle, paying a grazing \nfee on the grasslands in North Dakota, it is not just you paying some \nrent on some land on which you are going to raise your cattle. That is \nnot what the transaction is about. It is true, these ranchers have paid \na fee then to put those cattle on that land to graze, but they have \nother responsibilities too.\n  Those are multiple-use lands by law so there are recreational \nresponsibilities those lands have to bear. Somebody wants to \ncome hiking on those lands. Do you think someone is prevented from \nhiking on the grasslands? Oh, no. The fact that someone else is grazing \ntheir cattle does not prevent the multiple-use responsibility for \nrecreation on those lands.\n\n  What about mineral development? Is there an opportunity for mineral \ndevelopment even though some rancher is grazing cattle on that land? Of \ncourse, because that is part of multiple use.\n  What about the requirement for that land to be productive for the \nraising of deer, whitetail deer, upland game? Well, that is part of the \nresponsibility under multiple use as well.\n  If that rancher wants to put a water tank on that land, the question \nof where that rancher locates that water tank, is that up to the \nrancher? It is on private lands, not on public land. That has an \nimpact. And that land is multiple use. It might be that water tank has \nto be located near a woody draw where it is going to have a more \nfavorable impact on the production of certain kinds of animals, provide \na better habitat.\n  So these are lands with multiple-use responsibilities, and that is \nnot just a concept. That is in law. Every one of the users--minerals, \nmining, oil, hikers, hunters, all of the users--impose their right to \nthe multiple use on these lands.\n  So are these different lands than the other lands that are being \ncompared? Of course they are. Do you think if you rent private pasture \nland, you have to say, well, now, I have paid to rent this land and now \nI have responsibilities with respect to where I put this water tank and \nits effect on the production of deer? Do you have to think about the \nfact that you have responsibilities to a mineral company, or I have \nresponsibilities to hikers? Simply not the case with private land. I \njust make the point that I think these comparisons that we see are not \nfair or accurate.\n  Let me make a couple of points about the specific amendment. This \namendment creates a threshold of 2,000 animal unit months. The formula \nfor AUM's does not mean much to people, I suppose, unless they are \ninvolved in AUM's computations with the BLM or Forest Service and are \nrunning cattle on public lands. But we are not talking here about big \noperators or big ranchers when you talk about 2,000 AUM's. For someone \nwho is grazing cattle 12 months a year, you are talking about running \n160, 170 cows, at which point you have used the 2,000 AUM's.\n  That is not a large ranch. That is not going to make much of a living \nfor someone out there struggling to make a decent living. So this \nthreshold of 2,000 AUM's and the implication that above that we are \ntalking about large ranchers, corporate ranchers, is simply not the \ncase. I know a number of people, a good number of people in North \nDakota who have more than 2,000 AUM's, and they are struggling, family-\nsized ranchers desperately trying to make a go of it.\n  Cattle prices have fallen through the floor on them. Many of them are \nhanging on by their financial fingertips. I think they would be most \nsurprised to hear that someone judges them to be anything more than a \nsmall family rancher out there somewhere in western or central North \nDakota trying to make a decent living.\n\n[[Page S10593]]\n\n  I mentioned that, in my judgment, we have discussed, debated, and \nmassaged this issue in several different ways over the last years, and \nI suspect we will continue to do that. The Senator from New Mexico in \nhis recent discussion pointed out that the Senate has passed \nlegislation which does in fact increase grazing fees, and that it is \nnow awaiting action by the House.\n  It is not the case that those of us from areas where the Federal \nGovernment has lands for which a grazing fee is charged have said there \nshall be no increase in grazing fees. That is not the case. In fact, \nlegislation that has increased the grazing fees has been supported by \nmany of the people who have spoken today in opposition to this \namendment.\n  That is not the issue. The issue is whether this kind of amendment \noffered today on this piece of legislation makes sense for the Senate. \nAnd the answer is no. There perhaps should be from time to time a \nreview of exactly what should the grazing fee be, and when we have that \ndebate or review, I would always encourage us to compare apples and \napples, and it is not comparing like quantities by comparing private \nrent for private lands and grazing fees on public lands. It simply is \nnot comparing like amounts.\n  So, we will go through this debate, and we will have a vote today. \nThis is a proposal on an appropriations bill offered now during the \nlast couple of weeks in the session. I think it is probably useful to \nhave the discussion once again, but I hope my colleagues will, as they \nhave on the previous occasion, decide to turn down this amendment.\n  There are other ways for us to productively debate, in a thoughtful \nway, what should be the specific grazing fee that is appropriate for \nall Federal lands in this country. We may even have some disagreement \nabout whether one rate ought to be charged for the largest corporation \nin America and another rate for the smallest rancher in the country. \nThat is not something we will, perhaps, have agreement on generally \nacross all the political confluences in this Chamber.\n  But I think there will be a majority in this Chamber who believe that \nthis amendment is an amendment that purports to do something that it \nwould not accomplish. It purports to say it will increase the grazing \nfee only for the largest corporate ranchers in our country when, in \nfact, this will precipitously increase grazing fees for family ranchers \nwho are raising, in many cases, under 200 cows a year, grazing them the \nfull year, and who would not be expected, given the definition of this \namendment, to be included in it.\n  For those reasons I hope the Senate will turn this amendment down and \nwe will have, at another time on another occasion, further debate about \ngrazing fees. When we do, I hope we will compare, as I have indicated, \napples to apples, grazing fees on public lands to similar circumstances \nin other areas. I think you will find the allegation that is made that \nthere is an enormous public subsidy on grazing fees is simply not true, \nbased on fact.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Washington for his \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in turn I wish to commend the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on a very thoughtful analysis of a problem which he \nunderstands from firsthand experience. I agree with him in feeling this \nproposal ought to be dealt with under different circumstances and trust \nthat will be the decision of the Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not believe that any other Member is going \nto come to the floor this afternoon to propose an amendment to this \nbill. If I am in error, I hope contact will be made with the \nappropriate Cloakroom promptly. I also hope that, having thoroughly \ndebated this grazing fee amendment, we will be able to bring it to a \nvote promptly tomorrow morning.\n  I understand the majority leader wants to call the Senate into \nsession at 9:30 tomorrow morning, or at least to return to this bill at \n9:30 tomorrow morning, and would like to vote at about 10 o'clock. That \nproposition is still being cleared. I expect the leader on the floor \nwhen the Senator from Arkansas has completed his remarks on this bill, \nand we will determine between now and then whether or not we can have a \nbrief additional debate on this proposal tomorrow morning, vote on it, \nand move on to another subject relevant to this bill.\n  Seeing the Senator from Arkansas here and knowing he wishes to speak \nagain on this subject, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, it would be my hope, as far as voting on \nthis is concerned, that we could vote immediately after the caucus \ntomorrow. I do not know what other amendments Members may wish to offer \non this bill. I assume, based on what I am hearing, there are several.\n  I just have about 5 minutes worth of remarks here and we can move on \nto something else, if there is something else to be taken up. I hope we \nwill have some more amendments offered in the morning that we can \ndispose of and perhaps stack votes until after the caucus.\n  I think it would redound to the benefit of both sides if we could, \nfor example, set the amendment aside, take it up for 20 or 30 minutes \nof debate at 2:15 tomorrow, immediately after the caucus, 20 minutes \nequally divided or some such thing as that, or maybe 30 minutes equally \ndivided, and we could vote at 2:45. I think there are several Members \nwho may miss this vote if we do not do that.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. The request made by the Senator from Arkansas seems, at \nleast to this Senator, to be a reasonable one. The only frustration we \nmay suffer is whether or not we can get anyone to come tomorrow morning \nto use 3 hours that ought to be devoted to a substantive debate on this \nbill.\n  So, perhaps with the requests of both of us, we would be able to do \nexactly that and no time will be lost at all, if there is a serious \ndebate on another contested amendment or, for that matter, if we deal \nwith myriad amendments--I must have 30 or 40 of them here--that I know \nsomething about. If we can use tomorrow morning to deal with them, \nwhether they are ones that can be agreed to or ones that will be \ndebated, then we will not have lost any time at all in acceding to the \nsuggestion of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  He can use such time as he wishes now, and we will see whether we \ncannot work that proposition out for tomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for his always generous and \nthoughtful accommodation of other Senators. As I said, I am willing to \nset this amendment aside until 2:15 tomorrow at the conclusion of the \nfew remarks I have to make here. That will give the managers and \nperhaps the majority leader an opportunity to badger and cajole other \nMembers to bring amendments to the floor if they have them. We can take \nthat up in the morning, then, debate other amendments, and come back to \nthis at 2:15 tomorrow and maybe have 20 minutes or 30 minutes, by \nagreement.\n  I just wanted to challenge some of the things I have heard from the \nopponents of this amendment.\n  No. 1, the Senator from Wyoming pointed out that there are grazing \nassociations which several members belong to under one permit or one \nname. The association would control more than 2,000 AUM's, and \ntherefore they would lose the advantage of their association. The truth \nof the matter is, our amendment specifically exempts those people. So \nthe statement of the Senator from Wyoming was totally incorrect. If I \nmay, I will just read the amendment:\n\n       For the purposes of this section, individual members of a \n     grazing association shall be considered as individual \n     permittees or lessees in determining the appropriate grazing \n     fee.\n\n  That takes care of that argument.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said this amendment was precisely the one \nwe voted on in March. That is totally incorrect. The amendment I \noffered in March on this subject provided for a $2 fee for all \npermittees on the first 2,000 AUM's. In this amendment, we do not raise \nthe fees for those people who have control of less than 2,000 AUM's one \npenny. They are not affected at all.\n  No. 3, the Senator from New Mexico said that people do not just graze \ncattle for a few months and send them to the high country, they graze \nthem 12 months a year and therefore he concluded that 2,000 AUM's \nreally only\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\namounts to about 165 head. That is true if you graze 12 months. But the \ntruth of the matter is, more permittees graze less than 12 months than \ngraze 12 months. In the colder climates, ranchers take their cattle off \nof the lands so they do not have to pay even $1.35 a month for them in \nthe winter months when there is no grass for them to eat. They put them \nin feed lots. They put them someplace so they do not have to pay $1.35 \na month.\n  Finally, let me just say, the Senator from Wyoming said most ranchers \nare not corporations--and he is absolutely right. They are not \ncorporations, and we do not bother them. My amendment has absolutely no \neffect on 91 percent of the 22,350 permittees in this country. We do \nnot touch them. It is designed to protect all these little family \nfarmers that I have heard discussed here this afternoon. As a matter of \nfact, that is all I have heard from the opponents of this amendment, \nabout how tough these little cattle farmers are having it.\n  That is true, but that has absolutely nothing to do with this \namendment. If you think Anheuser-Busch and Hewlett-Packard and Newmont \nMining Co., are family farmers you ought not be in the U.S. Senate. If \nyou cannot distinguish between family farmers and the kind of people \nthat I am trying to reach here and take off corporate welfare, you have \nno business being here.\n  I daresay I have heard this grazing fee debated for 22 years. I will \nhave been here, at the end of this year, 22 years, and I have heard \nthis matter debated, I have heard every argument I heard this afternoon \nin spades, thousands of times. Every single argument is designed to \nobfuscate the issue.\n\n  The issue is not the little farmers who are not affected by this \namendment. The issue is the 9 percent of the wealthy people in this \ncountry, the big corporations, such as Anheuser-Busch, who control 60 \npercent. If you think it is right for 9 percent of some of the biggest \ncorporations in America to control 60 percent of the 270 million acres \nof Federal lands we let out for grazing, vote against the amendment. If \nthat is your sense of equity, if that is your sense of fairness, vote \nagainst this amendment. But for God's sake, do not come over here and \nmake these silly, facetious arguments about these little family farmers \nthat we are trying to bankrupt.\n  Even Hewlett-Packard, even Anheuser-Busch, only have to pay $1.35 for \nthe first 2,000 AUM's under my amendment. We do not even charge anybody \nan additional fee until you get to 2,000. And what do we charge them \nthen? The same rate that the State charges where the land is located.\n  The Senator from New Mexico made an argument about how this is \ndesigned, about how much more they are going to pay. What would they \npay under this amendment? They would pay exactly what they have to pay \nif they leased lands from the State of New Mexico. If the Senator from \nNew Mexico leased lands from the State of New Mexico, he would pay \n$3.54 an acre, and you do not get nearly as good a deal you get from \nthe Federal Government, because the State reserves all water rights. In \naddition, the State does not put 50 percent of the rent they get back \ninto range improvements.\n  I know what is going on here, and you do, too. The merits of this \nargument have nothing to do with the way people are going to vote here. \nThe politics of it are what is causing the debate here, and that is the \nreason politicians of this country have the approval of about 28 \npercent of the people. They know exactly how we vote and why we vote. \nYou put this debate on national television and I promise you I will get \n98 percent of the votes of the American people, but not in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In Oklahoma, you have to pay $10 for an AUM if you rented State \nlands. I have already shown you what the private sector charges. The \nprivate sector charges a lot more than the States do. It is only \n``Uncle Sucker.'' And I am not trying to balance the budget. This does \nnot amount to anything, so far as money is concerned. What it amounts \nto is fairness, and the American people have a right to expect at least \nminimal fairness on how their land is used.\n  Mr. President, if I were to change my amendment to 4,000 AUM's, and I \nmay do that, if I changed it to 10,000 AUM's, I would not get one \nadditional vote, and you would hear the same arguments about the poor \nlittle family ranchers out there. The poor little family ranchers \nrepresent 91 percent of all the permittees. They are not touched by \nthis. Nobody wants to get up here and say, ``I think the Government \nought to be subsidizing Anheuser-Busch.'' Nobody is going to say, ``I \nthink the Government ought to be subsidizing Newmont Mining.''\n  So what do we talk about? The 9 percent of the permittees who fall in \nthat category? No. We talk about the 91 percent of the little family \nfarmers who are not even affected by this. So the whole thing is \ndesigned to confuse, obfuscate and give people an excuse for violating \ntheir own conscience when they vote.\n  Do you know how many people are affected in the State of North \nDakota? You heard my good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, a \nmoment ago, one of the best friends I have and one of the finest \nSenators in the U.S. Senate. Do you know how many people in North \nDakota are affected by this amendment? Thirty-four, 2 percent; 2 \npercent of all the ranchers in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota \nare affected by this amendment--2 percent--and you would think the \nworld was coming to an end.\n  Who are they? They are the wealthiest people who graze livestock on \nFederal lands. In South Dakota, you would have to pay $7 an acre to \ngraze on State lands. I am talking about 2 percent of the farmers in \nMontana, South Dakota and North Dakota. What did you hear in the \ndebate? Not about the 2 percent. You heard about the 98 percent who are \ntotally unaffected by this amendment.\n\n  Oh, it's discouraging. I've got about as good a track record, I \nguess, at losing amendments as anybody in the Senate. I must say that \ndoesn't bother me much. I get frustrated. Offering an amendment like \nthis--the merits are absolutely undebatable. Oh, you can debate it, but \nthe truth of the matter is the merits of the amendment are unsalable. \nJust look at the list.\n  In California, you are talking about 8 percent of the permittees, a \ntotal of 53. California, with 33 million people and 53 of them are \naffected by my amendment.\n  Colorado, 70 permittees, or 5 percent of all the people who graze on \nFederal lands, 5 percent of them, 70 of them, and you would think we \nwere debating the welfare bill here.\n  Oregon and Washington, together, the two States together, Oregon and \nWashington, 136, 8 percent of all the permittees.\n  Nevada and New Mexico are the two States that have the most. Nevada \nhas 262 ranchers that would be affected, and then they have about 420 \nwho wouldn't be. But getting back to the merits of the case, we are not \ntalking about enough money. You know what, take the money out. I wish \nthere was some way you could take the money out of it because it \ndoesn't amount to anything. It doesn't amount to an ant hill, $8 \nmillion a year. We get $25 million a year from 22,350 permittees, and \nthis would raise an additional $8 million.\n  That ain't going to balance the Federal budget.\n  I wish we would take the money completely out of it and just simply \nsay we are not going to give anybody grazing rights on Federal lands \nthat exceed 2,000 AUM's. That will satisfy me. Forget the $8 million. \nForget the increased costs. I may offer that amendment, incidentally, \nsomething close to it, because I would like to hear people come in here \nand moan and groan and make the same speeches they just got through \nmaking if you set it at 10,000 AUM's.\n  Mr. President, I have covered about everything I can think to cover. \nI listened to the debate a while ago of all the various Senators, the \narguments made. As far as I am concerned, they are all friends of mine. \nThey are all fine Senators. But the arguments are so specious, I cannot \nbelieve it. I will probably lose again. I think we lost by three votes \nlast time. We will probably lose by three to five again.\n  But I am telling you something else, completely aside from the money, \ncompletely aside from the equity. I defy anybody to stand up and say, \nwhen they are up for reelection this fall--go back home and make the \nsame argument to the constituents that you made here on the floor, but \nbe truthful\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\nabout it. Tell those people that you voted to allow big corporations \nlike Anheuser-Busch and Hewlett-Packard and Newmont Mining, people like \nMr. Simplot out of Idaho--he is probably a fine citizen; I have nothing \nagainst him; if I were in his position and getting a couple thousand \nacres for little or nothing, I would probably take it, too--but go home \nand tell the people that you voted to defend those people on this \nissue, and tell them what the issue was. Tell them that 91 percent of \nthe ranchers in this country who graze livestock on Federal lands would \nhave been unaffected. The only people who would have been affected \nwould be the billionaires and the big corporations. Tell them you voted \nto defend those people and to give them lands for $1.35 even though the \nStates they live in would charge exponentially more.\n  The Senator from Montana just came on the floor. The State of Montana \nwould charge you $4.05 for an AUM in Montana. But ``Uncle Sugar'' will \nlet you have it for $1.35. And if you charge a nickel more than that, \nfor example, what they charge in the State of Montana, the weeping and \nwailing begins. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we are on rewind again. We have been down \nthis little debate before. It never ceases to amaze me how we can \ncompare apples and oranges and oranges and tangerines, and then we \ncompare everything else with rocks.\n  It is easy for me to go home and explain this vote for the simple \nreason that the majority of people that live in Montana, that live in \nthe West, where there is a large prevalence of Federal lands, they \nunderstand that.\n  When I first went to the State of Montana, I did not have a real good \nunderstanding of public lands and the policies on those public lands \nand how those policies were developed. I did not have a real keen \ninterest in what is regarded in the West as water rights. Where I was \nraised in Missouri, we did not file for--if you put a well down, we did \nnot worry about water. It seemed like it came down every river, and our \nwells were full all the time. We enjoyed anywhere from 35 to 45 inches \nof rain every year, so water was not a big issue where I came from as a \nyoung lad growing up on a small farm. But when you live there for a \nwhile, and these issues come up, then all at once your interest grows \nin it and on the development of that public lands policy.\n  I do not think we want to get into a class warfare type thing. I know \nif I was a rancher in the State of Montana, I would like to have the \nopportunity to grow bigger if I could and do it, and do it the way that \nmost of them did. So whenever we start comparing State lands and \nprivate lands and BLM land, it is not even a close or a fair \ncomparison.\n  I have been to the Senator's State of Arkansas. I would like to have \nsome of the grazing land that they have in their great State. I would \nlike to range some cattle there and graze some cattle there, because I \nknow what it will do and the season it takes. I was raised in Missouri, \nso I know what the cost is and how much they will gain on the kind of \nforage that they have. It is a little bit different as you move West, \nwhere the soil thins, and so does the forage. In some places there is \nhardly any forage at all.\n  The BLM lands are the lands that were sort of left over, because when \nthis country was settled, they did not have the technology or the way \nto develop water supplies and to deal with everything that you are \ngoing to have to have on that range to run livestock. I will tell you \nsomething else along with that. In the old days, there was not any \nwildlife out there either, because everything it takes to sustain \nwildlife on those ranges it takes to sustain livestock. That is why we \nhave more whitetail and mule deer, more antelope and more elk now than \nwe have had since the Great Depression.\n  The improvement in those ranges has been done in part by the \nindividual permittee, the person who held the permits, because he was \nthe one that had to lay out the money to build the pipelines, to build \nthe reservoirs, and to create in some places where there has never been \nwater but there is now, to where that resource, that resource called \ngrass, the only way it can be harvested is through the cattle or sheep.\n  But as our technology grew and our ability to develop those water \nresources on semiarid to arid land, we made use of more of that country \nthan had ever been used before. Then we all at once started developing \nanother little organization after World War II looking at the ranges \nand the condition of the ranges and knowing that the future of \nagriculture, especially animal agriculture, west of the Mississippi is \ngoing to depend on how well we take care of our resources. There was an \norganization that was founded and had as much to do with the \nimprovement of the range. It is called the Society for Range Management \n[SRM]. They started having neighborhood meetings and they started \nbringing new practices and they said not only do we have to do a better \njob in our grazing, but we have to do a better job in our water \nmanagement and our soil management.\n  We have to watch out for wind erosion. We do not have to watch out \nfor wind erosion in this part of the country. We have to watch out for \nwater erosion. Sometimes it sounds like it is going to rain here, wash \nus all right down the Potomac River. That is the forecast anyway. We do \nnot have to worry about that out there. We have to worry about it maybe \nsometimes in the spring of the year when the runoff goes off, but it \ndoes not last very long. But we have wind erosion. In order to prevent \nwind erosion, you have to keep pretty good forage on that land.\n  So we had to go to different grazing. We grazed some a long time; we \ngrazed some a very short time. But through those practices and trial \nand error and with that organization, the range improvements in the \nWest have been phenomenal over the last 50 years. One has to remember, \nyou do not change the direction. You do not improve land, you do not \nimprove anything in just 1 year, put a big Band-Aid on it and it is \nfixed, because it takes a long time. I will admit, the Homestead Act \nprobably did as much damage in the West to the resources there as any \nlaw that we ever had, although it did move our public lands into \nprivate hands and started building the farms and the ranches across \nthis country. But they also plowed up some country that should never \nhave had a plow stuck in it. That all had to go back into rangeland. \nSome of those scars still exist today, but we are dealing with that. It \ntakes time. Mother Earth heals, but sometimes it takes a long time.\n\n  Those lands never were held in private hands. They were always in the \nGovernment. They were the leftover lands. In the State lands, they lump \neverything together. In some places, you have great tracts of timber \nand some sections of State lands and farmland which produces a nice, \ngreat profit to the rancher who farms that land. It is either wheat, \nbarley, or grain, and that returns a nice little check to the Treasury \nwithout any livestock ever being on it. That is part of that rent. That \nis part of that scheme of $4 over there.\n  What we are talking about here, we cannot compare private lands, \npublic lands, and State lands. Take a county like Garfield County, MT. \nI heard the organizations that are sponsoring this amendment or \nendorsing this amendment, and they do not want cattle on these lands. \nThis is the bill to move them off the land. To a county like Garfield \nCounty, whose tax base for personal property taxes has to be in \nlivestock because there is very little out there to tax, it pays for \nschools, roads, public safety. All those things are paid for by animal \nagriculture in the vast amount of the counties east of the mountains in \nthe State of Montana.\n  The Government does do very well when you take into account all of \nthe multiple uses on that land, grazing included. And I saw the \ncomparison of my friend from New Hampshire. If I am investing $50 some \nodd million, whatever the figure is, and only get a return on $14 \nmillion, I think I would look at how I am operating my business. Maybe \nthe secret is not the grazing fee, maybe it is in the way that we are \noperating our land or our business. Maybe there is a better way. Also, \nif I was doing it that way--and some of the hoops that the Bureau of \nLand Management has to jump through were created by laws here in this \nbody. When I went to Montana, only the BLM managed all the land in \nMontana, with around perhaps 30 or 35 people, and now there are\n\n[[Page S10596]]\n\n500 people there. I would take a look at that. Maybe we have an \norganization that is a little on the bloated side when it comes to \nmanaging our public lands.\n  Do not be fooled by the comparison of the lands because there is no \ncomparison. We are trying to pass a rangeland reform bill. The cloud of \na Presidential veto is over that bill as we work with it here in this \nbody. Now you tell me that is trying to solve some of the problems that \nwe have in developing public lands policy, because if it is not just \nexactly the way we want it, we are just going to veto it. That does not \ntell me that this administration or Mr. Babbitt is trying to get along \nwith the folks who are dependent on the use of public lands, multiple \nuse of those lands in the West.\n  Keep in mind any commercial development, along with the recreation \nand the access to those lands, is very important to all Americans, all \nAmericans, as they are the benefactor of this, even as we speak today. \nNot very many of us have a hungry night, for we have a wonderful way of \nproducing food and fiber in this country.\n  I know we will have more to say on this issue later, but take a look \nand see what we are doing. The comparisons just are not there. \nRegarding this, I suggest we reject this amendment. It has been \nrejected before, and it was rejected basically on common sense--common \nsense. Sure, we can make a case where maybe it ought to be $10--or, to \nbe fair, go to $20. Take them all off the land. Who needs them? It is \njust a handful of people. Not very many. America, who needs them? I \nthink we need them. They are very important to my State. They are very \nimportant to this country.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the Senator from Montana would be willing to \nengage in a short colloquy. I just ask this question: Is the Senator \nopposed to any limit? In other words, Hewlett-Packard or Anheuser-Busch \nmaybe has 8,000 AUM's. Mr. Simplot has 50,000 AUM's. Do you have any \nobjection to Mr. Simplot paying a grazing fee to run 50,000 animal unit \nmonths at $1.35?\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I have to say to the Senator that you just cannot single \nout a few people to say whether you would like that or dislike it. That \nis the way it is set up for all of us.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, we single out rich people with a little higher \ntax rate than we do poor people.\n  Mr. BURNS. I wonder some days, I wonder about the wisdom of that on \noccasion. Every time we try to single out somebody to pay higher fees \nor put them under a different set of laws, then somebody else who is \nrunning under the same conditions--everybody gets hurt. In other words, \nthose people did not get big from being dumb, so there are other ways \nto get around it. I think it limits a little man growing.\n  What is wrong with the little guy starting out and wanting to grow? \nIs that not the American way?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator wants Anheuser-Busch to grow?\n  Mr. BURNS. I sure do not want to lose them as a viable corporation. \nThey do a lot of business in my State. They buy my barley. They are not \njust a one-faceted company. They pay a lot of personal property taxes \nin my county, the county government.\n  I was a county commissioner before I came here. I know about those \nchecks. They foot the bills on a lot of education. They buy a lot of \npickups, and they buy a lot of services in counties. Once it leaves or \nonce that has eroded, that business has a hard time coming back. \nSenator, we cannot live on just tourism or recreation alone on that \nland, because recreation will not pay for it. They will not pay you \n$1.36 an AUM.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I take it the answer is no, there is not any limit that \nis too high for the Senator to oppose?\n  Mr. BURNS. I have to think about that, but I do not think you can \nsingle out people and put them in a class over here and have another \nclass over here. I do not think I like that very much.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You understand, of course, that some of the biggest \ncorporations, and these billionaires who own hundreds of thousands of \nAUM's, if they had to pay more or if they gave it up, that would make a \nlittle room for some of the little ranchers that I watch all these \ntears shed for around here.\n  Would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. BURNS. I think if it becomes unprofitable for them, it would be \nunprofitable for a small man, too. I do not think that will open up the \navailability of more of those permits to a smaller rancher.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So the Senator sees no inequity in the fact that the \nState of Montana leases its lands at $4.05 an AUM and the Federal \nGovernment receives $1.35? That doesn't bother the Senator?\n  Mr. BURNS. If you had some preference, you would rather lease private \nlands for even more than that, Senator, because we know the services \nthat go with it. The cattle will be ridden and we will get gain on the \ncattle. That is not guaranteed. Nothing is guaranteed on the public \nlands. We will get control. The State lands are a little better lands. \nLike I said, you cannot compare these lands. You are comparing apples \nand oranges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I take it from the Senator's comments \nthat the fact that Montana gets $4.05 an acre and the U.S. Government \ngets $1.35 an acre, the Senator sees nothing wrong with that. In the \nprivate sector in Montana, people who lease private lands to ranchers \nreceive $11 per AUM. The Federal Government gets $1.35, and the Senator \nsees no inequity in that.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5353, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right, and the amendment \nis so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5353), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending Committee amendment ending on \n     line 4 of page 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . GRAZING FEES.\n\n       (a) Grazing Fee.--Notwithstanding any other provisions of \n     law and subject to subsections (b) and (c), the Secretary of \n     the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a \n     fee for domestic livestock grazing on public rangelands as \n     provided for in section 6(a) of the Public Rangelands \n     Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1905(a)) and Executive \n     Order 12548 (51 F.R. 5985).\n       (b) Determination of Fee.--(1) Permittees or lessees, \n     including related persons, who own or control livestock \n     comprising less than 5,000 animal unit months on the public \n     rangelands pursuant to one or more grazing permits or leases \n     shall pay the fee as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Permittees or lessees, including related persons, who \n     own or control livestock comprising more than 5,000 animal \n     unit months on the public rangelands pursuant to one or more \n     grazing permits or leases shall pay the fee as set forth in \n     subsection (a) for the first 5,000 animal unit months. For \n     animal unit months in excess of 5,000, the fee shall be the \n     higher of either--\n       (A) the average grazing fee (weighted by animal unit \n     months) charged by the State during the previous grazing year \n     for grazing on State lands in which the lands covered by the \n     permit or lease are located; or\n       (B) the Federal grazing fee set forth in subsection (a), \n     plus 25 percent.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section--\n       (1) State lands shall include school, education department, \n     and State land board lands;\n       (2) individual members of a grazing association shall be \n     considered as individual permittees or lessees in determining \n     the appropriate grazing fee; and\n       (3) related persons includes--\n       (i) the spouse and dependent children (as defined in \n     section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of the \n     holder of the permit or lease; and\n       (ii) a person controlled by, or controlling, or under \n     common control with the holder of the permit or lease.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment originally required that \nanybody who held more than 2,000 AUM's would have to pay whatever the \nState charged for lands in that State on any AUM's in excess of 2,000. \nI have the very distinct impression it would not make any difference, \nas the Senator from Montana just confirmed, how high the limit went. I \nthink he would find it difficult, if not impossible--I detect \nimpossible--to support the amendment. Nevertheless, I will give \neverybody a chance because they say 2,000 AUM's is only 166 head. So we \nwill get it up to 400 with 5,000 AUM's. That is what my modification \ndoes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I don't remember, but I \nbelieve Yogi Berra says, ``This is like deja vu all over again.'' It \nreally is. I am so saddened that my friend and colleague from Arkansas \nlikes to engage in the typical class warfare game that\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\nhis side of the aisle oftentimes likes to play over issues where they \nproject that there is some big evil creature out there profiteering off \nof what is the public's interest or the public's resource and, \ntherefore, we ought to stop them.\n  If that were true, I would be standing not only beside my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, but I would be supporting his legislation. That has \nnever been the case. What is the case is that the environmental \ncommunity of our country, for well over two decades now, have tried to \nfind a reason to change the character of the western public grazing \nlands for a variety of reasons. And through that, they have searched \nfor a variety of arguments that somehow would ring solid with our \ncitizens, that would say that public policy that directs our public \nlands somehow is misdirected, that the Congress has failed in its \nresponsibility to the American people and, therefore, we ought to \nchange public grazing land policy.\n  I certainly don't hold the edge on the knowledge on this issue. But I \nam one of a few Senators on this floor that once leased public grazing \nlands from the BLM and from the Forest Service. My family ranching \nbusinesses did that for years. We are no longer in those businesses. \nThere is no conflict of interest with this Senator. But I represent \nthousands of cattlemen in my State who do graze. Of our agriculture \nindustry in the State of Idaho, which is the number one total receipts \nindustry in my State, cattle is the largest segment of agriculture. It \nisn't potatoes when it comes to dollars and cents in total sales; it is \ncattle. Eighty percent of those cattle have to graze on public land at \nleast some time during the year. The reason is that 63 percent of my \nState is owned and managed by the taxpayers of this country, the \nFederal Government, the public domain, the people's estate, however one \nwants to describe it.\n  So, in other words, Washington, DC, has more to say about running \nIdaho than Idaho has. The largest segment of our agriculture industry, \ntherefore, has to rely on Federal public policy to survive. Sometimes \nit's good, sometimes it's bad. There is one thing Idaho appreciates, \nthough, and that is its large expanse of public lands. We don't want it \nto be private per se. We have found that there is a tremendous heritage \nthere that speaks to the public lands, that enjoys them, not just for \ncattle grazing, but for access--hunting, fishing, and for the quality \nof the environment that my State of Idaho has.\n  My grandfather, a good number of years ago--a good number of years \nago--homesteaded in Idaho--then just a State. At that time there was no \nBLM, there was no Taylor Grazing Act. He was a grazer, a rancher, a \nsheep rancher. He found out that the great big interests out of the \nSouthwest, out of Colorado, large ranching combines, that owned \nthousands of acres and tens and thousands of head of cattle, would \nsweep across the western lands, including Idaho, grazing them at will. \nLarge sheep operations did the same. He and other ranchers across the \nWest joined together and appealed to the Congress to create the Taylor \nGrazing Act, to control and limit grazing.\n\n  In the late 1800's, a U.S. cavalry officer, stationed in Idaho, wrote \nin his diaries that the public rangelands and the western rangelands of \nIdaho were depleted by over 80 percent from overgrazing. That was \nbefore the turn of the century. That is when my grandfather and others \nof western heritage said, ``This had gone too far in an uncontrolled \nfashion, and we ought to do something about it.'' Congress created the \nTaylor Grazing Act. Out of that, they directed their interests back to \nthe States and back to the local rancher and not the large national \ninterests or regional interests. They created committees. They created \nlocal control, and they began to turn the western grazing lands around.\n  Now, few remember that history or that heritage. Today's memory \ndoesn't even want to realize that, before the turn of the century, \nwestern grazing lands were already in trouble because they had been \novergrazed by largely no control whatsoever, until the Congress of the \nUnited States stepped into this vast domain of public lands and said we \nhave to do something about it. And they did. And if you will remember a \ncouple of years ago, Mr. President, when Secretary Babbitt was trying \nto find a reason to change public grazing policy, because the \nenvironmental community had wrestled him to the ground and said, \n``cattle-free by '93,'' and ``you have to change this policy.'' In his \neffort to try to find a reason, he asked the staff of the Department of \nInterior to find worse-case scenarios. In a memo that I divulged on \nthis floor--a secret memo--they said, in essence: Mr. Secretary, that \nis hard to do because the western grazing lands are in better condition \nthan they have been in 100 years.\n  So why do you want to eliminate grazing? Why do you want to tighten \nit down? Well, in a few instances, there are problems. There are some \nriparian areas critical to wildlife habitat and water quality that need \nto be administered differently. That is true in my State, as it is true \nin other public land grazing States across the Nation. There isn't a \nSenator on this floor that wouldn't suggest that these lands be managed \nin a responsible fashion, not just for grazing, but for wildlife \nhabitat, for archeological values, for outdoor recreation, for water \nquality, for all of the reasons that we have in the public domain.\n  But we in Idaho and the West say that, amongst all of those reasons, \ngrazing should be equal, and it should have, by character of the Taylor \nGrazing Act that created these grazing relationships with private \npeople, some level of priority.\n  Why? Because a big chunk of the economy of Idaho depends on access to \nthat land. We have incorporated that for over 100 years into the \neconomic base of our State, and if we had known that the Federal \nGovernment was going to sweep in and change the character of local \neconomies, maybe we would have fought over a hundred years ago when we \ncame into the Union to make all of those States private land instead of \na large portion of them remaining federally owned public lands. But \nthat didn't happen. It has not happened.\n  Idaho has a wonderful public land heritage, and we want to keep it \nthat way. But we sure want to try to maintain a working, cooperating, \nsharing relationship with the Federal land management agencies that \nsays there can be some grazing, mining, logging, water quality, and \nenvironmental integrity and all of those combinations of multiple \nbalanced uses that are so critical to the character of the western \npublic land States. That part is what the Bumpers amendment is not all \nabout. It does not understand, nor does it share, that relationship \nthat has existed for well over 100 years.\n  When we talk about the character of the West and wanting to preserve \nit, this is an amendment that would dramatically change the character \nof the West. For the people who come to Idaho today, because Idaho is \nwhat it is and has been for so long, part of that which they enjoy is \nthe ranching heritage, along with the great outdoors and the beautiful \nlandscapes and the pristine air. For over 100 years we have grazed \nIdaho actively, and it is still a beautiful State.\n  Several years ago, I, along with others who have primary \nresponsibility in the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources for \nthis issue, began to recognize there needed to be some adjustment in \ngrazing fees; that somehow the formula currently being used by the \nBureau of Land Management and the Forest Service was not working well. \nMr. President, you know the struggle we went through. We offered a \nvariety of amendments and a variety of bills. We passed a grazing \nreform bill through the Senate this year. Senator Pete Domenici, \nSenator Craig Thomas, certainly Senator Conrad Burns, who has just \nspoken, myself, and others were involved in crafting that. We \nintroduced one that was not liked at all by a variety of interest \ngroups.\n  We went back to the drawing boards, and we invited all interests--\nsportsmen, wildlife enthusiasts to environmentalists--to make \nrecommendations for change. Why? Because we didn't like the ranch form \nregulations that Secretary Babbitt was shoving through because we felt \nthat in the long term it would badly damage the relationship of the \ngrazer to the public land, and after taking information from all of \nthose groups, we made between 27 and 30 changes in our legislation \nbefore it passed through the Senate with a bipartisan vote.\n  Why this amendment, then? I think the Senator from Montana said it \nwell.\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\n It is somehow the big versus the small, and that does not seem to work \nvery well. A blade of grass is a blade of public land grass and ought \nto be worth the same to anybody who wants to buy it. Certainly, when we \nsell trees off the national forests we do not say to the great big \nWeyerhaeuser's or Louisiana Pacific's, or any of the big timber \ncompanies, ``You have to pay a premium because you are big,'' and to \nthe small timber operator in my State of Idaho, ``You are small and you \nare little and you pay less.'' We don't do that. We offer it to up to \nbid. But in the instance of grazing, because grazing is tied with the \nranch, we have said you will pay a fee determined by the Congress. That \nis what we have tried to do in a fair and equitable way, and I think we \nhave accomplished that, because not only are we trying to get a \nreasonable amount of money from the public resource for the public \nTreasury, but we are still trying to reflect the relationship that was \ncrafted back in the teens with the creation of the BLM Act, or the \nTaylor Grazing Act, when we said that ranches ought to have a \nrelationship to that public land to be able to graze it under \nreasonable conditions. That kept the local economy together. That kept \nthe main streets of Grand View, or Twin Falls, or Oakley, or Buhl, or \nany of these small Western agricultural ranching communities, together \nbecause they didn't own the vast lands. Those were owned by the public. \nBut there would still remain a relationship between the ranching \ncommunity, the economy, and the land. For a long time that was the \nright relationship, but now we have wanted to make changes.\n\n  The Bumpers amendment makes the kind of change that dramatically \nalters big and small, because the one thing that has never been talked \nabout in all of this was all of my small ranchers have been marvelous \nstewards of the land throughout this time. They are the ones who gave \nthe time. They are the ones that put in the water systems. They are the \nones that have largely made the public range what it is today by \ninvesting millions of hours of person time and millions of dollars of \ntheir own money on public lands to improve them not just for grazing, \nbut for wildlife habitat. Yet, that seems to not be recognized today in \nthis kind of amendment, the big versus the small, the rich versus the \nnot-so-rich, which should never become a factor in the uniform \nmanagement of and the selling of public resources. Yet, that is what \nthe Senator from Arkansas attempts to do. And it is wrong, Mr. \nPresident, it is just plain wrong. We do not treat any other public \nresource--renewable or nonrenewable--that is up for sale that way.\n  Let us compare it. You go to a national park. You pay a fee to go \ninto a park. Do they ask you at the time you drive through the park, \n``Are you a millionaire,'' or, ``Are you poor?'' If you are a \nmillionaire, you pay $10,000 to enter the national park, and if you are \nnot so rich, you pay the daily fee.\n  We do not do that when somebody enters the public resource buildings \nof the national treasures of the Nation's Capital. There is a fee \ncharged, and that happens in some instances but not many. Yet, \ntaxpayers pay millions of dollars annually to keep these beautiful \nbuildings up. Do we say to the rich, ``You pay more,'' and to the poor, \n``You pay less''? No, we do not do that. But that is what the Senator \nfrom Arkansas does on grazing.\n  When we provide coal resources, oil resources, they go to the highest \nbidder, and they go to the finder. Then we have a national fee that we \ncharge per ton or per gallon. Do we say to the Standard Oil's of \nAmerica, ``You pay more,'' and to the small stripper well producers in \nKansas, ``You pay less''? No, we do not. We expect a reasonable and a \nbalanced fee.\n  I don't know how, Mr. President, to make another comparison that the \npublic would understand. How about two apartments, one side by side, \nand one is furnished and one is not furnished. That is what the Senator \nfrom Montana was talking about. Certainly, the one that is furnished \nyou would pay more for.\n  So when the Senator from Arkansas talks about State lands, in many \ninstances, the State lands are a better quality grazing land. The \nservices on them are treated differently. Certainly, it is true of \nprivate grazing. I know; I used to lease out private grazing. We took \ncare of the cattle. We fixed the fences. We sold to them. We made sure \nthat the water facilities were operating, and the person who put the \ncattle on the land never came back to see them sometimes until 2 or 3 \nmonths later when they wanted to pick them up. So we were able to \ncharge more because we offered a service. But when the rancher leases \npublic grazing land, BLM or Forest Service land, none of those services \nare offered. You ride for the cattle, and you care for the cattle. You \npick up all of those extra expenses.\n\n  That is a part of the reason that the formula over the year has \nreflected some of disparity of difference, and it is unfair to make \nthose comparisons. But I am afraid that some of my colleagues, who have \nan entirely different mission in mind than just getting for agriculture \na fair price for the public resource, want to change the story. And, in \nchanging it, they know that the consequence of their action would be \ndisastrous to the public grazing lands as we know it.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that Senators will once again join with us in \nrejecting this amendment. This Senate has done its duty. We have \ncrafted a compromise, bipartisan grazing reform bill with a fee \nincrease in it which is fair and equitable to all, and passed it \nthrough the Senate. Now, to have this kind of an end run on an \namendment that divides--that says to the rich this, says to the less \nrich this, that says we create different levels and different fees for \ndifferent blades of grass grazed by different cattle, it does not make \nsense.\n  It will not work. We do it nowhere else when we deal with public \nresources, and we certainly ought not do it with grazing.\n  So I hope that the Senate will reject this amendment at the \nappropriate time and continue to work with the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to accomplish the grazing reform that we need, \nbecause there is no Senator who would suggest we need none.\n  As a Senator who represents a western public lands State, I will tell \nyou that I helped lead the reform this year. We did not stand back, \nbecause we wanted to make sure that the reform was reflective of not \nonly national interests but that unique relationship that was crafted \nwith the Taylor Grazing Act decades ago between the public lands State \nand the public domain and the public resource and the grazing industry \nand the citizens of the States involved.\n  That is the issue at hand here. I hope the Senate will honor its \nhistoric commitment in these areas to maintain balance and to maintain \nreasonable return for the public resource.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that debate on this grazing fee \namendment has been concluded for the day.

Mr. President, I was pleased to be able to offer this \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Mikulski to provide the State \nof Maryland with the flexibility and additional resources needed to \nclean up environmental problems associated with acid mine drainage from \nabandoned coal mines. Specifically, my amendment would allow the State \nof Maryland to set aside the greater of $1 million or 10 percent of the \nfunds received under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n1977 for use in undertaking acid mine drainage abatement and treatment \nprojects.\n  There are over 450 miles of rivers and streams in Maryland which are \ncontaminated by acid mine drainage.\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\n Much of the north branch of the Potomac River, from its headwaters \nnear Kempton, MD, to the Jennings Randolph Lake is biologically dead. \nThe Kempton mine alone contributes 3 million gallons of acid mine \ndrainage to the Potomac each day and estimates to clean up this problem \nrun as high as $80 million.\n  Section 402 (g)(6)(B) of SMCRA authorizes States to set aside up to \n10 percent of their annual title IV abandoned mine land reclamation \nallocation into a special interest-bearing account for addressing \nadverse environmental effects caused by abandoned mine drainage. For a \nminimum program State like Maryland, which receives only $1.5 million \nin AML funds a year, 10 percent is clearly insufficient to address our \nState's acid mine drainage problems.\n  My amendment will not authorize or appropriate any new money to be \nexpended for acid mine drainage. It will provide greater flexibility \nfor Maryland to use its existing AML funds for acid mine drainage \nabatement as well as health and safety problems and help address the \nmost serious environmental problem facing the western region of my \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10598-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10599-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE CONTINUATION OF THE EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n               UNITA--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 169\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide additional consumer protections for medicare supplemental \ninsurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  The Medigap Portability Act of 1996\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last month, the President signed \ninto law bipartisan legislation that provides greater portability of \nhealth insurance for working Americans. Today, I join with my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, in the introduction of a bipartisan \nbill that will provide some of the same guarantees for seniors who buy \nMedicare supplemental insurance or Medigap policies.\n  Of the 37 million Medicare beneficiaries, 80 percent, or nearly 30 \nmillion, have some form of Medicare supplemental insurance, whether \ncovered through a retiree health plan or a private Medigap policy. \nUnder current law, Medigap insurers must issue these policies without \npre-existing condition limitations during the 6-month period \nimmediately after the beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare. Our \nbill does three things for seniors who have purchased Medigap \ninsurance.\n  First, it guarantees that if their plan goes out of business or the \nbeneficiary moves out of a plan service area, he or she can buy another \ncomparable policy. These rules also would apply to a senior who has had \ncoverage under a retiree health plan if their plan goes out of \nbusiness.\n  Second, it encourages seniors to enroll in Medicare managed care by \nguaranteeing that they can return to Medicare fee-for-service and, \nduring the first year of enrollment, get back their same Medigap policy \nif they decide they do not like managed care. Under current law, if a \nsenior wishes to enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, they have two \noptions. They may drop their Medigap policy, and hope they can get \nanother if they go back to fee-for-service, or they can continue paying \ntheir Medigap premiums in the event that they may need the policy again \nsome day--a very costly option for those on fixed incomes.\n  Third, it provides a 6-month open enrollment period for those under \n65 who become Medicare beneficiaries because they are disabled. Under \ncurrent Federal law, Medicare beneficiaries are offered a 6-month open \nenrollment period only if they are 65. There are approximately 4 \nmillion Americans who are under 65 years of age and are enrolled in the \nMedicare Program. Currently, they do not currently have access to \nMedigap policies unless State laws require insurers to offer policies \nto them.\n  It is true that this bill does not go as far as some advocacy groups \nwould like. Our bill leaves to the States more controversial issues, \nsuch as continuous open enrollment and community rating of Medigap \npremiums. I believe, however, that this legislation will provide \nseniors the same guarantees that we provided to working Americans under \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2075\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medigap Portability Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I join my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, in introducing a bill that aims at taking \nanother significant step in extending the kind of health care security \nwe want for all Americans. I believe the recent enactment of the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health reform bill confirms that those of us who want \nto expand health care access, coverage, and quality for Americans have \nevery reason to press on. And the Senator from Rhode Island and I have \nvery deliberately adopted the same principles of bipartisanship and \npragmatism in crafting this new bill to take the next steps forward in \nhealth reform.\n  Our bill responds to a clear need among Medicare's beneficiaries, \nespecially the 4 million disabled Americans who rely on Medicare, to be \nable to count on supplemental insurance when they seek it. As important \nas Medicare is, it covers less than one-half of beneficiaries' total \nhealth care costs. As a result, almost 80 percent of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries buy private, supplemental insurance that gives them extra \ncoverage and financial relief. But it turns out that seniors and the \ndisabled are having all kinds of difficulties in obtaining or holding \nonto this supplemental insurance. Our bill solves some of these \nproblems, by making Medigap policies portable, more reliable, and more \naccessible in different situations.\n  Specifically, our bill requires insurers to issue a Medigap policy to \na Medicare beneficiary who loses his or her Medigap coverage because he \nor she moves out of a plan's service area; because an HMO or managed \ncare plan goes out of business or withdraws from the market; or because \nan employer drops, or substantially cuts back, retiree health benefits.\n  This legislation responds to changes we are seeing that are hurting \nolder and disabled Americans, which includes 50,000 disabled West \nVirginians. For example, more and more employers are cutting costs by \ncutting back on their retirees' health benefits. Between 1993 and 1995, \nthe number of large employers who provided retiree health benefits \ndropped by 5 percent. When retirees lose employer-sponsored health \nbenefits, they are forced to go to the private market and purchase \nindividual coverage.\n  If they have any type of preexisting medical condition, they will be \nlucky to find an insurance company who will sell them a Medigap policy \nwithout a lengthy pre-existing condition limitation. Others will not be \nso lucky. They won't find an insurer willing to sell them a policy at \nany price.\n  Mr. President, our bill gives Medicare beneficiaries an opportunity \nto try a managed care plan without worrying about losing their ability \nto return to fee-for-service medicine. Our legislation would give \nMedicare beneficiaries a 12-month trial period to try a Medicare \nmanaged care option. Understandably, many seniors are very nervous \nabout enrolling in a managed care organization if it means losing \naccess to their lifelong doctor.\n  Our bill lets Medicare beneficiaries see if a managed health care \nplan suits them and gives them a way back to fee-for-service medicine, \nif that is their personal preference.\n\n  Mr. President, my preference would be to allow continuously insured \nMedicare beneficiaries to freely switch types of policies--fee-for-\nservice versus managed care--and insurers, on an annual basis. This \nwould allow seniors the ability to switch insurers for customer service \nreasons or any other personal preference. But because the insurance \ncompanies are especially opposed to any type of continuous or annual \nopen enrollment policy for Medigap insurance--even for individuals who \nare continuously insured--we have to have our bill aim for the more \nmodest improvements in portability that we think we have a better \nchance of enacting.\n  Our legislation bans insurance companies from imposing any \npreexisting condition limitation during the 6-month open enrollment \nperiod for Medigap insurance when a person first qualifies for \nMedicare. This makes the rules for Medigap policies consistent with the \nrecently enacted Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, and with Medicare coverage \nwhich begins immediately, regardless of preexisting conditions.\n  For the disabled, this bill is a big improvement over current law. In \n1990, Congress mandated that insurers must sell a Medigap policy to any \nsenior wishing to buy coverage when that individual first becomes \neligible for Medicare. The disabled were left out at that time because \nof insurance company-generated concerns about potentially huge premium \nhikes for current Medigap policyholders.\n  Since then, at least 10 States went ahead and required insurers to \nissue policies to all Medicare beneficiaries in their States, including \nthe disabled. My staff called those States, and not one State reported \nlarge hikes in premiums as a result of their new laws requiring access \nto Medigap for the disabled.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] has also estimated \nthat Medicare's average per-person cost for the disabled is actually \nless than Medicare's average per-person cost for the aged. So, Mr. \nPresident, I believe we can put concerns about large premium hikes to \nrest, and move to guarantee the disabled access to private Medigap \npolicies.\n  This bill will help people like a 44-year-old man from Capon Bridge, \nWV, who qualifies for Medicare because of a disability. He earns too \nmuch money to qualify for Medicaid and is unable to buy a private \nMedigap policy because of a chronic medical condition.\n  Medigap insurers in West Virginia refuse to sell him a policy because \nof his medical condition. A 47-year-old woman from Slanesville, WV, is \nin a similar situation. She was uninsured before qualifying for \nMedicare because of a chronic kidney disease that requires dialysis. \nHer husband and she have too many assets to qualify for Medicaid and \nthey cannot afford the $300 a month, or $3,600 a year premium for \nhealth insurance provided through\n\n[[Page S10603]]\n\nher husband's job. The average cost of a Medigap policy ranges from \n$700 to $1,000 a year. Access to a Medigap policy would be a more \naffordable option for this family.\n  Mr. President, our bill also includes a section to help seniors \nchoose the right health plan for them by ensuring that they get good \ninformation on what plans are available in their area.\n  It allows them to compare different health plans based on results of \nconsumer satisfaction surveys, and will include information on benefits \nand costs.\n  Our bill does not directly address affordability. Just as the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill was not able to take that step, we leave it to \nthe States to consider ways to promote affordable Medigap premiums. But \nCongress has some history in the Medigap market, with legislation \npassed in 1980, and again in 1990, to guarantee at least a minimal \nlevel of value across all Medigap policies. Under the current law that \nI helped enact back in 1990, individual and group Medigap policies must \nspend at least 65 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of all premium \ndollars collected, on benefits. If a Medigap plan fails to meet these \nminimum loss ratios, they must issue refunds or credits to their \ncustomers.\n  Mr. President, while Federal loss ratio standards help assure a \nminimum level of value, they do not prevent insurance companies from \nannually upping premiums as a senior ages. This practice--known as \nattained age-rating--results in the frailest and the lowest income \nseniors facing large, annual premium hikes as they age. I would hope \nthat more States would follow the lead of at least five other States \nwho have banned attained age-rating. This would vastly improve the \naffordability of Medigap for the oldest and frailest of our seniors.\n  Mr. President, our bill is a targeted, modest bill. But if and when \nwe enact it, it will provide very real, very significant help to the \nseniors who, year in and year out, pay out billions of dollars in \npremiums in order to have the extra protection of Medigap protection.\n  It is wrong and unfair when senior and disabled citizens in West \nVirginia and across the country are suddenly dropped by insurers or \ndenied a Medigap policy just because they move to another State, or \ntheir employer cuts back on promised retiree health benefits, or \nbecause they're disabled.\n  In the bipartisan and practical spirit of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, \nwe now propose the same kind of commonsense, consumer protections and \nreforms, to help over 33 million senior citizens and almost 5 million \ndisabled Americans. It is a great honor to be presenting this bill with \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, someone who is responsible for many of \nthe country's most important achievements in health care. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill, and to help us extend the health \ncare peace of mind that older and disabled Americans ask for and \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2076. A bill to increase economic benefits to the United States \nfrom the activities of cruise ships visiting Alaska; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        cruise ship legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing a very \nimportant measure--one that will unlock and open a door that Congress \nhas kept barred for over 100 years.\n  Opening that door will create a path to thousands of new jobs, to \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity and to \nmillions in new Federal, State, and local government revenues. \nFurthermore, Mr. President, that door can be opened with no adverse \nimpact on any existing U.S. industry, labor interest or on the \nenvironment, and it will cost the Government virtually nothing.\n  There is no magic to this; in fact, it's a very simple matter. My \nbill merely allows United States ports to compete for the growing \ncruise ship trade to Alaska, and encourages the development of an all-\nAlaska cruise business, as well.\n  The bill amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign cruise \nships to operate to and from Alaska, and between Alaska ports. However, \nit also very carefully protects all existing U.S. passenger vessels by \nusing a definition of ``cruise ships'' designed to exclude any foreign-\nflag vessels that could conceivably compete in the same market as U.S.-\nflag tour boats or ferries. Finally, it provides a mechamism to \nguarantee that if a U.S. vessel ever enters this trade in the future, \nsteps will be taken to ensure an ample pool of potential passengers.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward approach to a vexing \nproblem, and it deserves the support of this body.\n  Let us look at the facts. U.S. ports currently are precluded from \ncompeting for the Alaska cruise ship trade by the Passenger Service Act \nof 1886, which bars foreign vessels from carrying passengers on one-way \nvoyages between U.S. ports. However, it isn't 1886 anymore. These days, \nno one is building any U.S. passenger ships of this type, and no one \nhas built one in over 40 years.\n  Because there are no U.S. vessels in this important trade, the only \nreal effect of the Passenger Service Act is to force all the vessels \nsailing to Alaska to base their operations in an foreign port instead \nof a U.S. city.\n  Mr. President, what we have here is an act of Congress prohibiting \nU.S. cities from competing for thousands of jobs and hundreds of \nmillions in business dollars. That is worse than absurd--in light of \nour ever-popular election-year promises to help the economy, it belongs \nin Letterman's ``Top Ten Reasons Why Congress Doesn't Know What It's \nDoing.''\n  How, Mr. President, can anyone argue with a straight face for the \ncontinuation of a policy that fails utterly to benefit any identifiable \nAmerican interst, while actively discouraging economic growth.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time I have introduced this \nlegislation. When I began, Alaska-bound cruise passengers totaled about \n200,000 per year. By last year, almost three times that many people--\nmost of them American citizens--were making that voyage. Almost 600,000 \npeople joined an Alaska bound vessel in 1995, and almost all those \nsailings originated in Vancouver, BC--not because Vancouver is \nnecessarily a better port, but because our own foolish policy demands \nit.\n  The cash flow generated by this trade is enormous. Most passengers \nfly in or out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington \nState, but because of the law, they spend little time there. Instead, \nthey spend their pre- and post-sailing time in a Vancouver hotel, at \nVancouver restaurants, and in Vancouver gift shops. And when their \nvessel sails, it sails with food, fuel general supplies, repair and \nmaintenance needs taken care of by Vancouver vendors.\n  According to some estimates the city of Vancouver receives benefits \nof well over $200 million per year. Others provide more modest \nestimates, such as a comprehensive study by the International Council \nof Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 alone, the Alaska cruise \ntrade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city of Vancouver, plus \npayments to Canadian vendors and employees of over $119 million. If \nthat business had taken place inside the United States, it would have \nbeen worth additional Federal, State, and local tax revenues of \napproximately $60 million.\n  In addition to the opportunities now being shunted to Vancouver, we \nare also missing an opportunity to create entirely new jobs and income \nthrough the potential to develop new cruising routes between Alaska \nports. The city of Ketchikan, AK, was told a few years ago that two \nrelatively small cruise ships were very interested in establishing \nshort cruises within southeast Alaska. I'm told such a business could \nhave contributed $2 million or more to that small community's economy, \nand created dozens of new jobs. But, because of the current policy, the \nopportunity simply evaporated.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we allow this to happen? This is a market \nalmost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to see one of the United \nState's most spectacular places, and yet we force them to go to another \ncountry to do it. We are throwing away both money and jobs--and getting \nnothing whatsoever in return.\n  Why is this allowed to happen? The answer is simple--but it is not \nrational. Although the current law is actually a job loser, there are \nthose who argue that any change would weaken\n\n[[Page S10604]]\n\nU.S. maritime interests. I submit, Mr. President, that is not the case.\n  For some inexplicable reason, paranoia runs deep among those who \noppose this bill. They seem to feel that amending the Passenger Service \nAct so that it makes sense for the United States would create a threat \nto Jones Act vessels hauling freight between U.S. ports. Mr. President, \nthere simply is no connection whatsoever between the two. I have \nrepeatedly made clear that I have no intention of using this bill to \ncreate cracks in the Jones Act.\n  This bill would actually enhance--not impede--opportunities for U.S. \nworkers. Both shipyard workers and longshoremen--not to mention hotel \nand restaurant workers and many others--would have a great deal to gain \nfrom this legislation, and the bill has been carefully written to \nprevent the loss of any existing jobs in other trades.\n  Finally, let me dispose of any suggestion that this bill might farm \nsmaller U.S. tour or excursion boats. The industry featuring these \nsmaller vessels is thriving, but it simply does not cater to the same \nclient base as large cruise ships. For one thing, the tour boats \noperating in Alaska are all much smaller--under 1,000 tons compared to \nthe 5,000 ton minimum for cruise ships in this bill. The larger vessels \ncan offer unmatched luxury and personal service, on-board shopping, \nentertainment, and so forth. The smaller vessels offer more flexible \nroutes, the ability to get closer to Alaska's natural attractions, and \nother benefits. There is no significant competition between the two \ntypes of vessel, because the passengers inclined to one are not likely \nto be inclined to the other.\n  Mr. President, I cannot claim that this legislation would immediately \nlead to increased earnings for U.S. ports. I can only say that it would \nallow them to compete fairly, instead of being anchored by a rule that \nis actively harmful to U.S. interests. It is, as I said at the \nbeginning of this statement, only a way to open the door.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about growing the economy and creating \njobs during the last few years, and we are bound to keep hearing those \nphrases even more often over the next few months. But we all know, Mr. \nPresident, that such changes are easier to talk about than they are to \naccomplish. Well, Mr. President, here is a bill that opens the door to \nthousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of new dollars, and does it \nwithout one red cent of taxpayer money.\n  It has been 110 years since the current law was enacted, and it's \ntime for a change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2077. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to improve the \nact, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             The Commodity Exchange Act Amendments of 1996\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I are \nintroducing legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This bill \nfollows several months of hearings and informal consultations with \nindustry, academics and regulators. The legislation streamlines U.S. \nfutures trading law, conforming it to changing competitive realities.\n  In many ways, regulation has benefited the U.S. futures industry. \nPrudent regulation enhances customer protection, prevents and punishes \nfraud and other abuses, and makes futures markets better able to \nprovide risk management, price discovery and investment opportunity.\n  Regulation, however, also has its costs. U.S. futures markets face \ncompetition that is, in some cases, less regulated or differently \nregulated. In the years ahead, our challenge is to balance the need for \nadequate regulation with the need to offer cost-competitive products.\n  This bill tries to strike such a balance. It requires the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission to consider the costs for industry of the \nregulations it imposes. The bill streamlines the process of introducing \nnew futures contracts, reducing the time that is required to begin \ntrading these new products. It makes similar reforms to the process by \nwhich exchanges' rules are reviewed by the CFTC.\n  Where additional authority for the CFTC is needed, the bill provides \nit. The CFTC will have the authority to require delivery points for \noverseas futures markets to provide information that is also regularly \ndemanded of American market participants. This is eminently reasonable, \nand may assist the CFTC and other regulators in the future if \nsituations similar to the current copper market scandal recur.\n  The bill will also provide greater legal certainty for swaps, over-\nthe-counter products that are of increasing importance to many \nbusinesses. It is important that these contracts' enforceability be \nmade more certain, so that legal risk does not compound the other risks \ninherent in any financial transaction.\n  The bill contains a number of other provisions. I have provided a \ndescriptive summary which may be helpful to our colleagues. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this document and the text of \nthe introduced bill be printed in the Record.\n  It is late in the session, and I do not expect the Commodity Exchange \nAct Amendments of 1996 to become law this year. Senator Leahy and I \nwanted to introduce it to spur discussion and debate, so that early in \nthe next Congress we can again introduce the bill, with any refinements \nthat may be developed in the interim. We both intend that the bill will \nbe a major focus of attention for the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry next year.\n  As usual, I am indebted to Senator Leahy for his bipartisan \ncooperation in this as in so many other endeavors. I am honored that he \nis an original co-sponsor of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In \n     Section 3 of the CEA, which contains various legislative \n     findings that justify regulation of futures markets, the \n     statute speaks of business operators ``hedging themselves \n     against possible loss through fluctuations in price.'' \n     Questions have been raised whether hedging can occur against \n     risks other than price risks--for instance, in new futures \n     contracts that are based on yields of specified crops in \n     particular states. The bill deletes the phrase ``through \n     fluctuations in price.'' It makes clear that risks to be \n     hedged may be risks other than those directly resulting from \n     price changes. This change will not affect the authority to \n     establish speculative limits, require reporting of large \n     trader positions and otherwise ensure market integrity.\n       Section 3. Delivery Points for Foreign Futures Contracts.\n       In recent years, some overseas futures exchanges have \n     established delivery points in the U.S. The implications of \n     making and taking delivery of a physical commodity that is \n     priced on a foreign exchange may differ, depending on the \n     comparability of price discovery on that exchange and on U.S. \n     exchanges, as well as other factors. Serious questions have \n     been raised, as the current scandal in the copper markets has \n     unfolded, about what role, if any, delivery points for \n     foreign futures contracts may have played in that affair. \n     These questions are not yet answered. However, the \n     legislation makes changes that will be appropriate regardless \n     of the outcome of specific investigations.\n       The bill directs the CFTC to consult with overseas \n     regulators and other appropriate parties in countries where \n     futures exchanges have established U.S. delivery points. The \n     aim of the consultations will be to secure adequate \n     assurances against any adverse effect on U.S. markets because \n     of these delivery points. Such assurances could take the form \n     of changes to regulations or trading rules in the overseas \n     market.\n       The bill also gives the CFTC authority to obtain \n     information from warehouses that are delivery points for \n     foreign exchanges. This information would be similar to that \n     which the CFTC may already require of persons making trades \n     on overseas futures markets, and will assist the CFTC in \n     ensuring market integrity, preventing abuses and otherwise \n     discharging its responsibilities.\n       Section 4. Exemption Authority and Swap Exemption.\n       The Act gives the CFTC authority to exempt transactions \n     from its regulatory requirements, either completely or on \n     stated terms. In 1993, the CFTC used this authority to exempt \n     swap agreements from most, but not all, portions of the Act. \n     This exemption generally seems to have worked well, \n     facilitating a climate in which swaps, which offer numerous \n     benefits to their users if properly and prudently employed, \n     could trade with secure legal status. (It was the lack of \n     such legal certainty which, in part, prompted Congress to \n     enact the exemptive authority.)\n       The bill will provide additional legal certainty for swaps \n     transactions in two ways. First, the bill codifies the \n     present exemption from regulation for transactions that meet \n     its requirements, either now or in future. For these \n     qualifying instruments, a statutory change would be required \n     in order for the exemption to become more restrictive than it \n     now is. The codification does not affect the CFTC's power to \n     grant additional exemptions that would be less restrictive \n     than the current exemption. Nor does it limit the CFTC's \n     ability to enforce anti-manipulation or anti-fraud provisions \n     of the CEA as they may apply to these transactions or as the \n     present exemptions may be conditioned on compliance with \n     their provisions.\n       Second, the bill codifies two important elements of the \n     present swaps exemptive authority, again to enhance legal \n     certainty. The legislation clarifies that the CFTC may issue \n     an exemption that is applicable to the extent the exempted \n     transaction may have been subject to the Act--i.e., without \n     requiring a prior decision on whether the transaction \n     actually was, in fact, subject to the Act. Relatedly, the \n     legislation states that the mere fact that a transaction was \n     exempted from the Act does not, in itself, create a \n     presumption that the transaction was one that would have \n     fallen under the Act's regulatory requirements had it not \n     been exempted. Both these clarifications are consistent with \n     present regulations for exemptions.\n       This section of the bill also directs the CFTC to review \n     rules that permit futures exchanges, under narrowly defined \n     conditions, to operate less-regulated markets that are \n     restricted to professional and institutional participants. \n     These so-called ``Part 36'' rules have not, so far, resulted \n     in the active operation of such markets. The issue is an \n     especially important one because of the competitive \n     challenges futures exchanges face, both from overseas markets \n     and from over-the-counter products in the U.S. The \n     legislation does not contemplate greater regulation of the \n     latter markets, and indeed strives to achieve greater legal \n     certainty for O-T-C products. But it does express the view of \n     Congress that futures exchanges need to be able to compete in \n     today's financial marketplace, in a way that reduces \n     regulatory costs of doing business while assuring customer \n     protection. To this end, the CFTC is directed to re-examine \n     the Part 36 rules and report, within a year, to Congress on \n     what if any changes may be appropriate. This broad mandate, \n     as opposed to requirements for specific changes in the \n     current regulations, reflects a view that the CFTC should be \n     better able than Congress to assess necessary reforms. The \n     report will afford an opportunity for Congress to judge the \n     adequacy of any changes, and to contemplate any additional \n     statutory changes that may be required.\n       Section 5. Contract Designation.\n       The Act now requires futures exchanges to be ``designated'' \n     as a ``contract market'' for each futures contract they \n     trade. This process has been streamlined by the CFTC in \n     recent years, but the statute continues to reflect a rather \n     elaborate process in which, in many ways, the burden of proof \n     is placed on exchanges to demonstrate why they should be able \n     to offer new products for trading. Even for a regulated \n     financial sector like the futures industry, this implicit \n     presumption against new product development is out of date. \n     The bill streamlines the process of introducing new futures \n     contracts, both by compressing the time available for agency \n     review and by creating a presumption that products developed \n     by exchanges should be permitted to trade unless the CFTC \n     finds compellingly why they should not. The legislation \n     treats new contract applications as rules, albeit under \n     somewhat different procedures from other exchange rules. \n     Under the new procedure, an exchange submits a new contract \n     to the CFTC. The new contract may trade after 10 business \n     days, unless the CFTC states an intention to review it for \n     possible disapproval. After a further 15 business days, the \n     new contract can be traded unless the CFTC institutes \n     proceedings to disapprove it. These proceedings are to be \n     completed within 120 days; if not, the new contract can trade \n     until and unless it is finally disapproved. In contrast to \n     the present burden on an exchange to show that a contract is \n     in ``the public interest,'' the CFTC could only disapprove a \n     contract by showing that it was ``contrary to the public \n     interest'' (or by showing that it violated law or \n     regulations). The philosophy is a fairly simple one: Subject \n     to prudent regulatory limits, private futures exchanges can \n     more appropriately and efficiently decide which new products \n     are ripe for trading than can the government. The exchanges \n     may sometimes err in these judgments, but that is the way \n     markets work.\n       Section 6. Delivery by Federally Licensed Warehouses.\n       An obscure provision of the Act now allows any federally \n     licensed grain warehouse to make delivery against a futures \n     contract, on giving reasonable notice. Though seldom used, \n     this provision appears to conflict with the ability of \n     exchanges to establish their own trading procedures, \n     including delivery points. In an extremely tight market, the \n     current provision could in some circumstances facilitate \n     market manipulation. The bill repeals this provision.\n       Section 7. Submission of Rules to Commission.\n       The bill revises current requirements for submitting \n     exchange rules to the CFTC. These rules affect the everyday \n     procedures for doing business on the exchange, as well as the \n     ground rules for trading. They run the gamut from major to \n     minor. As with the procedures for approving new contracts, \n     the legislation compresses the time available for federal \n     review and generally streamlines procedures. Rules are to be \n     submitted to the CFTC and can become effective in 10 business \n     days unless the CFTC notifies the exchange that it will \n     review them for possible disapproval. If the CFTC does not \n     institute disapproval proceedings within 45 days of receiving \n     the proposed rule, or conclude its proceedings within 120 \n     days, the rule can become effective until and unless \n     disapproved.\n       The authors of the bill intend that its legislative history \n     will also discuss the implementation of statutory \n     requirements for the composition of exchange boards of \n     directors. The CFTC will be directed to report, on an ongoing \n     basis, its evaluation of how fully these requirements are \n     being met. The report language will provide further \n     clarification of Congressional intent with regard to the \n     qualification of individuals to satisfy particular \n     requirements for board representation.\n       Section 8. Audit Trail.\n       Futures exchanges are subject to audit trail requirements \n     that are intended to ensure market integrity, and to deter \n     and detect abuse. The bill clarifies these requirements in \n     one respect. It states--consistent with testimony by the CFTC \n     before Congress in 1995--that the audit trail requirements \n     establish a performance standard, not a mandate for any \n     particular technological means of achieving the standard. In \n     further support of this clarification, the bill speaks of the \n     ``means selected by the contract market'' for meeting audit \n     trail standards. The authors of the bill intend that its \n     legislative history will also note further CFTC testimony \n     that, in assessing the ``practicability'' of various \n     components of the audit trail standards, the cost to \n     exchanges of meeting the standards is one factor to be taken \n     into account.\n       Section 9. Miscellaneous Technical Amendments.\n       The bill makes several technical changes to correct \n     omissions in the current statute.\n       Section 10. Consideration of Efficiency, Competition, Risk \n     Management, and Antitrust Laws.\n       The bill requires the CFTC, in issuing rules, regulations \n     or some types of orders, to\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\n     take into account the costs and benefits of the action it \n     contemplates. The requirement is not for a quantitative cost-\n     benefit analysis, but a mandate to consider both costs and \n     benefits, as well as other enumerated factors. The authors of \n     the bill believe that in establishing its policies and giving \n     direction to market participants, the CFTC should weigh how \n     its actions may effect the participants' costs of doing \n     business, as well as what benefits may accrue from the \n     action.\n       Some activities of the CFTC, of course, do not call for \n     this kind of approach, and indeed applying a cost-benefit \n     requirement to them would be inappropriate. Thus, the bill \n     exempts the CFTC's adjudicatory and investigative processes, \n     emergency actions and certain findings of fact that are \n     objective, quantitative or otherwise unsuitable for a cost-\n     benefit approach. The bill's eventual legislative history \n     will further discuss Congressional intent in enacting this \n     requirement.\n       Section 11. Disciplinary and enforcement activities.\n       Enforcement is a priority for the CFTC. Like other \n     financial regulators, the CFTC is assisted in its enforcement \n     activities by the complementary rules, surveillance and \n     disciplinary actions of self-regulatory organizations (SROs). \n     These include both the futures exchanges themselves and the \n     National Futures Association. The bill provides guidance to \n     the CFTC on the deployment of enforcement resources, and \n     requires a report in 1 year on the overall enforcement \n     program. The legislation expresses the sense of Congress that \n     the CFTC should avoid unnecessary duplication of effort \n     where SROs have taken adequate action to deter abuse and \n     ensure customer protection. It further states that the \n     CFTC's oversight and disciplinary role should be \n     sufficient to safeguard market integrity and protect \n     public confidence in markets.\n       Section 12. Delegation of functions by the Commission.\n       The CFTC, under current law, has delegated some limited \n     duties to the National Futures Association. Today's austere \n     budget climate makes it prudent for the commission to assess \n     whether other functions could appropriately be delegated. The \n     bill calls on the CFTC to determine which, if any, additional \n     functions should be delegated to SROs, suggesting the use of \n     procedures like spot checks and random audits to ensure that \n     any delegated functions are adequately performed, and \n     requires a report in one year with the results of the review. \n     The authors intend that the bill's legislative history will \n     cite several current CFTC activities that could be considered \n     for delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        Outline of the Commodity Exchange Act Amendments of 1996\n\n       The Commodity Exchange Act has benefited the American \n     economy. It has helped encourage a dynamic, world-class \n     futures trading industry that allows farmers, ranchers and \n     other business operators to manage risk, provides investment \n     opportunities and offers protection to consumers of its \n     services. From time to time, Congress has re-examined the Act \n     to bring it up to date with changing markets. Such an update \n     is now opportune.\n       On June 5, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry heard testimony on the need to update the Commodity \n     Exchange Act. Since then, committee staff have consulted \n     extensively with federal agencies and private industry, \n     seeking to explore the implications of legislative proposals \n     by various groups.\n       As a result of this thorough process, we announced on \n     August 2, 1996, our intention to introduce legislation to \n     amend the Commodity Exchange Act. Today we are introducing \n     that legislation. Because it is late in the legislative \n     session, we do not intend that the bill become law this year. \n     We intend it to spark discussion, so that the Congress can \n     make comprehensive revisions to the Act in 1997.\n       There is a public interest in a strong, competitive U.S. \n     futures industry because of its critical role in price \n     discovery and business risk management. This public interest \n     implies, and requires, a degree of regulation. In recent \n     years, U.S. futures exchanges have also faced increasing \n     competition from foreign exchanges and from over-the-counter \n     derivative products.\n       U.S. exchanges face some regulatory costs that are not \n     borne by their competitors. The Act, and the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission's actions to implement its \n     requirements, must strike an appropriate balance between \n     prudent regulation and the need for a cost-competitive \n     industry.\n       In our August 2 statement, we noted the importance of a \n     provision of the Act called the ``Treasury amendment.'' This \n     amendment excludes interbank foreign exchange transactions \n     and some other enumerated transactions from the CFTC's \n     jurisdiction. It has been the subject of much more frequent \n     litigation than other sections of the Act. It was written, in \n     some haste, in 1974 at a time when many financial markets and \n     instruments were different or less fully developed than \n     today. The case for Congress to revisit, reassess and clarify \n     the Treasury amendment is compelling.\n       We asked the CFTC and the Treasury Department to conclude \n     discussions which they had begun some months before, and \n     report their progress around Labor Day. Unfortunately, these \n     discussions have so far produced some points of agreement but \n     no overall consensus among the two agencies or among the \n     other members of the President's working group on financial \n     markets.\n       We are disappointed that an agreement on the Treasury \n     amendment has not yet been forged. The issues raised by the \n     amendment seem to us substantial but not insurmountable. In \n     fairness to the Administration, there is not yet a consensus \n     in the private sector either about the appropriate scope of \n     the amendment's exclusions from the Act.\n       With some reluctance, we have been persuaded to defer \n     addressing the Treasury amendment in this bill. The \n     Administration asserts that given furhter time, it will be \n     able to reach internal agreement. We are today informing the \n     Administration that, in our view, an agreement by the end of \n     this year is necessary so that the issue can be presented to \n     our colleagues at the beginning of the 105th Congress. If the \n     Administration is not able to present its ideas by the end of \n     1996, we will reluctantly conclude that no consensus in the \n     executive branch is likely, and not await further agency \n     deliberations.\n       Deferring a provision of the Treasury amendment does not \n     diminish its importance. Since today's legislation will have \n     to be reintroduced in January 1997, we believe this course of \n     action is prudent, since not only the Administration but also \n     various interested private groups will have the opportunity \n     to confer between now and the end of the year. We urge them \n     to do so. Independent of both efforts, we are considering a \n     variety of specific reforms to the Treasury amendment, and \n     will be interested to compare these ideas to those of the \n     private sector and the Administration. We intend that the \n     reintroduced version of today's bill will propose a solution \n     to the Treasury amendment problem.\n       We invite public comment on the Commodity Exchange Act \n     Amendments. We believe this bill represents sound policies. \n     We want to take full account, however, of other views. As we \n     said in August, the bill is neither an opening gambit nor a \n     least common denominator. It represents our best judgment of \n     how the Act should prudently be changed, but our minds remain \n     open.\n       The Agriculture Committee's work on the Commodity Exchange \n     Act has been bipartisan and collegial. Like the 1996 farm \n     bill, the landmark new food safety law and other important \n     laws originated by the committee, this legislative effort is \n     one on which we have worked together. Our cooperation will \n     continue.\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senator Lugar and I are \nintroducing legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This \nlegislation updates and streamlines U.S. futures trading law.\n  There is a strong interest in maintaining a viable futures market. \nSenator Lugar's and my review of committee testimony combined with the \ninformal meetings with the industry, regulators, and interested \nacademics has convinced us that it is appropriate to make these \nrevisions to the CEA.\n  I do not expect that this bill will become law during this session. \nBut introducing it now will afford an opportunity to engage in an \nactive public discussion and debate over the changes that we propose \nhere today.\n  It is my experience that such a dialog helps develop solid bipartisan \nlegislation. As with most issues, there are many interests that must be \nbalanced. And, Senator Lugar and I have strived to strike the right \nbalance between these interests. But we will profit from the dicussions \nthat this bill is sure to prompt.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague in offering this bill. Senator \nLugar and I have worked together on futures issues since we came to the \nAgriculture Committee. We did the same on this bill--working to ensure \nthat these markets remain competitive while still maintaining effective \nprovisions on customer protection and market integrity such as the 1992 \naudit trail provisions.\n  I look forward to continuing our discussions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2078. A bill to authorize the sale of excess Department of Defense \naircraft to facilitate the suppression of wildfire; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n             the wildfire suppression aircraft transfer act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this Nation has had a very severe \nfire season this year. So far almost 6 million acres have burned. The \naverage amount burned over the last 6 years is a little over 2 million \nacres per year. Airplanes, known as airtankers, play a critical role in \nfighting wildfires. Airtankers are used in the initial attack of \nwildfires in support of firefighters on the ground and, on large \nwildfires, to aid in the protection of lives and structures from \nrapidly advancing fires.\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\n  Today, I and my colleagues, Senators Kempthorne and Craig, are \nintroducing legislation that will help ensure that Federal firefighters \ncontinue to have access to airtanker services. The Wildfire Suppression \nAircraft Transfer Act of 1996 will help facilitate the sale of former \nmilitary aircraft to contractors who provide firefighting services to \nthe Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The existing \nfleet of available airtankers is aging rapidly and fleet modernization \nis critical to the continued success of the firefighting program.\n  Currently, legislative authority does not exist for the transfer or \nsale of excess turbine-powered military aircraft, suitable for \nconversion to airtankers, to private operators. This greatly hampers \nefforts to modernize the airtanker fleet. This bill will require that \nthe aircraft be used only for firefighting activities.\n  Time is very short, but it is critical that this bill become law in \nthis Congress. If we fail to pass this law, airtanker operators will \nnot have access to the planes they need to update the aging airtanker \nfleet.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to ensure that Federal \nfirefighters have the resources they need to protect the public and \ntheir property from the threat of wildfires.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 2079. A bill to repeal the prohibition against State restrictions \non communications between government agencies and the INS; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             alien information provision repeal legislation\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 11, Mayor \nRudolph W. Giuliani of New York City delivered an address at Georgetown \nUniversity Law School about an obscure provision in the recently passed \nwelfare legislation. The provision, section 434 of the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or \n     local law, no State or local government entity may be \n     prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or \n     receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS) information regarding the immigration status, lawful or \n     unlawful, of an alien in the United States.\n\nMayor Giuliani said it would ``create chaos in New York City.'' I agree \nwith him that this provision is ill-advised and threatens the public \nhealth and safety of residents of New York City. It conflicts with a \n1985 executive order issued by then-Mayor Edward I. Koch prohibiting \ncity employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to the INS \nunless the alien was charged with a crime. That executive order, which \nis similar to local laws in other States and cities, was intended to \nensure that fear of deportation does not deter illegal aliens from \nseeking emergency medical attention, reporting crimes, and so on.\n  An earlier version of this provision was first introduced in welfare \nlegislation during the 103d Congress as a part of H.R. 3500, the \nResponsibility and Empowerment Support Program Providing Employment, \nChild Care, and Training Act, sponsored by Representatives Michel, \nGingrich, and Santorum. On September 8, 1995, during Senate \nconsideration of H.R. 4, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, Senator \nSantorum, along with Senator Nickles, offered a similar amendment. The \namendment was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 91 to 6, but H.R. 4 \nwas later vetoed by President Clinton.\n  This year, the provision was included in S. 1795, the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which \nwas signed by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.\n  Because this provision poses a threat to health and safety in New \nYork City and elsewhere, I am today introducing legislation to repeal \nsection 434 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996.

For purposes of this \n     paragraph, relevant organization means the Codex Alimenterius \n     Commission or other international organization deemed \n     appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may, under \n     procedures specified by regulation, revoke a tolerance \n     established under this paragraph if information demonstrates \n     that the use of the new drug under actual use conditions \n     results in food being imported into the United States with \n     residues exceeding the tolerance.''\n\n     SEC.  75.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to \none of Boston's most celebrated local institutions--which is soon to be \nno more--and to the man who has done so much to make that place the \nvery special corner of town that it is.\n  To running enthusiasts across the Nation, the Eliot Lounge is well \nknown as the unofficial headquarters of the Boston Marathon--a \ncongenial watering hole where the world's elite runners rub elbows, and \nperhaps down a beer or two, with weekend joggers and others even less \nathletically inclined. But anyone who has ever dropped by the corner of \nMassachusetts and Commonwealth Avenues knows that the Eliot is far more \nthan just a runner's tavern.\n  The Eliot is a gathering place, and a welcoming haven, for men and \nwomen from all different backgrounds and walks of life: stockbrokers \nand steam fitters, journalists and office clerks, teachers and police \nofficers and even the occasional politician have all found a warm \nwelcome there. It is a place where old-fashioned hospitality and \ncamaraderie still endure, a place where strangers become old friends \nwith just a few easy words--a neighborhood bar, it's been said, for \npeople who don't necessarily live in the neighborhood.\n  For the better part of two decades now, the camaraderie and good \nfellowship of the Eliot Lounge have been personified by one man: Tommy \nLeonard. From his post behind the bar, T.L. has dispensed wit and \nwisdom to all corners--always brimming with enthusiasm and good cheer, \nand always eager to help the first-time visitor to Boston learn all the \nextraordinary charms of our most extraordinary city.\n  As devoted distance runner and founder of the renowned Falmouth Road \nRace, it was Mr. Leonard who first introduced the running community to \nthe charms of the Eliot Lounge. But even more important, it is Tommy \nLeonard who embodies the tremendous generosity of spirit that has long \ncharacterized the special place.\n  Just as he proudly served his country years ago in the U.S. Marine \nCorps, Mr. Leonard continues to serve the people of Boston in countless \ndifferent ways. Over the years T.L. has organized charity drives for \nscores of worthy causes; whether money was needed to replace a beloved \nchildren's statue stolen from the Boston Public Garden, to set up a \nscholarship fund for the children of a slain police officer, or to meet \nthe medical bills of a badly injured former marathon star, Mr. Leonard \nhas always been at the forefront of those looking to help.\n  Tommy Leonard is the first to point out that he has not been alone in \nthese endeavors. Indeed, the entire staff of the Eliot Lounge deserves \ntremendous credit for their years of charitable work--as does Eddie \nDoyle, another legendary Boston publican who is Mr. Leonard's frequent \npartner in good deeds.\n  But over the years it has been Tommy Leonard who has, time and again, \nprovided the inspiration and the energy needed to get the job done: to \nturn well-intentioned wishes into concrete deeds. To prove that the \nvolunteer spirit is still alive and well in America today. To harness \nthe generosity and good will of an entire community and, together, to \nmake a real difference in the lives of others.\n  Some who know him say that if Tommy Leonard had only devoted his \nboundless energy and his promotional genius to making money for \nhimself, he would be a rich man today. But, Mr. President, others who \nknow him--myself included--look at the joy that he has brought to so \nmany others, and we know that Tommy Leonard is already wealthy in the \nways that really matter.\n  But now, Mr. President, after all these years, there will soon be no \nmore Eliot Lounge for Tommy Leonard to call home. The congenial little \ntavern that has seen so many famous faces and so much good cheer will \nbe closing its doors by the end of this month.\n  Before that happens, Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto salute Tommy Leonard, and his colleagues on the staff of the Eliot \nLounge, for all the generosity they have shown and all the good works \nthey have so cheerfully performed over the years. I applaud them, I \nwish them Godspeed, and I also remind them:\n  As T.L. so often observes, ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' And it is even \nmore so, T.L. and colleagues, because of all that you have \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10615-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10615-S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SARAH SCHOFIELD AND ERIN MITCHELL, NEW HAMPSHIRE STUDENTS \n    WHO ARE RECIPIENTS OF THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise before you today to \ncongratulate two young New Hampshire students for their outstanding \nwork on behalf of their community. Sarah Schofield of Gilbert H. Hood \nMiddle School in Derry, NH, and Erin Mitchell of Londonderry High \nSchool in Londonderry, NH have both been honored with the Prudential \nSpirit of Community Awards. In recognition of their hard work and \ndedication to their communities, Sarah and Erin will both receive a \nsilver medallion, $1,000, and a trip to Washington, DC.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards honors students who best \nexemplify community spirit by their self-initiated volunteer work. The \nawards are sponsored by the Prudential Insurance Co. of America in \npartnership with the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals. The program recognizes deserving students in local schools, \nidentifies the best examples of community service, and culminates in \nnaming America's top 10 youth volunteers of the year. For the 1996 \nawards, the program drew applications from more than 7,000 young people \nacross the Nation. Both Sarah and Erin should be very proud of this \ndistinguished recognition.\n  Sarah Schofield was recognized for her participation in a Christmas \nevent at a local nursing home. Along with several of her peers from her \nchurch's Sunday school, Sarah went to a nursing home with gift baskets \nand sang Christmas carols for the residents. Due to the great success \nof the group's first effort at the nursing home, several other trips \nwere planned after the Christmas event.\n  Erin Mitchell was recognized for creating a Girl's Group, to match \ngirls from her scouting troop with girls who have disabilities. All the \ngirls gather together regularly for theater trips, bowling, camping, \nand a variety of other activities. Erin's program allows the families \nof the disabled girls to know that their daughters are making new \nfriends. Erin's inspiration for developing the group came from her \nexperience of working with the Special Olympics.\n  I am extremely proud to congratulate both Sarah Schofield and Erin\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\nMitchell for exemplifying the leadership and willingness to act on the \nbehalf of others in their New Hampshire communities. Both students have \nmade a tremendous difference in the lives of other people. \nCongratulations to them on their hard work and distinguished \nrecognition. They are an inspiration to the youth of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10615-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA PETER GALBRAITH\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during much of my time in the Senate \nI was fortunate to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. With our \nresponsibility to approve the nominations of ambassadors and others, I \nhad the opportunity to meet so many of the fine men and women who serve \nour Nation overseas. One of those outstanding public servants is Peter \nGalbraith.\n  I got to know Peter when I came to the Foreign Relations Committee in \n1985 and he was a staff member. I was grateful for the diligent, \nthoughtful, and excellent staff work he provided. In 1993, I was \npleased to vote to approve his nomination as the first-ever U.S. \nAmbassador to Croatia, a position he currently holds.\n  There has been a certain amount of controversy surrounding Ambassador \nGalbraith in the last year. This summer he was called to testify before \nCongress on his involvement relating to third-party transfers of arms \nto the Muslims in Bosnia. While Ambassador Galbraith has faced \ncriticism from several corners, it seems to me that he was doing the \njob that ambassadors are supposed to do, and that is carry out the \npolicies set forth by the President and his administration.\n  Peter has at times been disparaged as an activist. If this label is \napplied to someone who wants to change things for the better, then \nPeter should be proud of that characterization. As a staffer on the \nForeign Relations Committee, he was known as a tireless campaigner for \nhuman rights. The story of his trip to Iraqi Kurdistan after the gulf \nwar is well known. He helped bring attention to the plight of the Kurds \nand rescued key documents before they could fall into the hands of \nSaddam Hussein's regime. Benazir Bhutto, now Prime Minister of \nPakistan, credited Peter with helping attain her release from prison. \nAnd in another famous incident, he achieved in helping Senator Pat \nMoynihan--a strong advocate for the Bosnian Muslims--get into Sarajevo \nin 1992 to survey the besieged city. This event may have aggravated \nsome United States military officials at the time, but it helped \nincrease the Senate's understanding of what was going on in Bosnia.\n  Now, as the first envoy to Croatia, a nation only 5 years old, \nAmbassador Galbraith has had the responsibility to develop the new \nrelationship between our two countries. His service has occurred during \nan extremely trying and tragic period in the Balkans. Such a job is not \neasy, and it is understandable to see how one could get stuck between a \nrock and a hard place. These circumstances call for strong and able, \neven aggressive, diplomats, and Ambassador Galbraith has been just \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/16/senate-section/article/S10616-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1996\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
