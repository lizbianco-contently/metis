As \nwe convene, it is difficult not to consider every issue in terms of the \nforthcoming elections. Our differences are sharply focused; the spirit \nof competition runs high; we are tempted to become users of our process \nhere to posture our positions. Sometimes our eyes are on the polls and \nnot on You, and our passion for winning vies with our passion for \npatriotism.\n  In this quiet moment, before we begin this day, and our fall season, \nwe deliberately reorder our priorities. We renew our basic commitment \nto seek first Your will, what is best for America, and what will \nglorify You. May these priorities be the basis of our unity. Keep us \nclose to You and open to each other. We commit to Your care our friends \nand brother Americans, Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Bob Dole and Jack \nKemp, as they debate the issues and prepare for the November \nPresidential elections. Watch over their families and surround them \nwith Your protection. We ask for Your guidance in dealing with the \ncrisis of aggression by Saddam Hussein in the Kurdish zone of northern \nIraq. Grant us wisdom each step of the way in this strategic situation. \nThrough our Lord and Savior. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9681-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WELCOME BACK\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I hope amendments, though, will be offered and debated on the \nbill today, with those votes to occur tomorrow morning, hopefully, \nbeginning at 9 or 9:30. I hope we complete action on the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill early this week so we may consider other available \nappropriations, as well as conference reports for such bills as the \nD.C. appropriations conference, the military construction \nappropriations conference, the legislative appropriations conference, \nas well as the Defense authorization conference report.\n  Also, this week we have a consent agreement with respect to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act. All Senators \nshould be prepared for busy sessions of the Senate this week and the \nweeks to follow as we prepare to complete our business prior to the \nadjournment of this Congress.\n  Also, I should note that under the unanimous-consent agreement with \nrelation to H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act, there were four \namendments on each side that were provided for, and those amendments \nwill need to be filed by 5 o'clock this afternoon or exchanged, so we \ncan get a chance to look at the amendments that might be offered on \nThursday of this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9681-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 3953\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I trust, as well, that his month was \nproductive and restful and successful in many respects.\n  I look forward to working with him on a number of the issues he \nmentioned. The one omission I cite, and I am sure it was an oversight, \nbut I look forward to working with him on that as well, is the \nExecutive Calendar, which was a matter that was unresolved prior to the \ntime we left, and of great concern to colleagues on this side of the \naisle.\n  I also indicate to the majority leader that it would be my hope that \nhe and I could sponsor a joint resolution or a resolution which would \nindicate our support for the actions taken in Iraq. I hope there would \nbe broad bipartisan, virtually unanimous, support for the actions \ntaken. I intend to talk with the distinguished majority leader about \nthat throughout the day.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of work to do. I must say I am very \nhopeful that in the short time that we have available to us we can make \nit a productive time. Obviously, appropriations bills will deserve, as \nthey should, the highest priority. As we were able to do in the \nremaining days of the session prior to the recess, Democrats and \nRepublicans came together on a number of bills, and I hope that would \nset a very important precedent and a standard by which we will judge \nour progress and our ability to work together in the remaining weeks of \nthis session.\n  I will have much more to say about the President's actions in Iraq, \nas well as the convention, in the time allotted to Democrats prior to 2 \no'clock this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9682-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This morning, the President of the United States ordered \nthe use of cruise missiles against key strategic targets in Iraq. \nPresident Clinton noted in his address that despite clear warnings from \nthe United States and the international community, Iraqi forces \nattacked and seized the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil. Iraq's latest \nattack repeats a pattern the civilized world has seen before. Saddam \nHussein is prepared to use force at any time to achieve his end, to \nthreaten his neighbors, to terrorize his own people, and to undermine \nthe stability of the entire Middle East.\n  This act of naked aggression violates the spirit if not the letter of \nthe United Nations' resolution adopted shortly after Saddam's earlier \nmisguided attempts at transforming the balance of power in the Middle \nEast. President Clinton correctly stated that if we did not respond \nfirmly and decisively at this time, Saddam would conclude he could act \nwith impunity.\n  The purpose of the U.S. military action is twofold: First, Saddam \nmust pay a price for his attack on the Kurds; second, by extending the \nno-fly zone and eliminating certain air defense assets, we have reduced \nthe threat he poses to others. To our allies and to others overseas, \nPresident Clinton and the United States will continue to do all that is \nnecessary to protect our national and our international interests. And \nthe President will continue to consult closely with our allies as he \ndid before taking this action.\n  Finally, I am optimistic that all Americans will set aside partisan \npolitical differences and stand behind the administration at this \nimportant time. Senator Dole's latest comments indicate that he \nsupports the United States strikes, and I am pleased to know that \nothers in his party have had similar reactions. I expect strong, if not \nunanimous, bipartisan support for the President's decision to launch a \nUnited States strike against Iraq this morning.\n  As I indicated earlier today, it will be my intention to work with \nthe majority leader to propose a resolution of support for the \nPresident's actions later today, to be voted upon tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I hope Saddam Hussein and those who are in control of \nthe Iraqi Government clearly understand the resolve and the \ndetermination of this administration and this country. This may be a \npolitical year, and we may now be in the most contentious time of the \nentire Presidential campaign, but on this issue there can be no \ndisunity. There can be no lack of cohesion. We stand united, \nRepublicans and Democrats, determined to send as clear a message with \nas clear a resolve as we can articulate: Saddam Hussein's actions will \nnot be tolerated. His willingness to brutally attack Kurds in northern \nIraq and abrogate U.N. resolutions is simply unacceptable.\n  We intend to make that point clear with the use of force, with the \nuse of legislative language, and with the use of other actions that the \nPresident and the Congress have at their disposal. We stand united in \nsupport of the President's commitment to stand up against Iraq's \naggression, and we should continue to demonstrate our support for the \nadministration's response in the weeks and months ahead, regardless of \nthe actions taken by Saddam Hussein.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: It is my \nunderstanding that from the hour of 12:30 until 2 o'clock that time is \nallotted to either myself or a designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That will not be the subject of our \ndiscourse this afternoon. But before we get into it I wanted to \nacknowledge my concern, and I am sure the concerns of all of my \ncitizens in Georgia at home and across the Nation as we hope that each \nof their journeys is a safe one and that they all return ultimately to \ntheir assignments and ultimately at home here in the United States \nsafely and in good keeping.\n  So our thoughts are with all our armed services personnel wherever\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\nthey may be at this very, very difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9682-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE DRUG EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Today we are going to talk about another war, and that \nis the domestic war that is infecting millions upon millions of \nAmericans--primarily teenagers--as we deal with yet a new drug epidemic \nin the United States. And ``epidemic'' is the right word. It is hard to \nbelieve that we are in the midst of one. And we hope that the next hour \nand a half will be in part a wake-up call to Americans across our land \nthat all of us have to be engaged in--putting the question mark in the \nmind of every teenager as to the effect on their lives of abuse of \ndrugs. All I can say is, even if they ultimately recuperate from it, \nthat their lives will be unalterably and forever changed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for up to 10 minutes on this issue. I know he wants to say a word \nor two about Iraq as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I have always tried to make it a matter of \npolicy to be supportive of the President on international and military \naffairs whenever possible. I think each of us in the Senate owe it to \nthe President to give him the benefit of the doubt on military matters. \nCertainly we owe it to those in uniform to be supportive of them when \nthey are in harm's way.\n  I believe that given the conflict among the warring Kurdish factions \nin the northern part of Iraq and the instability there that the \nPresident's actions can be justified both to send a warning to Saddam \nHussein and to destroy the air defense capability in the southern part \nof the country so that we might extend the no-fly zone.\n  But, having said that, Mr. President, let me make it very clear that \nwhile giving the President the benefit of the doubt I can support the \nactions he has taken in firing 27 cruise missiles and destroying air \ndefense capacity in expanding the no-fly zone, and while I certainly \nsupport our military forces in the region, if we look at the \nfundamental conflict, it is a conflict between two warring Kurdish \nfactions--one backed by Iraq and one backed by Iran, and we do not have \na dog in that fight.\n  If this conflict escalates, if this becomes a conflict between Iran \nand Iraq, I think the President would be poorly advised in becoming \ninvolved in that conflict and I would not and could not support such an \ninvolvement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9683-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9683-S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE DRUG EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about drug use. \nYou may recall that many people derided or made fun of Nancy Reagan's \n``just say no'' approach to the use of illegal drugs. But I think it is \ninteresting that for 11 years in a row during the Reagan-Bush era drug \nuse among our children declined. Just saying no was a policy that \nworked. It seems now that we are not saying no enough in Washington and \nour children are not saying no enough in our junior high schools.\n  If we look at the record on drug use, it is a frightening sight as to \nwhat is happening. Overall drug use has more than doubled in the last 4 \nyears. Drug use among teenagers is up 105 percent in the last 4 years. \nThe use of marijuana among teenagers has risen 141 percent. Cocaine \nusage among teenagers in the last 2 years has gone up by 160 percent. \nToday 1 out of every 10 children in America between the ages of 12--\nthat is the sixth grade--and 17 now are using drugs at least once a \nmonth.\n  How did Washington contribute to this tragedy that is occurring in \nevery junior high school in America? I think it started when President \nClinton took office and, in his first days, cut the drug czar's office \nby 83 percent. President Clinton cut drug interdiction spending 25 \npercent below the level carried in the last Bush budget. Between 1992 \nand 1995, 227 positions at DEA were eliminated. Drug prosecutions in \n1993 and 1994 declined by 12 percent, and the average sentence for \nselling marijuana declined by 13 percent from 1992 to 1995.\n\n  I think if we are serious about this problem that we need to end the \ndebate that we have been engaged in with the administration for the \nlast 4 years where the President is trying to eliminate mandatory \nminimum prison sentences for hoodlums who are selling drugs at junior \nhigh schools, and we need to enact reforms that the Senate has adopted \nnumerous times, and yet which has not yet become the law of the land. I \nhave proposed 10 years in prison without parole for selling drugs to a \nminor or involving a minor in drug trafficking, so every hoodlum in \nAmerica, when they are thinking about selling drugs to a child, will \nunderstand that if they are convicted they are going to prison and they \nare going to serve every day of 10 years in prison no matter who their \ndaddy is or how they may think society has done them wrong.\n  I also want life in prison for people who get out of prison having \nbeen convicted once of selling drugs to a minor and turn right around \nand do it again.\n  I think when we look at this data on drug use it is obvious that we \nare not doing our job. I think we need to change that pattern. I want \nto double the size of the Border Patrol. This last year we took a first \nstep. It is a major step in the right direction. Right now we have more \npolice officers in Washington, DC, than we have Border Patrol agents \ntrying to police and control the entire border of the United States of \nAmerica. It is not unusual--in fact it is the norm--to have on any \nshift in a 300-mile strip from Brownsville to Laredo 87 Border Patrol \nagents actually working that line. We are using in many cases near-\nobsolete sensing devices, while the military has great night vision and \ninfrared capacity. We do not have similar capability in the Border \nPatrol. That needs to change.\n  We need to double the size of the Border Patrol over the next 5 \nyears. I believe that given the threat we face from armed drug gangs, \nwith automatic weapons, with night-vision capability, and with \nsophisticated electronic communications basically invading our country \nnightly, that we do not now have the resources we need and we have \ncertainly not committed the will to keep drugs out of our country.\n  We need to expand the capacity of the FBI Academy. I think we should \nhave a goal that within 5 years we double the training capacity of the \nFBI Academy. In no other way can we give local law enforcement \npersonnel the enrichment of training that they need and which can, in \nturn, be passed on within their police departments and their sheriff \ndepartments.\n  We need to expand the size of the DEA. I think if you will look at \nyour individual State, you are going to find that in many vast regions \nwe have only two or three or four DEA agents. And let me make it clear. \nI have no criticism of our Border Patrol agents, our FBI agents, our \nDEA agents. They are doing their job. The problem is they are not \ngetting the support they need from Washington.\n  We need to prosecute vigorously drug felons in general and criminals \nwho are selling drugs to children. I would like to see us change our \nbuilding code and stop building prisons like Holiday Inns. We have at \nleast three Federal statutes which criminalize making prisoners work. \nPrisoners cannot produce goods to be sold across State lines. They \ncannot produce items to be sold within the State. We have limits on the \ntransport of prison-produced goods and you have to pay the union scale \nif you make prisoners work. Needless to say, not many prisoners in \nAmerica are working and producing anything of value.\n  We took the first step in the Senate toward changing that last year. \nThat effort died because it was opposed in the House and by the \nPresident. But I think we need to continue to work to change the \ncriminal justice system in America.\n  In addition to that, we have to take a zero-tolerance approach to \ndrugs. We need to make it very clear to young people that drug use is \nnot acceptable. We need to hold people who are buying drugs just as \nresponsible as people who are selling drugs. Whether we are talking \nabout a high school student or a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, \ndrug use should be a serious matter. I think we ought to call on our \nprofessional athletic leagues, the NFL, professional baseball, \nprofessional basketball, to set higher standards. If people\n\n[[Page S9684]]\n\nare going to be set out as role models for our children, I think when \nthey have established a pattern of drug use they ought not to be \nplaying professional football or professional basketball.\n  I think these are changes that need to be looked at. If you look at \nthis data and you are not alarmed, then I think you do not understand \nthis problem. I think drug use represents one of the greatest threats \nwe face.\n  I thank our colleague from Georgia for leading this effort to try to \nmake the public more aware of it. I am hopeful that we will have an \nopportunity in Commerce-State-Justice appropriations to look at our \npriorities in terms of the Border Patrol and law enforcement. We should \npass a major new crime and antidrug bill which is aimed at getting \ntough on those who are selling drugs but which also holds accountable \nthose who are buying drugs.\n  I am very proud of the provision in the welfare bill which for the \nfirst time takes the public policy position that if you are convicted \nof a drug felony, we are not going, through our welfare programs, to \ngive you a base pay in welfare and food stamps while you are out \nselling drugs at the local junior high school; that one of the things \nthat is going to happen to you if we convict you of a drug felony under \nour new welfare bill is you are going to lose your cash welfare \nbenefits and you are going to lose your food stamps.\n  I think that is a perfectly reasonable proposal, and I think it is \nsomething that should be expanded. Our society should take a zero-\ntolerance approach to drugs. I think that is the only way we are going \nto solve this problem. When Nancy Reagan was saying no, when our \ncountry was taking a stronger approach, drug use fell for 11 years. It \nseems in recent years our Government has not been saying no, and, as a \nresult, drug use has skyrocketed among our children. I think we need to \ndo something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Texas for the remarks he has \nmade and the contribution he has made over the years with regard to our \nconstant battle with narcotics. I appreciate very much him joining us \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to call on the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, but I would like to take just a few \nmoments to put before the Senate a question I put before local \npolicymakers all across my State about a week ago. I went from one end \nof the State to the other and in each jurisdiction I said: I want this \nmeeting to be a wakeup call. I want it to be absolutely clear in all of \nour minds when we leave this meeting and when we leave here today that \nthere is a new drug epidemic in the United States. Epidemic. You will \nhear these figures throughout the afternoon, but essentially drug use \namong teenagers has doubled.\n\n  What does that mean? That means 2 million more teenagers are involved \nwith drugs today than were just 36 months ago. The increase on the part \nof teenagers in the last 12 months--12 months--increased 33 percent.\n  You heard the Senator from Texas begin to talk about the fact that we \nhad to restore interdiction efforts on the border. You will hear many \nother suggestions that we need to restore and reopen the drug czar's \noffice, that we need to double our efforts, we need to quit reducing \nmilitary capacity involved in interdiction and restore it. But that is \ngoing to take some time. That is not going to happen tomorrow. These \nsystems were being shut down, and it takes a lot of funding and time to \nturn them back on.\n  In the meantime, what I would ask is that every policymaker, be they \nFederal officers, Members of the of the Senate, a county commissioner \nor teacher, every policymaker at every level, every chamber member, \nevery business leader, every church, every family at their kitchen \ntable, the media, they can make an enormous contribution by being part \nof the wake-up system. While we are waiting for these other systems to \nbe put back in gear, I would ask every citizen of this country to help \nus warn teenagers, particularly young children, kids that are 8 to 13, \nthat drugs are dangerous, that drugs will ruin their lives, alter their \nlives, change the way they are educated, where they can get a job or \ncannot get a job. They are making decisions that are going to affect \nthem for their whole life.\n  For some reason--and I am sure it will be talked about here this \nafternoon--we have the highest number of teenagers in modern history \nwho do not think drugs are a threat or a risk, so, conversely, they are \nusing drugs in unprecedented numbers. It is up to us, the leaders of \nour Nation, to warn them, to give them the opportunity to understand \nthis is dangerous stuff; this will unalterably affect their lives. \nHopefully, those who are ensnared can be rehabilitated. But even if we \ndo, it will be at great cost and you will never be able to put all the \npieces back together for these kids.\n  One last thing and I am going to turn to the Senator from Ohio. The \ndifference between this epidemic that we are in now and the one in the \n1960's and 1970's? There is a striking difference. The target audience \nthen was age 17 to 21. The target of the cartels today is kids 8 to \n13--8 to 13. This is the first war that has ever been waged against \nkids.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor leading this discussion today. I cannot think of a more appropriate \nforum than the U.S. Senate, nor can I think of a more appropriate topic \nfor us to be discussing today than what is literally the crisis that is \nfacing our young people.\n  The evidence is out. The statistics are there. We have seen the \nheadlines in the newspapers in the last few weeks that others have \ndetailed on this floor already today. But I would like to spend a \nlittle time talking about it and maybe reflecting on my personal \nexperiences in dealing with this problem. I used to be a county \nprosecuting attorney in Ohio. I dealt with kids who were certainly at \nrisk, kids who were starting out on lives of crime, kids who had \nunbelievable problems. Later I served as Lieutenant Governor in a State \nwith a very large at-risk youth population. I worked on the education \nsystem, but I also worked on the prison system, and I saw a lot of kids \nleading, certainly what we would describe as, broken lives.\n  Based on that experience, I am convinced, if we truly want to save \nthe next generation of young people in this country, we can no longer, \nas a country, pretend the problem does not exist. I am afraid, to some \nextent that is what we have been doing. We have to face the problem and \nwe cannot do that, frankly, without Presidential leadership. Over the \nlast 4 years, we have basically surrendered on the fight against drugs. \nA couple of weeks ago, President Clinton's Department of Health and \nHuman Services released a report stating the total failure of the \nClinton administration on this particular issue. The statistics are \nunbelievable.\n  From 1992 to 1995, overall drug use by teenagers, young people age 12 \nto 17, has risen by 78 percent. Marijuana use is up 105 percent, more \nthan double what it was 4 years ago. That is after 11 years of \ndeclining marijuana use, 11 straight years of declining marijuana use \nunder President Reagan and President Bush. Now we are up 105 percent in \njust a couple of years. Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 \npercent, nearly triple what it was 4 years ago. Cocaine use is up 166 \npercent. If you really want to see the tragedy my colleague from \nGeorgia has talked about in the past, if you really want to see the \ntragedy, look at the emergency rooms and look at the people who have \ngone into the emergency rooms for overdose problems today.\n  One out of every ten children age 12 to 17 is using drugs on a \nmonthly basis--1 out of every 10 children. We must do something. This \nadministration's approach has basically been one of neglect. For years, \nthe Reagan and Bush Justice Departments would concentrate their most \nintensive efforts on two areas of law enforcement: Gun crimes and \ndrugs. When President Clinton came in, this effort simply withered \naway. Here are the statistics.\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\nUnder President Clinton, the prosecution of gun-related offenses in \nFederal court by U.S. attorneys went down 20 percent--down 20 percent. \nThat is after an increase year after year under the Bush and Reagan \nadministrations. Further, under President Clinton, drug prosecutions \nhave gone down 12.5 percent.\n\n  It is incredible. The drug problem is skyrocketing but the Clinton \nadministration's willingness to fight has gone down. President Clinton \nhas cut 625 individuals, soldiers, out of the ranks of the war on \ndrugs; 625 law enforcement personnel from 6 separate Federal agencies \nare gone. Under President Clinton, Federal spending on drug \ninterdiction went down 25 percent.\n  These are not just statistics, these are not just facts. This \nmatters. This makes a difference, because spending less on interdiction \nmakes a difference. According to recent Federal law enforcement \nstatistics, the disruption rate--that is the amount of drugs that are \nblocked from coming into this country--dropped 53 percent between 1993 \nand early 1995. That means that an additional 84 metric tons of \nmarijuana and cocaine came into America and comes into America every \nsingle year.\n  Since 1993, Coast Guard seizures of cocaine are down 45 percent. \nCoast Guard seizures of marijuana for that same period of time are down \n90 percent. That says a lot about the priorities of this \nadministration. Instead of cracking down on gun criminals, people who \nuse a firearm to commit an offense, repeat violent offenders, and \ninstead of getting tough on drugs, this administration has literally \ntaken a walk. I am sure that is one reason Democratic Congressman \nCharlie Rangel--certainly someone in the U.S. Congress who is one of \nthe foremost leaders in this area, who has spent a lot of time battling \nthe drug problem--said, ``I have never, never, never met a President \nwho cares less about this issue.''\n  That sums up very well the prevalent attitude of the current \nadministration with regard to the war on drugs. It is an attitude of \nneglect. For anyone who cares about the future of this country, this \nattitude is totally unacceptable. The average young person who is using \ndrugs in high school ends up in trouble. That individual represents \nAmerica's future. This is something we have to get serious about. This \nadministration, unfortunately, did just the opposite. They cut the drug \nczar's office. One of the first things they did is they cut the drug \nczar's office by 83 percent. Their Surgeon General talked about \nlegalizing drugs. ``We should study that,'' she said. Their National \nSecurity Council dropped drugs--this is astonishing, absolutely \namazing--their National Security Council dropped drugs from the top 3 \nof national priorities down to 29th, the last, 29 out of 29, when they \nranked the national priorities; dead last. That tells you something \nabout what this administration's attitude has been.\n  As a statement of our national priorities, as a statement of our \nnational consensus, this administration's attitude and record are \nsimply unacceptable. It is time for our national leadership to let the \nteenagers of this country know we are serious. Drugs do kill. We have \nto speak in this country with one clear voice.\n  In the first 9 months of 1995, President Clinton was interviewed 112 \ntimes. He mentioned drugs just once. He made 119 statements during that \nperiod of time, formal statements. He mentioned drugs just twice.\n  We need an attitude of ``just say no.'' This administration, by \ncontrast, has just said nothing. Drugs are a threat to the future of \nour children. They are a threat to the future of our country. That will \nbe true even after this election year. It is time, frankly, for some \nfollowthrough in the Oval Office. We need to realize that our national \neffort against drugs is really not a war. All of us, myself included, \nuse that term. That really is not the best of terms, because in a sense \nit is something more difficult than a war. When we talk about a war, we \nusually think of something where we go in as a country, we make the \ncommitment, we pay the price, we get the job done, and we win and we go \nhome, men and women go home--mission accomplished.\n  The antidrug effort in that sense is a not a war. Rather, it is more \nof a struggle, a struggle that is always going to be with us day in and \nday out and for every young person is, in a sense, a new battlefield, \nand victory is never final.\n  We live, Mr. President, in a society where we want everything \ninstant, quick--instant oatmeal, instant coffee, everything has to be \nresolved in 30 minutes on TV from beginning to end, everything has to \nhappen quickly. That is how we live our lives.\n  I think we have to understand and accept the fact it simply is not \ntrue in regard to our efforts in the drug area, that we have to hang in \nthere, we have to stay in there, we have to talk about this problem and \nfight this problem day in and day out. The good news is we can, in \nfact, make a difference if we are willing to stay in there and if we \nare willing to have patience and if we are willing to persevere.\n  Mr. President, we need to win this struggle, but to win this \nstruggle, we need to be focused. We need leadership. We need leadership \nfrom the top. We need leadership all the way through the system. There \nare many things that, frankly, we need to do.\n  We spend a lot of time debating what is more important: treatment, \neducation, or law enforcement. The reality is, they are all important; \nwe have to do them all. That is what the reality is. We have to have \neducation. We have to have treatment. We have to have domestic law \nenforcement, and we also have to have drug interdiction that goes to \nthe source and goes to the transit countries. We have to do all four, \nand we have to continue to do them day in and day out.\n  Mr. President, in a sense, this is a tall order. It is difficult to \naccomplish even when we have the best of intentions. But if you turn \naway from this effort, as this administration has done for several \nyears, if you really do not act like there is a drug problem, you send \nthe wrong message to the American people, but particularly to the most \nimpressionable, and that is our young people. You send them the message \nthat drugs are really not that big a problem.\n  My colleague from Georgia said it very well a moment ago. The most \nfrightening statistic in all these polls we have seen published, all \nthis data we have seen, is that consistently as drug use goes up, the \nfear of drugs is going down, and there is a relationship--I should say \nan inverse relationship--between those two. Part of that lack of fear \nis maybe lack of experience. That is what we deal with when we deal \nwith young people, a lack of experience. But part of it also is that \nthe message has not been reinforced as it has to be time after time \nafter time after time. That is what, frankly, we need the President of \nthe United States to do.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask that we recommit ourselves, from the \nPresident on down, to this antidrug effort, understanding that it is a \nlong fight, it is a struggle, and that we are going to have to hang in \nthere to get the job done.\n  I, again, thank my colleague from Georgia for taking time on the \nSenate floor today. It is an appropriate forum for a very, very \ncritical issue that we need to be dealing with in this country. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Ohio has expired.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. I know \nthat he is the father of a very large family and that there are many \nteenagers in that family, and this has to be an issue of personal \nconcern to any parent, including the Senator from Ohio.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to, if I can, read from an article that \nappeared in the Washington Post this past Friday, August 30. It is an \narticle about the military role in the drug war, which is now being \ndebated, and ought to be, because I often say that we suffer more \ncasualties annually in the drug war than we did during the entirety of \nthe Vietnam war. If you add up the collateral damage, the personal \ndamage, it is staggering.\n  But to read from this article, not in its entirety, it says:\n\n       It was the last Republican President, George Bush, who in \n     1989 began enlisting military forces in regular patrols of \n     Caribbean trafficking routes. But 4 years later, the Clinton \n     administration reduced the number of planes and ships \n     monitoring narcotics transit zones as a Democratic Congress \n     slashed counterdrug funds. The move came in part of a shift \n     in U.S. strategy that placed less emphasis on interdicting \n     shipments into the United States and more on assisting\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\n     South American countries where the narcotics are produced. \n     Pentagon spending on antidrug actions dropped about 27 \n     percent in 1993, from $1.1 billion to $800 million, and has \n     remained at about that level since.\n\n  The point I am making here, Mr. President, is that, if I can take one \nexception with the Senator from Ohio, I don't believe our situation is \none of neglect, but rather one of conscious decisions made to dismantle \nmuch of the interdiction force, just as this article has documented.\n\n       The impact of the change has been argued ever since. \n     Cocaine seizures in the transit zone between the United \n     States and South American borders declined 47 percent between \n     1992 an 1995.\n\n  That is by half.\n\n       A General Accounting Office report recently criticized \n     interdiction activities as inadequately planned and staffed.\n\n  The Senator from Texas spoke to the downsizing of the efforts at \ninterdiction. The article says:\n\n       A study for the White House last year by EBR, Inc., a \n     Virginia research firm, estimated that restoring $500 million \n     in military assets to blocking Caribbean routes could lower--\n\n  Lower--\n\n     the traffickers' success rate in shipping cocaine from 69 to \n     53 percent. But the estimate carried a high degree of \n     uncertainty and the administration--\n\n  The White House--\n\n     concluded the possible gain wasn't worth the cost.\n\n  My point here is that the administration made specific changes in \npolicy: closed the drug czar's office, cut interdiction in half, \nlowered military assets across the board.\n  And now, Mr. President, the results are coming in. The data by the \nadministration itself has ratified what we have been saying for well \nover a year: that drug use among our youngsters and teenagers is \nskyrocketing.\n  I was just quoting from the Washington Post.\n  Here is another periodical less known. This is called the Gwinnett \nDaily Post, which is in a county north of Atlanta. And they recently \npublished an article in our own State. This is just a suburban \nnewspaper and probably will not go down in the chronicles of policy \nsetting.\n  But, Mr. President, it is sort of interesting. I picked this up over \nthe weekend scanning through clippings. It is written by Stacey Kelley, \na staff writer for the Gwinnett Daily Post. But what she chronicles \nhere is very significant. It says, ``The number of drug related cases \nhandled by the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court has increased 738 percent \nsince 1992, * * * '' Mr. President, I will repeat that: 738 percent in \n36 months. `` * * * with the most common cases involving marijuana and \nLSD, according to court records.'' And in 1992 the juvenile court \nhandled 21 cases of drug-related crimes involving juveniles, kids. In \n1995, 3 years later, that figure had increased to 176.\n  As I said to community leaders across my State--I would say it \nanywhere in the Nation--do not think your community is not experiencing \nthese kinds of data because they are. It is everywhere. There is nobody \nfree of this new epidemic. Nobody is free from this. Juvenile court \ndeals with minors 16 years of age and under. Remember, Mr. President, a \nmoment ago I said this epidemic is with a different-aged audience, aged \n8-13 when they are getting ensnared in this. And this documents it. You \ncould document this anywhere you go in the country.\n  We have been joined by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I am \ngoing to call on him in just a moment.\n  If I might read one other paragraph in this Gwinnett Daily Post. It \nsays:\n\n       Most of the drug cases that end up there [in juvenile \n     court] are cases of drug possession. Jackie White, Juvenile \n     Court Administrator, said it is rare to see a juvenile \n     charged with distributing drugs.\n       ``Drug cases are growing at a rate higher than all our \n     delinquent cases,'' White said. Delinquent cases are those \n     presented in Juvenile Court which involve criminal charges. \n     In 1992, the Gwinnett court had 2,275 delinquent cases, and \n     in 1995, 2,740 cases.\n\n  If you had these kinds of records in county after county across the \ncountry, and if you talked to local sheriffs or police officers, people \nthat deal with juvenile courts, youth detention, they would all tell \nyou the same thing. This is a massive epidemic. This is affecting a \nyounger and younger audience, and the consequences are stunning and \nstaggering.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nwho joins us from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Let me express my appreciation to the Senator from Georgia for \nbringing about this special order in which we could discuss a topic \nthat has just now again burst upon the scene, at least from the \nstandpoint of us having new figures and statistics to be concerned \nabout. But many of us have recognized that it has been going on for \nsome time in a way that this administration and others have just either \nignored it or failed to address it.\n  As I came to the floor this afternoon, my friend from Georgia was \ntalking about national statistics on teenage drug abuse versus local \nstatistics and that national averages probably mean local averages if \nyou take a close look at the problem, because I have a feeling that \nmany of us have the habit of saying, well, gee, that really does sound \nbad and certainly the consequence for younger Americans is tragic but \nthat really is not going on in my backyard. I think in a State like \nIdaho that remains relatively rural and, at least from the standpoint \nof metropolitan areas has few, that would be the case with many of my \nfriends and associates in Idaho.\n\n  Let me start my comments this afternoon by talking about my home \nState of Idaho because what we are now finding in our checking of \nstatistics with law enforcement is that the national trends are Idaho's \ntrends. I think that is probably true across the Nation.\n  In the last 4 years we have seen a dramatic reversal in the trends \nthat we saw in the late 1980's and early 1990's in my home State of \nIdaho according to the Idaho Statistical Analysis Center. Juvenile drug \narrests have jumped from a 9 percent decrease--a 9-percent decrease in \n1991--to a 69-percent increase in 1995, an absolute flip-flop of the \nrecord. Why is it going on?\n  Juvenile drug arrests in Idaho are now growing at a faster rate than \nadult drug arrests. Let me repeat that. Juvenile drug arrests in Idaho \nare growing at a faster rate than adult drug arrests. Teens are \nexperiencing drugs at younger and younger ages. And 7.1 percent of the \nninth grade females and 1.5 percent of the 12th grade females used \nmarijuana for the first time before the age of 13 in Idaho. And those \nare the statistics that ought to be alarming all of us because those \nare the same kinds of statistics that we have had reported to us by the \nsubstance abuse and medical health services administration in their \nstatistics of a few weeks ago.\n  Illicit drug use among youth doubling since 1992. Marijuana use among \n12- and 13-year-olds more than doubled since 1992, and tripling among \n14- to 15-year-olds. Those are the national statistics, Mr. President. \nAnd yet those are the same statistics of Idaho, a State of about \n1,300,000 people.\n  Cocaine, crack, heroin, LSD use among teenagers is expected to soon \nrival the highest rates of the 1970's. Why? What has changed? What in \nAmerica is different in 1995 and 1996 than was existing in 1990, in \n1988, in 1987 when we actually saw peaks and then declines in the use \nof some of these substances by our teenaged population? I think one \nthing has changed. And while over the last several years I have been \nunwilling to be bold in talking about it, clearly I think it is time to \ntalk about it.\n  I remember because I was here in the early 1980's when Nancy Reagan \nsaid, ``Just say no.'' There were a lot of the press and a lot of the \nliberal critics that said, ``Are you kidding me? Just say no? We have \nto have control. We have got to have institutional programs. You can't \njust argue with teenage America that they ought to just say no.''\n  But what Nancy Reagan knew as a mother and what a lot of citizens \nknow in our country, that one of the greatest areas of control is when \nnational leaders speak out and when in most instances there is the kind \nof internal peer pressure that really does have an impact. And that \nkind of national leadership, certainly that kind of internal peer \npressure that is produced as a product of national leadership has been \nrelatively nonexistent since the early 1990's at a time when our \nPresident\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\nopenly admits he once smoked marijuana, at a time when his press \nsecretary says, ``Well, yes, of course I did. And I've used it from \ntime to time.'' In other words, what I am saying is, a national \nleadership with a relatively cavalier attitude that just simply says, \n``oh, so what.'' Well, the ``oh, so what'' is very simple. The ``oh, so \nwhat'' is teenage America listening to our national leaders with a tone \nthat it does not really make any difference, that there is not really a \nproblem there, that somehow it is OK.\n  I am not suggesting in any sense that our President has openly said \nthat. But what I am suggesting is that a White House that cannot get \nsecurity clearances because of its current drug use, a White House \nwhose press secretary says ``so what'' a President who says, ``My only \ndefense against a past action is that I really didn't inhale,'' I am \nsorry, that is a leadership speaking out. That is our national icon, \nand the President of the United States is less than caring and less \nthan leading on this issue.\n\n  What remains today as the greater deterrent? A statement that was \nmade in the early 1980's by a lady who was openly ridiculed for making \nit, ``Just say no.'' That ``just say no'' amongst teenagers today, with \nhigh school counselors and those who associate in peer-type \norganizations with young Americans is the strongest defense today \nagainst the use of illegal drugs or substance abuse. Say no, stand up, \nbe an individual, speak out. But most importantly, say no. Say no for \nyourself and no for your peers.\n  What is the rest of the story beyond that, beyond tone setting, \nbeyond leadership? We could pour billions of dollars into this, and we \nshould put more into it. We tried to put more into it. As you know, the \nClinton Justice Department issued a study recommending a reduction in \nmandatory minimum drug sentences, and the Clinton administration cut \n355 DEA agents and 102 persons from the Justice Department's crime drug \nenforcement task force, and the Clinton administration cut the Coast \nGuard drug interdiction budget by $14.6 billion. I could go on and on \nand on. We do need that side of it. We must have that side of it to \nstem the flow, to deter that kind of activity. Put all of that \ntogether, and this Congress will work hard to get it back on line.\n  But well beyond that, Mr. President, remains the fundamental \nresponsibility that our national leadership must speak out that this is \nno longer something that you shrug and grin and walk away from because \nthose who you put around you cannot meet the test, cannot meet the \nstandard, are violating the law by their action behind the scenes. That \nis something that is unacceptable in this country.\n  We reap the whirlwind of inaction. We reap the whirlwind amongst our \nteenagers for a failure on the part of our leadership to clearly and \nopenly stand out in opposition to this kind of illegal and harmful \nactivity. We all know what it can mean when drug abuse starts, when \nsubstance abuse begins. One action can lead to another. The use of \nmarijuana oftentimes--by the admission of those who have used it--can \nlead to the use of harder drugs. That can lead to criminal activity \nbeyond the act itself. Those are the kind of things that we need to \nworry about.\n  Why now, then, do the criminologists of this country, why, now, do \nthe people who study our demographics say to us that as a society we \nneed to prepare for something that we are institutionally unprepared to \nhandle? That in the coming decade, starting now, we can anticipate a \nteenage and juvenile crime wave of the kind this country has never \nseen. That is the whirlwind we reap because we have failed to be \nresponsive in the kind of leadership necessary to deal with the current \nstatistics, the kind that we now see today, be they national or in my \nState of Idaho or any other State in the Nation.\n  This is an issue that will not go away. It is clearly an issue that \nthis administration and that this Congress has to redress and move \nforward on. I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Georgia, for \nhis willingness to take this kind of leadership. What I have said today \nand what he is saying is not easy to say. I do not want to be a \ncondemner. I want to be a supporter. I want to build up. In this area, \nclearly, amongst all other areas, we would like to be proud of the \nstatistics that would be positive for our young people. That \nis nonexistent in this area today. We must deal with it. I hope we deal \nwith it aggressively.\n\n  Again, it will not come by throwing money at it. It must come by a \nnational conscience. It must come by knowing the difference between \nright and wrong. It must come from all of us as leaders here in the \nSenate and in the very White House that I have spoken of. That is the \nkind of leadership that we must have if we are going to deal with this \nissue and convince the young of our country that their actions must be \nchanged for themselves and for their future.\n  I thank my colleague and yield back the time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho. He has \nreinforced several points that are worth talking about a little more.\n  I am convinced that most parents, until very recently, did not \nrealize that we are in a new epidemic. I think they had heard year \nafter year that drug use amongst our teenagers was falling. It did from \n1980 to 1992. It was cut in half, which should be a sign of optimism \nfor us as a people because it means that you can win this battle.\n  As the Senator from Ohio said earlier, it is a long struggle. It will \nnever be over. But we can change the behavior and relationship of \nteenagers to drugs.\n  What we are doing here today is something that has to reverberate all \nacross the country. That is that we have to warn our parents that once \nagain their children are at grave risk of being embroiled in this \nepidemic.\n  The second point that the Senator from Idaho makes that I think is \nvery important is that if you think as a parent or a policymaker that \nthis problem is an inner city ghetto problem, that it is just in \npoverty zones across our country, you are making a grave, grave \nmistake.\n  I do not care where you go in this country, you are going to find \ndata like we have been hearing all afternoon. There is going to be more \naction in the juvenile court. There will be more action among law \nenforcement officials and teenagers.\n  The article, which I will return to in a minute--the Gwinnett Daily \nPost is in one of the largest suburban counties in our country, just \noutside of Atlanta. In rural and inner city and suburban communities it \nwas consistent. It did not matter where you went or what the \nsociostrata of the community was. It did not matter. This is the kind \nof data that we were finding in every kind of community. No one is \nexempt from this. Everybody better have that yellow light on in their \nhome. Every church needs to rethink what it is doing about this \nproblem. Every business leader needs to be thinking about what is \nhappening with the colleagues in that business. If you think that you \ndo not need a drug-free workplace program, you are making a mistake.\n  I was talking to an executive of a substantial company in Augusta, \nGA. They make water cups. It has been a very long success story. They \nbought some facilities and they doubled their production. All of a \nsudden, Mr. President, there was theft of petty items, wallets, and \npurses. Then suddenly more and more material was missing.\n  They called in outside consultants and they said, ``We think you have \na drug problem.'' They said ``could not'' then. They resisted it. \nFinally, they hired an outside consultant, went to an undercover agent \nand, indeed, discovered a drug ring in the company, robbing it of its \nproduction costs and much, much productivity and many, many funds. It \nwas difficult to correct, but they corrected it.\n  The point I am making, Mr. President, is that any business, any \nfamily, any church, any community--it doesn't matter where --better \nhave the wake-up bell on full. This is an epidemic, and it is in our \nbackyard and our front yard.\n  Now, it also means you are talking about a classmate, a brother, or a \nsister. Sometimes we lose the proportions of this when we talk about \nnumbers, such as 178 percent, 141 percent, 2 million people. Just \nremember, Mr. President, that every one of those numbers is a personal \ntragedy, and the tragedy goes far beyond the person that has been \nembroiled in the use of drugs. It is going to affect everybody around \nthem--their family, their workplace, their school, their church.\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\n  Mr. President, about 4 months ago, I guess, I visited a youth \ndevelopment center. I know the chair, along with all of us, is \nconstantly visiting places and trying to understand how they operate \nand work. Sometimes you are never quite prepared. You go to so many \nmeetings like that, and you never really prepare yourself for them. The \npoignancy of them hits you cold in the face.\n  In this youth development center, I met around 12 young females. \nTheir average age was 14 to 16. They agreed to come and talk to me \nabout what happened to them. I thought that was pretty courageous. One \nby one, they walked around, and they represented every walk of life, \nevery income level, the mix of America. And they were there for \nattempted murder, assault and battery, auto theft, you name it. You can \nlook at these groups of innocent faces and wonder how in the world this \ncould happen. In a word: drugs.\n  Every one of them had come there through a journey of drugs. Drugs \nhad caused them to lose control of their lives. Three of them said that \nif they had not been arrested, they would be dead. I asked them, ``What \nwould you say to the youth of the country if you could speak to them?'' \nI wish we could have filmed this and have every teenager in our country \nhear them talk.\n  Mr. President, they said, ``Don't do it. Do not do it.'' No. 2, they \nsaid, ``You think that you can control these drugs, and you are wrong. \nThe drugs will take over.'' No. 3, they said, ``Never, ever use drugs \nto enter a peer group or to be a part of it. If somebody wants you to \nuse drugs to be their friend, they are not your friend.''\n  I asked each of them, ``Well, how did you get started on this, and \nhow old were you?'' Every one of them got into drugs between the ages \nof 8 and 11. Every one of them said drugs are everywhere. There was no \nproblem at all getting them. And every one of them acknowledged that \ntheir lives would never be the same if they were lucky enough to get \nover it. The damage to their families, the damage to their dreams, the \ndamage to their hopes and aspirations had in much part already \noccurred. I wish every youngster could have heard that message.\n  Now, the Senator from Idaho was talking about message. In the article \nI just read from the Post, we talked about the fact that we had lowered \ninterdiction budgets. We have heard various figures about shutting down \nthe drug czar's office. Yes, all of those things have had an affect and \nare the underlying reason for this change of attitude among teenagers. \nBut, in my judgment, the single most profound change that has occurred \nis in the message, what these very vulnerable citizens, these \nyoungsters aged 8 to 13, are hearing. I think everybody admits that the \nHollywood message is very, very disruptive, the glorification of drug \nuse. It is a great debate in our Nation.\n\n  The Senator from Texas talked about the role models that our great \nsports heroes are to a very vulnerable population. And I believe that \nprofessional athletics is going to have to step back and take a look at \nwhat their contribution is here. Everywhere I went, somebody in the \naudience would stand up and say, ``Well, what are we going to do about \nthe fact that a national athlete, a $20 million baby, gets involved in \ndrugs, and there is nothing that really happens about it?'' What does \nthat say to these girls, to these 8 to 12-year olds, Mr. President?\n  Mr. President, on June 16, 1992, on MTV, a youth-driven \ncommunications system, the questioner asked the President of the United \nStates, ``If you had it to do over again, would you inhale?'' Candidate \nClinton: ``Sure, if I could. I tried before.'' [Laughter.]\n  Mr. President, the message is having a more profound affect on what \nour young people think about drugs than probably all these other assets \nwe are talking about. I don't mean to suggest that we don't need to get \nthat drug czar's office back in line. I think the selection of General \nMcCaffrey is an excellent one. I wish he had been there all along. I \nwish we weren't confronted with this epidemic. But the most profound \naffect is what our leaders are saying to the country about drug use. \nThis cavalier response, and the fact that there are contemporary \nemployees of the White House who have recently broken the law and have \nengaged in drug use, the remarks by the press office about it, the \nremarks that were made by the first Surgeon General of this \nadministration flirting with legalization, that message races through \nthe country and very quickly sanctions, becomes nonthreatening to this \nvery, very young target of the drug cartels.\n  That is why I said earlier that we need a wake-up call at every level \nincluding the White House. All of us need to be engaged in putting that \nquestion mark in the head of every young person in America. This stuff \nis dangerous. This stuff is life altering. This will have a profound \neffect on you, your family, and your future. If that message begins to \nresonate, it will become the first line of defense in this struggle \nthat we have with this new national epidemic. Message: What we say and \nhow we act influences--always has and always will--the children of any \ncountry and any nation.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by my colleague from Texas. I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Georgia for starting off after Labor Day on this very important \nissue.\n  Many of us were stunned when the first report came out that showed \nthe enormous leap in drug use and drug abuse in this country in the \nlast 3 years. We knew that it was a problem. But I do not think we \nrealized how big a problem this has become. In fact, I was privileged \nto be able to see Mrs. Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, who started the \n``just say no'' whole effort when she was the First Lady of this \ncountry. And I think she was a leader. She was prophetic.\n  I remember that people sort of ridiculed her in a way when she \nstarted the ``just say no'' program. They sort of acted like, oh, you \nknow--that really was not cool. Well, it was proven by all of the \nstudies that in fact her willingness to stand up and say we need to go \nout into our schools and tell our young people to just say no was in \nfact very effective because it started the thinking of our young \npeople--that they did not have to be with their peers. They did not \nhave to be cool just because their peers would ridicule people who just \nsaid no to drugs. In fact, it worked because she started the thinking \nprocess in their minds. And the studies showed that between 1985 and \n1992 drug use did go down.\n  I remember the ads on television of some of our sports stars talking \nabout the importance of keeping your body clean. That sold to our young \npeople. But then when President Clinton came into office and his \nadministration, he slashed the Office of Drug Control Policy from 147 \npeople to 25 people. There was not a focus on this very important \nissue. So the gains that were won during those earlier years went by \nthe wayside.\n  In the study that came out just recently in September 1995--the \nNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse from the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services--said that since 1992 marijuana use among \nyoung people has increased an average of 50 percent. Marijuana use \njumped 137 percent among 12- to 13-year olds since 1992, and 200 \npercent among 14- and 15-year olds.\n  Mr. President, we used to worry about our high school kids. And we \nstill need to worry about our high school kids. We are talking junior \nhigh and even elementary schoolchildren who are now being introduced to \nmarijuana and other kinds of drugs. And worse yet, of course, they are \nbeing introduced to it by their peers because the drug dealers have \nlearned that if they can get a juvenile to do this crime that the \njuvenile will not be subject to the same penalties.\n  So, Mr. President, it is going to take a concerted effort by the \nPresident with his leadership, and by the Congress standing with the \nPresident and saying enough is enough. Just say no makes a lot more \nsense than just say nothing. We must not let a whole generation of our \nyoung people think that we do not care about their minds and their \nfutures and their potential. We cannot let that happen, Mr. President. \nWe have to stand up and say we are going to do something about this and \nwe are going to take it from every level.\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\n  Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who is the new drug czar, is well aware of \nthis. I think he is a man who can handle this issue. He, too, believes \nthat having an annual drug awareness day is not enough for our young \npeople; that we must show how serious we are by stopping drugs at our \nborders, by having education efforts, by having counseling efforts, by \nhaving peer groups work with troubled youth. And he is going to try to \nturn this around. But it is going to take more than just one person. It \nis going to take all of us working together to try to turn back this \nterrible increase that we are seeing. The national drug control \nstrategy should interdict drugs in Latin America and at our borders.\n  I am particularly hit by this because I have seen in my State what is \nhappening with the drugs coming from South America through Mexico and \nright into Texas as well as New Mexico, Arizona, and California. But I \nhappen to be closer to it because my own ranchers are devastated by \nwhat they are seeing. And they are frankly in a war with no defenses. \nWe have common ranchers who are now meeting drug warlords with \nautomatic weapons. And if a rancher objects to a drug lord coming \nacross his or her property along the border they will be shot down. It \nhas happened. They are so scared and so defenseless that the worst of \nall things is now happening. They are having to sell their property. \nWho do you think is giving them 10 times the worth? The drug dealers. \nThey are the only ones who can afford it.\n  So we are seeing drug dealers buying up the lands in remote parts of \nour borders so that they will have a free trail right up through South \nAmerica through Mexico and into the United States. Mr. President, we \ncannot let this happen. This is a war and we must treat it as a war. If \nthey had chemical weapons coming across our borders we would have an \nall-out alert. We would declare a war. Well, Mr. President, this is \nchemical weaponry. Drugs are chemical weapons that are ruining the \npeople, and especially the young people of our country.\n  So, Mr. President, we must get serious about this. I have seen it \nfirsthand. We must increase the number of Border Patrol agents. We must \nuse all the technology that we have available that we are not now \nusing. We have better technology than we are using. A drug enforcer can \nsit in an office and survey for 25 miles and see movement. But we do \nnot have the up-to-date technology on our borders that is available to \nus in this country right now, and we have to do something about that. \nWe have to stop the money laundering.\n  I was talking to a Border Patrol agent who said these people are \ngetting so bold that they stopped a man walking down the streets of one \nof our border cities with a suitcase, dragging the suitcase along. And \nwhen they stopped the man and opened the suitcase there was $3 million \nin cash. That is incredible--that people would be dragging a suitcase \nwith $3 million of cash down the main street of a border community \nright here in our own country because that money was headed right back \ninto the mainstream of America. That was clearly drug money.\n  So they think they can get by with this--that they would be so bold. \nWell, we have to tell them that the time has come and we are not going \nto allow the money laundering. We are not going to allow the buying up \nof our property. We are not going to allow people to just come into our \ncountry with chemical weapons against our young people.\n  We cannot let that happen. We are going to have to come at this from \nall angles.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for working with us to make sure \nthat the people of this country know the seriousness of this issue and \nto let the people of this country know that Congress is going to get \nserious about it. We have to be able to work with the President to take \ncontrol of this cancer on our society.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas \nparticularly for the personal observations with regard to the property. \nI have heard of that, but I have never heard it so vividly described as \nthe Senator from Texas just revealed, an unbelievable condition in her \nState. I appreciate her bringing that to our attention.\n  I yield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nGeorgia for the time. I join with him in thanking our colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, for describing the scope of the problem.\n  We have all seen the numbers in recent surveys, the percentage of \nadolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 who admit to using drugs \nwithin the last month. That increase has gone from 5.3 percent in 1992 \nto 10.9 percent in 1995. The statistics from these surveys show that \nthe use of LSD and hallucinogens is up anywhere from 183 percent, \ncocaine up 166 percent, marijuana use up 144 percent. But there are \nother factors that give us a better idea of the pervasiveness and the \nimpact that drugs are having in our country. When the Senator from \nTexas tells about the Texas border and other places where ranchers are \nthreatened by drug lords--and we have heard the same thing from the \nSenator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], talking about how the drug \nefforts are really moving a foreign, hostile nation into our borders--\nwe ought to be seriously concerned; the problems are very acute in the \nborder areas.\n  There are some other statistics that are very alarming away from the \nborders, in the heartland of the United States. In the August 21 \nedition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, we had the very frightening \nnews that emergencies in the medical care units in St. Louis were up an \nastounding amount as it relates to drugs. The overall increase in drug-\nrelated emergencies nationally has gone up significantly, but St. Louis \nfor one had an even greater increase. Since 1992, heroin-related \nemergencies are up 111 percent in St. Louis hospitals and medical care \nfacilities. That is even worse than the national rate, which is up 58 \npercent. We are talking about an explosion of emergencies linked to \nheroin.\n  Now they say: Oh, well, it may not all be exactly statistically \nrelated to the increase in drug use. It may be some bad heroin.\n  When you look at the numbers nationwide and you see these \nemergencies, these are not people responding to a survey about whom we \nmay question their veracity. These are people who are hauled in in \nserious condition to an emergency room. They are not deciding whether \nor not to honestly answer a question of a survey. They are hoping to \nstart breathing again.\n\n  Cocaine-linked emergencies were up 38 percent in St. Louis in the \nlast 4 years. They are up 19 percent nationwide. Marijuana-related \nemergencies increased 316 percent in St. Louis in the last 4 years.\n  There is no question, from whatever statistics you use, whether you \nlisten to the Senator from Texas talk about the problems of property \nbeing taken over on the Texas-New Mexico-Arizona borders, whether you \nread the general national statistics that drug use is up, whether you \ntake a look at the hospital and emergency-room-related emergencies, we \nsee a very clear pattern that drug use is up, the abuse of drugs is up, \nand the problem for our society is getting worse, not better.\n  I believe that the Clinton administration has had countless failures \nin this area, and they have even taken actions which might be conducive \nto an atmosphere of permissiveness. The former Surgeon General, as has \nbeen pointed out here before, advocated legalization of many drugs and \nalso advocated needle exchange programs for heroin addicts.\n  I served as the ranking member on the Treasury-Postal Appropriations \nCommittee and wondered why, in 1993, there was so much of a problem in \ngetting White House personnel security clearances. Well, it has come \nout that some of the officials in the White House have had recent drug \nuse and among the drugs used were crack, powdered cocaine, and \nhallucinogens. The administration proposed and we opposed decimating \nthe Office of National Drug Policy. But they were bringing into the \nWhite House people who used drugs in recent times.\n  We saw significant cuts in the funding for the efforts against drug \nimportation. We saw cuts across the board.\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\n We saw Customs cut significantly in terms of the efforts. The DEA has \nbeen cut by 227 agents. The FBI had proposed cuts of significance. All \nof these areas were where we are fighting on the front line against the \nimportation, the trafficking and the use of drugs through law \nenforcement efforts. I think a primary goal of drug control policy must \nbe to reduce the amount of cocaine entering the United States. \nInterdiction programs target source countries in the transit zone, \nabout 2 million square miles between the United States and South \nAmerican borders, including Central America, Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and \nthe Caribbean Islands. About 780 metric tons of cocaine are produced \neach year in South America, and about 30 percent is shipped through the \nCaribbean into the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.\n  Funding for interdiction declined from $1 billion in 1992 to $569 \nmillion in fiscal year 1995. There was no funding increase in source-\ncountry activities. So the overall funding was decreased by nearly \nhalf. As a result, cocaine seizures are down from 70,000 kilograms in \n1992 to 37,000 kilograms in 1995. DOD funding for interdiction is down. \nCoast Guard funding for drug interdiction is down.\n  I think the executive branch needs to develop a plan to implement a \nnational interdiction strategy. Agencies have their own plans, but they \nneed the coordination of the ONDP. We need to get serious once again \nabout the war on drugs.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I know our time has expired. I ask unanimous consent \nfor 2 minutes just to wrap up this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I think he has \nreinforced everything we have been saying all afternoon. It does not \nmatter what community you are in, whether St. Louis or Gwinnett County, \nGA, we are in the midst of a new epidemic.\n  Just to summarize, major policy with regard to the management of the \ndrug issue in the United States has been changed. The message has been \neither nonexistent or acquiescent, and as a result we have produced \nheadlines like the Marietta Daily Journal, ``Georgia Crime Rate Reaches \nNew High. Juveniles Are More Apt To Break the Law.'' Or, in the now \nfamous Gwinnett Daily Post, ``Juvenile Drug Cases Up 738 Percent Over \n1992.''\n  The first wake-up call has to be in our communities. Every \npolicymaker has to get the message right. Drugs are not good and drugs \nwill do enormous damage. Teenagers, do not use it. Listen to those \nlittle ladies, those friends in the Macon Youth Development Center, \nwhen they said: ``Don't use drugs. Don't think you can control them. \nNever use drugs to be a part of a clique, a group. Just say no.''\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9683-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO C.H. ALBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in my many years of public service to \nthe people of South Carolina, one of the finest and most dedicated \npublic servants I have known in C.H. ``Icky'' Albright, a leading \nbusinessman, civic booster, and the former mayor of Rock Hill. Today, I \nrise to pay tribute to my friend, and to wish him a happy 90th \nbirthday, which he celebrated on August 30.\n  Without question, Icky has had a full life, and one marked by many \nimpressive accomplishments. A graduate of Clemson College, Icky's \ninitial calling in life was as an architect, and he practiced his \nprofession first at the South Carolina Highway Commission, and later in \nhis beloved Rock Hill. To this day, many of the buildings he designed \nremain standing, including several on what has become the campus of \nWinthrop University. Despite his success as an architect, Icky, as so \nmany enterprising Americans do, wanted to try his hand at running a \nbusiness, and he eventually gave up architecture in order to manage the \nMarshall Hardware Co. where he demonstrated his skills as an \nadministrator and entrepreneur.\n  In communities throughout the Nation, being a business leader is a \nnatural springboard into public service, and it was not long before \nIcky's reputation for hard work, integrity, and desire to help others \nled my friend into politics. In the years following World War II, \nduring which Icky had volunteered for the Navy and earned the rank of \nlieutenant, we was elected as a city councilman, mayor, and State \nsenator. In each instance, he held himself to the highest standards of \nhis office and he worked diligently to represent his constituents \ncapably, effectively, and fully. During my term as governor, Icky was \nserving as Mayor of Rock Hill, and I remember being impressed by his \ndedication to improving his city and the many projects which he \nsuccessfully undertook during his tenure.\n  Icky's reputation around Rock Hill was that of a man of action. He \nwas always eager to become involved in any endeavor that would benefit \nhis hometown and make it an even better place. Many of his initiatives \nare still part of life in Rock Hill, including the Come-See-Me \ncelebration, an annual event designed to celebrate the beauty and \nhospitality of that city. Without question, Icky has left a commendable \nlegacy through his many years of public service.\n  My friend's commitment to helping others was not limited to the \npublic sector. Through his involvement with numerous broads, \ncommissions, and committees, Icky worked to help build South Carolina \nand its business community into a vibrant and successful place. He \nestablished Albright Realty Company; served as president of both the \nSouth Carolina Hardware Association and the South Carolina Association \nof Realtors; and ended his professional career as the District Director \nof the Small Business Administration in South Carolina. Additionally, \nIcky served on the board of visitors of Presbyterian College; the \nbuilding committee for the Medical University of South Carolina; as a \ndelegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948; and, as an \nelder in the Presbyterian Church. Icky's commitment to service has \nearned him many awards and recognitions, including being inducted as a \nPaul Harris Fellow by Rotary International, the highest recognition a \nnon-Rotarian may be awarded.\n  Mr. President, Icky Albright is a man whose friendship I value \ngreatly. He is the godfather of my daughter, Nancy Moore Thurmond, and \na man who has been one of my strongest supporters through the years. I \nam always pleased whenever I have the opportunity to visit with Icky, \nhis loverly wife Sophie, or their sons. Without question, Icky Albright \nis a man who has served his city, State, and Nation admirably, and it \nis my hope that others will follow the lead he has set for public \nspiritedness and willingness to help others. We are proud of his many \naccomplishments and contributions, and that we are able to claim him as \na citizen of South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9690-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9690-S9691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL SCHOOL OF NURSING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today \nto pay tribute to the Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing, which \nis marking its 100th year of service to Cincinnati, OH, and northern \nKentucky.\n  Good Samaritan, the sixth nursing education program established in \nOhio, was founded by the Sisters of Charity and has graduated nearly \n5,000 nurses over the past century. These nurses have brought skilled \nand compassionate care to hundreds of thousands of patients throughout \nthe world.\n  Consistently a leader in nursing education, in 1906 Good Samaritan \nHospital School of Nursing was among the first in the United States to \nearn accreditation. Its leadership status was again affirmed in 1927 \nwhen it affiliated with a baccalaureate degree program at the College \nof Mount St. Joseph; in 1952 when it created a third-year internship; \nin 1972 when it tailored a nationally recognized registered nurse \nprogram to further the skills of licensed practical nurses; and in 1981 \nwhen it introduced its diploma program for part-time students.\n  Good Samaritan has also been a good neighbor.

I thank the Chair and thank my colleague, the ranking \nmember, the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Before proceeding with the opening statements and the usual motions \nto begin consideration of the appropriations bill--and we are going to \nbe doing a lot of that today--I would like to go over, for our Members \nand the staff, our intentions, how we would like to be able to expedite \nfloor consideration of this measure.\n  The bill was reported by the Committee on Appropriations 6 weeks ago, \non July 11. We tried very hard to minimize the number of new issues \nraised in the recommendations. Where compromises have been achieved, we \nhave restated bill language and mirrored funding levels, reflecting the \nagreements for the current fiscal year. We think we have made a good-\nfaith effort to avoid reopening controversial issues.\n  Again, I express my sincere thanks to the ranking member. This has \nbeen a bipartisan effort to try to move this bill forward. But in an \n$85 billion appropriations bill, there are disputes and policy \ndifferences. We did make a concerted effort to minimize the issues, \nspecifically with the intent of facilitating consideration of this \nbill. It is critical that we move this bill quickly if we are to avoid \nthe disruption, the waste, and inefficiencies which would result if we \nfailed to enact the bill before the start of the fiscal year and have \nto resort to cumbersome continuing resolutions or other measures.\n  I add, as I did in the discussion when this bill was brought up en \nbloc for consideration prior to the August recess, that there is a \nsupplemental appropriation, increasing the loan limitation of the \nGovernment National Mortgage Corporation, or Ginnie Mae, as most people \nknow it, which has to be enacted soon to prevent the disruption of \norderly placement and financing of FHA- and Veterans' Administration-\nguaranteed mortgages later this month. If we do not get this bill \npassed and sent to the President, they are going to run out of \nopportunities to refinance these mortgages later this month. I think \nthat is something we ought to be concerned about.\n  The bill also provides an extension of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency flood insurance authorization, which is necessary to \ncontinue FEMA's writing of these critical insurance policies beyond the \nend of this month. Coming from a State where floods happen and flood \ninsurance is vital, I ask all my colleague to focus on the fact that \nthere are these gravely needed portions of the bill that are in some \nways even more important than the appropriations parts for some \nindividuals.\n  It is my view that our efforts to avoid unnecessary disputes have \nbeen successful, laying the groundwork for a relatively quick \ndisposition of the bill. I will be making the standard motions for en \nbloc consideration of the committee amendments after my ranking member \nhas the opportunity to be heard.\n  In the course of that motion, I will propose a compromise on the FHA \nhome mortgage issue, which provides for a narrow demonstration of a \nrevised downpayment formula, limited to the States of Alaska and \nHawaii, which I believe is acceptable to all sides. We\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nhad much interest from Members on the entire matter of the FHA issues. \nI want everyone to be on notice we are going to be dealing with those. \nWe hope the compromise is acceptable.\n  Beyond that matter, we have a number of other noncontroversial \namendments, several of which make necessary technical and clarifying \nchanges in the bill. We have heard of other issues which we are \nattempting to work out. All Members, please be on notice that at this \npoint we can dispose of all but a handful of amendments within the \nhour. At that time it is the floor managers' intent to seek time \nagreements on remaining amendments which do require some debate and \nrollcall votes. We are limited in the amount of time that we have to \ndeal with this bill. I ask Members or their staffs to contact us so we \ncan provide this in an orderly fashion, for debate today and votes \ntomorrow, to move on with this bill.\n  The issues in dispute include an amendment to delete the space \nstation funding, by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers; an \namendment by the Senators from New Hampshire and Wisconsin, Mr. Smith \nand Mr. Feingold, proposing to terminate U.S. participation in the Bion \nspace life sciences mission; and one by the minority leader, the \nSenator from South Dakota, relating to a new VA entitlement program and \ndiscretionary benefits for the offspring of veterans in Vietnam \nsuffering from spina bifida. I hope we can arrive at time agreements so \nwe can air all sides of these issues and move on to a prompt \nresolution.\n  I ask any Member who has an issue to come down to the floor and to \nwork with us to address these concerns. If you work with our floor \nstaff and leadership, we will be seeking to limit time for debate on a \nshort list of remaining amendments by the conclusion of debate today. \nAgain, I urge any Member who has concern over an issue under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction, come to the floor so we can work to find \nan acceptable compromise or at least establish time agreements to \nfacilitate debate and disposition.\n  From past experience, I know there are likely to be a flurry of \ncolloquies that we are asked to accept at the last moment. We have had \nsome of those submitted to us. Both the ranking member and I need to \nlook at the colloquies. In the past, sometimes colloquies have gone in \nwhich have caused problems for other Senators. We will be happy to \naccept as many of the colloquies as we can, if we can get them cleared \nand make sure that everyone is comfortable with them. But to do that we \nreally need to have them by 5 o'clock today if we are to be able to \ngive them the full consideration so that we do not have any unnecessary \ndelay tomorrow or have to put off consideration of those issues to a \nlater time.\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, it is my pleasure to present to the \nSenate the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1997 as reported by the Committee on Appropriations. I am \nespecially pleased that I am doing so prior to the start of the fiscal \nyear rather than 6 months after it has begun. That is a pleasant change \nfor us. None of us want to repeat the long delays and frustrations we \nexperienced during the past year, being unable to enact this critical \nfunding measure. Unfortunately, less than a month of legislative \nactivity remains in this session.\n  So if we are to avoid a lapse of funding, or the necessity of a \ncontinuing resolution, and if we are to deal with the problems that I \nmentioned in my earlier statements, we have to act quickly. The bill \nbefore us attempts to provide a fair and balanced approach to many \ncompeting programs and activities under the VA-HUD subcommittee's \njurisdiction, within the constraints imposed by a very tight budget \nallocation. We have attempted to avoid reopening past disagreements and \ncontroversy which blocked the bill last year. It is our hope that by \npursuing this course, we can expedite consideration and enactment of \nthe measure.\n  Our efforts to facilitate this measure has meant that the bill, in a \nnumber of respects, reflects funding levels and policies which are \ncompromises between very different viewpoints. Nobody is going to be \nhappy with all of the decisions we have reached in this bill. Certainly \nI have had to make many compromises myself in the hopes of making it \nacceptable.\n  One example is inclusion of funds at the 1996 enacted level for the \nCorporation for National and Community Service. I and many others on my \nside continue to have some strong reservations about the program. No \ndoubt that failure to fund the program would result in a Presidential \nveto. I think that there are reforms that have been enacted and will be \nenacted that can improve the operation of the program.\n  Despite the misgivings, the bill proposes to maintain the current \nlevel of funding for the program, less than what is requested, more \nthan what I believe is warranted, but certainly more than would be \nincluded in a continuing resolution or other subsequent action if we \nhave to deal with vetoes of this measure.\n  With respect to other agencies funded in the bill, the committee has \nattempted to balance a wide variety of competing interests within a \nvery constrained budget allocation. The committee recommendation \nprovides $39 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including \nfull funding for VA medical care and an increase for VA research.\n  VA medical programs were afforded the highest priority in order to \nassure quality care for all veterans. The veterans currently being \nserved by the VA will receive that quality care. There will be a smooth \ntransition to a new organizational structure with the emphasis we \nexpect on a managed care approach.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the committee \nrecommendation continues the policies and programmatic reforms enacted \nlast year. We are hopeful and strongly support enactment of a \ncomprehensive public and assisted housing reform bill from the \nauthorizing committees. Make no mistake about it, we believe that we \nhave to have authorizing legislation. We would like to see it done. But \nthis appropriations bill contains temporary extensions of provisions \nneeded to halt the ever increasing cost of housing subsidy commitments.\n\n  And as I point out, and as the Secretary has agreed, under the \nreduced funding levels, many of these programmatic changes have to be \nmade right now in the appropriations measure to enable particularly \nlocal housing authorities, public housing agencies to deal with the \nreduced levels of funding. We cannot cut back on the funds without \ngiving relief to the local agencies who must administer the program. \nThat is why in the HUD provisions there are temporary authorizing \nprovisions to facilitate their use of the lower amounts of resources \navailable until such time as we get a good authorizing bill that \nestablishes a new framework.\n  Similarly, the appropriations bill complements the multifamily \nhousing restructuring proposals now under consideration by the \nauthorizing committee. We cannot continue excessive subsidies currently \nbeing paid to sustain the inventory of nearly a million apartments for \nlow-income families. Unless we in Congress act to reduce the excessive \ndebt of this housing inventory along with implementing other management \nimprovements, there could be massive defaults and widespread resident \ndisplacement. So make no mistake about it, the housing provisions in \nthis appropriations bill are vitally important.\n  The complexity and difficulty of developing a consensus on these \nissues obviously is substantial. Project owners, including limited and \ngeneral partners, project managers, the residents themselves with the \ngreatest stake in it, the State housing finance agencies, local \ncommunity development organizations, bondholders, and municipal \ngovernments are among those with significant interests in how we \naddress this issue.\n  These interests are, while we seek the same general goals, often \ndivergent and sometimes competing. We must be mindful of the fact that \nwe have billions of taxpayer dollars previously invested in this \nmultifamily housing inventory, and billions more which are at risk over \nthe next several years depending on which policies and financing \nmechanisms we select to deal with these issues.\n  The reported bill reflects our attempts at finding a reasonable \nbalance between these sometimes conflicting\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\nconcerns. We cannot afford to continue to pay excessive, way above \nmarket-rate subsidies for these multifamily housing projects through \nour supplements of rent through section 8, even those which provide \nvery good housing for low-income families. And some portions of this \ninventory, I might add, are little more than slums that it was intended \nto replace. Those have to be dealt with as well.\n  The committee recommendation is not a comprehensive solution. We are \nstriving for a workable compromise. It simply is an attempt to deal \nwith the issues in that fraction of the multifamily inventory that has \nsection 8 contracts expiring during fiscal year 1997. We are acting \nsolely because of affirmative efforts and the forward motion necessary \nto prevent defaults and potential resident displacement during the \nfiscal year. This ought to be of great importance to all Members of \nthis body.\n  Many people will shy away from housing because it is complicated. But \nlet me tell you, if we fail to do our job, there could be citizens in \nour States who are left without housing, which I think is a result that \nwe must avoid.\n  Since this bill was reported, we have heard from a number of affected \nparties, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who \nhave made suggestions as to how our proposal could be improved or made \nmore effective. We are examining these ideas and incorporating the good \nones as they come along.\n  We may be able to recommend a perfecting amendment to our multifamily \nhousing provisions. We intend to do so before the bill is finally \npassed. In any event, since the House bill contained no recommendations \non this issue, we will have extensive discussions on these concerns \nprior to and during conference. I hope that we can come out of \nconference, if not out of this body, which will be my first choice, \nwith a workable temporary solution.\n  Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge and express my sincere thanks \nfor the critically important role that the Senator from Oregon, the \nchairman of our full Appropriations Committee, has played in addressing \nthe potential adverse effects of the House budgetary allocations. \nSpecifically, Senator Hatfield has recognized how that allocation would \ncurtail our ability to maintain housing occupied by low-income families \nin developments which could prepay their subsidized mortgages and \nconvert to market-rate housing.\n  Based on the chairman's recommendation, the committee revised the \nsubcommittee's allocation which enabled us to include $19.7 billion for \nHUD. Perhaps what is more important, the increase in our outlay \nallocation allowed the increased funding for activities which prevent \nthe displacement of currently assisted families through contract \nrenewals and housing prevention payments.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill restores funding for the \nCommunity Development Block Grants program, the CDBG, at the current \nfull fiscal year 1996 level of $4.6 billion and does not have to \nwithhold $300 million from the obligation as was proposed in the House-\npassed bill, operating under a lower allocation.\n  For the Environmental Protection Agency, the recommendation totals \n$6.6 billion, an increase of $70 million over last year, with increases \nin key areas, particularly grants to States. Most programs are funded \nat last year's level, and programs such as Superfund and safe drinking \nwater revolving funds are increased as requested by the President. \nDespite the very compelling arguments made by some Members, this \nrecommendation does not include so-called riders in EPA in view of our \ndesire to keep this bill as free of controversy as possible in the \nlimited time available.\n  For FEMA, the bill provides the President's full request and, in \naddition, restores $1 billion in previously rescinded disaster relief \nfunds which FEMA anticipates will be needed to meet ongoing disaster \nrelief requirements.\n  The recommendations for NASA totals $13.7 billion, an increase of \n$100 million over the House, and restores funds for the critical \nMission to Planet Earth program to study global climate change.\n  Finally, $3.27 billion is recommended for the National Science \nFoundation, an increase of $55 million over the 1996 level and $22 \nmillion over the House amount, with very high priority given to \ninstrumentation and informal science education.\n  I note it was only 4 months ago we finally gained enactment of the \nbill for the current fiscal year. As a consequence, much of what is \nrecommended simply builds on agreements achieved in that measure. Mr. \nPresident, in aggregate, this bill appears to provide $2.1 billion more \nthan the fiscal year 1996 appropriations level. But this reflects two \nmajor adjustments which are unrelated to program levels. The first is \nan increase of $1.1 billion to replenish the FEMA disaster relief \naccount, which was drained by that amount to accommodate other \nappropriations measures in the cycle for the current year. The other \nchange is $948 million in one-time legislative savings which were \nenacted for HUD housing programs. When these adjustments are made, the \nnet aggregate increase in program funding is reduced to $84 million, or \njust one-tenth of 1 percent of the fiscal year 1996 appropriation.\n  Mr. President, this very modest increase, all but a freeze, reflects \nthe net of increases and decreases in several of our agencies. The \nbiggest increase, $481 million, was provided for the discretionary \nprograms of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The only other agencies \nto receive significant increases were the Environmental Protection \nAgency, with a $70 million increase, and the National Science \nFoundation, which received $55 million more than last year. These \nincreases were offset by cuts of $411 million in HUD and $200 million \nin NASA.\n  Finally, again, I express my sincere appreciation to my ranking \nmember and valuable colleague, the Senator from Maryland. I appreciate \nher assistance and cooperation in putting this bill together. I now \ntake pleasure in yielding the floor to her for such statement as she \nwishes to make.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nconsideration of H.R. 3666, Miss Catherine Corson, a detailee from the \nNational Science Foundation serving with the VA-HUD subcommittee, be \nprovided floor privileges.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are debating the VA-HUD bill, \nand I want to make my comments on it. I think, like all Americans \ntoday, our thoughts and our prayers are with our U.S. military, who, \nonce again, are called upon to stand sentry to protect those who cannot \nprotect themselves. For all who might be watching this on C-SPAN and \nseeing how we want to help the veterans, we are going to keep our \npromises to America's veterans, but we should really hold these men and \nwomen in our hearts today.\n  Today, I want to join my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nMissouri, to offer for floor debate the fiscal year 1997 appropriations \nbill. This is an $84.7 billion bill. It funds seven Cabinet or Cabinet-\nlevel agencies, as well as 18 independent agencies. We fund all of the \nveterans programs--both the veterans pensions, as well as veterans \nmedical care, veterans medical research, housing, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the National Science Foundation, National Community \nService, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. While we are looking \nat those large and significant agencies, we also fund programs like \nSelective Service, Arlington Cemetery, the Consumer Product Safety \nAgency.\n  Somebody might say, ``Well, how did all that happen?'' It sounds like \na lot of money, and it is, but years ago, this was the subcommittee \nthat before you got to be a Cabinet agency, you were an independent \nagency. Hopefully, these agencies still have independence and backbone, \nbut we now have seven of these. Of course, the largest and most \nsignificant, in terms of our obligations to the American people, is the \nVeterans Administration.\n  Dealing with these competing interests has been an enormous and \ndifficult job. I want to thank Senator Bond and his appropriations \nstaff, as well as my own for all the hard work they have done to get \nthis bill to the floor. I want to acknowledge the role of Senator \nHatfield and Senator Byrd in ensuring we have an allocation to meet \nday-\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nto-day needs of American people, as well as in science and technology, \nlooking at the long-range interests of the American people.\n  I am particularly grateful for Chairman Bond's efforts to work on a \ncollegial basis with this. I want to thank him for the collegiality and \ncivility with which we have been able to work on these issues. This \nbill continues the process of implementing many of the recommendations \nof the National Academy of Public Administration that I raised on \nissues related to HUD and EPA.\n  It is my commitment and I know the chairman's commitment that we want \nto make sure that a dollar's worth of taxes is used for a dollar's \nworth of services. When we are working, whether it is to fund Housing \nand Urban Development or the Environmental Protection Agency, we want \nto fund results and not bureaucracy. That is why when I chaired the \nsubcommittee, we turned to the National Association of Public \nAdministration to give us kind of an x ray of what they thought we \nshould be doing so we could get rid of the bureaucracy and focus on the \nresults.\n  I thank Senator Bond for continuing that. When we look at HUD, we can \nsee we have been able to do that. It has been my concern that in \nHousing and Urban Development, too often we create programs without \nthinking about their results. Do we empower the poor, which I know the \nPresiding Officer is deeply concerned about? We share a belief and \ncommitment in the role that nonprofit agencies play in the empowerment \nof the poor.\n  We want to make sure that our section 8 program is an opportunity, \nbut not a hollow one, and that along the way we do not create such \nlarge subsidies that we are creating a new generation of slum landlords \nor creating a new and expanded liability for taxpayers.\n  I have been deeply distressed in my own State of Maryland, \nparticularly in Baltimore and some of the surrounding areas, of the \nfailure to stand sentry with section 8 housing itself to make sure that \nit is an opportunity for the poor. Too often section 8 housing is \nriddled with housing abuse, poor housing conditions from plumbing and \nother fire and safety violations. We want to make sure HUD is on track \non how they spend their money, that we do get results and we are not \ncreating more liability for the taxpayer and minimizing opportunity for \nthe poor. Then we also looked at the funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Both the chairman and I have worked to get them \nfocused on the fact that they need to spend their money on that which \nis the greatest public health risk. The whole idea is not only to \nprotect natural resources and make sure we have clean air and clean \nwater, but in the process let us look at those areas that ensure public \nhealth and safety, and not move around on certain boutique programs \nthat might grab a headline. Chairman Bond and I are more interested in \nsaving lives than in grabbing headlines. That is why we urged EPA to \nfocus on this kind of risk-based approach. We believe EPA is doing it. \nI believe Secretary Browner is actually trying to move it in this \ndirection.\n\n  There is one other area in this bill where we were able to restore \ncuts that the House made. We restored a $1 billion cut in Federal \nemergency disaster relief. As you know, many disasters have hit the \nUnited States, from blizzards to hurricanes, to terrible tornadoes that \nhave affected our States. We wanted to be sure that if a Governor calls \nPresident Clinton 911 to help with emergency relief, we will have the \nmoney to be able to do that. We now have Edouard and we have Fran \nwhizzing around out there. We want to be sure that the Governors of our \nSoutheastern States know we are behind them.\n  This bill also restores a cut in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. All \nof us have been mesmerized about this new finding about life on Mars, \nthat maybe there is life on Mars, or maybe there was life on Mars. It \nis a fascinating topic. But there is one planet that we believe there \nis intelligent life on and it is called the Planet Earth. Dr. Sally \nRide said we should study it because by stepping back in space and \nstudying Mission to Planet Earth, studying our own planet as if it were \na distant one, we will come up with an incredible amount of information \nthat will be able to help our farmers, help our fishermen, and help \ncommunities prepare for natural disasters.\n  Mission to Planet Earth is a scientific mission, a civilian mission \nthat looks at our environmental condition, which can then prepare \ncommunities for natural disasters, and not only here, Mr. President, \nbut around the world. We can help Africa predict and know about a \nfamine. We can help Japan and our friends in the Pacific rim know how \nto estimate typhoons and be able to save lives and property and \nevacuate people. What a great way for us to advance our scientific \nknowledge but, again, be able to help in our commercial activity and be \nable to save lives.\n  Another cut restored was in the national service AmeriCorps Program. \nI know that is significantly controversial. I thank Senator Bond for \nworking with me in restoring AmeriCorps at a modest funding level. This \nis a program that is very special to President Clinton and, I believe, \nto many people. What it essentially says is that by getting out there \nand volunteering, being part of AmeriCorps, you can earn a voucher to \nreduce your student debt.\n  You see, for every opportunity, we think there is an obligation. This \nis not about giveaways. We want our kids to be able to reduce their \nstudent debt, but at the same time rekindle those habits of the heart, \nso when the voucher is over and they are back in their communities, \nthey are part of the volunteer effort, working in nonprofits, or hands-\non, or being members of boards and commissions.\n  I am very proud of the fact that Senator Bond has worked very hard to \nensure veterans medical care and veterans medical research. It is \npromises made and promises kept to America's veterans. I think we were \nable to do that. There are over 187 veterans hospitals. There are also \nmany new outpatient clinics in many areas where I believe we have not \ndone all we would like to do, but I believe we have kept our promises.\n\n  Some of the yellow flashing lights for me are in EPA. I know that \nwhile funding for EPA is $70 million more than last year, it is $400 \nmillion below the President's request. There is concern about deep cuts \nin core programs or other priority programs like Boston Harbor, the \nMontreal protocol, climate exchange, and the environmental technology \ninitiative. Some in Congress do not always make the case between public \nhealth and the environment. We know it is so, and that is why we need \nto ensure adequate funding for EPA.\n  Another area which is controversial is NASA. Because we face so many \ncompelling human needs, many people say, ``Why are we funding NASA?'' \nWell, by funding NASA, we develop new ideas, new knowledge and new \ntechnology that helps advance the cause of mankind through scientific \ndiscovery. That is the nature of what we are as Americans. We are \ndiscoverers. And through it, we are able to also come up with \ntremendous opportunities for technology transfer, which helps our \nAmerican people. I could list those programs, but I don't think we need \nto do it. I do know that we will be looking at all of these special \nprograms, some in Maryland and some in other States. Goddard Space \nAgency is in my own home State. I know the recent discovery of possible \nlife on Mars is an example of how exciting and important the space \nprogram continues to be.\n  Some people feel that money is wasted. But we cannot look that way. \nIt is too narrow. You know, they laughed at the Louisiana Purchase, \nthey laughed at Columbus, and they laughed at Pasteur.\n  The Presiding Officer knows that scientific discovery and the \ntechnology around it is always ridiculed, such as the automobile, and \nall those things, and one day they transformed our society. Whoever \nthought a couple of guys working in a garage with spare parts could \nspawn a whole new computer industry that has now revolutionized the \nentire planet?\n  We want to make sure that by funding the National Science Foundation, \nwe continue to make sure that the United States of America is on the \ncutting edge. There are many issues that we have to face in the future, \nwhether it is in housing, space, and so on. But\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nI believe that we can solve those problems if we work with good will, \ncommon sense, and focus on the results we want to achieve in science \nand technology for the long-range needs of our country and looking at \nthe day-to-day needs of the American people. How can we give help to \nthose who practice self-help? I believe if those are our guiding \nprinciples, we will be able to move this bill, and I think we have \nfollowed those principles in this.\n  Again, I thank Senator Bond for his very hard work and willingness to \nlisten to my concerns and those of the members of my own party, and to \nwork with my staff and me. I am going to echo the words of Senator \nBond. Less than a month remains in this session. We don't want this \nbill to be in a continuing resolution. Let us make the U.S. Senate work \nand get the appropriations bill done. I look forward to voting for \nfinal passage of this bill tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished ranking member for \na very forceful presentation. I tell her that I share that desire for a \nfinal vote tomorrow very strongly. I endorse and second all of the \nstrong things she said about the science function. She knows and \nunderstands these programs extremely well. That is why she is an \ninvaluable member of this subcommittee. I certainly would hate to lose \nher from this subcommittee to Small Business, as has been suggested in \nother quarters.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am right here.\n  Mr. BOND. I am delighted to have the good Senator from Maryland \nworking with me on this. I enjoy working with the Senator from Arkansas \non small business.\n  Mr. President, turning to some of the procedural matters, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendments of the committee to H.R. 3666 be \nconsidered and adopted, en bloc, with the proviso that no points of \norder are to be waived thereon by such adoption, and that the bill, as \namended, be considered original text for the purpose of further \namendment, with the further proviso that this consent request exclude \nthe following amendments: On page 72, line 10, relating to an earmark \nfor drinking water funds; page 85, lines 6 through 15, relating to NASA \nbuyouts; page 102, line 23, through page 104, line 20, relating to FHA; \npage 104, lines 21 through 24, relating to NASA's Bion mission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to, en bloc, with the above \nnoted exceptions.\n\n\n Amendment No. 5157 to Excepted Committee Amendment on Page 72, line 10\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount provided for EPA drinking water state \n  revolving funds by $725,000, offset by a commensurate reduction to \n                   clean water state revolving funds)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5157.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 72, line 10, in lieu of the sum proposed by the \n     committee amendment, insert ``$1,275,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an amendment to the first excepted \ncommittee amendment. It increases the amount provided for drinking \nwater State revolving funds by $725 million in recognition of the fact \nthat, on August 1, 1996, funds previously appropriated for drinking \nwater State revolving funds were reallocated to clean water State \nrevolving funds pursuant to a requirement in the fiscal year 1996 \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  Congress mandated this transfer if a drinking water authorization \nbill had not been enacted into law as of that date. That measure was \nenacted less than 1 week after the August 1 deadline, and we believe it \nis appropriate that these funds be restored. The funds which have been \nreleased for clean water revolving funds can be considered as an \nadvance on the fiscal year 1997 appropriation.\n  This amendment simply adjusts the new appropriations to reflect this \nprior funding and will have no effect on our intended program levels. \nWe gave our assurances to members of the authorizing committee that \nthis would be one of the first orders of business as we dealt with this \nbill. The members of the committee worked so hard for the passage of \nthe safe drinking water measure. We are very anxious to have these \nfunds available, and the funds under this amendment will be available \ncrediting the transfer of the funds on August 1 to the clean water \nrevolving fund account for 1997 and giving the 1996 appropriations \nalong with the 1997 appropriations to drinking water.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with the amendment offered by \nSenator Bond. It does make the compelling need that we have talked \nabout and does so in a timely way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Missouri.\n  The amendment (No. 5157) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, this is a perfecting amendment to the next \nexcepted committee amendment.\n  The modification proposed is necessary to clarify the intent of the \ncommittee that the buyout authority granted for NASA be conducted \nentirely with the appropriated funds. The modification requires NASA to \nreimburse the civil service retirement disability fund for the full \ncost of anticipated retirement benefits and lost contributions \nassociated with employees who accept these incentives and retire \nvoluntarily to separate from Federal service. By requiring such \npayments, we prevent an increase in expenditures occurring during \nfiscal year 1997 as a result of the buyout since NASA will have to use \nother expenditures in order to meet these costs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with Senator Bond's amendment. \nAgain, what we are finding is that NASA must encourage people to \nretire. Their original request was excessive.

SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH REGARD TO COMPLIANCE WITH \n                   INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in response to a dispute settlement finding against the \n     United States by the World Trade Organization, the United \n     States informed the World Trade Organization on June 19, \n     1996, that the United States intends to meet its \n     international obligations to the World Trade Organization \n     with respect to the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     requirements on imported reformulated and conventional \n     gasoline;\n       (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has initiated an \n     open process to examine any and all options for compliance \n     with international obligations of the United States in which \n     a key criterion will be fully protecting public health and \n     the environment; and\n       (3) many United States environmental and industrial \n     organizations are concerned about the ``Regulation of Fuels \n     and Fuel Additives: Individual Foreign Refinery Baseline \n     Requirements for Reformulated Gasoline'' proposed on May 3, \n     1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 84).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in evaluating any option for compliance with \n     international obligations, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency should--\n       (1) take fully into account the protection of public health \n     and the environment and the international obligations of the \n     United States as a member of the World Trade Organization;\n       (2) ensure that the compliance review process not result in \n     the degradation of the gasoline quality required by the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) with respect to conventional \n     and reformulated gasoline;\n       (3) not recognize individual foreign refiner baselines \n     unless the Administrator determines that the issues of \n     auditing, inspection of foreign facilities, and enforcement \n     have been adequately addressed; and\n       (4) provide a full and open administrative process in the \n     formulation of any final rule.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the pending sense-of-\nthe-Senate offered by my colleague, Senator Burns. This measure strikes \nwhat I believe to be the proper balance. It recognizes both our \nobligation to comply with the World Trade Organization's [WTO] recent \ndispute-settlement finding against the United States' regulation of \nimports of reformulated and conventional gasoline, and our obligation \nto take fully into account the protection of the public health and the \nenvironment in evaluating all options for compliance.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I want to underscore \nthe importance of the United States honoring its obligations and \ncommitments under the WTO, particularly with respect to the dispute-\nsettlement process. Mr. President, creation of an effective binding WTO \ndispute-settlement mechanism was an important achievement of the \nUruguay Round trade agreement.\n  I believe that any attempt to frustrate U.S. efforts to implement the \nWTO's decision on reformulated and conventional gasoline, or any future \nWTO decision, would be harmful to U.S. interests and the multilateral \ntrading system for the following reasons.\n  First, WTO rules permit retaliation to be taken against a WTO member \ncountry that refuses to implement a WTO decision. Therefore, U.S. \nfailure to comply with a WTO decision could prompt our trading partners \nwith an interest in the decision to seek authority from the WTO to \nretaliate against the United States. Such retaliation could come in the \nform of increased tariffs on U.S. exports.\n  Second, I believe that U.S. failure to implement a WTO decision would \nundermine the WTO dispute-settlement process and our ability to end \nunfair foreign trade practices. Other countries may use U.S. non-\ncompliance as an excuse for refusing to implement WTO decisions that \nare unfavorable to them, including the many WTO disputes the United \nStates is currently pursuing against other countries' trade \nrestrictions.\n  Third, I worry that if WTO decisions are ignored by the United States \nor other countries, the ability to enforce WTO obligations generally is \nsharply reduced, as is the value of the obligations themselves. A \nweakening of WTO obligations would be a major setback for the \nmultilateral trading system and could complicate any future efforts to \nfurther expand the system and reduce existing trade barriers.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I am heartened that this Sense of \nthe Senate recognizes the important U.S. interests in complying with \nthe WTO's recent decision on reformulated and conventional gas and in \nmaintaining the integrity of the WTO dispute-settlement process.\n  Finally, I would like to make two further points on the WTO decision \nat issue here. I hope that these points will clear up any \nmisconceptions surrounding United States compliance with the WTO's \nfinding that current Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] regulations \ndiscriminate against foreign refiners in Brazil and Venezuela and do \nnot comply with WTO rules.\n  First, the WTO decision does not dictate what actions the United \nStates or the EPA must take to come into compliance with the decision, \nbecause under WTO rules the United States retains the discretion to \ndecide the best way to comply with the WTO's finding.\n  Second, as my good friend Senator Chafee, chairman of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, will point out, the WTO decision does \nnot undermine the United States' ability to enforce its environmental \nlaws. In its decision, the WTO was very careful to note that it did not \nobject to the goals of the Clean Air Act or the United States' right to \ntake measures to protect the environment. Nor does the decision require \nthe United States to lower its environmental standards. Instead, the \ndecision simply found that the United States had not adequately \nexplored ways to achieve its environmental objectives without \ndiscriminating against imports.\n  I appreciate having the opportunity to share my views on this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if my colleagues would permit, I would \nlike to add a few comments of my own on the subject of the Burns sense-\nof-the-Senate included in the managers' amendment.\n  As my colleagues may know, earlier this spring a World Trade \nOrganization [WTO] panel found that a 1993 regulation adopted by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency [EPA] discriminated against imports. \nThe regulation in question established baselines against which refiners \nmust measure compliance with requirements under the Clean Air Act for \nconventional and reformulated gasoline. In coming to its conclusions, \nthe WTO panel noted that the United States had not fully explored ways \nto overcome the administrative difficulties relating to imported \ngasoline, and that although the United States had considered the costs \nto domestic refiners of complying with the regulation, the same \nconsideration was not given to the costs that would be incurred by \nforeign refiners. On June 19, the United States informed the WTO that \nwe would endeavor to meet our international obligations by complying \nwith the panel decision.\n  This case has received a good deal of attention, and provoked a good \ndeal of comment. Unfortunately, many of the assertions that have been \nmade about this case misinterpret both its meaning and its effect. As \nchairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I regret \nsuch misinterpretations, and want to take a moment to set the record \nstraight.\n  First, let me stress that the April WTO decision has nothing to do \nwith the Clean Air Act itself; nor does it undermine the act in any \nway. Rather, the WTO decision deals with the approach set by a \nregulation issued pursuant to the Act. The Clean Air Act did not force \nEPA to discriminate against foreign refiners. EPA had a range of \noptions from which to choose and, unfortunately, they chose one that \nran afoul of our international obligations.\n  I want to emphasize that the panel decision did not invalidate or \notherwise undermine the act's requirements or the concept of using \nbaselines. What the decision did do is say that the law must be \nimplemented in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. That concept\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\nis one of the most basic--and most important--elements of our global \ntrading system. And I would point out that it need not conflict with \nstrong environmental protection.\n  The WTO ruling does not affect the ability of the United States to \nenforce the Clean Air Act. The WTO itself explicitly recognizes the \nright of member nations to take steps to protect human health and \nexhaustible natural resources. Neither the Clean Air Act nor its \nobjectives were ever at issue in this case.\n  Finally, the panel decision does not mandate whether, or how, the \nUnited States should come into compliance with the WTO ruling. Such \nmatters are left to the member nation to decide for itself. In this \ncase, the United States informed the WTO that we will take steps to \ncomply--a decision I believe was the right one. Indeed, I would urge \nEPA in the strongest terms possible to act without delay, so that we \nmay come into compliance as quickly as possible.\n  So there should be no confusion about this case or its outcome. The \nWTO examined a regulation promulgated under the Clean Air Act and found \nthat its separate requirements for foreign refiners were \ndiscriminatory. That is all there is to it. Fix the discrimination, and \nthe problems cease. Meanwhile, the Clean Air Act and our other \nenvironmental laws remain in effect, as always.\n  Now, with regard to the sense of the Senate, which attempts to \ndescribe the current situation and hold the EPA to certain commitments \nregarding the upcoming review process, since it does not constitute an \namendment to the Clean Air Act and is not binding, I do not intend to \nraise an objection.\n  However, let me say this: there is no question that complying with \nthe WTO decision is in the best interests of the United States, not \nonly for the reasons outlined just now by my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, but for our own \ninterests in environmental protection. Frankly, there are some in the \ndomestic refining industry who have benefited from the current unequal \nstate of affairs, and who would prefer to see the United States avoid \ncoming into compliance in this case. They may attempt to influence the \nreview process to ensure that at the end of the day, they retain their \ncurrent advantage. An outcome along those lines would be an act of \ncynicism that would do us serious damage in our efforts to maintain a \nfair international trading system. Such an outcome will not do.\n  We have an obligation to make a good faith effort to come into \ncompliance with the WTO decision as soon as possible. Adopting an \napproach that purports to solve the problem, but that merely prolongs \nthe current inequity, is not acceptable. An acceptable solution is one \nin which no unfair distinction is drawn between domestic and foreign \ngasoline; in which domestic and foreign refiners alike meet the levels \ncurrently allowed by the Clean Air Act; and in which the United States \nmay ensure enforcement for both domestic and foreign industry using \napproaches that have proven effective in the past. That truly would be \na level playing field.\n  For my colleagues' information, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of a letter on this issue that was sent to \nme by the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, \nthe Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund. I appreciate the managers \nof the bill allowing me the opportunity to make comments about this \nmatter, and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, \n           Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund,\n                                                    July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. John Chafee, Chairman,\n     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,\n     Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Chafee and Baucus: We write to register our \n     environmental opposition to a potential rider, identical to \n     that attached to the 1995 and 1996 VA/HUD/Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations bill, that would prohibit the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from signing, \n     promulgating, implementing, or enforcing certain regulations \n     concerning reformulated gasoline (RFG). We are concerned that \n     this rider would limit the authority of EPA to promulgate \n     sound regulations to protect the U.S. environment and the \n     health of U.S. citizens.\n       First, EPA has a mandate under the Clean Air Act to protect \n     the U.S. environment from hazards in reformulated gasoline, \n     whether such gasoline is domestically produced or imported. \n     EPA should be free to fulfill that congressional mandate in \n     the way that it sees fit, consistent with the required public \n     comment process. We believe such a procedure places decision-\n     making on trade and environment issues where it belongs: with \n     the American people and the government agencies that serve \n     them. This process should not be cut off prematurely by \n     Congressional action on an Appropriations bill.\n       Second, all of our organizations strongly oppose weakening \n     environmental laws in response to trade pressures, and harbor \n     deep concerns about the WTO. However, the WTO Appellate \n     Report in the RFG case concedes that the United States can \n     adopt ``non-arbitrary'' discriminatory rules if we and our \n     RFG trading partners are unable to agree on a mutually \n     satisfactory approach for maintaining our high level of \n     protection of the U.S. environment. Thus the EPA is not \n     constrained to weaken U.S. environmental standards (in fact, \n     it has a mandate not to), and there is no environmental \n     benefit to be gained by the proposed rider.\n       One further note: it has come to our attention that certain \n     industry entities may have stated, directly or by \n     implication, that some of the undersigned organizations are \n     supporting the Burns rider on environmental grounds. Any such \n     statements reflect a misunderstanding and are inaccurate. \n     Some of our organizations did object to an earlier effort by \n     EPA to change the RFG rule. These organizations did so \n     because EPA did not provide adequate public notice and \n     opportunity for public comment. Moreover, a compromise rule \n     considered at the time could have weakened environmental \n     protections. EPA's latest Federal Register Notice does \n     provide the opportunity for comment that we were originally \n     seeking, and provides the public with the opportunity to \n     ensure that high levels of U.S. environmental protections are \n     maintained. Because EPA has met our concerns about public \n     notice and comment, there is no reason to support the Burns \n     rider, or to hamper EPA from pursuing its new course.\n       We therefore urge you to oppose the rider currently being \n     considered by Senator Burns for attachment to the EPA \n     Appropriations bill in the floor debate in the Senate.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Annie Petsonk,\n       International Counsel, Environmental defense Fund.\n     Rodrigo Prudencio,\n       Trade & Environment Program Coordinator, The National \n     Wildlife Federation.\n     Daniel Seligman,\n       Senior Trade Fellow, Sierra Club.\n     David Schorr,\n       Senior Program Officer, Trade and Environment World \n     Wildlife Fund.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5163\n\n (Purpose: To allow the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to use certain funds to implement comprehensive conservation and \n          management plans under the national estuary program)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4   .

Mr. President, let me give Members a brief rundown of the \nprovisions in these en bloc amendments so everybody will know what we \nare dealing with.\n  The first amendment, which is supported by FEMA and is cosponsored by \nSenator Byrd, provides an interim extension of FEMA's flood insurance \nlegislation to enable FEMA to continue writing flood insurance policies \nafter September 30, 1996, until the committee of jurisdiction \nreauthorizes the flood insurance program. Without this extension, FEMA \nwould be forced to stop writing policies on October 1, a problem which \nI have already dealt with here and which I have stated is of great \nimportance to many States and particularly those like mine which have \nhad significant flood events in them.\n  The second amendment is offered on behalf of Senators Snowe and \nCohen. It represents a technical correction to the fiscal 1995 VA-HUD \nbill pertaining to a project in Bangor, ME. The amendment relates only \nto the fiscal year 1995 appropriations for the project and allows the \nfunds to be utilized in a manner required by that community.\n  The third, on behalf of Senators Burns and Mikulski, is an amendment \nwhich expresses the sense of the Senate regarding imports of \nreformulated and conventional gasoline.\n  That has been cleared on both sides, and it has been cleared by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  Next, in the en bloc amendment, on behalf of Senators Mack, Graham, \nand Lieberman, an amendment which has been cleared on both sides and \nhas wide support would allow EPA's national estuary program funds to be \nused for implementing cleanup plans in fiscal year 1997 and prior \nyears.\n  Next, on behalf of Senators Craig, Sarbanes, Moseley-Braun, Kerry, \nand Murray is an amendment to clarify the $500 million appropriation \nfor low-income housing preservation.\n  Next, on behalf of Senators Kerry and Domenici, the final amendment \nsets forth an earmark of $50 million for vouchers for displaced and \ndisabled individuals or families currently in buildings being converted \nto all-elderly.\n  The last amendment which has been requested by the EPA Administrator \nis technical in nature. It is one which addresses $725 million in funds \nrecently released for the clean water State revolving funds from funds \npreviously appropriated for drinking water State revolving funds. These \nfunds are considered an advance on the fiscal year 1997 appropriation \nfor clean water State revolving funds. The amendment simply ensures \nthat States' clean water funds are not penalized by the 1996 release of \nfunds so late in the fiscal year. It enables States which are not \nprepared to receive the entire amount of the share of $725 million in \nclean water State revolving funds in fiscal year 1996 but do receive \nthe balance in fiscal year 1997 to participate in any possible \nreallotment of fiscal year 1996 funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion of the amendments? \nIf not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments offered en bloc \nby the Senator from Missouri.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5160 through 5166) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know in a few minutes one of our \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Glenn of Ohio, wants to speak about \nthe importance of NASA and its adequate funding. We are so honored to \nhave a Senator astronaut with us who, of course, can speak in a unique \nway, but I wish to make one comment on the amendments that we just \npassed because when we run through them they sound so technical, they \nsound so dry, and they sound so easy.\n  I should like to bring to the attention of my colleagues that each \none of these took a lot of hard work and a lot of staff time and will \nbe enormously important to people.\n  The FEMA flood insurance authorization means that we can actually \nwrite flood insurance. What we are facing with Edouard and Fran, and so \non--flood insurance.\n  We have worked to protect the American refiner industry. We had \nsomething a lot stronger, but we were told that we would trigger a WTO \naction, so therefore we sat down and worked very hard to make sure we \ncomply with international trade but we made sure we had our dukes up to \nprotect America's jobs in the gulf coast, to make sure that Americans \nare working, being able to have jobs in the refiner industry, and \nultimately with Iran and Iraq staring each other down now it would be \nvery important to ensure our independence in the refinery process.\n  When we look at the amendment of a $50 million earmark for vouchers \nfor displaced disabled, what does that mean? It means now that disabled \npeople are now living in housing for the elderly. That is what was \nincluded in the Americans With Disabilities Act. These are younger \npeople. There is a clash of culture between the younger disabled and \nthe elderly. We want to have the elderly be able to have their own \nhousing. We want to make sure that we do not abandon our commitment, \nand that is what this amendment is about. I could go through example \nafter example. We want to show when we are spending this money we are \nprotecting jobs, we are looking out for the disabled, and we are also \nprotecting property owners with flood insurance. It takes a lot of hard \nwork, focusing on the detail, and making sure that Government is \nworking in a way that serves people.\n  So having said that, I did not mean to give a long speech but that is \nwhy we agree to these amendments and again we find that a sensible \nSenate can protect our jobs and protect our folks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a statement on NASA today before we get \nin the throes of some of the amendments and get into the more time-\nconstrained portion of our debate on the floor.\n  I wish I could have the very personal attention of every person in \nthis country who is 60 years of age or older. Do you know how many \nthere are? According to the statistics from the Bureau of the Census, \nas of July 1 of this year, it is estimated we had 43,872,000 people \nabove the age of 60. That number is expanding, as was pointed out in a \nU.S. News & World Report full-page article earlier this year in June \ncalled, ``Waves of Gray.''\n  The Census Bureau also tells us that over the next 50 years or so \nwhen those people who are in their twenties now are in their real \nsenior years, the numbers of people over 60 years of age will have \ngrown to almost 100 million people.\n  Now, why do I bring that up in the context of NASA? Because I think \nif I had the attention of every single one of those people we could \nmake very decided moves into getting every single one of those people \nto support everything about the space program, and for this reason. One \nthing that has happened in the look into the life and biosciences in \nthe NASA program has been that we find some notable parallels between \nwhat happens to astronauts in space and what happens to the elderly \nright here on Earth. And if we can find what triggers some of these \nsimilarities, perhaps we will have a whole new handle on approaching \ndifficulties that people have right here on Earth.\n  There is an excellent article that was put out by Joan Vernikos, who \nis the Director of Life Sciences at NASA, and I wanted to read most of \nthis article here because I think it is very good and it lays out \nexactly what NASA has found. Then I will have some addi-\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\ntional remarks at the end. The article is titled ``Parallel Processes? \nThe Study of Human Adaptation to Space Helps Us Understand Aging.''\n\n       In 1963, the U.S. population included 17 million people who \n     were 65 years old or older--today there are twice as many.\n\n  That is just since 1963.\n\n       Meanwhile, the number of Americans 85 years or older is \n     projected to grow from 3.3 million today to 18.9 million by \n     2050.\n\n  Many people just getting out of college and starting their working \nyears will fit into that group.\n\n       Gerontologists--scientists who study the aging process--say \n     that more research into diseases that afflict older people \n     could help to reduce the number of individuals who require \n     expensive full-time medical care in their later years.\n       Studies of age-related health problems have shown that the \n     process of physiological adaptation to the low gravity of \n     space induces symptoms also seen in aging (some effect of \n     aging appear to be due to inactivity rather than the aging \n     process itself). Hence, gerontologists and space life \n     scientists are collaborating to determine how people adapt to \n     aging and to the virtual absence of gravity in space and to \n     develop countermeasures where possible. Space biomedical \n     research could improve understanding of the basic mechanisms \n     of aging, and aging research could contribute to a better \n     understanding of physiological deconditioning in space.\n\n\n               Astronauts: Simulating the Aging Process?\n\n       Life on Earth evolved in the presence of gravity. For this \n     reason, gravity plays a role in all life processes, and \n     exposure to the microgravity environment of space affects \n     living things significantly. Certain physiological changes \n     that occur in space also occur with aging: for instance, \n     cardiovascular deconditioning, balance disorders, weakening \n     bones and muscles, disturbed sleep, and depressed immune \n     response. An important difference, however, is that these \n     changes are reversible in astronauts.\n       Research has shown that insufficient excercise--due to \n     aging, paralysis, weakness, or prolonged bed rest, for \n     example--can cause a downward spiral in an individual's \n     health over time, increasing susceptibility to bone fractures \n     and slowing recovery from injuries and other ailments. What \n     researchers learn about the physiological effects that \n     accompany space flight may yield ways of limiting he \n     deconditioning symptoms of the inactivity that comes with \n     aging.\n       Are these changes inevitable? Do they result from the same \n     processes? Can people take steps to lessen, prevent, or \n     reverse them? With the understanding that similar results may \n     be due to different mechanisms and processes, biomedical \n     researchers are attempting to gain insights into the aging \n     process by studying physiological adaptation to space and \n     visa versa.\n       A primary goal of NASA's life sciences program is to \n     understand the mechanisms underlying these physiological \n     changes and to find ways of preventing them in astronauts. \n     The National Institute on Aging's high-priority research \n     interests reflect a similar focus, encompassing nervous \n     system function, frailty, osteoporosis, dizzy spells, sudden \n     drops in blood pressure often causing falls and fractured \n     bones, problems with coordination of movements, and the \n     effects of physical exercise on bone and muscle in the older \n     population.\n\n\n                           Balance Disorders\n\n       Space crew members experience neurosensory disturbances \n     such as dizziness and inability to maintain their balance \n     upon returning from space flights. Humans sense gravity on \n     Earth directly through receptors in the inner ear and \n     indirectly by touch and stretch. In space these sensing \n     mechanisms don't review their usual cues. Studies of the \n     neurosensory system conducted in space offer a unique \n     opportunity to understand how gravity, and the absence of it, \n     affects the central nervous system and neurosensory-dependent \n     functions such as hand-eye coordination, posture, balance, \n     and gait.\n       Much space flight sciences research focuses on better \n     understanding the mechanisms involved in the brain's \n     interpretation of the body's orientation in three-dimensional \n     space. With sufficient information in hand, researchers can \n     develop procedures to protect space crew members from such \n     disturbances, especially when crews return to Earth after \n     long space voyages. The results of this research apply to \n     patients with gait and postural disorders of neurological \n     origin, including elderly people for whom falls may have \n     especially serious consequences.\n\n\n                           Sleep Disturbances\n\n       The change in sleep pattern that typically comes with aging \n     is early waking and fragmented sleep. In space, sleep is also \n     fragmented or otherwise disturbed. Optimal alertness during \n     the day and sound sleep at night, valuable qualities on Earth \n     and in space, require proper synchronizing of the human \n     circadian pacemaker (the ``body clock''). Thus, researchers \n     seek to better understand how aging and space flight affect \n     the mechanisms governing circadian rhythms.\n       While researchers surmise that aging changes the properties \n     of the human circadian pacemaker, they are not precisely sure \n     how changes occur. Research has shown that bright light can \n     reset the human circadian pacemaker; this treatment, \n     originally developed for aging people, more recently has \n     proven useful to astronauts preparing for space flight.\n\n\n                           bone deterioration\n\n       Loss of bone mass is a problem common to aging and space \n     travel. Although the results may be the same, the causes may \n     be different. Space life scientists and researchers studying \n     aging are interested in how exercise affects bones; whether \n     hormones or drugs can prevent bone loss or promote bone \n     formation; and what mechanism translates mechanical loading \n     (physical street or force) on bones into biochemical signals \n     that stimulate bone formation and resorption.\n       Normally, the breakdown of old bone mass (resorption) and \n     the formation of new bone mass occur constantly, in a \n     balanced cycle called remodeling. Mechanical forces (that is, \n     gravity-driven stresses) appear to coordinate these \n     fundamental bone shaping processes. Determining how the body \n     translates these forces into the signals that control bone \n     structure may reveal whether and how exercise or drugs can \n     prevent osteoporosis in the elderly and in astronauts.\n\n\n       cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic intolerance\n\n       Exposure to microgravity degrades the general condition of \n     the cardiovascular system and specifically degrades \n     orthostatic tolerance (the ability of the cardiovascular \n     system to supply the brain with enough blood to maintain \n     consciousness while an individual stands upright).\n\n       It is what adjusts our body if we are lying down and stand \n     up or are sitting down and stand up suddenly. We know a lot \n     of people have a problem with this, have a dizziness. If they \n     fall over, with maybe osteoporosis, have a broken hip, \n     whatever.\n\n       Since orthostatic tolerance may decline with aging, \n     whatever space researchers learn about this particular \n     adaptation should help to solve the problem on Earth as well \n     as in space, even though the mechanisms of adaptation may be \n     different.\n\n\n                      drug and nutrient absorption\n\n       Nausea and sometimes vomiting were the earliest and mostly \n     consistent symptoms experienced in the first few days of \n     spaceflight. A broad array of drugs used to treat motion \n     sickness on Earth were only slightly helpful in space. Many \n     theories were developed to explain this lack of \n     effectiveness, until an astronaut doctor gave a fellow \n     suffering astronaut one of these drugs by injection.\n       The effect was miraculous. It became clear that the same \n     drug taken orally in space was not nearly as effective \n     because perhaps it was not absorbed nearly as well. Recent \n     experiments in spaceflight suggest the absorption of calcium \n     may also be reduced in space. Perhaps the same is true for \n     other nutrients? Ground studies, using the inactivity of bed \n     rest to mimic the effects of spaceflight in young volunteers, \n     have also indicated reduced absorption through the stomach \n     and gut, similar to what is suspected to be found in the \n     elderly. Research in the absorption and distribution of drugs \n     and nutrients in astronauts may help increase awareness that \n     as people get older daily nutritional requirements as well as \n     the effect of drugs prescribed may change.\n\n\n                            immune response\n\n       Both aging and space flight depress the human immune \n     response (though the change in space is temporary while the \n     change due to aging is not). Reduced proliferation of \n     infection-fighting cells in the immune system may underlie \n     changes in both conditions. It is not clear, however, whether \n     aging or other factors that typically accompany aging (such \n     as declining activity) cause this immune-system depression.\n       Models of age-related changes in immune function are \n     difficult to find, so microgravity may be a very useful model \n     system to use to increase our understanding of changes due to \n     aging.\n\n\n                             for the future\n\n       Although humans have been traveling into space for three \n     decades--\n\n  A little over three decades now.\n\n     researchers have had few opportunities thus far to carry out \n     systematic biomedical research in space. The dedicated space \n     biomedical research missions of Skylab in the early 1970's \n     and two Spacelab Life Sciences missions aboard the Space \n     Shuttle stand out as exceptions. Future Spacelab missions \n     such as Neurolab, a joint mission with the National Institute \n     of Health to be launched in 1998--and expanding collaboration \n     with Russia on Shuttle-Mir missions will give researchers \n     greater opportunities to solve the mysteries of space \n     deconditioning and aging.\n\n  Mr. President, NASA has a book published by some of its most notable \nphysicians. The book is called ``Space Physiology and Medicine.'' And \nit is a great book. It describes the changes that have come up in space \nflight with the different astronauts. And they have come up with a list \nof 55--55 different areas where there are changes on the human body \nthat occur in space. It is a long list. It is in that book.\n  I did a little research on my own. We came up with some very similar \nfindings, as a matter of fact. I had the Merck Manual of Geriatrics. \nEveryone is familiar with the Merck Manual that almost every doctor has \non his or her desk as a reference work. It is the definitive reference \nwork. It has been\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\npublished, I think, for over 100 years now, the Merck Manual.\n  Just a few years ago, back in the 1980's, Merck started putting out \nthe Merck Manual of Geriatrics. It is one where it gives all the same \nthings that apply to the regular Merck Manual for normal-aged people. \nBut this one book has a different emphasis to it. In the index they \nhave, for instance, ``disequilibrium of aging,'' one I just happen to \nturn to here. The book gives a great number of things where changes in \nthe human body occur with aging. And they note them here and the \neffects of them.\n  What we did is go through the NASA book on space physiology and \nmedicine and compare it with the Merck Manual where there is a special \nrelationship to aging and the human body. We came up with some \nsimilarities that are excellent. I mentioned some of them a moment ago.\n  But there are 10 very basic areas we think should be looked into and \ncan be looked into that can give us not only better control for the \ndeterioration that occurs in the human body in space, but perhaps even \nmore importantly for those almost 44 million people I mentioned who are \nover 60 years of age, these things, if we do more research on them, can \napply to a better senior citizen life expectancy here on Earth. And \nthat to me is exciting. That is something to really look into and find \nout. I am of an age where I could probably benefit from some of that, \nand so are some 44 million other Americans. And that list is growing \nall the time. As I said, over the next 50 years or so that number is \nexpected to double up to almost 100 million people.\n  Listen to these for just a moment. These are physiological changes \nthat are referred not only in the Merck Manual, but also in the \nexperience of astronauts in space as recorded in the space physiology \nbook.\n  First, bone density. What happens? Net loss of bone density in both \nthe normal age process where it is irreversible as far as we know now, \nand during space flight where when they come back to Earth it is \nreversible. What causes this? What is the mechanism that triggers \nchanges in bone density? What can lead us to breakthroughs in the \ntreatment of osteoporosis? Are there some similarities here where we \ncan make some experiments on the elderly and on astronauts in space? If \nwe had an older person go up in space, would that breakdown in the bone \nbe in addition to what has already occurred just because that person \nhad become elderly? We do not know the answer to that yet. But I think \nwe should be finding out.\n  Second area, orthostatic tolerance, the difference in blood pressure \nmeasured when standing or sitting. How the lower extremities and the \nabdominal area react to the changing role of gravity as you stand up. \nOrthostatic tolerance decreases during and after flight in space before \nreturning to normal. It takes several days before astronauts, when they \ncome back from space, feel normal again. But it is a symptom that, once \nit occurs in the elderly, they may have to live with it the rest of \ntheir lives. So research into neurosensory mechanisms that control this \nadaptation could lead to cures for motion sickness and help prevent \nfalls, a very major factor with the elderly.\n  Another area, balance and vestibular problems. Dizziness and the \ninability to maintain balance is common in the elderly and astronauts \nreturning from space flight. Research could lead to advances in \ntreatment of patients with walking disorders or posture disorders of a \nneurological origin.\n\n  Sleep disturbances. Fragmented sleep and early wakening are common \nproblems in space flight and aging. That is, disruption of the human \ncircadian rhythm I mentioned a few moments ago. Learning how to control \nthe circadian rhythm will improve quality of life for the elderly as \nwell as others with sleep disorders or schedule changes.\n  Muscle strength. Decreases during and after space flight before \nreturning to normal, and decreases with aging, just across the board in \ngeneral. What causes this? Understanding the mechanism for muscle \nweakening and developing treatments can benefit patients with prolonged \nbed rest, as an example.\n  Immunology. I find this absolutely fascinating, and the portent of \nthis or the possibility of what research in this area may bring--I do \nnot think we can predict what it might be. The normal aging process in \nspace flight depresses the human immune response. Now, what triggers \nthis? Why is that triggered in someone in the weightlessness of space \nflight for a few days? What causes it in the elderly here on Earth \nwhere they become less immune to certain diseases? Since these immune \nsystem changes are similar, I think it is just an ideal opportunity \nthat exists to better understand how the elderly fight infection, \ncancer, AIDS in younger people, across the board. We are talking about \none of the most basic things in the human body, that the immune system \nchanges its response. The immune system changes its response in the \nelderly but is triggered off in younger, healthy people that go into \nspace. Now, say we send someone into space. In an elderly person would \nthat change in immunology be in addition to what they have already \nexperienced just by growing older here on Earth, or would they be \nimmune from further changes induced by microgravity? We do not know the \nanswer yet. Maybe we will someday.\n  To me, that is one of the most exciting areas of all because it opens \nup the thought of so many other areas and the potential is enormous. \nWhat if all of our elderly people here on Earth could do something that \nwould let them continue their immune response that they had in their \nyounger years? What if they can find a way to stimulate the immunology \nof young people who may be at risk for AIDS or cancer or whatever? This \nto me is a very, very exciting area to look into.\n  Drug and nutrient absorption. Reduced absorption of medicine and \nnutrients in the stomach and gut evidenced during space flight and also \nsuspected with many elderly where medicines do not have the same effect \nthey are expected to have. Space flight research may increase awareness \nof changing nutrient and pharmaceutical needs of the elderly.\n  Cardiac electrical activity increases PR interval and QT interval in \nspace flight and aging. What effect this may have or the impact it may \nhave is not clear, but it certainly is an area for further research.\n  Serum glucose postflight increases and it increases with aging. The \nimplication of this, once again, is not clear.\n  Reflexes, particularly Achilles tendon reflex. Reflex duration is \ndecreased after flight for astronauts coming back. We do not know why. \nFor a while, until they readapt to their Earth environment, their \nreflexes change. Now, that also occurs with the elderly. It may be \ndiminished or even absent as a reflex in the elderly. All of these \nthings are areas where we have seen changes in the elderly as well as \nwith those who are on space flight.\n\n  Mr. President, I think these areas are exciting areas to look into. \nIn a life science project that NASA has and is planning they are \nlooking into these areas. I know that the Administrator, Dan Goldin at \nNASA, is interested in this area. I have talked to him about some of \nthe similarities in these areas and he is very interested in seeing \nthat these things are looked into. Exactly how that will be done is \nunder some discussion right now. These are areas that obviously have \nenormous potential benefits for people right here on Earth.\n  Mr. President, let me go into some of the other areas of NASA that I \nwant to talk about for a little while this afternoon. Curiosity is at \nthe heart of all research. Who are we going to see as being responsible \nfor establishing a curious attitude, the curious mind of those, say, in \nthe class of 2015 or 2025? The Government's responsibility, as I see \nit, is to fund long-term basic research that is not being done or \ncannot be done by anyone in private corporations here on Earth and be \nconducted on the space station. Certainly no company is going to invest \nsignificantly in that particular area.\n  The CRS report discussing case studies of federally sponsored \nresearch is interesting. Mr. President, the Congressional Research \nService has recently published a report which examines some case \nstudies of federally-sponsored research and development activities. \nWhile these are not directly related with the space station, I want to \ncite some of these as examples where curiosity or some inquiry into the \nunknown--that has been an American trade ever since our founding\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\ndays--has led on to things that were undreamed of when they started \nout.\n  Some of the examples discussed in the report indicate that we do not \nalways know what the outcome or benefit will be from research, but \nthese examples clearly demonstrate federally-sponsored research in \nthese areas can change the way we live. I want to make clear, as CRS \nstresses, it is often difficult to extrapolate findings from particular \ncases to support for other types of research. The point I wish to make \nis that basic research can have unforeseen and unintended benefits.\n  Here are some of the examples cited by CRS: Titanium, in common use \ntoday, until the 1940's the titanium industry did not exist because \nnobody knew how to convert titanium ore into metal of a high-quality \nproduct. Intense Government involvement surmounted this technological \nbarrier and allowed the industry to grow. Like so many research \nprograms, early applications of titanium were for military use. \nHowever, commercial use of titanium now is three times that of the \nmilitary.\n  The Internet: As most people now know, the predecessor to the \nInternet was created in the late 1960's to establish a secure and \nreliable communications network between the DOD and universal \nresearchers. Out of this early narrow application has evolved today an \nentirely new media form which will possibly impact our lives as much as \nthe development of the telephone or television.\n  The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the $25 cowling: \nNACA, NASA's predecessor, was involved with the federally-sponsored \nresearch effort to improve America's international standing in aviation \nand aeronautics back in that time. One of the first major successes in \nthe 1920's was development of a cowling around aircraft engines, the \nhousing which surrounds it. In 1928, NACA announced test results that \nshowed if a $25 cowling was installed on existing aircraft, then the \npossible annual savings in fuel and associated costs could amount to \nmore than $5 million. In addition, one of the first aircraft equipped \nwith an NACA-designed cowling set a new cross-country record, allowing \nthe maximum speed of the aircraft to be increased by more than 10 \npercent.\n  Food processing control is another example. In the early days of the \nspace program, NASA wrestled with the question of how and what to feed \nastronauts. They were aided in this effort by researchers from \nPillsbury, working on a Government contract. A major issue that had to \nbe overcome was to develop assurances against bacteria contamination.\n  Pillsbury responded to this problem by developing the hazard analysis \nand critical control point, HACCP, concept, which was designed to \nprevent food safety problems rather than catch them after they had \noccurred. Pillsbury used the HACCP process to manufacture food that \nwent to the moon with the Apollo spacecraft. Subsequently, this system \nwas incorporated in the Food and Drug Administration regulation on \ncanned foods and has since become industry practice and provides for \nsafety for food that our producers here can now ship all over the \nworld.\n  Compact disc technology. Compact discs have made a substantial impact \nthroughout our economy--in education, music, and computer systems. Not \nmany people know this technology was originally developed from R \nsponsored by the Air Force, who were looking for better data storage \nsystems for the strategic bomber force. Air Force research in this area \nsuccessfully demonstrated the concept in the early seventies, but it \nwas not until the mid 1980's that CD's became the commercial success \nthat they are today.\n  Of course, with any research, there is no guarantee of the greatness \nof discovery. Arthur Compton, a Nobel Prize physicist, noted:\n\n       Every great discovery I ever made, I gambled that the truth \n     was there and then I acted on it in faith until I could prove \n     its existence.\n\n  From Eli Whitney to Thomas Edison, great Americans have pursued \nresearch leading to vast improvements in the quality of the American \nway of life. I am convinced that research conducted on the \ninternational space station will impact our lives in a manner \ncomparable to the other research programs I have mentioned.\n  Today I want to discuss for a little while the type of research that \nwill be conducted on the international space station and discuss the \nresearch currently being done on the space shuttle. As I talk about \nthis research, I want to emphasize what the benefits of the research \nhave been, or could be, for those of us right here on Earth. Then I \nwould like to discuss a particularly promising area of research, and \nthat was the one I mentioned before that involves the very similarities \nof aging and space flight.\n  Space station research areas. The following is a list of some of the \nfields to be explored aboard the space station: Biotechnology, which is \nvery promising. While some significant advances have been made in \nmicrogravity research aboard the space shuttle, many projects need a \nsustained microgravity environment in order to obtain any useful \nresult. For example--and this is a very promising--protein crystal \ngrowth projects, conducted in microgravity, have resulted in new cancer \ndrugs, among other pharmaceutical breakthroughs. However, the longest \nshuttle mission has only been 17 days. Often, this is not long enough \nto grow adequate crystals for drug research and production. A sustained \nmicrogravity environment provided by the space station could lead to \nnew weapons in the fight against such things as cancer, AIDS, and other \nterminal illnesses. I find that very exciting.\n  In talking to some of the people at NASA who are dealing with these \nareas, they say that some day a Nobel Prize will be given for some of \nthe breakthroughs that are imminent. I think that is entirely possible.\n  Private industry is working with NASA's Center for Macromolecular \nCrystallography to produce high-quality protein crystals for new drug \ndevelopment. Drug companies such as Scherring Plough, Eli-Lilly, \nUpjohn, Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Smith Kline Beecham, Biocryst, Dupont \nMerck, Eastman Kodak, and Vertex are using protein crystals to research \ncancer, diabetes, emphysema, and immune system disorders, including the \nHIV virus. That is exciting to me because you cannot develop crystals \nof this purity or size here on Earth because of the ``G'' environment. \nIn space, they grow differently, larger, and you can separate them out, \nand they grow more pure than on Earth. It opens up new fields of \napplication for pharmaceutical breakthroughs. You can only do that in a \nlengthy period of time on the space station. To me, the potential in \nthat area alone is worth everything that we are thinking about spending \non the space station.\n\n  Another area is mammalian tissue culture. Consider that field. The \npurpose of tissue culturing is to replicate what goes on inside the \nbody, but in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, several factors \nconspire to limit the size and the shape of tissue cultures in a normal \nEarth-bound lab.\n  For example, tissue cultures are extremely sensitive to shear forces \ncaused by fluid flow. Microgravity provides a reduced stress \nenvironment, which allows much larger tissue masses to develop. Tissues \ngrown in a microgravity environment not only grow large, but they \nresemble what actually happens in the body. They would no longer settle \nat the bottom of a Petri dish in a lab. You would develop that tissue \nculture much as it would occur here on Earth in a human body where it \nis in a 3D environment. Clearly, the more accurate and living model we \nhave, the more accurate the results of any experiment that is done with \nthe model. This branch of research is particularly promising for cancer \nresearch. That is actively underway, and it has been on the space \nshuttle and will be to a greater degree on the space station.\n  Materials science. The space station will play an integral role in \nthis research area. The zero-gravity environment available in the space \nstation will allow scientists to study how gravity influences the \ncrystal growth process I mentioned, and the primary offshoot of \ncrystalline growth can also be polymer production. Polymers are long \nchains of organic molecules used in everything from nylon and polyester \nto the plastics found in cars and medical implants. With breakthroughs \nin this area, the impact could be enormous.\n  Life sciences. Variable gravitational fields are an excellent \nresearch tool in addressing fundamental biological\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\nquestions. Cell response to external forces results in changes in gene \nexpression and protein synthesis. By studying cells in microgravity, \nresearchers hope to better understand how such basic cell functions are \ncarried out. This is the first step in learning how to improve care for \ngenetic disorders and other cell imbalance problems.\n  Space physiology. Microgravity research also helps improve our \nunderstanding of bodily systems. From the basic functions of the heart \nand lungs to the complex neurosystems controlling balance, perception \nand cognition, information gathered from space station research will \nimprove health care on Earth. For example, astronauts lose bone and \nmuscle mass in microgravity. In learning to treat these flight \nproblems, scientists have uncovered new insights into osteoporosis and \naging. With continued microgravity experiments, it is possible \nthat researchers could minimize some of the debilitating effects of \naging.\n\n  Technology and engineering. Not only will the space station help \nimprove human life on Earth, but it will also contribute to a more \nenergy-efficient future. The microgravity environment of the space \nstation will allow scientists to study combustion processes. Improved \ncombustion efficiency leads to improved energy conservation. Just a 2-\npercent increase in burner efficiency for heaters would save the United \nStates $8 billion per year. Advances in combustion research have \nalready occurred on the shuttle. They have been working on that on \nseveral flights already.\n  Fluid physics experiments will be also conducted aboard the space \nstation. By studying fluid behavior, scientists hope to improve their \nunderstanding of important activities from energy production to \nmaterials engineering.\n  Recent shuttle research. Mr. President, one of the challenges in \ndescribing the benefits of NASA research is explaining how it affects \nour everyday lives. Too often when scientific issues come to this \nfloor, my colleagues become afflicted with that unfortunate condition \nwe are all familiar with known as MEGO--My eyes glaze over. Today, I \nhope to relate recent scientific findings from the space shuttle \nprogram in an easily understandable fashion so that we can understand \nwhat our significant investments in this program are yielding. I would \nlike to spend a few minutes describing some of the research conducted \non three recent shuttle flights. This discussion is relevant because \nthe research and experiments I will discuss are examples of the type of \nresearch that will be conducted on the space station.\n  One of the missions up a short time ago was the life and microgravity \nsciences mission, STS-78. Earlier this month the astronauts on flight \nSTS-78, also called the Life and Microgravity Sciences, or LMS, \nmission, returned to Earth after a record-setting 17-day mission.\n  During this mission a number of important experiments were conducted \nthat could lead to new breakthroughs in our understanding of disease, \nhow it occurs, the aging process, as well as basic research in \nmaterials formation.\n  Musculoskeletal tests: Research conducted in this area could help \nscientists develop measures to reduce in-flight muscle atrophy and also \nfight certain muscle diseases and osteoporosis on Earth.\n  Metabolic experiments: These experiments involved the crew collecting \nfluid and calcium tracer samples throughout the flight to help \ninvestigators measure bone loss and changes in metabolism.\n  Circadian rhythm and sleep study: This study examined the crew's \nbrain waves, eye movement and muscle movement during sleep. Results of \nthis study may also benefit people on Earth by helping people whose \nsleep schedule suffers from shift changes or jet lag.\n  Neuroscience experiments: These experiments examine the crew's \nadaptation to microgravity in regard to balance and spatial \norientation. What is learned in this area could lead to developments to \ncombat motion sickness in cars, boats or aircraft--as well as in space.\n  Advanced gradient heating facility: Six individual experiments were \nrun that examined solidification of alloys and crystals. The benefits \nof this research could lead to improvements in the way semiconductors \nare manufactured. And that would be an enormous step forward.\n  The bubble, drop, and particle unit: A dozen experiments were \nconducted to examine how gas bubbles and liquid drops interact during \nheating. Research gathered from experiments completed could lead to \nadvances in material processing on Earth, including the development of \nnew types of glass and ceramics.\n\n\n                            usmps-3--sts-75\n\n  In March of this year, seven astronauts aboard the shuttle Columbia, \non flight STS-75, returned to Earth. This flight included two \nastronauts from the European Space Agency--thus demonstrating that \ninternational cooperation is working well with the shuttle program. One \nof the successes of that flight was the research conducted using the \nU.S. microgravity payload (USMP-3). Using four major experiments on \nsupport trusses in Columbia's  payload bay, the astronauts and \nresearchers on the ground, studied the formation of solids and liquids \nin microgravity. Much of the work conducted on USMP-3 will help \ncalibrate and improve the research done on the space station--thus \nenabling station researchers to more quickly begin more productive \nresearch.\n  Basic research was also conducted with USMP-3. On an experiment \ndubbed ``Zeno'' researchers were able to identify the precise critical \npoint of the element xenon. The critical point or temperature is that \nprecise point when an element is in a liquid and gas phase at the same \ntime. This research goal was achieved by lowering the xenon sample's \ntemperature and pressure in increments of a millionth of a degree. \nBecause gravity on Earth causes mixing of samples that destabilizes \nthem as they near the critical point, this is research that simply \ncannot be conducted on Earth.\n  This is basic research. It is not immediately clear what scientists \nmight learn from this experiment. What is clear is that researchers now \nhave a more fundamental understanding of what happens when materials \nchange from one phase to another. This insight could lead to \nbreakthroughs in superconductivity or magnetism. I ask unanimous \nconsent that an article discussing this experiment that appeared in \nScience News be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Science News, Vol. 149, Apr. 20, 1996]\n\n                      Creeping to a Critical Point\n\n                          (By Ivars Peterson)\n\n       When the space shuttle Columbia touched down at NASA's \n     Kennedy Space Center in Orlando, Fla. on March 9, it returned \n     a remarkable instrument to Earth. Designed to monitor laser \n     light scattered by a dense, compressed gas teetering on the \n     brink of turning into a liquid, this precision apparatus had \n     operated continuously in space for more than 14 days.\n       During this time, researchers had relayed dozens of \n     instructions to the equipment, controlling the temperature of \n     an ultrapure, high-pressure sample of xenon to millionths of \n     a degree. By taking advantage of a setting in which the \n     effects of gravity do not obscure details of a material's \n     activity, they could bring the xenon sample excruciatingly \n     close to its critical temperature--the point at which its \n     liquid and gas phases coexist and blend into one.\n       Robert W. Gammon of the Institute for Physical Science and \n     Technology at the University of Maryland in College Park and \n     head of the research team dubbed this project the Zeno \n     experiment in honor of the philosopher of ancient Greece who \n     pondered the paradox of traveling a finite distance in steps \n     that became vanishingly small.\n       The recent shuttle experiment represented the culmination \n     of years of work by a large group of scientists, students, \n     engineers, and technicians at the University of Maryland, \n     NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ball Aerospace in \n     Boulder, Colo., and several other organizations.\n       ``No other microgravity instrument has logged as many hours \n     as the Zeno experiment,'' says R. Allen Wilkinson of the \n     space experiments division at Lewis. ``It's gone through two \n     launches and two landings, and it's gone through hundreds of \n     hours of operation in orbit and more than 10,000 hours of \n     testing on the ground.\n       ``That's an impressive reliability record,'' he insists.\n       The data provided by this instrument brought researchers \n     closer to a fundamental understanding of what happens when \n     materials change from one phase to another, whether from gas \n     to liquid, from ordinary conductor of electricity to \n     superconductor, or from nonmagnet to magnet.\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\n       In particular, Gammon, project scientist Jeffrey N. \n     Shaumeyer of Maryland, and their team observed with \n     unprecedented clarity xenon's behavior as the gas hovered \n     within microkelvins of its critical temperature of 289.72 \n     kelvins, or about 16.7 deg.C.\n       The physical state of a material depends on its temperature \n     and pressure. For instance, at sea level pressure on Earth, \n     water exists as a liquid at temperatures between 0 deg.C and \n     100 deg.C. When the temperature goes above 100 deg.C, it \n     changes phase to become a vapor. During this phase \n     transition, the material's density decreases considerably.\n       By increasing the pressure, it's possible to raise water's \n     boiling point while increasing the vapor's density. At \n     sufficiently high temperature and pressure, the difference in \n     density between the liquid and vapor phases diminishes to \n     zero. At temperatures within millikelvins of this critical \n     point, the fluid fluctuates rapidly between liquid and vapor, \n     creating density waves.\n       These density fluctuations scatter light, making the fluid \n     appear milky instead of clear and colorless. This phenomenon \n     is known as critical opalescence.\n       On Earth, it's difficult to observe the details of these \n     fluctuations because the fluid's own weight compresses part \n     of the sample, distorting the waves. In orbit, where the \n     apparent force of gravity is only one-millionth as strong as \n     it is on the ground, such distortions disappear.\n       For their experiment, Gammon and his team used a sample of \n     pressurized xenon only 100 micrometers thick. By shining \n     laser light into the sample, they could monitor how the \n     density fluctuations scattered light, making the sample look \n     like a twinkling star.\n       As the sample temperature approaches the critical point, \n     ``those twinkles get slower and slower and more and more \n     intense,'' Gammon says.\n       By watching these trends, the researchers could readily \n     monitor how closely the xenon had crept to its critical state \n     as they slowly and systematically manipulated the \n     temperature. They had to be extremely careful not to step \n     through the critical point itself.\n       ``If we had made a temperature error and gone through too \n     large a step too quickly, we would have messed the sample \n     up,'' Gammon says.\n       On its first shuttle flight, in March 1994, the instrument \n     allowed the researchers to make measurements to within 100 \n     microkelvins of the critical temperature.\n       ``The outstanding performance of the Zeno instrument during \n     the mission gave a fine demonstration of the possibility of \n     making high-precision materials measurements in low gravity, \n     as well as the power of a flexible, ground-commanded \n     experiment,'' the research team concluded in its report on \n     the first run.\n       Two years later, having learned how to control temperature \n     changes considerably more carefully, the researchers put the \n     Zeno experiment back on board space shuttle Columbia for a \n     second try (SN:3/16/96, p. 165).\n       ``For 14 days, we worked our way up to more and more \n     intense fluctuations, and on the last day, we scanned across \n     and actually saw the transition more sharply than I have ever \n     seen it,'' Gammon says.\n       Beyond the transition, as the sample cooled further, it \n     began breaking apart into separate phases, with drops of \n     liquid forming within the vapor and pockets of vapor forming \n     within the liquid to create a kind of fog.\n       ``The transition was really there, right where we projected \n     it would be,'' Gammon observes. ``We could locate the \n     transition to about 10 microkelvins.\n       ``You can't see it this way on the ground,'' he says. ``It \n     was a delightful conclusion to the 2-week experiment.''\n       There are no more flights planned for the Zeno experiment. \n     To get even closer to the transition point and to get more \n     detailed data, the researchers need more than 14 days in \n     space: It takes longer than that for tiny temperature \n     differences across the sample to even out. ``We're still \n     struggling with equilibration issues in the microgravity \n     environment,'' Wilkinson notes.\n       ``There's more to be learned,'' he adds. ``But the \n     experiments would be very difficult and require a lot more \n     time.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Another interesting experiment conducted on USMP-3 is \ncalled the isothermal dendritic growth experiment. Dendrites are tiny \ncrystalline structures formed from molten materials as these materials \nsolidify. The size, shape, and orientation of the dendrites determine \nthe strength and durability of steel, aluminum, and superalloys used in \nautomobiles and airplanes. This experiment was designed to test \nassumptions concerning the effect of gravity driven fluid flows on \ndendritic formation. What is learned from this experiment could have an \nimpact on such major industrial processes as alloy and steel \nmanufacturing.\n\n\n                             usml-2--sts-73\n\n  Last November the shuttle flight STS-73 returned to Earth thus \nconcluding the space-based portion of the second U.S. microgravity \nlaboratory flight [USML-2]. On board the shuttle were a number of \nsophisticated scientific instruments to explore biological, chemical, \nand materials sciences in microgravity. The experiments carried aboard \nUSML-2 include the following:\n  Advanced protein crystallization facility: This facility can grow \ncrystals three different ways. By growing larger, more highly ordered \ncrystals, scientists may be able to better understand biological \nprocesses, leading to advances in medicine and agriculture.\n  Astroculture facility: This facility is designed to support growth of \nplants and to study how starch accumulation in plants is affected by \nthe microgravity environment.\n  Commercial generic bioprocessing apparatus: This research tool allows \na variety of experiments to be performed in the area of biomedical \ntesting and drug development, ecological systems development, and \nbiomaterials products and processes.\n  Crystal growth furnace: This furnace is also used for crystal growth \nexperiments. It can process multiple large samples at temperatures \nabove 1,000 degrees Celsius.\n  Drop physics module: This experiments has been developed so that \nscientists can study several fluid physics phenomena: a simple surface, \nsuch as the sphere formed by a liquid drop in the absence of gravity; \nhow a drop reacts to different forces: and how surfaces and compound \ndrops--a drop in one liquid surrounding a drop of a different liquid--\ninteract.\n  These are important things and what they can learn here from \nmanufacturing processes and for laboratory experiments right here on \nEarth.\n  Geophysical fluid flow cell: The purpose of this experiment is to \nstudy how fluids move in microgravity as a means of understanding fluid \nflow in oceans, the atmosphere--even stars.\n  Glovebox: The glove box is used for a variety of experiments, and \nenables hazardous or toxic materials to be incorporated in experiments, \nwhile they are isolated from the general environment in the lab.\n  Space acceleration measurement systems: This equipment enables \nscientists to accurately measure the microgravity environment on the \nshuttle to better calibrate experiments and design experiments for the \nstation.\n  Surface tension driven convention experiment: This experiment will \nallow scientists to investigate the basic fluid mechanics and heat \ntransfer of thermocapillary flows generated by temperature variations \nalong free surfaces of liquids in low gravity.\n  Zeolite crystal growth experiment: Zeolite crystals are used in the \nchemical process industry as filters, catalysts, and adsorbents. The \npurpose of this experiment is to understand zeolite crystallization and \ngrowth so as to achieve high yields of large nearly perfect crystals in \nspace, something that cannot be done here on Earth.\n  What can be learned from all of this? Why am I going through all of \nthese technical terms here? What good is it? Let me talk about that a \nmoment.\n  Knowledge gained from USML-2 research could lead to:\n  Custom tailored drugs, made possible by determining structures of \nproteins involved in diseases, and then designing drugs to disrupt \nspecific protein;\n  Faster, more efficient and less costly semiconductors for high speed \ndigital circuits, solid state lasers, and infrared detectors;\n  A new form of drug delivery: injecting a disease fighting cell into \nthe body, protected by a polymer outer shell developed in space;\n  Improved crude oil recovery, environmental cleanup and synthetic drug \nproduction, based on better knowledge of how chemicals alter the \nsurface properties of liquids;\n  Sophisticated materials production by controlling unwanted fluid \nflows in molten materials and welding;\n  More accurate weather forecasts, as improved computer models of \natmospheric fluid behavior and in predicting ocean flows and weather \npatterns;\n  Implants, such as synthetic skin and blood vessels for burn victims, \nbased on commercial research into biological materials;\n  Less expensive gasoline, by improving zeolite crystals used to crack \ncrude oil into refined petroleum;\n  Stronger, more easily shaped ceramics from insights into how the \nmicroscopic structures of solids form; and\n  More efficient fuel use and pollution control, derived from a better \nunderstanding of the combustion process.\n  Mr. President, any one of those items I just mentioned as possible \nbenefits\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\nout of this research going into space--just one breakthrough in any one \nor two of those areas--would make the whole space station program worth \nevery penny that we are going to spend on it.\n  USML-2 technologies are already being used on Earth. For example, \ndevices for early detection of cataracts, based on laser light \nscattering instruments developed for USML-2 investigations.\n  These are already being used right now.\n  Efficient lighting systems for large commercial nurseries, designed \nfor the space plant growth chamber.\n  These are already in the news.\n  Let me talk for a little while about another issue, the bioreactor.\n  Growing tissue samples--so-called tissue culture--is one of the \nfundamental goals of biomedical research.\n  Scientists use laboratory containers called bioreactors to grow or \nculture samples of body tissues. Scientists could use cancer tumors and \nother tissues that are successfully grown outside the body to test and \nstudy treatments, like chemotherapy, for instance, without risking harm \nto patients, if we were able to do this. These tissues from bioreactors \nwill also offer important medical insights into how tissues grow and \ndevelop in the body.\n  NASA engineers have already created breakthrough technologies for \ncell culture research on the ground and major breakthroughs can be \nexpected once time on the space station becomes available.\n  For example, NASA developed bioreactors have already produced the \nfirst 80-day lung culture, the first normal human intestine culture, \nand major breakthroughs in the quality of ovarian cancer tumor \ncultures. Though superior tissues may be grown in some Earth bound \nbioreactors, when compared with traditional sell culturing techniques, \nthere are still limits to the size and quality of the tissue. Many \nscientists believe that far superior tissues can be grown in the \nextended microgravity afforded on the space station and preliminary \ntests on the space station support this idea.\n  Mr. President, when we do these experiments in a laboratory here on \nEarth, we are still affected by gravity so that experiments that are \ndone in a Petri dish or whatever the experimental laboratory piece of \nequipment may be, you still have difficulty in that tissue does not \ngrow in its normal way that it would if it was in a 3-D environment in \nthe body. And with the bioreactor in space that kind of growth is \npossible and has already occurred on the first experiments so we then \ncan have a culture, a tissue culture that is more like what occurs in \nthe real human body.\n  In the long term, tissues cultured outside the body may be used \ndirectly even for replacing damaged tissues, treating diseases, or \neventually perhaps sometime even replacing organs.\n  Let me give a few highlights of recent research.\n  Dr. Jeanne Becker of the University of South Florida has applied NASA \ntechnology to create a breakthrough in culturing ovarian cancer tumors \nfor cancer research.\n  Dr. Josh Zimmerberg of the NIH National Institute for Child Health \nand Human Development is using NASA-developed bioreactors and NASA-\nfunded resident technical staff to pursue AIDS research goals under a \n1994 to 1998 NASA-NIH joint venture. And I would add that the NASA and \nNIH have 18, I believe there are, memoranda of agreement--they are \ncooperative agreements in any event back and forth--to work in this \narea of how the studies of NIH and NASA can be correlated together to \nget the maximum effect.\n  Dr. Lisa Freed of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is using \na NASA bioreactor to grow cartilage cells on biodegradable scaffolds. \nHer work shows a clear prospect for using the space station to produce \nmodels and transplantable cartilage tissues that could revolutionize \ntreatment for joint diseases and injuries.\n  STS-70 in July 1995. In July 1995, a NASA bioreactor flew to orbit \naboard the space shuttle Discovery, and the primary purpose of this \nexperiment was to test the performance of the bioreactor which worked \nsuccessfully.\n  Poorly differentiated human colon carcinoma cells were grown in a \nbioreactor aboard the space shuttle Discovery and their growth was \ncompared with that of similar cells in a bioreactor in normal gravity \nas well as in conventional two dimensional tissue cultures. The space \ngrown clusters of cells were approximately two times larger than the \nground-based samples but the significance of this must be determined \nyet by much study on the ground and many more data points from space \nexperiments.\n\n  Ground-based analyses by Dr. J. Milburn Jessup of the Harvard Medical \nSchool will address the histology of the preserved tissue specimens and \nthe production of specific proteins such as CEA.\n  The NASA-NIH agreement on biomedical research, let me talk about that \nfor a moment. NASA and the National Institutes of Health recently have \nsigned an agreement that will combine the unique talents and experience \nof both agencies in biomedical research and exploit NASA's bioreactor \ntechnology to produce fully three-dimensional tissue cultures for \nlaboratory research. This agreement will increase the capabilities of \nbiomedical researchers throughout NIH by transferring NASA technology \nto NIH and establishing a center within the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Development. The new center will teach this new \ntechnology to hundreds of neighboring NIH intermural laboratories that \ncurrently employ other tissue culture techniques as part of their \nongoing research. The initial goal of the agreement is to engineer a \nhuman lymph node model for AIDS research and then to extend the use of \nthis technology to a broad spectrum of tissues available at the NIH. \nThis collaborative effort will enable researchers to culture tissues \npreviously deemed too complex for current tissue culturing technology.\n  To accelerate the development of this critical tissue culturing \ntechnology, research grants were recently awarded under a NASA research \nannouncement. Included in the selections are support for two research \ncenters located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in \nCambridge and the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia that will transfer \nthe NASA bioreactor technology for culturing three-dimensional tissues \nto university researchers. These centers expand the pace of technology \ntransfer in the biotechnology areas begun when NASA and NIH established \na joint cooperative program within the NIH's Institute of Child Health \nand Human Development to exploit the NASA-developed bioreactor \ntechnology.\n  Protein crystal growth. Data from space to revolutionize \npharmaceuticals in the 21st century.\n  Rapid advances in biotechnology combined with enhanced data from \nprotein structures promise to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry \nin this country--indeed, around the world. Researchers seek to define \nthe structures of proteins and ultimately to design drugs that interact \nwith them. Penicillin is a well-known example of a drug that works by \nblocking a protein's function. In order to define protein structures \nwith precision, researchers analyze protein crystals. Unfortunately, \nmany Earth-grown crystals have flaws that limit their usefulness as \ndata sources or are too small to provide adequate data.\n  Orbital experiments provide researchers with superior protein \ncrystals for analysis and they also help scientists understand the \nfundamental concepts about the crystallization process. This \ninformation can be used to improve crystallization techniques here on \nEarth. Researchers will soon be able to use enhanced data on protein \nstructure derived from space station research to design a whole new \ngeneration of drugs to target a long list of specific diseases.\n\n  Once again, if we didn't have anything come out of the space station \nexcept advances in this particular area, it would be worth far more \nthan anything we are spending on it.\n  Rationally designed drugs promise to revolutionize health care, and \norbital research will feed this revolution with the crucial protein \nstructure data it needs. NASA researchers have already used space \nshuttle missions to produce protein crystals for a variety of clinical \nconditions including cancer, diabetes, emphysema, and immune system \ndisorders.\n  Let me start that sentence again. They have already used space \nshuttle\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nmissions to produce protein crystals for a variety of purposes. These \nspace-grown crystals were far superior to any crystals grown on Earth \nfor revealing the structure of proteins and supporting the development \nof drugs.\n  Recombinant DNA human insulin. The Hauptman Institute of Buffalo, in \ncollaboration with Eli Lilly, has obtained an improved description of \nhuman insulin-drug complex based on space-grown crystals. They are \ncurrently working on the design of a nontoxic drug that will bind \ninsulin, thereby improving the treatment of diabetic patients.\n\n  Porcine elastase. Elastase is a protein which is involved in \nemphysema. The refined structure of this protein was obtained using \nspace-grown crystals. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is designing drugs based \non this data to improve treatment for emphysema.\n  HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. NASA is supporting the microgravity \ncrystallization of HIV reverse transcriptase. That is a critical enzyme \nfor viral replication. It is believed this research will better define \nthe enzyme structure, so that effective pharmaceuticals can be \ndeveloped to inhibit the HIV virus.\n  What could be more important than looking into that?\n  The structural biology space program at NASA's Center in Excellence \nin Biotechnology was the first to publish a structure of a major human \nantibody that recognizes the AIDS virus. That was a breakthrough.\n  Human serum albumin, HSA. That is a primary binding protein in the \nblood and is responsible for distributing drugs throughout the body. \nEli Lilly and Co. is using this structural information from space-grown \ncrystals to design drugs that exhibit improved interactions with HSA. \nThe potential impact of this HSA structure on drug design and delivery \nis also enormous.\n  Mr. President, that takes us through quite a listing here of some \ntechnical things I thought it was important to get into the Record. Let \nme talk for a moment about the international aspects.\n  Thirteen nations, including the United States, Canada, Italy, \nBelgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Germany, \nUnited Kingdom, Japan, and Russia will join together in the largest \nscientific cooperative program in history. This is the first time this \nnumber of nations has been able to draw together and run this type of \nproject together. Drawing on Russian expertise in long-duration space \nflight and existing Russian technology and equipment, the international \nspace station will help redirect the focus of Russian technology \nprograms to nonmilitary pursuits.\n  Perhaps more important, the space station will serve as a symbol of \nthe opportunities available through peaceful international initiatives. \nThere will be several laboratories aboard the space station. One United \nStates lab, one other United States facility, a European space agency \nColumbus Orbital Facility, a Japanese experiment module, and Russian \nresearch modules. Partner nations will contribute $9 billion to the \nU.S. cooperative effort.\n  International contribution means international cooperation, bringing \ntogether the best scientific minds worldwide to answer fundamental \nscientific questions.\n  Since NASA began, the agency has been very effective. They have \nreached out to the community at large with programs to educate the \naverage U.S. citizen on the contributions of NASA to society. \nAstronauts make thousands of appearances every year all over the world, \nspeaking with people of all ages about their experiences and their \nresearch. Traveling aerospace education units, sponsored by NASA, \nvisited over 500,000 students last year, and tens of thousands of \nstudents participated in urban community enrichment programs to get \nstudents interested in science and mathematics.\n\n  These inspirational efforts are an investment in our future. It is a \nfuture including a fully operational space station. Students here on \nEarth will be able to place experiments on the space station and run \nthose experiments, indeed, from their classrooms. NASA virtual reality \ntechnology will make it possible for students to experience life on the \nspace station without ever leaving their classrooms.\n  Mr. President, these are enormous steps forward. They will only \nbecome reality if we have the space station. I know there are those, \nand we will probably have a vote on it tomorrow sometime, who wish to \nknock out support for the space station. I think that would be \nextremely myopic in our vision of the future. I think the space station \nhas the promise of developing wholesale changes and contributing to the \nchanges in medicine, materials research and all those things I have \ngone through, not in complete detail today because any one of these \nitems could be talked about as long as I have stood here this \nafternoon. But I have tried to hit the high points of some of the \nthings I think are important as to why the space station should \ncontinue into the future.\n  There are some other areas that are less quantifiable, that are a \nlittle less describable. That is how we look at ourselves. Are we \nwilling to put money into this research for the future? If there is one \nthing, it seems to me, we have learned throughout the past in this \ncountry it is that we, more than any other nation on Earth, we have \nbeen the ones who have had the curiosity. We were the ones who did the \nresearch, whether macroresearch or geographical research or \nmicroresearch, going into the laboratory and trying to get down to \ndiscover things at atom size. We have been the Nation that led the \nwhole world in this kind of technology and this research. However every \nsingle time it has not resulted in a home run.\n  But if there is one thing we have learned in the past in this country \nit is that money spent on basic research, the basic fundamental \nbreakthrough type research, is that has usually paid off in the future \nbeyond any possible thing we can imagine at the outset. I think this \nspace station, with its capability to do research in microgravity over \nan extended period of time, has the greatest potential of anything we \nhave come into for a long time.\n  Not only that research, but also just having the space station, and \nhaving space flights, having this kind of research go on, is exciting \nto our young people. I run into kids, young people of grade school, \nhigh school, college age, all the time in my travels around the country \nand back home in Ohio, who are excited about these things. They want to \nknow about it, what it is like. What experiments can they run? They are \nvery interested in it. A lot of them are studying math and science now \nbecause of their interest in these programs. I do not want to take that \nencouragement away. I want to see that encouragement expanded and \ncontinued.\n  I wish we had money enough to send up several space stations. Maybe \nthat would hasten things somewhat. I am realist enough to know that is \nnot about to happen. But these programs have truly been an inspiration \nto our young people. It has given them goals, has given them a vision \nof what we in this country can do. If we can do it in science research \nwhy can we not improve our Government? Why can we not improve our \nrelationships with each other? Why can we not do lots of things?\n  The answer is, we can. This stands as a symbol to our young people of \nencouragement to be curious, to do the research. Not just in this, but \nin a lot of different areas. It is inspirational to our young people \nand I think to those of us who are older also. Because we do see \nourselves leading the world with this technology and leading research. \nWe do not want to lay that kind of lead down. We cannot afford to see \nsome other nation take up that kind of a lead.\n  Being a leader in technology and research is what results in us \nhaving control of our own future. To take any other view of it, to say \nwe will cut this out because we have some other needs, I think would be \nvery shortsighted. Do we have other needs? Of course. Can we provide \nfor some of those other needs? Yes, I think we can. At the same time, \nwe do not want to give up what I think is one of our greatest projects \nfor the future, and that is the space station.\n  Mr. President, we are always faced with the people who say what good \nis it, as though you are supposed to know the results of research in \nadvance. Of course, we have the example of Faraday talking to Disraeli, \nthe British Prime Minister. It has been often quoted. This was in the \nearly dawn of the electrical age, when they had some\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\nsparks jumping from one bottle to another.\n  Disraeli is supposed to have asked Faraday, ``But what good is it?''\n  Faraday's reply was, ``What good is a baby?'' What is the potential? \nWe do not know. Yet, out of that curiosity, that research, came the \nwhole electronic, electrically powered world that we know today, with \nall the benefits and the standard of living and improvements in health \nthat is brought to us and the whole world.\n\n  Another example of this is one I used here on the floor last year. \nDaniel Webster rose in the Senate Chambers, even as we rise and debate \nthis subject every year. Daniel Webster rose back in his day in the \nearly 1800's when they were debating whether to buy some land for the \nGovernment, to acquire some land west of the Mississippi River. Daniel \nWebster was against that. He put into very eloquent words what he \nthought about what good it could possibly be out there.\n  This is what he said referring to that area beyond the Mississippi.\n\n       What do we want with this vast worthless area, this region \n     of savages and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and \n     whirlwinds of dust and cactus and prairie dogs? To what use \n     could we ever hope to put these great deserts or those \n     endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their \n     very base with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with \n     the western coast, a coast of 3,000 miles, rock-bound, \n     cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it? What use have \n     we for this country? Mr. President, I will never vote one \n     cent from the public treasury to place the Pacific coast one \n     inch nearer to Boston than it is now.\n\n  Daniel Webster's quote reminds us that when we are looking to \nterritorial exploration, or whether it be microexploration in the \nlaboratory, or combining the two in research in new places to travel \nand microexperimentation on something like the space station, we really \ncannot predict what may come from that kind of curiosity. Curiosity has \nbuilt this country, how to do things better, how to do things in a \nbetter way, whether it is to establish a better democracy and a better \nrepresentation of the people, how to do industrial research, how to do \ntransportation research, all of these different areas--medical \nresearch--that we lead the world in.\n  I hope that we can have a resounding vote, when the vote comes up, if \nthere are efforts made to cut back on the space station.\n  Mr. President, I have gone on longer than I have before when this \nsubject has come up because I thought it was important this year, in \nsupport for the space station, to just at least name some of these \nareas that I know do have big titles. They are difficult to understand, \nbut they are the scientific research that is the building blocks for \neverything else that happens in our society. I think it is important \nthat we establish very solid support for this program. I yield the \nfloor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank our good friend, the very \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, for his very perceptive and \npersuasive comments about space programs generally and specifically \nabout the space station. No one in this body speaks with more personal \nauthority than Senator Glenn on these very important issues. What he \nhas said is of great importance to all of us. I share his hope that not \nonly all our colleagues, but people throughout this country, will \nlisten to his comments and his heartfelt statements about the \nimportance of space and of scientific inquiry.\n\n\n                        urban search and rescue\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wanted to bring to the chairman's \nattention a fine urban search and rescue team in Lincoln, NE. It was \nthe first team to be recognized by FEMA and has been ongoing since \n1991.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator for bringing that to my attention.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am concerned that the Lincoln team has been \nunderfunded. At the same time, this bill calls for five new teams. Is \nit the Senator's intention to start five new teams prior to adequately \nfunding existing teams?\n  Mr. BOND. I fully support strong urban search and rescue teams, \nespecially in the Midwest. I believe FEMA should move quickly to assure \nan appropriate geographical mix of teams that are funded adequately. \nFurthermore, FEMA should consider decommissioning some teams that do \nnot meet the urban search and rescue programs' high standards.\n  Mr. KERREY. Would the Chairman encourage FEMA to strengthen existing \nMidwest teams, as they start new teams?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n\n\n                      endocrine disrupter research\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank my colleagues for supporting my successful effort last session to \nadd an amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act legislation. The \namendment would establish a new screening program to identify \npesticides and other substances in drinking water that would have an \neffect on humans similar to effects produced by naturally occurring \nestrogen or other endocrine effects. A provision very similar to my \namendment was also included in the bipartisan food safety legislation, \nH.R. 1627, that overwhelmingly passed the Senate last week.\n  These amendments address a growing concern over the effect of \npesticides and other substances on human endocrine systems and their \nability to increase the likelihood of disease, such as breast cancer. \nThe screening program established in these amendments will play an \nimportant role in developing our understanding of the nature of so \ncalled endocrine disrupters and their potential effect on exposed \nindividuals. Given the passage and likely enactment of these \nprovisions, I now want to make sure that there will be sufficient funds \nto implement these testing programs and that the testing programs will \nbe based on the best science available. For this reason, I would like \nto ask my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee responsible for this legislation, whether \nthere are sufficient funds in this bill to cover the anticipated cost \nof developing these screening programs and ensuring that they are based \non the best science available.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from New York for his concern for the \nhealth of the American public. The legislation under consideration does \ninclude funding for basic research on endocrine disrupters. If \nnecessary, the Environmental Protection Agency should consider \nproposing a reprogramming of funds to develop the screening programs \nrequired under the food safety and safe drinking water legislation. I \ndo, however share the Senator's concern that EPA base its testing \nprograms and future regulations on the best science available, \nparticularly as it embarks on relatively new areas of scientific \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleague from Missouri. Given our shared \nconcerns over the importance of the science in this new field of \nscientific inquiry, would it not be appropriate for the Environmental \nProtection Agency to enter into agreement with the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a comprehensive study of both the potential effects \nand the actual and potential exposures of humans to synthetic and \nnaturally occurring hormonally active agents in the environment? The \nstudy could address a number of important issues central to the \ndevelopment of an effective screening program, such as how to select \nand prioritize chemicals and samples for testing, which test or tests \nto include in a screening program, and the most appropriate way to use \nthe resulting information in developing risk estimates.\n\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from New York is correct. Such a study could \nprovide the Agency and the Congress with a comprehensive analysis of \nthe relative risks from both synthetic and naturally occurring \nendocrine disrupters and mixtures of both, as well as the most cost-\neffective way of developing a screening program that identifies \nsubstances of potential concern.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If my colleagues will yield for a moment, I would like to \nendorse the recommendation made by the\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nSenator from New York. Requiring EPA to arrange for the National \nAcademy of Sciences to conduct a full analysis of the science on \nendocrine disrupters will enhance our understanding of this new \npotential environmental threat. While I understand that the Academy's \nBoard on Environmental Studies and Toxicology is already undertaking a \nstudy at the request of the Department of the Interior and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that focuses primarily on wildlife, \ntoxicological mechanisms, and some human effects, this analysis could \nand should be broadened substantially to include a more comprehensive \nanalysis of human exposures, sources of exposure, and the best ways to \nmeasure them, in order to help guide the EPA in developing these \nscreening programs. In addition to comparing the relative risks between \nnatural and synthetic endocrine disrupters and providing information on \nthe proper way to prioritize chemicals and samples for testing, the \nAcademy could also be useful in providing advice on how to use the \nresulting information in making public policy decisions and how to best \ncommunicate the results of any screening and testing program to the \npublic.\n  Mr. FRIST. If my colleagues will yield for an additional comment, I \nwould like to associate myself with the recommendations made by the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Oklahoma. Since joining the \nSenate I have been surprised, as a physician and a lawmaker, with how \nfew of our rules and laws seem to incorporate the best of our current \nscientific understanding, but instead have only political goals in \nmind. Good politics and good science must be combined in the \npromulgation of new rules, standards, and laws. With the \nrecommendations outlined by my colleagues from Missouri, New York, and \nOklahoma, I believe we have the opportunity to have good science and \npossible future regulation necessarily linked, and I commend them for \ntheir commitment.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues from New York, Oklahoma, and \nTennessee for their recommendations, and I agree fully. Given the \nexpected value of this more comprehensive study, I would expect that \nthe Administrator would consult with the National Academy of Sciences \nprior to the release of the comprehensive study before proposing a \ntesting program for public comment that addresses potential endocrine \ndisrupters. Once the study has been released, the Administrator would \nbe expected to consider the findings and recommendations of the \nNational Academy of Sciences included in the study in developing any \nfuture testing program or regulatory initiatives. I thank my colleagues \nfor their recommendations.\n\n\n             huntsville global hydrology and climate center\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Alabama for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I want to first commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their skill in crafting this bill. I am particulary pleased \nthat the committee reported bill has included an additional $100 \nmillion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over that \nproposed by the House. As the chairman knows, NASA is an important part \nof the Huntsville-Madison County, AL, economy, and I am grateful for \nthe chairman's willingness to add these extra funds for NASA's 1997 \nbudget.\n  I would like to make the chairman aware of an important project in \nnorth Alabama. Since 1994, NASA, the University of Alabama in \nHuntsville and the Universities Space Research Association have jointly \nrun a Global Hydrology and Climate Center [GHCC] in Huntsville.\n  Since its creation, the center has developed a unique expertise in \nstudying the importance of the Earth's hydrologic cycle and its \nimportance to climate change. The GHCC has created a state-of-the-art \ncapability and understanding the importance of water vapor and its \neffect on greenhouse gases. In addition to this basic research, the \ncenter has developed important applications that demonstrate the links \nbetween better understanding of hydrology and more cost-effective use \nand regulation of natural resources in the southeastern United States.\n  The Global Hydrology and Climate Center is currently located in \nleased space whose cost is shared between NASA and UAH. However, the \ncenter now has an opportunity to relocate to permanent, dedicated space \nas part of an existing UAH-owned facility by permitting the buildout of \n46,500 square feet for the center's exclusive use. Unfortunately, \nbecause of NASA's accounting rules, driven by GSA guidelines, NASA \ncannot pay for its share of the cost of this buildout since the \nfacility in question is nonfederal space. However, with an \nappropriation of $2 million, which could cover only those costs of this \nrelocation that are attributable to NASA's share of the total cost of \nthe relocation project, NASA and UAH could proceed to continue the GHCC \nin this new and more cost-effective space.\n  The cost savings of such a relocation are significant as NASA can \nreduce the long-term costs of its support for the center. Some \nestimates suggest that NASA could save more than $500,000 per year in \nrental costs that they now pay for their share of the leased space.\n  I wonder if the chairman would consider identifying $2 million within \nNASA's science, aeronautics and technology account to pay for this \nrelocation in the upcoming conference on the 1997 VA-HUD appropriations \nbill?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to consider the Senator from Alabama's \nrequest in conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the chairman for his willingness to consider my \nrequest.\n\n\n                  james h. quillen school of medicine\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a very important project for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and the James H. Quillen School of Medicine at Mountain Home, \nTN, which has been under construction for several years. The project \ninvolves the relocation of the medical school and the renovation of \nseveral VA buildings, with the intended result being an improved \nenvironment for both the medical school and the VA, and most \nimportantly the highest quality medical care to Tennessee's veterans. \nFunding to complete this project in fiscal year 1997 is an extremely \nhigh priority to me.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may echo the sentiments of my colleague from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, that the joint project at Mountain Home \nrepresents a model relationship and combined effort between a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs hospital and a medical school. The \nrelationship provides both access to quality medical care for our \nveterans who are living at Mountain Home, and it provides a tremendous \nlevel of access to patients for the students and their teachers. Both \nthe medical school and Mountain Home believe this relationship is \ncritical to their success, and would like to further the level of \ncooperation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to that end of further enhancing the \ncooperative efforts between the two institutions, the State of \nTennessee and the Congress have, since 1993, funded the planning and \nconstruction of a new, joint facility at Mountain Home. The State of \nTennessee has provided $12 million thus far, with another $8 million \nthis year. Congress has funded a total of $16.3 million, with the House \nof Representatives including the final Federal obligation of $15.5 \nmillion in their spending bill this year.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank both Senators from Tennessee for raising this \nimportant project. I would note that both Senators from Tennessee wrote \nme earlier this year expressing their strong support for funding in the \nfiscal year 1997 appropriation for the VA. Unfortunately, we were \nunable in the committee to provide the funds needed to complete this \nproject since a decision was made to limit VA construction funds to \noutpatient projects, cemetery projects, and research facilities. \nHowever, I note that both Senators have been strong advocates for this \nproject, and that funding for this project will be an issue in \nconference with the House on the VA-HUD appropriations bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. Thompson and I fully understand the constraints under \nwhich his subcommittee currently operates with regards to limiting \nVeterans Administration construction funds largely to outpatient \nfacilities. However, would the Senator from Missouri be willing to \nconsider receding to the House position in conference?\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues from Tennessee \nthat I, too, recognize the importance of this project for the James H. \nQuillen School of Medicine, for our veterans at Mountain Home, and for \nthe State of Tennessee. I assure them that I will give very close \nconsideration to their request when the Senate and House meet in \nconference on this bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I sincerely thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I, too, offer my thanks for his diligent efforts on our \nbehalf.\n\n\n                       new york botanical garden\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy about \nthe New York Botanical Garden with the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri and the distinguished Senator from Maryland. The New York \nBotanical Garden has the largest collection of plant specimens in the \nhemisphere, some 5 million including those collected by Lewis and \nClarke. These are available to virtually any institution or researcher \nat no charge. The Department of Agriculture is the most frequent \nborrower.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would like to join my colleague from New York in \nsupport of the New York Botanical Garden. The Garden is much more than \na collection of plant specimens. Its research scientists are \ncontinually out in the field collecting new specimens, particularly in \nCentral and South America. In addition, one of the Garden's major \ninitiatives is in economic botany, trying to find and promote rain \nforest plants that can be harvested and sold, such as those with \nmedicinal value, rather than deforesting a region for farming.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The New York Botanical Garden is in need of a new \nlaboratory in which it will train graduate students and visiting \nscientists from this country and abroad. Their work is most important \nto the Garden's many efforts, but especially to the economic botany \nprogram.\n  Senator D'Amato and I ask that when this bill goes to conference, the \nchairman and ranking member look for an opportunity to provide a \n$50,000 planning grant so that the New York Botanical Garden can begin \nthe process of building a new laboratory.\n  Mr. BOND. I will certainly keep in mind the request from my \ncolleagues from New York.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I too will keep this request in mind during the \nconference.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to \nSenator Bond be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Washington University in St. Louis,\n\n                                     St. Louis, MO, July 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I am asking you to support a $50,000 \n     planning to determine the feasibility of a new laboratory at \n     the New York Botanical Garden. The Garden serves as a \n     training facility for graduate students as well as visiting \n     scientists from the U.S. and foreign countries in wide areas \n     of plant biology and agriculture. The laboratory, if built, \n     will house a mycology lab with research conducted in \n     pathology of crops, etc., the study of systematic and \n     developmental plant anatomy which will compliment research \n     being done at the Missouri Botanical Garden (St. Louis), and \n     other programs involved in research for medicinal properties \n     of plants. The latter will be particularly valuable in \n     relation to Washington University's program of drug discovery \n     associated with our International Cooperative Biodiversity \n     Group project which you helped so positively through the \n     final stages of funding. The research and laboratory at the \n     New York Botanical Garden are an integral part of modern \n     science and the institution is world-famous for conducting \n     first-rate scientific research.\n       I understand that such a study could be funded through the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the budget for which is \n     under your Committee's jurisdiction. I appreciate you \n     attention to and support for this request.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Walter H. Lewis,\n                                                        Professor.\n\n\n        agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the merits of a \nprogram that has done great work in the field of medicine. The Agency \nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, or ATSDR, funded through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, has addressed the concerns of a lot of \nAmericans, and has garnered the support of the Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals, particularly the Louisiana Office of Public \nHealth. The program has also received accolades from a network of \nuniversities that host programs aimed at expanding and enhancing \nnumbers and qualities of specialists entering the health professions \nfield. In Louisiana, the program has been essential to Xavier \nUniversity, whose college of pharmacy is in the fourth year of a 5-year \ncooperative agreement with ATSDR and the Minority Health Professions \nFoundation. ATSDR helps the college provide training for pharmacists \nwho are challenged with meeting the expanding needs of our society. \nXavier is 1 of 11 universities nationwide that have ongoing programs of \nthis nature.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I, too, would like to express my support for this \nprogram. In my State of Alabama, Tuskeegee University's School of \nVeterinary Medicine also participates in the Association of Minority \nHealth Professions Schools, by contributing materially toward helping \nto control the cost of human health care by preventing zoonotic \ndiseases. This, in turn, helps prevent an overload on human primary \nhealth care systems. The value of this program is self-evident.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this very worthwhile program, to stress the \nimportance of funding ATSDR at the budget request level of $69 million, \nand to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to fund at $4 million \nthe ATSDR minority health professions for the purposes of conducting \nessential research on hazardous substance induced diseases.\n  Mr. BOND. I can assure my colleague that this subcommittee has \nsupported ATSDR in the past, and in particular has supported the \nminority health professions initiative. It continues to be a worthwhile \nprogram, and I am cognizant of the need associated with ongoing \nresearch and treatment efforts. I am sure that I and my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, ranking member on this \nsubcommittee, will keep this in mind as we proceed to conference on the \nVA, HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill, H.R. 3666.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would agree with the chairman, and support this \nexcellent program.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                               clean air\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be grateful if the Senator would provide an \ninterpretation of the assurance contained in the letter dated July 23, \n1996, addressed to you and me from the U.S. Trade Representative and \nthe Administrator of EPA. I will submit the text of the letter for the \nRecord.\n  The letter states that compliance with the WTO decision ``will not \nresult in the degradation of gasoline quality required by the Clean Air \nAct with respect to imported conventional and reformulated gasoline.'' \nI understand that the EPA proposed in 1994 a foreign refiner baseline \nrule that could have allowed foreign oil companies to export gasoline \nto the United States with higher levels of sulfur and olefins than \nallowed under existing rules. However, the letter we recently received \nprovides assurances that the WTO compliance process will not allow \nforeign refiners to supply gasoline with higher levels of precursors of \nozone pollution than are currently allowed.\n  Mr. BOND. The letter indicates there will be no degradation in the \ngasoline quality required by the Clean Air Act with respect to imports. \nMy understanding is that foreign refiners will not be allowed to \nincrease the content of precursors of ozone pollution in its gasoline \nsupplied to the United States above the levels currently allowed.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would be grateful if the gentlemen would yield for one \nadditional point. I received a letter from the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the Administrator of EPA regarding the foreign \nrefiner baseline issue dated July 25, 1996. I will submit the text of \nthe letter for the Record.\n  The letter provides additional comments regarding enforcement and \nstates, ``EPA will not recognize individual foreign refiner baselines \nunless we have adequately addressed the issues of auditing, inspection \nof foreign facilities, and enforcement.'' It is my understanding the \nletter gives the administration's commitment to seek\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nequivalent levels of enforcement for foreign refiners before allowing \nthe access that these refiners desire to reformulated and conventional \ngasoline markets.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe the Senator from Montana is correct. The letter \nindicates the U.S. Government will seek to bring all appropriate and \navailable U.S. enforcement efforts to bear upon foreign refiners to \nassure that the data foreign refiners provide is useful and reliable.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senators from Missouri and Maryland and \nappreciate their hard work. I will continue to monitor this issue in \nthe future and look forward to our continued cooperation on this issue.\n  I believe this is a good compromise to expedite the bill yet send a \nstrong message about clean air and a level playing field for our \ndomestic refiners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Trade Representative, U.S. Environmental Protection \n           Agency,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Thank you for bringing to our attention \n     your concerns regarding the WTO decision with respect to \n     EPA's regulation on reformulated and conventional gasoline. \n     We appreciate your understanding of the Administration's need \n     for regulatory flexibility and your agreement not to support \n     Congressional action circumscribing that flexibility, \n     including introduction of a rider to H.R. 3666, the FY 1997 \n     VA, HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, \n     regarding EPA's treatment of foreign gasoline under its \n     regulations implementing the Clean Air Act.\n       On June 19, after consulting with Congress, we advised the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO) that the United States intends \n     to meet our WTO obligations with respect to the results of \n     the dispute settlement proceeding brought by Venezuela and \n     Brazil concerning the EPA's regulations on reformulated and \n     conventional gasoline. We announced that we had initiated an \n     open process which will examine any and all options for \n     compliance. In evaluating options, the overriding criterion \n     will be fully protecting public health and the environment, \n     consistent with this Administration's commitment to strong \n     and effective implementation of the Clean Air Act, in a \n     manner consistent with U.S. obligations under the WTO. We can \n     assure you that this process will not result in the \n     degradation of the gasoline quality required by the Clean Air \n     Act with respect to imported conventional and reformulated \n     gasoline.\n       The U.S. government understands that the foreign refiner \n     baseline issue and the WTO Appellate Body report on EPA's \n     gasoline regulation is of great continuing concern to U.S. \n     environmental and industrial organizations. We are committed \n     to working closely with all interested parties, including \n     specifically U.S. industry, the states and the environmental \n     NGO community, during our review process. We recognize the \n     concerns raised by members of the industry regarding the 1994 \n     EPA proposal to use foreign refiner baselines. EPA will not \n     recognize individual foreign refiner baselines unless we have \n     adequately addressed the issues of auditing, inspection of \n     foreign facilities, and enforcement. We are also very mindful \n     of the concerns expressed by members of Congress and others \n     that any response to the WTO decision should take into \n     account impacts on the environment and should recognize the \n     significant infrastructure investments undertaken by industry \n     to meet the requirements for reformulated gasoline. We can \n     assure you that we will incorporate these concerns of members \n     of Congress in the review process. We are committed to a full \n     and open administrative process in the formulation of any \n     final rule.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you throughout \n     this process. Please do not hesitate to contact either one of \n     us if we may provide you with further information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charlene Barshefsky,\n       Acting U.S. Trade Representative.\n     Carol M. Browner,\n       Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \ndated July 23, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President.\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond, Chairman,\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski, Ranking Member,\n     Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to strongly urge you to \n     oppose a potential rider to H.R. 3666, the FY 1997 VA, HUD \n     and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, regarding EPA's \n     treatment of foreign gasoline under its regulations \n     implementing the Clean Air Act.\n       On June 19, after consulting with Congress, we advised the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO) that the United States intends \n     to meet our WTO obligations with respect to the results of \n     the dispute settlement proceeding brought by Venezuela and \n     Brazil concerning the EPA's regulations on reformulated and \n     conventional gasoline. We announced that we had initiated an \n     open process which will examine any and all options for \n     compliance. In evaluating options, the overriding criterion \n     will be fully protecting public health and the environment, \n     consistent with this Administration's commitment to strong \n     and effective implementation of the Clean Air Act, in a \n     manner consistent with U.S. obligations under the WTO. We can \n     assure you that this process will not result in the \n     degradation of the gasoline quality required by the Clean Air \n     Act with respect to imported conventional and reformulated \n     gasoline.\n       We are very concerned that any action taken by Congress \n     casting doubt upon U.S. intentions could seriously interfere \n     with our ability to reach the best possible resolution of \n     this matter and could prompt Venezuela and Brazil to quickly \n     seek authority from the WTO to retaliate by raising tariffs \n     on U.S. exports. Even if such authority were not granted, \n     there is a serious risk that we could face a harmful \n     shortening of the period available for us to evaluate our \n     options.\n       We are also concerned about the precedent such action could \n     set. It would be most unfortunate if this type of legislative \n     action were to be used by other countries as an excuse to \n     avoid implementing the results of the many WTO disputes that \n     we expect to win. The United States is pursuing numerous \n     disputes against other countries' measures, including, for \n     example, one against the European Union for unjustifiably \n     limiting U.S. beef exports.\n       The U.S. government understands that the foreign refiner \n     baseline issue and the WTO Appellate Body report on EPA's \n     gasoline regulation is of great continuing concern to U.S. \n     environmental and industrial organizations. We are committed \n     to working closely with all interested parties, including \n     specifically U.S. industry, the states and the environmental \n     NGO community, during our review process. We recognize the \n     concerns raised by members of the industry regarding the 1994 \n     EPA proposal to use foreign refiner baselines. We are also \n     very mindful of the concerns expressed by members of Congress \n     and others that any response to the WTO decision should take \n     into account impacts on the environment and should recognize \n     the significant infrastructure investments undertaken by \n     industry to meet the requirements for reformulated gasoline. \n     We can assure you that we will incorporate these concerns of \n     members of Congress in the review process. We are committed \n     to a full and open administrative process in the formulation \n     of any final rule.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose the rider. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact either one of us if we may provide you \n     with further information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charlene Barshefsky,\n       Acting U.S. Trade Representative.\n     Carol M. Browner,\n       Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n              center for molecular medicine and immunology\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the distinguished managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, the Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology \n[CMMI], located in Newark, NJ, has been a leader in developing life \nsaving treatment for cancers that plague our Nation's veteran \npopulation. In particular, CMMI is conducting research into \nradioimmunodetection and radio- immunotherapy, a new technology that \nuses radioisotopes and monochlonal antibodies to target tumors often \ntoo small for detection with traditional equipment and delivers cancer \nfighting therapy to targeted muscle tissue and organs with virtually no \nside effects. This has the potential to be very helpful to treating our \nNation's veterans, many of whom suffer from cancer.\n  Mr. President, the House report on the fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill included language that encourages the Veterans' \nAdministration to enter into a partnership with nonprofit research \ncenters to expand these research efforts. The Senate report does not \ninclude such language. Does the Senator support the intent of the House \nlanguage?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. I am supportive of the House language.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the distinguished manager of the bill.\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\n              funding for the epa long island sound office\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nVA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from Missouri, in a \ncolloquy to discuss funding for the EPA's Long Island Sound Office. \nSenators D'Amato, Dodd, and Moynihan have asked to join in this \ncolloquy as well.\n  Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, the Long Island Sound Office \n[LISO] is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the \nsound's comprehensive conservation management plan [CCMP]. This office \nis faced with the daunting task of orchestrating a multibillion dollar, \ndecade-long initiative that requires the cooperation of nearly 150 \ndifferent Federal, State, municipal, and private institutions and \nagents.\n  Despite the odds, and the limited resources it has had to work with, \nthe LISO is succeeding. Over the last 2 years, it has made tremendous \nprogress in getting the cleanup started and beginning work toward the \nkey goals outlined in the CCMP--limiting nitrogen loads, restoring \ndamaged habitats, cracking down on nonpoint source pollution and the \nrelease of pathogens, and educating area residents about the importance \nof these conservation efforts and ways they can help.\n  We are deeply concerned, however, that this progress may be in \njeopardy. In contrast to past years, the subcommittee has chosen not to \nprovide any funding for the grant program the LISO is authorized to \nadminister. In addition, it is our understanding that the National \nEstuary Program [NEP], which supplied $300,000 to the LISO in the \ncurrent fiscal year to fund the office's operating budget, is planning \nto phase out its support of the LISO in fiscal year 1977. In fact, \nbecause of the increasing budgetary strain on the NEP, it is possible \nthe LISO may be zeroed out completely.\n  Mr. DODD. I join my colleagues in urging the Senate to maintain our \ncommitment to supporting the LISO. The loss of funding that Senator \nLieberman has described would severely handicap the LISO's ability to \ncontinue implementing the management plan, and could force the office \nto shut down operations, which would effectively stop the cleanup dead \nin its tracks.\n  Our conclusion is based on past experience. The New England River \nBasin Commission drafted a cleanup plan in 1975, and it disintegrated \nsoon after its adoption because the program ended with the plan and did \nnot focus on implementation. In other words, there was no central \norganizing and coordinating force keeping the many players at the \ntable. The LISO is the glue that is holding this project together, and \nafter spending millions of dollars and enormous time and energy getting \nto this point, we cannot afford to lose it. The environmental and \neconomic health of our region depends on a sound Sound.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we understand that the subcommittee is \nworking under considerable budget pressures. But given the importance \nof this project to our respective States, we would ask that you make a \nconcerted effort in conference to provide funding to keep this office \nmoving forward. We are seeking an appropriation of $975,000 to cover \nthe LISO's operating expenses and to expand its efforts to provide \ngrants to State and local partnerships involved in the cleanup. But at \na minimum, we would request that the conferees maintain support for the \noffice at the current level of $650,000. We thank the chairman and the \nsubcommittee's ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for consideration of \nthis matter.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I understand the Long Island Sound Office is as my \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, states ``the glue that is holding'' the \nrestoration of the Long Island Sound together. Recognizing the office's \nimportance, I will do everything I can to support the Senators' request \nin conference.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would like to join my colleagues in expressing my \nsupport for the continued funding of the Long Island Sound Office. What \nmany Senators may not know is that Long Island Sound is an economic as \nwell as an environmental asset. The sound generates billions of dollars \nfrom tourism, boating, sportfishing, and a newly-revived shellfish \nindustry. If the sound's recovery is threatened, the economies of both \nStates will suffer and we will lose jobs that these industries sustain. \nFunding to continue to carry out the important work of the sound's \nmanagement plan will help keep that recovery moving.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In closing, I think it is important to point out that \nunlike other NEP participants, the LISO was chartered for the express \npurpose of carrying the sound's management plan beyond the development \nstage and to actually oversee and contribute to the implementation of \nthis plan. It was for this reason that the office is authorized at $3 \nmillion annually to provide grants to State agencies, municipalities, \nand local partnerships. While we understand that the NEP may no longer \nbe the appropriate source of funding for the LISO, we feel strongly \nthat in no way should justify stripping this project of all its Federal \nsupport.\n  I also want to point out that the State of Connecticut reaffirmed its \ncommitment to cleaning up the sound just last week when it approved a \n$52 million bond issue to upgrade wastewater treatment facilities in \nthe cities of Norwalk and Waterbury. That investment is just the latest \nshow of support from Connecticut and New York, and we strongly urge the \nCongress not to let those dollars go to waste.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand the priority the Senators from New York and \nConnecticut place on the restoration of Long Island Sound, and I \nrecognize the unique challenges you face in implementing the long-term \nmanagement plan. It seems clear that this effort cannot succeed without \nthe guiding hand of the EPA Long Island Sound Office. Knowing of your \ndeep concern, I will do everything I can to support your request in \nconference and at a minimum maintain funding at its current level. My \nhope is to secure report language directing the EPA to provide funding \nto the LISO at a satisfactory level.\n\n\n                         community development\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to address a question to the \nmanagers of the bill, the chairman and ranking member of the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee, Senators Bond and Mikulski. Let me begin by commending \nthem for their hard work in crafting this bill under tough budgetary \ncircumstances. We all agree that this bill will provide funds for \ndiverse programs of vital importance to communities all across America. \nAs such, I hope this Senate floor debate will yield a cost-effective \nand responsible bill that we can all support.\n  In particular, I would like to ask for the managers' input on HUD \nprograms to foster community development. More specifically, funds in \nthis bill are designed to promote economic growth and development that \nbenefits entire communities, and it is my understanding that Congress \nhas taken steps to target some of those funds to urban areas where \nAmericans of the low and middle range live, work and raise their \nfamilies.\n  As you may know, Marquette University has headed up the Avenues West \nNeighborhood Crime Intervention Demonstration Program in Milwaukee, WI. \nThis innovative program has brought together a diverse group of public \nand private entities to focus resources on the causes of crime and its \neffects on individuals, families, and neighborhoods. The underlying \ngoal of this effort has been to generate comprehensive community-based \nsolutions to complex urban problems. Program participants include the \ncity of Milwaukee, Marquette University, the Milwaukee Police \nDepartment, as well as other community organizations. Do the managers \nagree that the avenues west initiative is the type of comprehensive, \ncommunity-based program that Congress would want to support through \ncommunity development grants?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes. In fact, Congress has appropriated funds for this \nworthwhile program in the past through special purpose grants.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, over the past 2 years the committee has \nworked very hard to eliminate the number of narrowly focused \ncategorical programs in HUD. Instead we have placed a priority on \nfocusing our declining budgetary resources on block grants such as the \nCDBG program, and other activities designed to increase local \nflexibility and decisionmaking. I would note that the\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\nreported appropriations bill has the effect of increasing the amount \navailable to cities and States under the CDBG program by $300 million. \nThis will maintain the full $4.6 billion level for CDGB. I would add \nthat there is no doubt in my mind that this neighborhood crime \nintervention program of Marquette qualifies for such CDBG funding.\n  In addition, let me note that earlier this month HUD issued a notice \nof funding availability for the $50 million appropriated in the current \nfiscal year for the Economic Development Initiatives Program. This is a \nnationwide competitive program which is designed to combat urban \ndecline and to foster economic revitalization in our cities. The \nMarquette University sponsors should definitely consider participation \nin this competition since their program appears very much on point to \nthe EDI effort, and I suspect, such an application should fare well in \nthis HUD competition.\n\n\n                   benefits of a disposal endosheath\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to state my support for an \nissue that I believe is important to the health of all veterans in \ndetecting colorectal cancer. Specifically, I am referring to the \nflexible endoscopic procedures performed by physicians. Currently, \nthere are two types of flexible endoscopes available to physicians to \nperform these procedures: One is a conventional endoscope that is \nmanually cleaned and disinfected. The other is a redesigned endoscope \nwhich incorporates the use of a sterile protective covering called the \nEndoSheath. Using the EndoSheath protects the patient and health care \nprovider from the risks associated with cross-contamination.\n  I am very concerned by the contamination risks associated with the \nuse of impure patient-ready endoscopes on veterans. As such, it is \nimportant to ensure that the Veterans Health Administration is aware of \nand encouraged to explore the overall effectiveness of the single-\npatient, sterile, condom-like protective coverings that may help \nprotect veterans from the risk of cross-contamination.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I share the concern expressed by Senator \nD'Amato, and agree with him about the benefits of utilizing a disposal \nsheath when physicians conduct procedures using a flexible \nsigmoidoscope on patients to detect colorectal cancer. Disposal sheaths \nare widely used in private practice. Therefore, I also encourage the \nVeterans Health Administration to explore their use as a means of \nprotecting veterans from the risk of cross-contamination.\n\n\n                        nasa's academic programs\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the House of Representatives approved \n$110.8 million in fiscal year 1997 for the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration's [NASA] academic programs. This amount reflects a \n$3.9 million increase from fiscal year 1996, and a $10 million increase \nabove the administration's budget request. I understand that the Senate \nproposal did not include a funding increase for NASA's academic \nprograms.\n  I support increased funding for this valuable program. This will \nallow NASA to fund ongoing programs as well as fund new innovative \nprograms. One such program involves a science education program \ndeveloped by Hawaii's Bishop Museum. NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin \nhas indicated his personal support for this program which involves the \ncreation of two dynamic multimedia planetarium programs and associated \neducational materials around the theme of exploration. The ``Journey by \nStarlight'' program is an interactive simulation of navigating a \nHawaiian canoe from Tahiti to Hawaii. The ``Eyes of the Universe'' \nprogram will focus on modern technology and human exploration of the \nuniverse from earth and space-based observatories, particularly those \nin Hawaii.\n  Using various distribution techniques, it is estimated that at least \n800,000 students and 500,000 families and nontraditional students \nacross the Nation will experience these programs. Complementing the \nplanetarium programs will be educational curricula for grades 3 through \n12, an interactive and evolving World Wide Web site, video resources, \nand an interactive CD-ROM.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that during the House-Senate conference \nyou will support increased funding for NASA's academic programs and \ngive consideration to the joint initiative between NASA and Hawaii's \nBishop Museum.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be pleased to give your request every consideration \nduring conference deliberations with the House.\n\n\n    future use of land adjacent to the los angeles national cemetery\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words today \nrelative to an effort being undertaken by veterans and local community \norganizations to protect and preserve land adjacent to the Los Angeles \nNational Cemetery.\n  This land, 44 acres, was deeded as a gift to the Federal Government \nprovided that its use would be for veterans. It is hoped that the land \ncan be preserved so that as the need for veterans cemeteries grows, \nthis land, which is adjacent to the Los Angeles National Cemetery, will \nbe a valuable resource to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  It is my understanding that there have been requests of the DVA to \nlease this land for commercial development, including its use as the \nsite for an NFL stadium. This has raised concerns by veterans and local \ncommunities as to the appropriate use of this land so close to a \nnational cemetery where families and veterans go to honor their loved \nones.\n  Local organizations are willing and able, through private resources, \nto develop this land as a park honoring our Nation's veterans. This \nproposal, in keeping with the intent of the gift of land, complements \nthe existing cemetery and protects the land for future veterans' use.\n  I have received letters from the American Legion, the California \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and officials of numerous veterans \norganizations in the State expressing their support for this effort.\n  I would ask that the committee include language in its conference \nreport directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to work with these \norganizations to develop the land into a veterans memorial park and to \nprohibit the Department from entering into any long-term, binding \nleases which would tie the use of that land into one inconsistent with \nthe intent of its donor.\n  I applaud the local veterans, the California veterans groups, the \nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs both in Los Angeles and Washington, \nDC, and the local citizens groups for working together to arrive at an \napproach to protect this land for veterans now and in the future\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nCalifornia a few additional questions on this matter. Senator, you \nmention the land is under deed restrictions against development \ninconsistent with veterans needs. If this is the case, why are these \norganizations worried about suggestions for commercial development?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The 44 acres in question are part of the original \ndeed; however, they are contiguous to lands under less restrictive \ndeeds thus creating a danger to this parcel.\n  Mr. BOND. The committee understands that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs is not prepared to create new cemetery space in this region and \nthat there is not an immediate need for additional cemetery space. Are \nthere not higher priorities for the Department of Veterans Affairs for \ncemetery space in other regions of the United States?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is not my intent to request that this land be \nconverted into a cemetery at this time. The Senator is correct, there \nare other regions in the country that are in great need of additional \ncemetery space. My goal is to ensure that this land is preserved so \nthat when the need for additional cemetery space arises, 20-50 years \nfrom now, the Federal Government will have land without major \nconstruction or contamination issues which can be easily converted into \na cemetery.\n  Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown has suggested both to local \nleaders and the House that a veterans memorial park would be a good \ninterim step to protect the land. This action would not be an \nadditional burden on the taxpayer because local leaders strongly feel \nthey can raise the needed funds privately to create this park. I hope \nthat the committee will support this effort with the inclusion of \nlanguage in the conference report.\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the issues you have raised and will be pleased \nto work with Mr. Lewis of the House Appropriations Committee to address \nthis issue in conference.\n\n\n                        southern oxidants study\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as you know, the Southern Oxidants \nStudy has brought together 35 industrial and government organizations \nand 20 universities in 21 States to study a critical economic, \nenvironmental, and health issue--the formation of ground level ozone. \nGround level ozone is a problem that has plagued many areas of the \nUnited States, having a negative impact on economic growth, human \nhealth, and forest and crop productivity. In the Southeast, ground \nlevel ozone may have its root causes in environmental factors unique to \nmy region. Because of this, the basic scientific research conducted by \nthe Southern Oxidants Study scientists is so critical to providing \npolicymakers with unbiased data for use in developing solutions to the \nproblem. Not only is this information beneficial to my region, but the \nmethodologies and knowledge gained in this study will add to ozone \nresearch nationally and internationally. The Southern Oxidants Study \napproach has been endorsed by the National Research Council and others \nand is considered a model of regional cooperation. It is imperative \nthat appropriate funding be continued for this vital study.\n  Mr. BOND. I am aware of the important scientifically based \ncontributions made by the university-based Southern Oxidants Study to \nunderstanding the causes of ground level ozone pollution in the \nSoutheast as well as other areas of the country. I agree that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should continue to provide the \nappropriate funding to ensure that the critical objectives of the study \ncan be fulfilled.\n\n\n                    PCB-landfill Permit Application\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues know, PCB's are an \nextremely sensitive matter in the Great Lakes region. These substances \nbioaccumulate, biomagnify and cause permanent damage to the environment \nand public health. And, they are ubiquitous. They are in the water, the \nsediment, and still stored around the country. Long ago, we made a \ndecision to discontinue their manufacture and import because of their \nnegative effects on human health.\n  Recently, in March of this year, the EPA decided that a 15-year-old \nban on the importation of PCB's should be lifted. This seems like a \ncurious decision, since I am not aware that the negative health \nimplications of PCB disposal, incineration or other treatment, which \nmotivated the original ban have significantly changed in that time. I \nplan to review this decision very carefully and hope my colleagues will \njoin me in that process.\n  It is true that some novel and cleaner permanent destruction options \nare now nearly ready for commercial use. But, PCBs are toxic wastes \nthat have an extremely long half-life and their basic characteristics \nhave not changed. I am concerned about their importation especially if \nthey are simply going to be landfilled or their incineration generates \ndioxins and other air toxics.\n  As my colleagues may know, Representatives Bentsen and Rivers \nsuccessfully attached a rider to the House version of this bill that \nwould prohibit any PCB disposal or treatment so long as EPA's rule \nallowing importation of PCB waste is in force. Though that provision \nhas some merit, I would prefer a narrower approach to correct what \nseems to be a clearly flawed process that EPA has followed to date on a \nlandfill permit for PCB disposal.\n  Generally, EPA does a very good job of informing the public and \nconsidering its view prior to making regulatory decisions. But, in this \ncase, things have not gone very well. And, due process seems to have \nbeen thrown out the window.\n  In approximately July of 1995, an application was filed with the EPA \nto dispose of 1.4 million cubic feet of PCB-contaminated waste, much of \nwhich would be higher than the Federal action level of 50 ppm, at a \nfacility in Michigan.\n  According to EPA, legal notice of this application was given at about \nthe same time in various local newspapers.\n  At a public meeting in April of this year, during the public comment \nperiod on a landfill permit application, EPA and the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality representatives responded to \nquestions from a very concerned local audience. My staff attended this \nmeeting.\n  This meeting occurred weeks prior to the conclusion of the public \ncomment period. The deadline for public comments was May 18, 1996.\n  At that meeting, an EPA official apparently spoke words to the effect \nthat the people can say all they want but that the permit is ``a done \ndeal.'' EPA has video tape of the event and we will try to check that \ntape. But, my staff was in attendance and heard the remark. It was \nlater retracted, but the damage was done.\n  Mr. President, I am appalled at the implication in that official's \nstatement, regardless of the situation or the retraction. There can be \nno confidence now that the permit process that EPA has followed has \nbeen fair and objective, that the public's comments will even be \nfactored into the permit decision. In fact, in a letter that I ask be \ninserted into the Record following my remarks, Congresswoman Rivers and \nI suggested that EPA discontinue consideration of the permit \napplication simply because of this event. (See exhibit 1.)\n  Further complicating this situation are the merits of the permit \napplication. The regulations developed by EPA to implement the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act [TSCA] are fairly specific. They lay out all of \nthe technical requirements that each chemical waste landfill must meet \nbefore it can be approved for PCB disposal. Based on the excellent \ninformation provided to me by Van Buren Township, the landfill \napplication in question apparently fails to meet 5 of the 7 major \ntechnical requirements.\n  Mr. President, it becomes more disturbing. My staff has been given \nthe impression from EPA staff that a waiver of the technical \nrequirements is necessary to approve this permit, since it clearly \nviolates the criteria for proximity and connection to water, and that \nsuch waiver will be granted. Combining that with a statement to the \neffect that the permit is ``a done deal,'' I am truly disappointed. The \npeople who live in the vicinity of this gargantuan waste disposal \nfacility are not getting fair treatment from the regulators who are \nsupposed to be looking out for the public health and welfare.\n  Mr. President, this permitting process should not go forward, if it \nhas been as tainted as I have been led to believe. It should be \ndiscontinued. If the public cannot be assured of a fair hearing on such \nweighty matters, we are in real trouble.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Michigan has stated his case clearly and \nforcefully. EPA certainly seems to have seriously erred, if its \nrepresentative indicated an outcome before the permit process has \nconcluded.\n  Having said that, however, there is a related provision, as the \nSenator has mentioned, in the House bill on PCB's. As a result, this \nmatter will have to be discussed in conference. EPA has been made aware \nof the mistakes that have weakened his trust in the Agency's ability to \nbe fair and objective in this permitting process. I cannot speak for \nthe Administrator, but I believe that it may be possible for the Agency \nto review this situation and start afresh.\n  There may be something that we can do in Conference report language \nthat would help the concerned citizens feel that they are being treated \nreasonably and the real environmental risks are being considered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the chairman be willing to seek to include language \nin the conference report that directs EPA to review the process that \nhas been followed in this particular case for breaches of the public \ntrust and breakdowns in the normal process that should be followed when \nconsidering a permit of this magnitude? And, if the representatives of \nthe EPA have, by their own words during public consideration of a \nlandfill permit application stated the intended outcome prior to a \nfinal permitting decision, direct that further consideration of the \npermit be discontinued?\n  Mr. BOND. I will certainly work to inform and convince the conferees \nthat such language is important and may be appropriate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would he further request that the conference report \ninclude language directing EPA to report back to\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nCongress within 90 days on the location and number of chemical waste \nlandfills that have received waivers pursuant to 40 CFR 761.75(c)(4) \nand a justification for each waiver?\n  Finally, and I appreciate the chairman's patience, would he also \nconsider directing EPA to engage an independent body to review whether \nor not the facility in question meets the technical requirements \nspelled out in 40 CFR 761.75(b), prior to any final decision on the \npermit?\n  Mr. BOND. I will do my best to accommodate his requests.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5167\n\n     (Purpose: To make a series of amendments relating to housing)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \ncommittee amendment will be set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for himself, Mr. \n     D'Amato and Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 5167.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what I have offered today is an amendment to \nprovide a section 8 mark-to-market transition demonstration program for \nthe restructuring of mortgages on FHA-insured multifamily housing \nprojects with expiring oversubsidized section 8 project-based \ncontracts.\n  At the end of my remarks, unless others wish to make comments on it, \nI will ask this amendment be set aside. My purpose in sending it today \nis to allow it to be printed in the Record so that all my colleagues \nhave an opportunity to review the amendment.\n  This amendment reflects our best efforts at solving a critical and \ncostly issue which is necessary to preserve affordable low-income \nhousing. Because it is a very complex amendment, it has gone through \nsignificant work, readjustments, revisions, and recriminations. I felt \nit would be wise to give all Members and their staffs an opportunity to \ngive this amendment thorough consideration. If there are improvements \non it or if there are ways we can change it now or when we go into \nconference, I hope Members will come forward and offer their views and \ntheir advice on it. It is absolutely essential we deal with this \nproblem right away so we will not trap ourselves in an escalating \nseries of commitments that are beyond our financial resources to \nsatisfy.\n  I know many Members are at this point perhaps only marginally aware \nof the exorbitant costs needed to maintain some one million units of \nFHA-insured section 8 project-based housing that are affordable to low-\nincome families. This marginal awareness is understandable because the \nsection 8 new construction and modern rehabilitation programs were \nfinanced in previous years through oversubsidized 15- and 20-year \nsection 8 project-based contracts which are only now coming due for \ncontract renewal. This housing is a valuable resource for low-income \nfamilies, but the cost of renewing section 8 for this housing often \nwill be an unreasonable expense.\n  We have an opportunity now and an obligation to readjust the cost of \nthis housing to the cost of market rents. The Banking Committee \nrecently held a hearing on the mark-to-market issue which emphasized \nthe escalating costs of this section 8 project-based assistance. In \nresponse, the Banking Committee is currently preparing to mark up a \nbill to establish a comprehensive program to reduce the costs of \nexpiring project-based section 8 contracts, limit the financial \nexposure of the FHA multifamily mortgage insurance fund for costly \nmortgage defaults, and preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the \nsection 8 project-based housing stock for very low- and low-income \nfamilies.\n  In conjunction with the efforts of the Banking Committee, I am \nproposing today an interim section 8 mark-to-market demonstration as a \nstepping stone to the Banking Committee bill to provide HUD and certain \npublic agencies with the authority and tools to test various approaches \nto restructure mortgages and reduce the cost of section 8 project-based \nassistance to these multifamily housing projects. I expect and hope \nthat Congress will enact a comprehensive reform bill this year.\n  I give my special thanks to Chairman D'Amato and Senator Mack as well \nas to Senator Sarbanes and Senator Kerrey for their interests, their \ndedication and commitment to finding a bipartisan approach that \npreserves this low-income housing stock at a reasonable cost to the \nGovernment.\n  Let me emphasize the depth of the section 8 mark-to-market problem. \nThere are some 8,500 projects with almost one million units that are \nboth FHA-insured and whose debt service is almost totally dependent on \nrental assistant payments made under section 8 project-based contracts. \nMost of these projects serve very low-income families, with \napproximately 37 percent of the stock serving elderly families. Most of \nthese projects are also oversubsidized and are at risk of mortgage \ndefault if we do nothing and attempt to renew the project-based \ncontract at fair market rents.\n  Some 75 percent of this housing stock has rents that exceed the fair \nmarket rent in the local area. This means without the renewal of the \nsection 8 project-based contracts, many project owners likely will \ndefault on their FHA-insured mortgage liabilities, resulting in FHA \nmortgage insurance claims and foreclosures. HUD would then own and be \nresponsible for managing these low-income multifamily housing projects.\n  In addition, the cost of renewing the section 8 project-based \ncontracts on these projects reemphasizes the difficult budget and \nappropriations choices Congress must make in seeking to control \nspending and achieve a balanced budget over the next 6 years. In \nparticular, according to HUD estimates, the cost of all section 8 \ncontract renewals, both tenant-based and project-based, would require \nappropriations of about $4.3 billion in fiscal year 1997, $10 billion \nin fiscal year 1998, and over $16 billion in fiscal year 2000.\n  In addition, the cost of renewing only the section 8 project-based \ncontracts will grow from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to almost $4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000, and to some $8 billion in 10 years. These \nexploding costs are unacceptable and unsustainable.\n  The section 8 mark-to-market demonstration included in this amendment \nwould authorize HUD to renew for up to 1 year all expiring section 8 \nproject-based contracts with rents at or below 120 percent of the fair \nmarket rents for an area. This safe harbor will cover many of the \n240,000 units which are supported by the expiring section 8 contracts \nand will provide HUD with the administrative ability to focus on those \nFHA-insured multifamily housing projects with significantly \noversubsidized rents.\n  The projects with units which do not qualify for the contract renewal \nsafe harbor will be eligible to participate in the section 8 mark-to-\nmarket demonstration. In addition, similar to the Banking Committee's \nmark-to-market draft bill, the demonstration would encourage HUD to \nenter into contracts with State housing finance agencies, local housing \nagencies, and other public agencies to administer the demonstration \nprogram and to work at the local level to restructure the FHA-insured \nmortgages and to reduce the cost of section 8 project-based assistance.\n  Finally, the demonstration would provide HUD and the public agencies \nwith a number of tools to restructure the FHA-insured mortgages and \nreduce the cost of section 8 project-based housing assistance. These \ntools include the authority to restructure mortgages so that a first \nmortgage will reflect the market value of a project, while HUD holds a \nsoft second on the remainder of the front debt. This is a critical tool \nbecause it preserves both the low-income housing while reducing the \ncost of section 8 project-based assistance and the risk of foreclosure. \nThe demonstration allows HUD to implement budget-based rents to squeeze \nout any inflated projects, while covering the debt service and \noperating costs of these federally assisted projects.\n  In addition, this demonstration would exclude those projects which \nare not properly managed or do not meet appropriate housing quality \nstandards. The demonstration, however, is flexible enough to address \nthe unique characteristics of projects such as elderly\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\nprojects in rural areas and the unique characteristics of localities \nsuch as those with very low vacancy rates.\n  I again emphasize that this demonstration is still a place holder as \nan interim approach to preserving federally assisted low-income housing \nthrough restructuring FHA-insured mortgages and reducing the associated \ncost of section 8 project-based assistance. We look forward to working \nwith the administration, the Banking Committee, and the housing \nindustry to find a responsible permanent method of preserving this \nvaluable section 8 housing resource.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support Senator Bond's amendment. It \nstarts to address the serious problem with section 8. A large number of \nhousing projects, or housing programs, are subsidized by rents that far \nexceed the rent in a given area. In 1997 alone, over 2,100 of these \nsection 8 contracts with nearly 132,000 units will expire. The \nGovernment cannot afford to continue paying these excessive rents \nindefinitely. This is almost like a Ponzi scheme, which is to come on \nin and get an FHA mortgage to build it. But in order to sustain the \nmortgage at inflated rents so you don't default, you need section 8 \ncontracts. Well, we are heading for a financial disaster in three ways. \nNo. 1, this could become an incredible taxpayer liability if all this \nbegins to cascade in default. No. 2, we cannot continue to pay rents \nabove market value, nor should we. No. 3, what we find is that we have \nan incredible number of these section 8 contracts coming due over the \nnext 3 to 5 years. We must get a handle on the problem.\n  Senator Bond's approach is a very, very reasonable approach. It is a \ndemonstration project. It gives a variety of tools to the local area to \nresolve this, because so much housing in a national program is locally \nset. The market value in Utah of section 8 is remarkably different than \nin the San Francisco area or the Seattle area. So we think it is a very \ngood approach. I think the Bond amendment begins a process that enables \nus to begin to, in a reasonable, rational, well-paced way, begin to \nmove on this. We cannot ignore the fact that over 850,000 units with \nsubsidy problems are in the pipeline. Now is the time to act. I look \nforward to additional debate on this amendment, but I look forward to \nsupporting this amendment. Most of all, I support beginning the process \nof getting a real grip on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say later, but I think that \nsummarizes my thinking.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nMaryland, who has stated very clearly and eloquently what I was trying \nto say, which is that we have a financial disaster facing us, and we \ncannot resolve it easily. We have to do something that preserves this \nlow-income housing. As I indicated earlier, my purpose in presenting \nthe amendment at this time was to allow it to be printed in the Record, \nto draw the attention of my colleagues to it, so that they may give us \nthe benefit of their wisdom or any views that they have on it before we \nseek to adopt it tomorrow, with the full knowledge that we may well \nhave to address it again in conference. It is vitally important for \nlow-income housing in every State in the Nation. I hope that my \ncolleagues will look at it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside for further discussion. I see colleagues on the floor who \nmay wish to speak, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I don't \nwant to interrupt my friend, who was, I think, on the floor before I \ncame. I want to ask a few questions about the section 8 program and \nthis amendment. You have no doubt forgotten more about this than I even \nknow. I have had some meetings about section 8 recently, and I would \nlike to spend some time inquiring about the direction this amendment \nwill take us. So I can do that following the presentation by Senator \nShelby. I am happy to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill before the \nSenate this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, the United States of America is the undisputed leader \nin space technology development and space exploration. We can thank the \nAmerican people for this.\n  It is they who had the foresight to commit to space exploration and \nto demand that we reach beyond what is already within our grasp.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us today continues that fine tradition \nand will help the United States maintain its leading role in space.\n  It fulfills our commitment to space exploration in a number of ways, \nbut primarily by funding the international space station.\n  We have heard on this floor countless times and we will continue to \nhear that we cannot afford such an investment in our future.\n  I cannot explain why someone would choose not to complete this noble \njourney. I can explain, however, why Americans throughout this Nation \ninsist that we must. It is because Americans have always dreamed \nlarger, reached farther, and excelled beyond all expectation. It is an \nAmerican destiny to take this next step in space exploration. We must \nnot quit now.\n  By providing more than $5.3 billion to fund the Human Space Flight \nProgram, which includes the international space station, this bill will \npreserve American leadership in space exploration. I am pleased the \ncommittee chose to continue this great endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight two \nother very important NASA provisions in this bill. The first is the \nWINDSAT Program within Mission to Planet Earth. The Mission to Planet \nEarth Program will provide valuable long-term climate forecasting \ninformation essential to a number of U.S. industries, including \nenvironmental, agricultural, forestry management, and disaster \nprediction and mitigation programs. The most difficult task facing this \nprogram is predicting seasonal and annual climate changes. This is the \npurpose of the WINDSAT Program. The global wind data provided by the \nWINDSAT is critical to Mission to Planet Earth's ability to predict \nthese changes.\n  Without this information, we are getting only part of the picture. \nWINDSAT will provide the data needed to complete that picture. I am \nvery pleased the committee has supported this program.\n  Mr. President, 50 years ago, it would have taken an entire warehouse \nto hold a computer with the capabilities of today's small hand-held \ncalculators. Again and again we have seen how technology development \nreduces size and increases power. This is happening in the satellite \nindustry as well.\n  By the year 2000, advanced microsatellite technologies will yield \nsmall high-power, low-cost satellites, yet launch costs will be \nprohibitively expensive, unless we do something about it.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that the committee has directed an \naugmentation for the low-cost small-launch technology demonstration \nproject.\n  This project promises to establish American leadership in the low-\ncost small-launch market. Without this additional funding, the \nobjectives of the program simply cannot be met. The funding level in \nthis bill will ensure that as microsatellites become available, we will \nhave a cost-effective way to put them into orbit.\n  Mr. President, in short, the bill we have before us today fulfills an \nAmerican vision of our future in space by continuing our commitment to \nspace exploration and high-technology research and development. It will \nensure that we continue on our national journey into space and will \nmean more opportunities and a brighter future for our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to share this vision and support this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to some of the presentation by \nSenators Bond and Mikulski. I indicated that they obviously know much \nmore about section 8 housing than I. I\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\nam certainly not an expert in this area. But I have begun to look at \nsection 8 housing because housing authorities and some others have \ncalled it to my attention and have asked how this can be justified. The \nmore I have reviewed what has happened in section 8 housing, the more I \nhave become convinced that if you were to try to find among the dumbest \nideas on how you might provide housing for low-income folks, among the \ndumbest ideas, you would select the approach selected some 20 years ago \ncalled section 8 housing.\n  It resulted in, as I understand it, a series of very significant tax \nbenefits paid upfront--generous, significant tax benefits paid \nupfront--for the construction of housing with preferential mortgages \nand mortgage amounts being given in excess, in most cases, of what \nwould be provided in normal private sector construction. In addition to \nthat, once the property was built with these tax benefits and with the \npreferential mortgages, section 8 provided a contract for rents that \nprovided automatic escalators every year for whatever the period of the \ncontract--in most cases, 20 years, I understand.\n  The result is, for example, that in a rural county of North Dakota, \nTowner County, the fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment is \n$270. But someone owning a section 8 property is not given the $270, \nbut instead paid a rent of $536. This is a microcosm of what is \nhappening around the country.\n  As you can see from this chart, in Williams County, ND, the fair \nmarket rent would be $263. If you happen to have a series of low-income \nunits in section 8 in Williams County, you wouldn't be getting a check \nfor $263; you would be getting $508.\n  I made a list of these properties just in North Dakota, a tiny little \nfraction of the properties nationally, and discovered that a \nsubstantial amount of money is being paid above market rent. This will \nnot be news to the chair and the ranking member. That is what they are \nattempting to address. That is what they have been talking about. But \nwhen you look at this, let me say at the outset that this is not a case \nof landlords doing anything wrong. The landlords signed up for a \nprogram that was made available by the Government, and the Government \nsaid we want to make sure some housing units are available for low-\nincome people. So here are the incentives. Grab the incentives. Build \nsome units and join in. What has happened, however, over the years is, \nwith these automatic escalators, the rents that are now being charged \nthe taxpayer to house low-income people are outrageous. They are way \nout of whack.\n  I also understand an evaluation has been done recently by Ernst & \nYoung about deferred maintenance costs and short and long-term \nmaintenance requirements on these section 8 properties across the \ncountry. There are, I believe, more than 1 million rental units \nreceiving section 8 subsidies--132,000 of which will come up this year \nfor an extension of the contract. The Ernst & Young study showed that \nthere is somewhere around $9.2 to $10.2 billion in deferred maintenance \ncosts.\n  If that is the case, I ask the question: First, what do we do about \nthis as the contracts expire? Do we simply renew the contracts? If I \nwere a section 8 landlord--again, I emphasize these landlords have done \nnothing wrong. They have simply taken advantage of a fundamentally dumb \nprogram constructed improperly without good forethought in a way that \nwas guaranteed to ravage the taxpayer. But, nonetheless, if I were one \nof those landlords, I suppose I would say, ``Gee, I would like to sign \nup for another 20 or 10 years. Let me sign up at the same rate. Let me \nget $508 for a unit where the fair market rent would be $260. I would \nlike some of that.'' I am sure the landlords would say that. I know \nthat across the country section 8 landlords are saying, ``We want \nextensions at the same rate.''\n  The Senator from Missouri, as I understand his amendment--and I do \nnot understand all of the details of it; that is why I am going to ask \nsome questions--he says, well, these contracts, if extended, are going \nto have to be reduced and the rents are going to have to come down \nsome. But if you bring them down to market rent or fair market rent \nimmediately, these folks who own them will simply walk away. They have \ntheir tax benefits. They have 10, 15, or 20 years of well above market \nrents. They will simply walk away, and all of these properties will be \ndefaulted, or many of them will be defaulted. The Federal Government or \nsomeone will end up owning all of this property.\n  I would like to understand and talk through for a minute where we go \nwith this. I am almost inclined to think that we ought to just decide \nthis construct is so inappropriate, at least given the taxpayers' \ninterests, that maybe we should find a way to get to simply a voucher \nsystem. We could give those who are eligible a voucher that they can \ntake and go find an apartment or a housing unit somewhere. But I do not \nquite understand how we get there from where we are now. And I fully \nagree with the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland. It \nis totally unacceptable and must be changed. It must be altered.\n\n  How do we get from where we are now to where we want to be? It seems \nto me that where we would want to be would be in a circumstance where \nthe taxpayers are helping in providing the incentives for some low-\nincome housing, because I think we need to do that. But the question \nis, how do you get to that point? Can you make a silk purse out of a \nsow's ear? Can you take a program that now exists and conduct an \nexperimental program of some type? Can you create something out of this \nthat the taxpayers will look at and say, ``Yes, that makes sense''? If \nso, how do we do that? I ask the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague asking simple \nquestions. This obviously is a major financial problem. It is a \nquestion of preservation of housing stock, particularly for the elderly \nin rural areas. We also have been sensitive to the cost of this \nhousing. Over the past several years, we have capped the automatic \nescalator, or annual adjustment factor, on section 8 contract rents to \nlimit the upward cost of this housing.\n  In addition, depending on how we treat this housing and the section 8 \nsubsidies, the Federal Government faces significant financial exposure \nas a result of FHA mortgage guarantees on these projects. If we were to \nwalk away from this housing, the FHA insurance fund could be faced with \nthe full cost of these mortgages. This is many billions of dollars of \nrisk and exposure. In addition, mortgage defaults will mean that FHA \nand HUD would have the projects in the HUD inventory, and be \nresponsible for managing and selling them. In some cases, many of the \nbetter projects could command high rents and be taken out of the \npublicly assisted housing program.\n  We have attempted to look at the alternatives. Under the \ndemonstration, HUD could hold a soft second mortgage by paying down the \ninsured project debt to market. This would limit the exposure of FHA \nwhich otherwise could be subject to the exposure of the full amount of \nthe guarantee on project debt. The FHA, the Government, the taxpayers, \nwill have a soft second mortgage on that property which will \nessentially kick in after the first mortgage is paid off. In this way, \nsection 8 would be paid at the market rent and good owners of projects \ncould stay in the program and not be forced into default and \nforeclosure.\n  It was our hope in working with all of the parties involved--as I \nsaid, originally many of them with adverse and competing interests--\nthat we could maintain this housing for those who need assisted housing \nmost by allowing HUD to enter into a demonstration project. We tried to \ninvolve State housing authorities in this project to do the workouts. \nWe have provisions that would permit HUD to set a budget-based rent \nthat would take into account the costs of maintaining the project debt \nservice and operating expenses.\n  Finally, the purpose of the demonstration is to preserve low-income \nhousing at affordable prices. This is critical for the people who \ndepend upon this housing, in North Dakota, as in Missouri. Preservation \nis especially critical for the elderly who depend on these projects in \nrural areas.\n  It is our view that attempting to shut down on the projects and \nvoucher out the people who are displaced would lead to a tremendous \nloss to the FHA insurance fund and a loss of housing. In\n\n[[Page S9729]]\n\nmany areas, there may not be housing to supplant this housing that has \nbeen constructed.\n  I do not intend and will not try to justify the decisions which were \nmade to get us into this crack. We are in a very difficult financial \nsituation. We have a commitment to provide housing. It is my view that \nthis is the best way we can get out of it. If the Senator and his staff \nwould like to work with us and have a better way to do it, I am anxious \nto have improvements. But from our standpoint, having worked with all \nof the competing interests in this, this seems to be the best way to \nminimize the exposure to taxpayers and maintain vitally important \nhousing for those who need assistance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not suggesting there may be a better \nidea. It appears to me that this is a maze from which there is not an \neasy escape. I guess I do not yet understand what a soft second \nmortgage is, and I also want to try to understand how this $10 billion \nin deferred maintenance on these projects, projects for which there \nhave been substantial tax advantages paid up front and substantial rent \nadvantages given over a contract period, how that relates to what one \nmight or might not do with these properties.\n  So I guess the first question I would ask is, what is a soft second \nmortgage? Is there an anticipation that that will be paid? And why \nmight not a landlord simply walk away from a soft second mortgage? \nAfter satisfying the obligation of the next contract period over which \nthe original mortgage is written down and rents are sufficient to \nprovide a profit ostensibly to those property holders, why would they \nnot walk away from a soft second mortgage? I am asking the question \nonly because I do not know anything about this proposal.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. In answer to that question, there are significant tax \nliabilities for an owner who walks away from a project. There were tax \nbenefits which accrued to the people who produced the project in the \nfirst place. Walking away means they lose not only the property, but \nthey also are subject to significant tax recapture.\n  There is a proposal from HUD that the write-down include funds \nsufficient to pay any tax liabilities. I do not agree with that. I do \nnot think that in the housing business we should change the tax \nimplications. But there are very serious tax implications if they walk \naway. The second mortgage is one which does not require payments in the \ninitial years while the first mortgage is being paid off.\n  To address the deferred maintenance, the owners will have access, for \nthe first time, to residual sums which had been set aside in the past \nfor maintenance, and by converting a portion of the debt on the project \nto the soft second and freeing the owners from the responsibility of \npaying that portion, paying current debt service on that portion, that \nwill free up money for the deferred maintenance. Will it handle all of \nit? We cannot say. But there will be a substantial sum made available. \nWe are calling it a demonstration project because we do not know for \nsure how this will work, but it is our best idea of how to deal with \nthese related problems.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I could comment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator first of \nall is right; we use a vocabulary nobody understands, like ``mark-to-\nmarket,'' ``soft seconds,'' and all of that. It is part of budget speak \nand one of the reasons the American people cannot follow much of the \ndebate. The language of Washington is not the language of everyday \npeople nor the language of everyday mortgage speaking, and so on. So I \nwant to acknowledge that.\n\n  Let me first explain to the Senator what ``mark-to-market'' means. It \nis really called multifamily portfolio reengineering. It is a program \ndesigned simply to refinance the FHA-insured project base, meaning that \nit is the actual building. Section 8 assisted multifamily, meaning more \nthan one family lives in it. It is private sector housing. It is not \npublic housing. The Senator is right. It was a program created during \nthe Nixon era and worked, but every good intention got layered on and \nnow we are in a situation where there is a tremendous possible \nliability to the U.S. Government if these mortgages go into default. If \nso, it is like a mini S crisis. What we are all trying to avoid, \nincluding working with the Clinton administration and Secretary \nCisneros, is that.\n  There is no answer. So what we are doing is providing the flexibility \nfor refinancing and restructuring. If you are a lousy landlord, you are \ngoing to be pushed out. They will not renew it. We are all in kind of \nthis quagmire. This demonstration project is providing flexibility to \nthe local government.\n  But let me come back to what the Senator says, how he needs to \nunderstand this. I want to understand it, too. The best explanation, \nquite frankly--and I mention it for the Senator's staff--the Baltimore \nSun in a column called, ``The Perspective,'' August 18, had an \nexceptional article done by John Barth, who was the chief economist at \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision during President Bush, and Robert \nLitan, who is the director of economic studies at Brookings. He goes \nthrough what this time bomb is, and it is a time bomb, including a \nvariety of the options that we have at our disposal. There are none \nthat are easy. There are none that are simple. There are none that are \ncheap. So what we are in the process of doing with the Bond amendment \nis beginning the process of getting our hand around it.\n  Now, I could go through item after item after item on tax \nconsequences, and so on. But I do not know that it would serve the \nSenator, and also perhaps we could get this even Xeroxed because we \nwill be debating this tomorrow. But one thing the Clinton \nadministration agrees upon, and I believe the Republican Caucus as well \nas our side, is this is a time bomb, and where ultimately we might go \nto vouchers or some other thing, right now we have this, and we will be \nfaced with this I would say for the next 3 to 5 years.\n  I know this because of a problem in Maryland where the guy took the \nsection 8 money, did nothing on maintaining it. HUD, Maryland HUD, \npreferred sitting in an air-conditioned office rather than going out \nstanding sentry on these projects, and now this guy is walking away \nfrom it. I have an IG report on it. I cannot go into it in more detail.\n  So you have the bums like what I had in Riverdale, in Maryland, and \nthen you have others that got into it--well-intentioned, aging \nprojects, section 8, tax credits--but now they cannot continue to pay \nthat rent and so they say, ``Whoops, we are now caught. How can we work \nit out?'' And the Bond amendment is how to deal at the local level with \nlandlords, owners who are ready to deal in good faith so we do not \nplace the tenants in jeopardy and we do not place the taxpayers in \njeopardy. It is the beginning of a process, and the only tool we have \nis to restructure these mortgages and to begin to kind of phase them \nout. Will the Senator characterize that as accurate?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am advised by the distinguished majority \nwhip that he needs to offer amendments, I believe, that are required on \nthe unanimous consent.\n  If there is no objection, I will yield the floor to allow him to meet \nthe 5 o'clock deadline which was previously entered into. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. \nNickles] is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9691-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9729-S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Under the unanimous \nconsent agreement entered into prior to our recess for the August \nbreak, we entered into a unanimous consent agreement on a bill called \nthe Defense of Marriage Act. Under the time agreement, it called for \nbringing this act up on Thursday of this week with each side permitted \nto offer up to four amendments. Those amendments must be submitted, \neach side, by 5 o'clock today.\n\n[[Page S9730]]\n\n  This Senator, on behalf of Senator Lott and others, submitted three \namendments. But I want to tell the minority leader and others it is our \nhope there will be no amendments adopted to the Defense of Marriage \nAct. We submitted those basically so we would have those in as possible \namendments, should an amendment on the other side by adopted. So I \nwanted to make sure that the minority leader, that Senator Kennedy and \nothers, who have an interest in this--at least it is this Senator's \nhope and desire there will be no amendments adopted to the Defense of \nMarriage Act. Under the unanimous consent agreement that was called \nfor, we did just submit three amendments for their consideration. But, \nagain, it is this Senator's hope that we will consider the bill and \npass it expeditiously. The House passed it overwhelmingly. Hopefully, \nthe Senate will as well, without any further amendments, so it can go \nto the President for his expected signature.\n  I thank my colleagues from Missouri and Maryland and North Dakota for \ntheir willingness to let me make this statement. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9729-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9730-S9735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I also wanted to follow \nup on the question the Senator from Maryland addressed. I think the \ninformation she provided is most helpful. I note many of the \ncontractual arrangements, including the excessively large mortgages and \nexcessive contract rents, are due to contractual agreements made by the \nFederal Government 20 or 30 years ago. Some excessive costs have \nresulted from some of the Federal regulations and standards, which \ncould be characterized as onerous, that applied to these projects. \nOther costs are due to the very difficult areas where the projects were \nbeing built. They were trying to get people into areas where you would \nnot normally build multifamily housing. This included going into rural \nareas where there is elderly population, or projects in depressed inner \ncity areas where costs of construction were very high.\n  Some of the multifamily housing in this portfolio represents the \nonly--or certainly the best standard housing in many areas, or the only \nhousing available to low-income families. Our purpose is to squeeze out \nthe excessive subsidies. But we also have to be sensitive to the \ncritical housing needs of the low-income families, and especially the \nelderly who were subsidized--assisted by the project. That is why this \nis a very difficult problem. That is why we are engaged in this \ndiscussion of how we get out of a bad situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not my intention to be critical, and I hope I have \nnot in any way been critical of what the Senator is trying to do.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Not at all.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am trying to understand what the problem is and what \nthe potential solutions are. While there are undoubtedly some other \nelements of the cause of the problems in section 8, I think it is fair \nto say the 500-pound gorilla here started with an idea that must have \nseemed right to those who propounded it, but in retrospect it was a \npretty dumb idea. It put us in the position, in small towns in this \ncountry, of having the Federal taxpayer pay $500 or $600 a month rent \nfor one-bedrooms that everybody in town knows would not rent for that, \nwould not rent for half that.\n  The problem is not only that you are wasting a lot money--when I say, \n``you,'' I mean the Federal Government--not only are we wasting a lot \nof money, we are also undermining public confidence again in \nGovernment. Because instead of this being the right approach that \nthoughtfully provides housing for those who need it, it provides \nhousing, over a period of some many years, at rents that are so \nsubstantially above the market. That is why I am asking the questions.\n  It may be that the approach suggested is the right approach, I just \ndo not know. I am trying to think through this myself. I do not know \nthat there is the right idea to extract ourselves from this problem. \nBut both the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland \nindicated this is kind of a time bomb because this problem does not get \nbetter, it gets worse unless it gets solved. The quicker it gets solved \nthe better off are the taxpayers.\n  The Senator from Missouri just made a point I fully agree with. You \ncannot solve this problem without being mindful of the housing needs of \nthe people who rely on the housing stock. I understand that. If there \nare 132,000 units that are going to come up for renewal this year in \nsection 8, and somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million that eventually \nwill come up whose contracts expire, the question is: what happens to \nthose who rely on or who have needs for public housing that are now \nsatisfied by those units. I do not know the answer to that. But it is \nalso clear to me we cannot sustain nor should the taxpayers expect us \nto make a decision ever to sustain what has been done. Because it has \ngrown into a circumstance where it is a grotesque caricature of what it \nought to be.\n  When you ask someone in a small town, small county in North Dakota, \nhow much should you have to pay for a one-bedroom unit to solve some \nlow-income person's housing needs, no one would come up with the amount \nthat is now being paid to that project owner. The project owner has not \ndone anything wrong, he has simply taken advantage of a program that, \nin my judgment, was inappropriately constructed, that allows this \nmangled result to occur.\n  Let me ask one additional question and, again, I do not mean to be \nputting you on the spot because this is not the area you would \nnecessarily be involved in. You are involved in the appropriations \nnecessary to pursue the goals of these housing programs that are \nauthorized.\n  In today's paper, Mr. Gugliotta has an article that talks about \nsection 8 landlords. It says, ``Law Says Section 8 Landlords Can Keep \nIt All in the Family.'' The article talks about a fellow in Allegheny \nCounty, the controller for that county, who is supposed to be \ncollecting taxes who thought he would start dunning low-income \nlandlords for failing to pay local property taxes. This is a quote now:\n\n       During his investigation, however, he happened upon an \n     anomaly. Nearly 100 landlords in the greater Pittsburgh area \n     were receiving federal subsidies for renting apartments and \n     houses to their supposedly poor relatives.\n\n  All of this, according to this story, was under section 8. That, it \nseems to me, is a dilemma. He sent this to Secretary Cisneros, who \nindicated he had not heard of such practices.\n  It is just another small example of something in that system that \njust smells to high heaven.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I might respond to the Senator from North Dakota, I \nread that article this morning, too. It was the first I have ever heard \nof this in my 10 years of being on this subcommittee, where someone \nowns a property, rents it to a relative, and then gets a section 8 to \npay for the relative's rent. The gentleman referred to is Mr. Frank \nLucchino, a very well-regarded public official in, I believe, the \nPittsburgh area of the State of Pennsylvania. That is Allegheny County.\n  I was quite concerned and had intended to talk with Senator Bond \nabout that this afternoon. No. 1, I think Cisneros owes us an \nexplanation. No. 2, this says exactly the point that I made: HUD is not \nstanding sentry on its section 8, nor is local government. It has met \noften compelling needs. There are many good landlords. But there have \nalso been bums and scams and schemes along the way. We need to clear \nthose out.\n  I was going to suggest to Senator Bond that we have an inspector \ngeneral look into this, rather than GAO, because I think we will get a \nquicker response. And as you know, the inspector general is intimately \nfamiliar with all the details of both the financing and management of \nHUD.\n  So I assure the Senator from North Dakota and anyone who has read \nthat article and wonders what is up that we are going to get a response \nfrom Mr. Cisneros. I would like to recommend that we get an IG report \non it. But I am like you. There are the tenants, the\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\ngood-guy landlords, the well-intentioned taxpayers. And then under \nevery rock we seem to find another rock on section 8.\n  What disturbs me is that in some instances, because of poorly \nmaintained buildings, it has been a hollow opportunity for the poor. \nAll we have is unaccountable private-sector housing imitating the worst \nof the public housing. Second, we have many good landlords, but we have \nalso in some instances--like Riverdale in Maryland had a new slum \nlandlord, and then to add insult, the taxpayers were left holding the \nmortgage for $5 million.\n  So we have a lot to do here. And to Mr. Cisneros' credit, and really \nto Senator Bond, and working on our committee, Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator D'Amato with the authorizing, we're trying to dig out. But the \nSenator from North Dakota, he knows when he walks into a stable, \nsometimes doing it one shovel at a time is difficult; but we will get \nto it.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will follow up the comments by my \ncolleague from Maryland. If there was ever an Augean stable that had to \nbe cleaned out, it is probably HUD. What was referred to in the article \ntoday by our colleague and what our colleague from North Dakota \nmentioned is a real problem of management by HUD of its facilities and \nall of the housing that it provides.\n  It is my belief and understanding that HUD has the authority to deal \nwith these problems. And there are a lot more problems. Let me assure \nyou just renting to relatives and getting section 8 contracts is not \nthe whole game. There is equity skimming. There are many other abuses.\n  One of the things we have attempted to do in recent years is to get \nHUD to focus on its job which is assuring that we provide good, clean, \naffordable housing to people who are entitled to it and do not pay one \ncent more out of the taxpayers' hard-earned money than we should pay. \nMany of us have been on the floor ranting and raving that we have put \ntoo many programs into HUD. Congress has been at fault. We have some \n240 programs that HUD is supposed to administer. And we have chastised \nthe Secretary and predecessors of HUD for coming up with new ideas and \nnew programs. And almost every week there has been a new program coming \nout of HUD. Some of us in frustration have said: Stop. Time out. Stop \ncreating new programs. Focus the resources on the programs that you \nhave because there are problems.\n  I think this problem that has been identified in the article demands \nan IG investigation. What was it that allowed this kind of an abuse of \nthe system to go forward? Any program that is this large will attract \nsome abuses. Are we doing enough? Do we have a system set up within the \nDepartment to identify these abuses? And if there are violations of the \nlaw, are we referring those to the appropriate authorities either for \ncivil or criminal penalties?\n  I think there is a lot to the administration side of it that needs to \nbe addressed. Fortunately, the Senator from Maryland and I have the \nvery simple task of appropriating the dollars. When you look at the \ntask of authorizing the programs in the Banking Committee, that is \nanother headache. When you look at administering the programs and the \nexecutive side, that is a very large headache. And that is one which I \nthink rightly deserves scrutiny.\n  We will join with, if the inspector general happens not to be \nlistening to this debate today, in requesting of the inspector general \nthat they do give us a report on that particular situation and how well \nHUD is equipped to deal with abuses such as these, and others. I thank \nmy friend from North Dakota for bringing this out into the discussion \non the floor today because it is just this kind of abuse of the system \nthat rightfully drives taxpayers nuts.\n  I do not think anybody or certainly a very small number of people in \nthe country would say that they did not want to provide housing \nassistance for those in great need. But there is an overwhelming \nmajority that say we should not be paying one cent to provide a section \n8 payment to somebody who is using a Federal program as a scam to get \nmoney off of housing a relative. I think that administration of the \nprogram is a very, very difficult challenge, one, frankly, I would not \nwant under any circumstances.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will finish at this point. If the \nSenator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland are going to ask \nthe inspector general to look into this, I would be delighted to join \nthem in that request. I think that we should do that. I would be happy \nto join them. Let me just make an additional comment. The job that the \nappropriators have here is a difficult enough job, and the dimensions \nof this are very complicated. This is a very difficult issue. And I \nwant to understand this evening a little bit--reading through what your \nproposal is--what soft second mortgages are and what some of the \nterminology is because I must confess I do not understand all of it.\n  I had intended, not only to come and ask questions about section 8 \ntoday, friendly questions I hope, but also to bring some pictures to \nthe floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so. I hope \nto do so when the Interior appropriations bill comes to the floor, to \nsay this: I stood on a street in a very small community recently on an \nIndian reservation and looked around 360 degrees, and I saw HUD-owned \nhousing--owned by HUD, I believe managed by the tribal housing \nauthority--that was in such desperate condition it was absolutely \nshocking.\n  I have seen bad housing. I have seen housing that is unfit to live in \nall over the world, and in this country, but I have not ever seen \nhousing in such disrepair owned by the Federal Government--holes in the \nwalls, holes in the roof, windows missing, front steps gone, never \npainted, never maintained. I have seen better looking housing in \nNicaragua. And Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in this \nhemisphere. I was shocked to see the condition of some of the housing \nstock owned by the Federal Government. Shame on the Federal Government \nfor having its name on housing, for which there is a 3-year wait to get \nin, that is almost unfit for habitation.\n  I say to the Senator from Missouri, he is correct, this deals with \nmanagement. It does not deal with politics. HUD has been guilty, in my \njudgment, for mismanagement for some long while. We need to get at \nthese problem areas, and get at them now. There are little children \nplaying out there in the dirt in front of those places who live in \nthose places. I am telling you, what I saw there was absolutely \nshocking. I am going to bring pictures to the floor of the Senate to \nshow my colleagues what I have seen.\n  Let me mention one additional point. The day after I visited those \nareas on one Indian reservation, I went to a second Indian reservation. \nAnd they had some of the same kind of housing, but they had something \nelse that made me leave that reservation feeling a little bit good at \nwhat was going on. On that reservation they had taken some kids, some \nkids who had troubled backgrounds, and as part of AmeriCorps, they put \nthem in something called the Youthbuild project. And those kids were \nlearning to become associate carpenters, helping to restore a little \nhouse. And they did a wonderful job restoring this house for a near-\ninvalid elderly couple. The couple came to the house the day that I was \nthere, and it was the first time they saw what had been done to restore \ntheir house to make it livable. And you should have seen the tears in \nthe eyes of the woman who was seeing that house and the kitchen for the \nfirst time.\n  You should have seen these young kids, as part of AmeriCorps and \nYouthbuild, who now had learned to plumb a door, who now had learned to \nhang a door, who now had learned the basic carpentry skills of how to \nhang closets. It was a wonderful thing. A lot of things you see are \nshocking but there are some things you see that give you a little hope, \nas well. There is some good work going on.\n\n  I cited the Indian reservation and the Youthbuild project, a small \nlittle project, helping some kids help others by restoring housing \nunits, because if we can replicate that thousands of times across this \ncountry, we will help a lot of people and we will address the right \nissues.\n  I regret I was not able to bring the pictures today of the housing I \ndescribed initially. I intend to do that in\n\n[[Page S9732]]\n\nthe next day or two so that Members of the Senate can see what I saw \nand see the shame of the Federal Government having the title in its \nname of housing, for which there is a 3-year waiting period to get in, \nand housing which, in my judgment, is nearly unlivable.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To respond to the Senator from North Dakota about \nAmeriCorps Youthbuild, it is this subcommittee and with the concurrence \nand cooperation of Senator Bond and Senator Hatfield that we have \nrestored the House cuts. Again, it is not some Government giveaway. It \nis almost like a conservation corps, but instead of outdoor work it is \nfocused on rehabilitating housing.\n  In their own way, youths learn those skills and go into the private \nsector. Some of the kids that are now working in Youthbuild, not only \ndid we stop them from being dead-end kids, but you will go back to \nNorth Dakota and see that they will be members of the North Dakota Home \nBuilders Association, and I mark-to-market my words on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was not aware that was something originated by your \nsubcommittee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We saved it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank you for doing that and tell you I have seen \nyoung kids whose lives are turning around because of it. I have seen \nelderly people who had tears in their eyes when they saw the work the \nkids have done to improve housing.\n  If ever there is an investment that makes sense, this is the kind of \ninvestment that improves kids' lives and improves housing in this \ncountry. That is a good place to end, so I say thank you for saving \nthat program because I think it is a wonderful promise that represents \nthe best of what we can do in Government.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join in thanking our colleague from North \nDakota for his kind comments about Youthbuild. We did put in the $40 \nmillion requested for that program.\n  I, too, have seen the benefits in St. Louis of the Youthbuild \nProgram. I regret to inform my colleague that if he wants to deal with \nthe problems of Indian housing, we do that, too. That is not Interior. \nThat is in this committee. We will have, in the public housing reform \nbill that is working its way through the authorizing committees, there \nis a chapter that is in conference between the Senate and House Banking \nCommittees that would reform Indian housing. Indian housing is unique. \nIt has unique solutions. Instead of HUD micromanaging responsibilities, \nunder the authorizing bill that is now in conference, the \nresponsibility would be returned to the tribes to address their own \nneeds.\n  I suggest our colleague may want to take some time to acquaint \nhimself with the provisions in that public housing bill that deal with \nIndian housing, because I share the concerns about Indian housing and \nhow the U.S. Government has not done a good job in addressing those \nneeds. We do Youthbuild, we do Indian housing, we do AmeriCorps, \nNational Science Foundation, lots of things you never heard of. We are \nsort of a general complaint window and always glad to have comments and \nparticipation by our Members in these programs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand.\n  My only point was I was not able to get the photographs, but when we \ntalk about Indian issues in the next appropriations bill I will show \nthe photographs to the Senate at that point.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5175\n\n    (Purpose: To provide HUD authority to provide special incentive \n  payments to encourage voluntary retirements to extent necessary to \n   avoid a reduction in force (RIF), subject to a $25,000 limitation)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment relating to \nreductions in force in HUD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5175.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 59, after line 2, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . In order to avoid or minimize the need for \n     involuntary separations due to a reduction in force, \n     departmental restructuring, reorganization, transfer of \n     function, or similar action affecting the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary shall establish \n     a program under which separation pay, subject to the \n     availability of appropriated funds, may be offered to \n     encourage employees to separate from service voluntarily, \n     whether by retirement or resignation: Provided, That payments \n     to individual employees shall not exceed $25,000: Provided \n     further, That in addition to any other payments which it is \n     required to make under subchapter III of chapter 83 or \n     chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, HUD shall remit to \n     the Office of Personnel Management for deposit in the \n     Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to 15 \n     percent of the final basic pay of each employee who is \n     covered under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of \n     title 5 to whom a voluntary separation incentive has been \n     paid under this paragraph''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe this amendment is cleared on both \nsides. This amendment is being submitted pursuant to a request from the \nSecretary of HUD which inserts language similar to that provided in \nthis bill for NASA which proposes a buyout provision to address the \nsubstantial personnel reductions confronting the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development at headquarters and in several other locations.\n  The buyout authority would enable the agency to meet its personnel \ntargets without resorting to very disruptive and potentially costly RIF \nprocedures.\n  In addition, to make this subject to the availability of appropriated \nfunds, the language requires HUD to reimburse the civil service fund \nfor expected loss revenue and increase beneficiary payments from \nappropriated funds. These limitations assure that no net increase in \nthe expenditures would occur during fiscal year 1997.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I absolutely support Senator Bond's \namendment. We worked very closely on this. We think it is what we need \nto downsize Government without downgrading HUD. It gives, essentially, \nmany of the employees the opportunity to be able to take an early \nretirement. We think that is a good idea. We support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5175) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       board of veterans' appeals\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies, Senator \nChristopher Bond, in a colloquy regarding processing veterans' claims \nand the reduction of the claims backlog due to the efforts of the Board \nof Veterans' Appeals [BVA].\n  The Board of Veterans' Appeals [BVA] is responsible for the final \ndecision in each of the many thousands of claims for entitlement to \nveterans benefits that are presented annually for appellate review. The \nBoard's mission is to issue quality decisions in a timely manner. The \ntimeliness of BVA's decision-making has come under intense scrutiny as \nunprecedented appellate backlogs have developed in recent years, \nprimarily as a result of the process of adapting to a judicial review \nenvironment. However, beginning in 1995, BVA has done much to reverse \nthis trend and is making progress in reducing the time veterans must \nwait for decisions on appeals.\n  Mr. President, in 1994 our veterans had to wait 781 days, over 2 \nyears, for an appelant decision on their benefits and medical claims. \nThis response time was reduced to 763 days in 1995. This reduction was \nstill possible even with an increase of approximately 4,500 cases. Thus \nfar in 1996 the response time has been reduced even further to 623 \ndays. The anticipated appeals response time will be reduced to 545 days \nupon implementation of the BVA's staff increase by 50 attorneys in \n1997. While this time is still too long for America's veterans\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\nto wait, it represents a substantial reduction from 1994 in the waiting \ntime for appeals.\n  I believe two factors are responsible for the improvements in the BVA \ndecision output and timeliness: First, productivity has increased at \nall levels, primarily as a result of the Board's successful \nimplementation of its organizational realignment at the outset of 1996 \nand second, additional staffing resources made available in fiscal year \n1996 have enabled the Board to add additional attorneys to the mission \ncritical tasks of reviewing and drafting decisions on appeals. The \nBoard's principal indicator of productivity is the number of appeals \ndecided per full time employee [FTE]. As of may 31, 1996, BVA appeals \ndecided per FTE had risen over 20 percent to a level of 80.1 from the \nfiscal year 1995 level of 65.1 appeals per FTE. This compares with \nfiscal year 1994's productivity of 49.9 appeals per FTE.\n  As the distinguished chairman is aware the other body approved the $4 \nmillion to fund the additional 50 positions on the Board. The bill \nbefore us specifically removes that funding. While the funding adding \nthe 50 positions will decrease the processing time and lead to long \nterm reduction, what is just as important is the impact of not adding \nthose 50 positions. The processing time will not only increase in the \nnear future, but will continue to increase and that is why I'm so \nconcerned over the $4 million reduction.\n  I ask the chairman of the VA/HUD Subcommittee on Appropriations to \nsupport the $4 million request to the Board of Veterans' Appeals for an \nadditional 50 staff so that we may continue to reduce the veterans' \nappeals response time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen. I think it's \nworth remembering that this $4 million increase at the Board of \nVeterans' Appeals [BVA] is supported by the American Legion, the \nDisabled American Veterans, AMVETS, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The administration asked for this \nmoney and the House of Representatives has included the increase in its \nbill. Thus, the support for this increase is substantial.\n  I understand that there are various studies looking at the \nadjudication process at the VA, including the appellate process. The \ncommittee's report points that out. However, we will not receive these \nresults until December, and although this and future studies are \nongoing, we cannot delay addressing the horrendous backlog at the BVA. \nStudies are fine, Mr. President, but we have veterans that could \nbenefit now with an increase of 50 BVA personnel for only $4 million \nwithin a $84.71 billion bill. According to the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs, failure to increase funding levels for the BVA would mean that \nveterans will have to wait an additional five months to have their \nappeals decided. To many, that may not seem like a long time. I believe \nthat most surviving World War II veterans would disagree.\n  So I will conclude by asking the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bond, to support an additional $4 million for the \nBVA in the VA/HUD appropriations bill when it goes to conference with \nthe House.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would also like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the senior Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] and the \nSenator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords].\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have a \nspecial interest in the Board of Veterans' Appeals. In 1994, our \ncommittee sought to address the unacceptable backlog of pending claims \nand passed legislation that streamlined the Board's process and helped \nretain experienced and qualified judges.\n  This year, the President, veterans organizations, and the House of \nRepresentatives agreed to increase the Board's appropriations by $4 \nmillion to further reduce its response time. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs has indicated that the additional funds will reduce the \nprocessing time by 132 days in fiscal year 1997 and 272 days in fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee did not fund the administration's \nrequest. I understand the committee is awaiting the results of studies \nbeing undertaken on the effectiveness and efficiency of the \nadjudication and appeals system and decided against providing the \nadditional funds. I, however, believe that the money will provide much \nneeded relief to veterans currently waiting for a response from the \nBoard. A veteran should not have to wait over a year and a half for a \ndecision. We need to reduce the average response time and address the \nresults of the studies when they are completed and made available to \nthe appropriate committees for action.\n  Therefore, I respectfully request that the chairman and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, \nHUD and independent agencies support the restoration of the $4 million \nin conference.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of Senators Cohen, \nJeffords, and Akaka. I can assure them that I will consider their \nrequest for $4 million for the Board of Veterans' Appeals, in \nconference with the House. Reducing the response time to process \nveterans claims is extremely important. I believe the BVA should \ncontinue to look at improving the process, in addition to looking at \nacquiring more staff to process the claims.\n\n\n           federal emergency management activities in arizona\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I take the \ntime of the Senate today to discuss an issue involving my State that \nshould have been resolved years ago. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency--the funding of which we are now discussing--has not given \nArizona the same prompt response other States have enjoyed.\n  We have seen FEMA respond to the needs of communities across the \ncountry, helping the American people put their lives and property back \ntogether after major catastrophes. In Arizona, however, several \ncommunities have been living with the damage caused by a flood in early \n1993, for which they have yet to receive FEMA's help in restoring \nsignificant damage.\n  The areas damaged, and as yet unrepaired, include the Wellton-Mohawk \nIrrigation and Drainage District, the town of Kearny, and Romero and \nAravaipa Roads in Pinal County, AZ.\n  The Arizona congressional delegation first contacted FEMA Director \nJames Lee Witt in September 1995 to express our concern and dismay \nabout unresolved repair projects from the 1993 Presidential declared \ndisaster. In a meeting last October with Director Witt, he pledged that \nhe would immediately get his staff to work on resolving the outstanding \nissues that had prevented the completion of the disaster repairs in \nArizona. Shortly thereafter, a member of his staff visited Arizona and \npromised action. There was no discernible progress toward resolution of \nthe problems until March 1996.\n  In March, during another meeting with FEMA's Washington staff, our \nconstituents were dismayed to learn that FEMA had failed to follow \nthrough on the commitments made by agency staff during the fall visit \nto Arizona. It is incomprehensible that FEMA has failed to fulfill its \nobligation in any of the projects which have been its responsibility \nsince the disaster was declared in early 1993.\n  As a result, the town of Kearny has not yet seen restoration of its \nairport, a recreational park, or a campground destroyed by the \nflooding. Delays in constructing a flood control levee have left the \ntown's sewer treatment ponds susceptible to further flood damage and \nhave left the Gila River exposed to the threat of contamination from \nthe ponds.\n  River crossings for Romero and Aravaipa Roads remain unrestored. \nSchool children have been forced to cross the Gila River at the Romero \nRoad crossing by walking across a 1,300 foot railroad bridge with \nfrequent train activity and not enough clearance for both the trains \nand the children. At the Aravaipa crossing, families are required to \nleave vehicles on both sides of Aravaipa Creek and traverse the \ncrossing by rope in order to commute to their jobs and bring food \nsupplies and other basic staples to their homes when the creek is \nimpassable. Emergency service to both communities are severely hampered \nby the lack of adequate crossings.\n\n[[Page S9734]]\n\n  Again, this flood damage occurred some 3\\1/2\\ years ago. Despite a \nPresidential disaster declaration, these important public facilities \nremain closed.\n  We understand that there are regulations and requirements governing \nthe restoration of facilities following a disaster. Especially in light \nof FEMA's recent history, it is imperative that taxpayer funds not be \nspent unwisely and without justification. However, this is not the \nissue in these cases.\n  FEMA has simply not given these Arizona projects the attention \nnecessary to get them completed. And when agency personnel have worked \non Arizona's projects, they have proven to be more adept at throwing up \nbureaucratic obstacles than at helping these small communities--as they \nhave helped hundreds of other towns and cities around the country in \nthe 3\\1/2\\ years since areas of Arizona were flooded.\n  In one instance, FEMA notified the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District \nin May that its project would be funded, conditioned on the completion \nof all environmental requirements. Apparently unknown to the FEMA \nofficial writing the letter, however, the District had already \ncompleted the necessary environmental documentation--to the \nsatisfaction of the Corps of Engineers and with the instrumental \nparticipation of FEMA staff.\n  Nonetheless, FEMA officials have spent the months from early May \nuntil now trying to decide whether additional environmental work must \nbe done. I was informed this week that FEMA has agreed to complete the \nenvironmental work by early November. But given our past experience \nwith FEMA, there is no certainty that the commitment will be kept. This \nsort of delay and indecision are simply unconscionable, and I would \nsuggest that the distinguished committee chairman would grow very \nimpatient if disaster-stricken areas in his State were treated so \nirresponsibly by Federal officials charged with their recovery.\n  I would ask that the chairman take note of FEMA's failure to provide \neven an adequate level of attention to Arizona's disaster-affected \ncommunities.\n  Mr. BOND. I will make note of the circumstances in Arizona. As you \nhave mentioned, if a disaster had occurred in my State, I would expect \nFEMA to respond quickly. We recognize that FEMA has worked to help many \nareas around the country, but it appears that they need to complete \ntheir commitments in Arizona. Could the Senator from Arizona tell me \nhow long the communities have waited for a resolution?\n  Mr. KYL. In 1993, a flood caused severe damage to four areas of \nArizona. They were considered Federal disaster areas. The Arizona \ncongressional delegation met with Director Witt in October of last \nyear. He assured us that FEMA would move promptly to conclude the \nunresolved issues in Arizona. So to answer the chairman's question, the \ncommunities have been living in damaged areas since 1993 and roughly 10 \nmonths have elapsed since FEMA recommitted itself to solving the \nproblems quickly.\n  Mr. BOND. Have they completed any of the projects?\n  Mr. KYL. No.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand the Senator's concern especially given that 3 \nyears have passed without relief. I appreciate the Senator's bringing \nthis to my attention, and I will do what I can to work with the Arizona \ndelegation to rectify the situation.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the chairman for recognizing the problems in Arizona \nand for his leadership on this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have been open for business for 3\\1/2\\ \nhours today. We have handled some routine matters and had a very good \ndiscussion on mark to market.\n  We would like to know if there are any other Members who have \nanything they wish to act on this afternoon. We have major amendments \nthat will have to be debated tomorrow. We certainly hope that we can \nconclude this bill sometime between the resolutions or actions on the \nsituation in Iraq and the Defense of Marriage Act. I hope that the very \nimportant programs that are covered by VA, HUD, and independent \nagencies bill will be given full consideration. If there are any other \namendments or actions today, I ask that they be brought forward.\n  I yield the floor and ask my colleague if she has any further \ncomments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think we have gotten a lot \naccomplished. We look forward to tomorrow moving our bill in a crisp \nway. We ask all Democratic Senators who have amendments to please \nnotify my staff, and on all of the major ones we hope to be working on \ntime agreements, particularly those related to the space station. We \nknow Senator Daschle has an amendment, which is very important, on \nveterans health care. We know one will involve experimental research \nwith animals in the space program. We hope to deal with those.\n  We say to our colleagues, please notify us. If you don't need to \noffer an amendment, and we can resolve it, please discuss it with us. \nAs we have seen in colloquies, people of good will and good manners can \nget a lot done pretty quickly.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been advised by floor staff that \nthere will be a briefing on the situation in Iraq tomorrow afternoon. I \nbelieve leadership is working to get a very short time agreement on a \nresolution. We have had indications that the Senators involved in the \nBion amendment for NASA would be willing to accept a 2-hour time \nagreement. Is it possible to get a time agreement from, say, 9:30 to \n11:30 tomorrow morning, with a vote at 11:30 on or in relation to the \nNASA Bion amendment? I pose that question to my colleague for further \ndiscussion with the leadership on the minority side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Several things. We cannot agree to a time agreement on \nthe Daschle amendment. I don't know whether he would like his amendment \nto go first. We hope to have that clarified.\n  Second, for many of our Members, there is a request from the \nDemocratic leader that votes be postponed until after the caucus, and I \nthink that is not only for our side, but your Members who are also \nflying back. So we are trying to find out whether in the morning there \nwill be, first, a resolution on Iraq or whether we can go to Bion. I am \nready to go to Bion.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. It was the intent, I \nbelieve, of the majority leader to move--or it was hoped that we could \nmove forward on the Bion amendment and have a vote at 11:30. It appears \nthat this has been raised to a higher pay grade than ours. So it cannot \nbe resolved at this time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Missouri that I believe when \nwe convene tomorrow morning, and the two leaders will have conferred \nabout how they want to pace the day, both in terms of a resolution \nrelating to Iraq, and then from there proceed back to our bill. I \nbelieve the Democratic leader wishes to speak to the Republican leader, \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, about what they want to go first. So \nI am not quite sure how that will all be worked out.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I don't think anybody is particularly \nconcerned about what time we have votes, so long as we can reach an \nagreement. On behalf of the majority leader, and really on behalf of \nthose of us who worked on this bill, I hope we will be able to come up \nwith an orderly procedure, get agreements on the order in which we will \nbring up these very important amendments, when we can get a resolution, \nget a time agreement, and get final passage. For my part, we are ready. \nWe have been ready since early August to go forward with this. We have \nvery difficult and constructive disagreements to work out with the \nHouse over this measure so we can get it passed. We really want to move \nforward on it as quickly as possible. So all things are negotiable. I \nhope we can get an orderly procedure and handle these amendments, which \nwill require some good debate, and get them done tomorrow as quickly as \npossible.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Missouri, I believe we will \nhave an orderly procedure. I believe we are in a situation because of \ntwo factors. One is because of the Iraq situation. There is a question \nof when we will do a resolution on that, which was not anticipated.\n  No. 2, many Members are not yet back for the two leaders to be able \nto confer and do this. I think we are clear for where we are going. It \nis just a matter for the two leaders to talk and for us to work on a \ntime agreement.\n  I tried to get an agreement on the space station. I have tried for \nthree\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\nCongresses to get a time agreement from the Senator from Arkansas. So \nwe are all working on this. I think by the time we get to tomorrow we \nwill be a little clearer on the order and our pacing. It is just a \nmatter of getting everybody focused. People are just flying in now from \nthe break.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Maryland. We can have debate on \nthe space station all night tonight, as far as I am concerned. For \nthose who wish to debate a new entitlement program, that could go on as \nlong as we want tonight. This facility is not being used otherwise. I \nhope that when we get ready to begin voting tomorrow, we will be able \nto have votes in a timely fashion.\n  At this point, the floor staff is checking with the leadership. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9730-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sophie \nGerson, a remarkable New Yorker who provides a superb example of how \none citizen can make an important difference. In particular, she has \nshown how one dedicated educator can pass on a brighter future to \nnumerous young people. Through her dedication to education, as a \nparent, parent association leader, teacher, school board member and \npresident, Sophie has been an important leader for better education in \nthe city of New York and our Nation.\n  Sophie Gerson taught physical education and health in public junior \nhigh schools in lower income areas of New York City for over 36 years. \nShe endured budget cuts, increases in class sizes and other adverse \nconditions to make sure all of her students would enjoy a healthier and \nmore successful future. She imparted health skills, athletic skills, \nand the values of team work, sportsmanship, and healthy competition. \nShe took an interest in coaching students in dance and, as a result, \nstudents were able to rise out of poverty by pursuing dance-related \ncareers. Upon Sophie Gerson's retirement from teaching, her students \ncomposed the following tribute to her:\n\n     Mrs. Gerson gave new meaning to the word protect\n     Because she taught us to apply it to ourselves\n     We will not be a generation whose health is wrecked\n     And we'll put trophies she inspired on our shelves.\n\n  Recently, many of her former students paid the ultimate tribute that \ncould be bestowed on a teacher by remembering and honoring Sophie many \nyears after she had taught them at an award ceremony by the Puerto \nRican Family Institute.

A bill to reform the budget and oversight processes of the \nCongress; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one committee reports, the other committee \nhave thirty days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n          the budget process and oversight reform act of 1996\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation designed to improve the way Congress conducts its business. \nThis legislation, entitled the ``Budget Process and Oversight Reform \nAct of 1996,'' would create a 2-year budget process, and provide \ndesignated times for Congress to conduct oversight and work in their \nhome States or districts.\n  As anyone who has followed Congress over the years knows, the changes \nproposed in this legislation are not new. However, in the past, \nproposals to create a 2-year budget and move toward a citizen \nlegislature have languished in Congress.\n   Mr. President, I will do everything in my power to assure that these \nproposals get the most thorough consideration. In fact, I have already \nbegun the process of reviewing them in Congress. In late July, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Management \nand Accountability, which I chair, held a hearing that began creating \nthe record for legislative action that I hope will occur early in the \nnext Congress.\n  Surely, after our experience with the budget process over the last \nyear and a half, most in Congress would agree that biennial budgeting \nis an idea whose time has finally come. Since I came to Congress, I \nhave spent an unusually high percentage of my time considering matters \nrelated to the budget. No sooner did we finish working on the fiscal \n1996 budget, then we had to start work on the budget for fiscal year \n1997.\n  Although I believe that a biennial budget will prevent recent history \nfrom being repeated, I do not believe that it is a panacea for all of \nour budget problems. It cannot bring the budget into balance--Members \nof the Senate and House, along with the President of the United States, \nmust still make the tough choices to bring that about. And, it will not \nautomatically solve the serious problems posed by the increased demand \non entitlement programs as the next generation begins to retire.\n  What a biennial budget can do is to give us time for the important \ntasks that often get short shrift these days, such as conducting \noversight and long-range planning, and spending more time at home. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today will ensure that time for \noversight and work at home is set aside.\n   Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the specifics of that \nlegislation.\n  First, the bill would create a 2-year budget process, and would \nrequire Congress to complete action on the budget by September 30 of \nthe first session. If Congress misses that legal\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\ndeadline, absent a national emergency, Members would not be paid.\n  In addition, the legislation would require Congress to perform \noversight of the executive branch during the second year of the \nCongressional session.\n  Finally, the bill would require Congress to adjourn by July 31 of the \nsecond session. If Congress missed that legal deadline--again, absent a \nnational emergency--Members would not be paid.\n   Mr. President, I would like to explain how this legislation came \nabout. Ever since I began campaigning for the Senate, I have expressed \nthe view that we need to cut the pay of Members of Congress and send \nthem home. This, too, is not a new idea. It was first advocated by \nformer majority leader Howard Baker and reproposed by Governor Lamar \nAlexander during his Presidential campaign.\n  The legislation I just described is the very first step in that \ndirection. It shortens the amount of time that Members must devote to \nthe budget process. However, in return, Members must spend more time \noverseeing the activities of the Federal Government and more time at \nhome--either working with their constituents or pursuing the work that \nthey engaged in before they came to Congress. I believe that these \nsteps will help us re-create the citizen legislature that existed much \nearlier in this country's history.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these and other ideas \nto make Congress more responsive and efficient.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2050. A bill to provide an enhanced penalty for distribution of \ncontrolled substances to recovering addicts; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  THE RECOVERING ADDICT PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as anyone familiar with substance \nabuse treatment knows, recovery from addiction is a one-day-at-a-time \nprocedure--often recovering addicts literally struggle on a daily basis \nto resist the temptation to use drugs. In recognition of this daily \nstruggle, many treatment and 12-step programs run daily group meetings \nfor those in treatment to gain support and help from others who are \nalso committed to staying sober.\n  Unfortunately, as has become all too clear in all areas of drug \npolicy, the people who traffic in drugs are unscrupulously cunning in \nconstantly finding new ways to increase the number of people buying and \nbecoming addicted to drugs. One of the easiest targets for drug dealers \nlooking to increase their number of customers are the people most \nvulnerable to the temptations of drugs--recovering addicts.\n  Because those in treatment are often so easily tempted and because \nonce they purchase drugs they are likely to become regular customers as \ntheir addiction retakes hold full force, they are, perversely, the most \nsought-after clients for drug dealers, representing a steady and high-\nconsumption consumer base.\n  It is obviously a problem every time a drug dealer sells narcotics to \nanyone. It is an even greater problem when drug dealers try to increase \ntheir profits by targeting the most susceptible and weakest members of \nour society. Recognizing this, Congress created drug-free school zones \nwhich recognized that drug dealers were finding schools a good place to \ntarget potential new customers--susceptible children--where they were \nmost likely to be and where there are a lot of them together. Drug \ntraffickers caught selling drugs in these areas are subject to harsher \npenalties than for selling outside of these areas.\n  This step to protect our children has obviously not completely solved \nthe problem of youth drug abuse, but it has increased the chances that \nchildren can avoid being pressured by drug dealers into trying drugs. \nThe same type of protection needs to be given to those similarly \nsusceptible to coercion by drug dealers--recovering addicts. This type \nof tactic is a common occurrence, and it undermines the entire \ntreatment community's efforts.\n\n  In addition, many recovering addicts are targeted in the very places \nthey should be most safe: their recovery meetings. It is unfortunately \neasy for a dealer to attend a meeting such as Narcotics Anonymous, \nlisten to the other attendees, discover who is most vulnerable to a \nrelapse, and approach those people after the meeting in order to expand \ntheir client base.\n  The people targeted are obviously in the unfortunate position of the \ndealer having heard them in the meeting discussing how tempted they \nare, what they are craving, and why. It is then very easy for the drug \ndealer to pretend to be a fellow recovering addict concerned about the \naddict's struggle and willing to stay after the meeting to talk \nfurther--with the intention of getting the person alone and then \noffering drugs, often free of charge, in the hopes that the \nunsuspecting addict is drawn into the drug abusing lifestyle once \nagain, thereby becoming a regular paying customer.\n  In an even more simple scheme, drug dealers often track down former \ncustomers after they have entered a treatment program. The drug dealer \nthen becomes a constant presence in the recovering person's life--\ncalling them, coincidentally running into them on the street, and \nshowing up places they know the addict will be. These dealers know it \nis only a matter of time before the recovering addict has a weak or \nparticularly difficult day, and the dealer wants to be sure the \naddict's temptation leads to a return to regular drug abuse.\n  For these reasons, I am now introducing a bill to send a strong \nmessage to drug dealers and to severely punish those who don't heed the \nwarning: ``stay away from recovering addicts who are trying to put \ntheir lives back together.''\n  My bill directs the Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for \ndrug distributors who intentionally target recovering addicts. This \nwill send the clear signal to drug dealers to stay away from treatment \nmeetings, former customers who are now in treatment, and anyone else \nthey know is committed to kicking their addiction.\n  It also sends the right message to those drug addicts who are trying \nto regain their lives--that society is behind them; that we recognize \ntheir admirable struggle; that we are willing and able to help them \nresist the temptation to return to drug abuse; that we want them to \nsucceed in staying drug free; and that we will punish those who \nknowingly try to make them fail.\n  This is a simple yet vital piece of legislation in our fight against \ndrugs, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for the development of drugs to treat an addition to illegal \ndrugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              THE PHARMACOTHERAPY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since the first call to arms against \nillegal drugs in 1989, we have learned just how insidious hardcore drug \naddiction is, even as\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\nthe ravages of substance abuse--on both the addict and his victims--\nhave become ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a \nseemingly intractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in \nthe heated rhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to \nfind a cure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition \nthat we have not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, \nlike all serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, \nand refuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture.\n  Throughout my tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \ncalled for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the \nspecific steps I advocated was the creation of incentives to encourage \nthe private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area \nwhere promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to \nproduction of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the \nPharmacotherapy Development Act of 1996, will hopefully change that. It \ntakes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--\nhardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because \nthese addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and \nin part because this population commits such a large percentage of \ndrug-related crime.\n  In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, \n``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.'' In that report, I posed \nthe question, ``If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find \na medical `cure' for this disease?'' The report gave the answer ``No.'' \nUnfortunately, almost a decade later, the answer remains the same. \nDeveloping new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among \nour highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this \nmodest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to \naddress the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we \neffectively throw up our hands and do nothing.\n  Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing \nmedications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a \nheightened understanding of the physiological and psychological \ncharacteristics of drug addition and a greater base of neuroscientific \nresearch.\n  One example of this promising research is the recent development of a \ncompound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against \nthe effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by \nstimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks \ncocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a \nwhole new avenue for combating addiction.\n  Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat \ncocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance \nabuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the \nnecessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines.\n  Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for \na variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties \ndistributing medication to the target population, and fear of being \nassociated with substance abusers. We need to create financial \nincentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market \nthese treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between \nprivate industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active \nmarketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to \nall addicts in need of treatment.\n  While pharmacotherapies alone are not a magic bullet that will solve \nour national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to fill a \ngap in current treatment regimens. The disease of addiction occurs for \nmany reasons, including a variety of personal problems which \npharmacotherapy cannot address. Still, by providing a treatment regimen \nfor drug abusers who are not helped by traditional methods, \npharmacotherapy holds substantial promise for reducing the crime and \nhealth crisis that drug abuse is causing in the United States.\n  The Pharmacotherapy Development Act would encourage and support the \ndevelopment of medicines to treat drug addictions in two ways. Both \napproaches are designed to create greater incentives and protections \nfor private sector companies willing to undertake this difficult but \nimportant task.\n  First, the bill would provide additional patent protections for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, \npharmacotherapies could be designated ``orphan drugs\" and qualify for \nan exclusive 7-year patent to treat a specific addiction. These \nextraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of \npharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that \ninvest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was \ncontained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but \nwas never acted on by Congress.\n  Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but \nshift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to \nthe Government. This approach would create a financial incentive for \ndrug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to \navoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance \nabusers.\n  The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop \nstrict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats \ncocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the Government must \npurchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed \nit. The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: \n$100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for \na drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the Government has purchased the \npatent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and \ndistributing it to clinics, hospitals, State, and local governments, \nand any other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs.\n  This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market \ninefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to \ntreat addiction and require the Government to take on the \nresponsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform.\n  America's drug problem is reduced each and every time a drug abuser \nquits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer \nhospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies, and fewer neglected \nchildren. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment \noptions such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on \nadvancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much \nin years to come. The question isn't can we afford to pursue a \npharmacotherapy strategy, but rather, can we afford not to.\n  Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to \nspeed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in \npharmacotherapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without \nrectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in promoting an important, and potentially groundbreaking \napproach to addressing one of our Nation's most serious domestic \nchallenges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

designee may restructure \n     mortgages to provide a restructured first mortgage to cover \n     debt service and operating expenses at the market rent, and a \n     second mortgage equal to the difference between the \n     restructured first mortgage and the mortgage balance of the \n     eligible multifamily housing project at the time of \n     restructuring.\n       (B) Interest rate on second mortgage.--The second mortgage \n     shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed the applicable \n     Federal rate for a term not to exceed 40 years.\n       (C) Timing of payments.--If the

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 3754 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3754) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 30, 1996.)\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the conference report is an appropriation of \n$2,165,000,000, for the legislative branch for fiscal year 1997.\n  This is a reduction of $22 million below the enacted program levels \nin fiscal year 1996, $174 million below the requested amount, and, \ncompared to fiscal 1995 the bill reflects a $225 million reduction.\n  Mr. President, I thank the members of the committee, and especially \nour ranking member, Senator Murray for her help and cooperation in \nproducing this legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement to H.R. 3754, the fiscal year 1997 legislative branch \nappropriation bill.\n  I commend Senator Mack for his leadership of the managers on the part \nof the Senate. I also compliment the House conferees, particularly the \nHouse subcommittee chairman, Mr. Packard, and his minority counterpart, \nMr. Thornton. Their obvious knowledge of this legislation certainly \nplayed a large part in the expeditious manner in which this conference \nproceeded.\n  All in all, Mr. President, this is a good conference agreement. In \nmost cases, we split the difference with the House with respect to the \nfunding levels for the related agencies in this bill. One exception is \nthe funding for the Joint Economic Committee. The Senate-passed bill \nfunded that committee at a level of $750,000 and the House-passed bill \nat a level of $3,000,000. The conferees agreed to a funding level of \n$2,750,000 with language stating that the long-term need for this \ncommittee should be reviewed and that funding for the committee is \nexpected to be phased down to zero in the future.\n  In addition, I was pleased that the House accepted my amendment \nregarding the disposal of excess computer equipment to public schools. \nAnd, at the recommendation of Congressmen Fazio and Serrano, the House \nincluded language stating that they support this policy for excess \nHouse computer equipment.\n  Mr. President, I note that section 312 of the House-passed bill, the \nissue of so-called dynamic scoring, was dropped from the conference \nagreement. As Members are aware from previous statements I have made on \nthe floor, I steadfastly opposed this provision and, therefore, am \npleased to report that the House agreed to remove this provision from \nthe conference agreement.\n  In closing, I again commend this Legislative Branch Subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Mack, for his leadership and for the spirit of \nbipartisanship in which he operates. Many difficult issues have arisen \nwith respect to this legislation over the 2 years of his subcommittee \nchairmanship and he has unfailingly faced those issues and resolved \nthem in a fair and objective way on a nonpartisan basis. He has always \nendeavored to keep me fully informed on all matters coming before the \nsubcommittee, for which I am deeply appreciative.\n  I urge the support of this conference agreement by all Members.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 3754, the legislative branch appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1997.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $2.2 billion and new \noutlays of $1.9 billion for the Congress and other legislative branch \nagencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Government Printing Office, among others.\n  When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.3 billion in budget authority \nand $2.2 billion in outlays. The bill is under the Senate \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation by $21 million in budget authority and \n$47 million in outlays.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member for producing \na bill that is substantially within their 602(b) allocation. I am \npleased that this bill continues to hold the line on congressional \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of H.R. 3754, as reported by the committee of \nconference, be inserted in the Record. I urge the Senate to support \nthis conference report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT   \n                 [Fiscal year 1997, dollars in millions]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget               \n                                                 authority     Outlays  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other                                \n     actions completed........................  ...........          214\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\n                                                                        \n    H.R. 3754, conference report..............        2,166        1,917\n    Scorekeeping adjustment...................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.......        2,166        2,131\n                                               =========================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other                                \n     actions completed........................           92           92\n    H.R. 3754, conference report..............  ...........  ...........\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs                            \n     with Budget:                                                       \n        Resolution assumptions................           -0           -0\n                                               -------------------------\n          Subtotal mandatory..................           92           92\n                                               =========================\n          Adjusted bill total.................        2,258        2,223\n                                               =========================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.....................  ...........  ...........\n    Nondefense discretionary..................        2,187        2,178\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund........  ...........  ...........\n    Mandatory.................................           92           92\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................        2,279        2,270\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.....................  ...........  ...........\n    Nondefense discretionary..................          -21          -47\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund........  ...........  ...........\n    Mandatory.................................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................          -21          -47\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support final passage of \nthe conference report on the appropriations bill for the legislative \nbranch. The managers of the bill have done a laudable job in their \ncontinued efforts to reduce spending, and I am particularly delighted \nthat they were able to include my amendment on books for the blind.\n  This amendment, which makes a very small change in current copyright \nlaw, will make an enormous difference to our Nation's blind children \nand adults. It has the approval of the authorizing committees in both \nChambers, as well as the support of the National Federation of the \nBlind, the American Foundation for the Blind, the American Printing \nHouse for the Blind, Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic, the American \nCouncil of the Blind, the Association of American Publishers, and the \nU.S. Office of Copyright.\n  The amendment which I offered with Senators Frahm, Stevens, Leahy, \nMcConnell, Bingaman, Frist, Ford, Pressler, and DeWine resulted from \nthe efforts of Ambassador Anthony Veliotes, representing the \nAssociation of American Publishers, and Dr. Kenneth Jernigan, \nrepresenting the blindness community. In January, they met and agreed \nthat this amendment would address the needs of the blindness community \nwithout compromising the rights and interests of the publishers. I \ngreatly appreciate their help and the help of my constituent, Ed Beck, \nthe legislative representative for the Rhode Island affiliate of the \nNational Federation of the Blind, who first brought this to my \nattention.\n  National Library Service and a number of nonprofit organizations, \nsuch as The American Printing House for the Blind and Recording for the \nBlind and Dyslexic, reproduce, in specialized formats, published \nmaterial that is readily available to sighted individuals in libraries, \nbookstores, newsstands, and countless other locations. ``Specialized \nformats'' refers to braille, sound recordings--either on cassette or \nphonorecord--and new digital formats that can be used with special \nsoftware. My amendment seeks to end the unintended censorship of blind \nindividuals' access to current information. Under this amendment, \ngroups that produce specialized formats for the blind no longer are \nrequired to gain permission from the copyright holder before beginning \nproduction.\n  James Gashel of the National Federation of the Blind was invaluable \nin his efforts to help us put forth a proposal that would be acceptable \nto all sides. He is a strong and able spokesman for the blind. Also, I \nwould like to thank the managers of the bill, who were completely \naccepting of this amendment, as well as their staff, Larry Harris with \nSenator Mack and Jim English with Senator Murray.\n  Let me close by quoting from a letter I received from Mr. Gashel that \nexplains the significance of this amendment to the blindness community. \nMr. Gashel writes:\n\n       This is a significant change for us. It means, for example, \n     that the current best-sellers, which the Library of Congress \n     produces for us, should be available in Braille or recorded \n     format within months rather than a year or more. It also \n     means that blind children in schools should be able to have \n     the editions of textbooks being used by their sighted \n     classmates this year rather than the ones in use last year.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to commend the managers of the bill \nfor reconciling the differences between the two bodies on this measure. \nThey have indeed produced a good bill.\n  I want to comment on one issue in specific. I am saddened that the \nmanagers did not keep language offered by Senator Feingold and myself \nto stop the revolving door and restrict former staff and Members from \nlobbying the Hill until after a decent cooling-off period elapses. \nUnfortunately, this issue will not be resolved today and we will have \nto return to it at another time.\n  Our amendment would have doubled from 1 year to 2 the time a staffer \nwould have to wait before he or she could lobby the office that \npreviously employed them. It was our intention that senior staff and \nformer Members would have to wait 5 years before being able to lobby.\n  Some have raised the issue that the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin and myself was harder on senior staff than it was on \nMembers. I want to clarify for the Record that in the drafting process, \nwe inadvertently neglected to include the provision that made the \nlobbying ban for Members 5 years. Instead, the amendment as offered, \nmade the lobbying ban for Members the same as that for lower level \nstaff. Again, I want to repeat, that was not our intention. We had \nhoped that our error could be corrected when the bill was considered in \nconference. However, we were told that the Senate receded to the House \nregarding this matter and subsequently the McCain-Feingold provision \nwas dropped from the bill.\n  Additionally, I want to note that the cooling-off period for staff--\nregardless of salary--only restricts that individual from lobbying his \nor her own boss or committee of employment. On the other hand, the \ncooling-off period for former Members of Congress would restrict such \nindividuals from lobbying the entire congressional branch of \ngovernment. This restriction is much tougher than that for staff. \nHowever, I again repeat, it should have been a 5-year restriction.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    general accounting office issues\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this conference report provides $338.4 \nmillion for the General Accounting Office. This is $44.4 million less \nthan 1996 appropriations. This reduction is the second year of a \nprogram to reduce GAO funding by a total of 25 percent.\n  GAO should be commended for agreeing to this downsizing program. \nGAO's work here is an example to Federal agencies for how to downsize \nquickly, while still performing the agency's mission.\n  In addition to this model downsizing, there are two matters of note \nfor GAO this year.\n  First, this year is GAO's 75th anniversary. I want to express to the \nevaluator staff at GAO my sincere appreciation for their hard work, \nmuch of it on difficult and controversial issues and all of it under \nthe strenuous circumstance of a major downsizing.\n  Also, this is the last year of Comptroller General Charles A. \nBowsher's 15-year term. After September 30 Congress and the President \nwill jointly select and appoint a new Comptroller General. As that \nprocess is started, I want to express three thoughts that I believe \nshould be kept in mind as a new Comptroller General is selected.\n  First, it has been traditional to select an individual with an \naccounting background as Comptroller General. However, most of GAO's \nwork is actually not accounting; much of it is evaluations and other \ntypes of investigations. We should consider for Comptroller General an \nindividual who has a broad background in the type of work GAO actually \ndoes, not necessarily just accounting. I believe this approach may help \nin improving the quality of GAO work that has concerned some of us in \nrecent years.\n  Second, for many years I have been an advocate of outside expert peer \nreview of enforce high quality standards of GAO's work. I continue to \nbelieve that GAO work would benefit from regular review by outside \nexperts, and I\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\nwill want to discuss how best to effect such review with the new \nComptroller General-designate as the Senate confirms his, or her, \nnomination.\n  Third, my concern for peer review for GAO reports has been heightened \nby a recent GAO action. GAO has just decided to eliminate its Program \nEvaluation and Methodology Division. While very small, this division \nhas distinguished itself by producing some exceptional reports and by \nhelping other GAO divisions improve the quality of many of their \nreports. Disbanding this division will eliminate and important source \nof internal expert review; this decision increases the need for \nexternal peer review.\n  I congratulate Comptroller General Bowsher and GAO and their 75th \nanniversary and I look forward to working with GAO and my colleagues in \nthe Senate to continue this agency's tradition of very important and \nvaluable work for Congress.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the conference \nreport be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the conference report be placed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/03/senate-section/article/S9763-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1996\n\n  Mr. BOND.
