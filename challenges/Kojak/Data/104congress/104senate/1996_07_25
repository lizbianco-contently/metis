Mr. President, this morning the Senate will \nimmediately resume consideration of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. Under the agreement reached last night, the Senate \nwill begin 30 minutes of debate on the McCain amendment No. 5017 \nregarding antiterrorism efforts. Senators can expect a rollcall vote on \nor in relation to that amendment no later than 10 o'clock this morning, \nif all debate time is used.\n  Additional amendments are anticipated. Therefore, Senators can expect \nvotes throughout the session of the Senate today. The majority leader \nhas indicated that he hopes to complete action on this bill today. I \nmight say that I think that is entirely possible. We have a number of \namendments that are anticipated to be offered that would be acceptable, \nand there is really no reason why we should not be able to complete \nthis bill today. The leader then plans to turn to the consideration of \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill following final passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona here. I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield. Mr. \nPresident, I wish to compliment the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nwho had worked with this amendment last night and could have asked for \na vote last night. I asked him if he might be willing to withhold while \nwe discussed it further with him. I know there have been some \ndiscussions. I note that because the Senator from Arizona showed his \nusual courtesy and cooperation, I wish to thank him here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg Suchan, \na fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \ndiscussion of H.R. 3540.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5017, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and his \nstaff for working with us last night on this particular amendment. In \naccordance with the previous unanimous-consent agreement, I send to the \ndesk a modification of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5017), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\nINFORMATION ON COOPERATION WITH UNITED STATES ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN \n                  ANNUAL COUNTRY REPORTS ON TERRORISM\n\n       Sec. 580. Section 140 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. \n     2656f) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (1);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n     inserting a semicolon; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) with respect to each foreign country from which the \n     United States Government has sought cooperation during the \n     previous five years in the investigation or prosecution of an \n     act of international terrorism against United States citizens \n     or interests, information on--\n       ``(A) the extent to which the government of the foreign \n     country is cooperating with the United States Government in \n     apprehending, convicting and punishing the individual or \n     individuals responsible for the act; and\n       ``(B) the extent to which the government of the foreign \n     country is cooperating in preventing further acts of \n     terrorism against United States citizens in the foreign \n     country; and\n       (4) With respect to each foreign country from which the \n     United States Government has sought cooperation during the \n     previous five years in the prevention of an act of \n     international terrorism against such citizens or interests, \n     the information described in paragraph (3)(B).'' and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by striking ``The report'' and inserting ``(1) Except \n     as provided in paragraph (2), the report'';\n       (B) by indenting the margin of paragraph (1) as so \n     designated, 2 ems; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) If the Secretary of State determines that the \n     transmittal of the information with respect to a foreign \n     country under paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a) in \n     classified form would make more likely the cooperation of the \n     government of the foreign country as specified in such \n     paragraph, the Secretary may transmit the information under \n     such paragraph in classified form''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncooperation. I think we have reached an agreeable resolution to this \nissue, which achieves the goal I was trying to accomplish. I think it \nsatisfies the concerns not only of the Senator from Vermont had, but \nalso of the administration.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would require the Secretary of State, \nas part of his annual report to Congress on global terrorism, to \nprovide information on the extent to which foreign governments are \ncooperating with U.S. requests for assistance in investigating \nterrorist attacks with Americans. The Secretary will also be required \nto provide information on the extent to which foreign countries are \ncooperating with U.S. efforts to prevent further terrorist attacks \nagainst Americans.\n  The recent terrorist attack in Dhahran demonstrates the importance of \ncooperation of other governments in investigating and preventing \nterrorism against Americans. The proposed amendment would of course \ncover terrorist attacks against Americans or U.S. interests abroad, \nsuch as the Riyadh bombing last year or the assassination of two State \nDepartment employees in Karachi. It would also cover terrorist attacks \nin the United States, either by foreign terrorists or domestic \nterrorists operating with foreign assistance. For example, if the \ndestruction of TWA flight 800 proves to be a terrorist act--and at this \ntime we do not know that it was--the amendment would ensure that we \nknow whether other countries are cooperating with the United States in \ninvestigating the crash and bringing to justice those responsible.\n  As part of his annual report on terrorism, the Secretary of State is \nalready required by law to report on the counterterrorism efforts of \ncountries where major international terrorist attacks occur and on the \nresponse of their judicial systems to matters relating to terrorism \nagainst American citizens and facilities. I believe it would be very \nuseful to add to this report important information about how foreign \ngovernments are responding to U.S. requests for cooperation in \ninvestigating and preventing terrorist attacks against Americans.\n  Moreover, the executive branch is already required to provide \ninformation on other countries' antiterrorism cooperation. Section 330 \nof the recently enacted antiterrorism bill prohibits the export of \ndefense articles or services to a country that the President certifies \nis not cooperating fully with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. Such \ncooperation must certainly include investigating terrorists acts \nagainst Americans. If such information is reasonable and useful in the \ncontext of military cooperation, then I see no reason why similar \ninformation cannot be provided for all other countries who are not the \nrecipients of U.S. defense equipment or services.\n\n  The State Department has expressed reservations about the earlier \ndrafts of this amendment, which included a requirement for \ncertification along the lines of the anti-terrorism bill. Working with \nthe Senator from Vermont, we have addressed this concern by requiring \nthat the Secretary's report provided information, rather than a \ncertification.\n  Another concern raised by the State Department is that there may be \ntimes when other countries, for reasons of their own, might not want it \nmade public that they are cooperating with our anti-terrorism efforts. \nThe amendment, therefore allows the Secretary to provide this \ninformation in a classified manner when it will enhance foreign \ncountries' cooperation.\n  But international terrorism is a global problem that must be \naddressed by the joint efforts of all civilized states. If the United \nStates seeks the cooperation of other countries in pursuing those who \ncommit acts of terrorism against Americans, then I believe the Congress \nand the American people have a right to know whether foreign \ngovernments are indeed cooperating with the United States.\n  Just last week, I met with the family of a young American woman, \nAlisa Flatow, who was killed by an Islamic Jihad truck bomb in the Gaza \nStrip last year. According to Alisa's father, Stephen M. Flatow of West \nOrange, NJ, when President, Clinton sent an FBI team to investigate the \nattack, the Palestinian authority refused to cooperate with the FBI. \n``As a result,'' Mr. Flatow writes in a letter to me supporting this \namendment, ``the people responsible for planning my daughter's death \nhave not been apprehended.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at this point a letter \nfrom Stephen M. Flatow, of West Orange, NJ, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              West Orange, NJ,\n\n                                                    July 15, 1996.\n     Re H.R. 3540.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: It was a pleasure to meet you last \n     Thursday on the steps of the Longworth Building. I \n     wholeheartedly support your amendment to the Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Bill, H.R. 3540, as it deals with \n     crimes against Americans in foreign countries.\n       Following the death of my 20-year-old daughter, Alisa, in \n     April 1995, President Clinton ordered an FBI team to Israel \n     and Gaza to investigate the circumstances of her murder by \n     the Islamic Jihad. While the Israelis cooperated fully, to my \n     family's chagrin the Palestinian Authority would not \n     cooperate with the FBI team. As a result, the people \n     responsible for planning my daughter's death have not been \n     apprehended.\n       It seems now that for the second time the Saudis are \n     blocking a similar investigation by Americans of a crime \n     involving the deaths of Americans. My sympathies are with the \n     families of the victims of terror and my prayers are for the \n     capture and proper adjudication of the perpetrator's guilt.\n       I am confident that, with your perseverance, justice will \n     be done.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephen M. Flatow.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I might add that this refusal to cooperate \nwith the FBI is not mentioned at all in the State Department's 1995 \nreport on international terrorism. But this is an excellent example of \nthe type of information that I believe the executive branch should \nroutinely provide to the Congress and to the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Again, Mr. President, \nthis is not my original proposal. I would have liked to have seen a \ncertification process. I understand the concerns raised by the Senator \nfrom Vermont and by the State Department. I am pleased as always to \nhave the opportunity to work with him, as, clearly, this issue of \nterrorism transcends any party or political viewpoint.\n  As I said earlier in my remarks, I do not know if the tragedy of TWA \nflight 800 was an act of terror or not. I was\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\npleased to note this morning, as we all were, that the black boxes were \nrecovered, which, in the opinion of most experts, will give us the kind \nof factual evidence we need to reach a conclusion. But whether flight \nTWA 800 was an act of terror or not, the reality is that terror has now \nbecame part of the world scene and the American scene.\n  Any expert that you talk to will clearly state that you could not \nattack terrorism where the act of terror takes place. You attack it at \nthe root and the source of the act itself. That means going to places \nwhere the training, equipping, and arming takes place. It also means \nobtaining the cooperation of every other civilized nation and taking \nwhatever action is necessary to go to the source of this act of \nterrorism.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am not drawing any conclusions, nor would \nI advocate any course of action, because there is a wide range of \noptions that are open to an American President and Congress in the \nevent that an act of terror is perpetrated on American citizens.\n  It is instructive to note that some years ago, when there was a bomb \nin a cafe in Germany, that a previous administration was able to \nidentify the source of that act of terror. A bombing raid was mounted \nand successfully carried out in Libya, and since that time, Mr. Qadhafi \nhas been rather quiet. It does not mean that Mr. Qadhafi has abandoned \nhis revolutionary zeal, but it was certainly a cautionary lesson to Mr. \nQadhafi and his friends.\n  I do not say that is the remedy in every case of an act of terror. I \nthink that there are a wide range of options, such as economic \nsanctions and others, that are open to us. But if we do not act in \nresponse to acts of terror, and if we do not act in a cooperative \nfashion, then it is virtually impossible to address these acts of \nterror in an effective fashion.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Kentucky, for their assistance on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe that there is strong support for \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I know that I am one \nsupporting it. Again, I compliment him for the effort that he has made \non this.\n\n  I also understand that as a result of efforts to get some Senators \nback in here, that we will probably not have this vote until 10 \no'clock. I know that meets the satisfaction of leadership. So I might \njust make a couple of general comments on the bill along the lines of \nwhat I did yesterday.\n  This legislation reflects the best compromise that we are able to \nmake in the Senate in the committee and a compromise between the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself in this legislation. We \nhad an effort within a very small limit and a very small allocation. \nThe allocation itself reflected the best efforts of the distinguished \nchairman of the overall Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield.\n  But I think that, Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves at some \npoint just how long we can go down this road. No matter what the \nadministration is, Republican or Democrat, we are going to have to face \nup to the responsibility of world leadership when we are the most \npowerful and wealthiest democracy known to history. We have seen steady \ncuts in the area of foreign aid. Maybe it is politically popular to go \nback home and talk about those cuts, but let us look at what we have \nwith the conservative, tight-fisted, anti-foreign-aid rhetoric of the \nReagan administration.\n  President Reagan's budgets were almost 40 percent higher in foreign \naid than President Clinton's. President Bush's were. Frankly, those \nbudgets reflected reality. The rhetoric did not reflect reality. The \nbudget reflected more reality. But we have been so caught up with the \nrhetoric. The rhetoric of the Reagan administration rarely reflected \ntheir spending priorities. But we have gotten so caught up with the \nrhetoric that we have now made the spending priorities a reality. As a \nresult, we are not reflecting our responsibilities. Some are just pure \neconomic sense.\n  If we help in the development of these other countries, that is \nusually the biggest and fastest growing market for our export products. \nWe create jobs in the United States. The more exports we can create, \nthe more jobs we create, and our fastest growing and biggest potential \nmarket is in the Third World. That is why Japan and so many other \ncountries spend more money than the United States does as part of their \nbudget in these other parts of the world, because they know that with \nthe United States stepping out of that they can step in. They are \ncreating jobs. We lose American jobs. They create Japanese jobs, \nEuropean jobs, and otherwise. They probably sit there and laugh and \ncannot understand why we believe our own rhetoric and give up these \npotential jobs. But they will take them over.\n  Then we have another area, and it is a moral area. We have less than \n5 percent of the world's population; we use more than 50 percent of the \nworld's resources. Don't we as a country have a certain moral \nresponsibility to parts of the world?\n  In some parts of the world, the annual--think about this for a \nmoment, Mr. President--in some parts of the world, the annual per \ncapita income of a person is less than one page of the cost of printing \nthe Congressional Record for this debate. We have already spent in the \ndebate this morning by 10 minutes of 10 more than the per capita income \nof parts of the world where we help out with sometimes 20 cents per \ncapita, sometimes even 25 cents per capita. Are we carrying out our \nmoral responsibility as the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth?\n\n  We can look at pure economic sense. It makes little economic sense to \nus. We lose jobs as we cut back. We lose export markets as we cut back. \nBut we also have some moral responsibility. Most Americans waste more \nfood in a day than a lot of these hungry countries, the sub-Saharan \ncountries and others, will ever see on their tables. We spend more \nmoney on diet preparations in this country than most of these nations \nwill ever see to feed their newborn children or their families.\n  So I ask, Mr. President, at some point when you feel good about the \nrhetoric of going home, Members feel good about the rhetoric of going \nhome and talking about how they are opposed to foreign aid, they ought \nalso to look in their soul and conscience and ask what they are doing. \nAnd, if they are not touched in their soul and their conscience, then \nalso talk to the business people in their State and say: ``We are doing \nthis even though we are cutting off your export jobs, even though we \nare cutting out American jobs by doing this.''\n  There is an interesting op-ed piece in the Burlington Free Press of \nJuly 24 by George Burrill, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 24, 1996]\n\n                U.S. Foreign Aid Helps Americans at Home\n\n                          (By George Burrill)\n\n       Of all the budget cuts enacted last year, none was more \n     damaging than the reductions in foreign assistance. \n     Fortunately, the hemorrhaging appears to have stopped. The \n     Senate is now acting on the foreign operations spending bill, \n     which will increase the funding slightly over this year's \n     level. In James Jeffords and Patrick Leahy, Vermont is \n     fortunate to have two senators who understand the role of \n     foreign assistance in improving the economic security of \n     Americans. Both serve on the appropriations subcommittee with \n     jurisdiction over foreign operations, and both have supported \n     the programs that helped create future markets for U.S. \n     exports.\n       One poll last year showed that nearly six out of 10 \n     Americans incorrectly believed that the U.S. spends more on \n     foreign aid than on Medicare. In fact, the government \n     collects only about $11 per person each year from income \n     taxes to pay for foreign assistance.\n       Most people know that foreign aid can be humanitarian. But \n     few Americans realize that 80 percent of the total foreign \n     assistance budget is spent right here in the United States, \n     on American goods and services--more than $10 billion in \n     1994. This translates to about 200,000 U.S. jobs. For \n     example, Cormier Textile Products in Maine provided tarps for \n     disaster relief and temporary housing in Africa.\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n       Closer to home, I am working on a project to enhance the \n     computer capabilities of the Egyptian parliament. What kind \n     of computers? IBM--which has over 6,000 employees in Essex \n     Junction.\n       Today, exports account for 10 percent of the entire U.S. \n     economy--double the level of a decade ago. In 1983, the jobs \n     of five million workers depended on U.S. exports. Today, that \n     number has reached 12 million.\n       The fastest growing markets for U.S. goods and services are \n     in the developing world. Between 1990 and 1995, exports to \n     developing countries increased by nearly $100 billion, \n     creating roughly 1.9 million jobs in the United States.\n       This increase in U.S. exports to the developing world is no \n     accident. Most of the foreign assistance that we spend on \n     developing countries today goes toward making them good \n     customers tomorrow. The American economy is growing today \n     mainly because other countries want and can afford to buy our \n     products and services.\n       U.S. foreign assistance now focuses on encouraging six \n     reforms in developing countries.\n       First, we encourage reform of developing countries' overall \n     economic policy. For example, in the Czech Republic, we \n     assisted in the transition from a command economy to a free-\n     market system. The United States helped the Czech government \n     create a healthy economic environment for investors, which \n     included a balanced government budget, low inflation and low \n     unemployment. With over 10 million mostly urban and well-\n     educated consumers, reforming the Czech economy has meant an \n     11 percent increase in U.S. exports there between 1993 and \n     1994.\n       Second, we encourage developing countries to dismantle laws \n     and institutions that prevent free trade. Guatemala now \n     exports specialty fruits, vegetables, and flowers--and the \n     increased buying power of Guatemalans has meant a 19 percent \n     increase in U.S. exports there every year since 1989.\n       Third, we are helping to privatize state-dominated \n     economies. This dismantling of state-run industries is an \n     important means of attracting foreign investment. A $3 \n     million U.S. government to investment to support \n     privatization in the Indonesian energy sector has led to a $2 \n     billion award to an American firm for Indonesia's first \n     private power contract. In fact, the U.S. foreign assistance \n     budget has enabled U.S. companies to dominate the global \n     market for private energy.\n       Fourth, U.S. foreign assistance encourages developing \n     countries to establish business codes, regulated stock \n     markets, fair tax codes and the rule of law. Foreign \n     assistance helps create the stable business environments that \n     U.S. companies need in order to cooperate effectively.\n       Fifth, we are helping to educate a new class of consumers \n     in developing regions. When the United States helps educate a \n     population, we help develop the skills needed in modern \n     economy and a solid middle class with a vested interest in \n     seeing economic reforms succeed.\n       Sixth, we help build small businesses. Community-run \n     lending programs administered by the U.S. government are \n     expanding small businesses and increasing per capita income \n     in many developing countries.\n       The United States spent relatively more on foreign economic \n     aid in the 1960s and '70s than it does today. The economy \n     activity we are seeing in the developing world is tightly \n     linked to the work the U.S. government carried out 20 and 30 \n     years ago. Although the private sector is ultimately \n     responsible for economic growth, the government's work is \n     critical. At the very least, our goal should be to match the \n     mean level of total U.S. economic assistance of the 1960s--\n     about $18 billion a year.\n       America is at a crossroads. We can choose to make a smart \n     investment now or pay a steep price later. The relatively \n     small amount of money we spend on foreign economic assistance \n     serves as an engine for our future economic growth.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. So, Mr. President, let us go on with this debate, as we \nwill. As I said, I support the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona. But let us understand that there are issues here beyond \nwhat might be in the applause line at a town meeting back home or at a \nservice club meeting when you say, ``By God, we are taking the money \naway from those foreigners and putting it right here in America.'' We \nare not doing that really. When we cut back on all our programs for \ndevelopment and for democracy around the world, we cut back on the \npotential of American jobs in export, we cut back our own security, we \nincrease the potential that our men and women will be sent into trouble \nspots worldwide, but also we ignore our moral responsibilities as a \ncountry with 5 percent of the world's population using over 50 percent \nof the world's resources.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is one of the so-called Burma \namendments. I will take a few moments to explain the nature of what I \nam seeking to achieve.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Feinstein, \nand Senator Chafee, and Senator McCain. Let me begin, Mr. President, by \nstating that nothing that we do or say on the floor of the Senate today \nis going to magically bring democracy, freedom and prosperity to the \nlong-suffering people of Burma.\n  Burma's history, since gaining independence after World War II, has \nbeen a series of oppressive regimes unable to set the Burmese economy \non its feet, unwilling to grant the peoples of Burma the democracy and \njustice that motivated their heroic struggle for independence in the \nyears leading up to the British withdrawal.\n  When decades of isolation and economic mismanagement gave way in the \nlate 1980's to a transitional period under military rule, there was a \nslight glimmer of hope that Burma might finally be moving toward a more \nbright and democratic future. But stolen elections, student riots, and \nthe jailing of democratic politicians, including the Nobel Prize \nwinning leader of the democracy movement, Aung San Suu Kyi, soon made \nclear freedom's day had not yet arrived for Burma.\n  Over the past 5 years, Burma's military junta, the State Law and \nOrder Restoration Council, or SLORC, as it is called--its acronym--has \npursued policies of economic restructuring, leading to economic growth. \nBut its continued oppressive tactics and the oppression of the forces \nof democracy, the use of conscripted labor, and the quest to pacify \nethnic unrest in various parts of the country have all brought us to \nwhere we are today.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering seeks to substitute \nlanguage that the Foreign Operations Subcommittee has offered in this \nbill.\n  While I disagree with the subcommittee's approach to the issue, I \nwould like at this time to pay personal recognition to Senator \nMcConnell for his longstanding dedication to the issue of Burmese \nfreedom. It is an issue little discussed in the Senate until recently. \nI think that the considerable attention the issue now receives owes a \ngreat deal of credit to Senator McConnell's persistence to this issue. \nSo I want to commend him for his untiring efforts, drawing our \nattention to this issue.\n  I want to also recognize Senator McCain and Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts for their sustained involvement in the debate over \nAmerica's Burma policy.\n  Mr. President, the choice today is not whether the subcommittee's \napproach or the one that I am offering in this amendment is going to \nturn Burma into a functioning democracy overnight. Neither will \naccomplish that. And it is not a question of who is more committed to \nimproving the lives of the Burmese people or who has greater respect \nfor the tireless eloquence and courage of Aung San Suu Kyi. All of us \ninvolved in this matter respect Suu Kyi immensely and share\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nher aspirations for a democratic and prosperous future for the Burmese \npeople.\n  But the question is, does the approach laid out by the subcommittee \nincrease America's ability to foster change in Burma and strengthen our \nhand and allow the United States to engage in the type of delicate \ndiplomacy needed to help a poor and oppressed people obtain better \nliving standards, political and civic freedoms, and a brighter future \nas a dynamic Asian economy--one of the next of the so-called Asian \nTigers?\n  I think, Mr. President, with all due respect, the answer is no. By \nadopting the subcommittee language the Senate will be sending the \nfollow message:\n  That the United States is ready to relinquish all of its remaining \nleverage in Burma;\n  That America is shutting every door and cutting off all of its \nalready-depleted stake in Burma's future;\n  That the Congress is ready to further bind the hands of this and any \nfuture administrations, taking away those tools of diplomacy--\nincentives, both in a positive and negative sense--which are crucial if \nwe are ever going to hope to effect change in a nation where our words \nand actions already carry diminished clout.\n  All of us deplore the behavior of the Burmese junta. We all sense the \nplight of the Burmese people. We know the United States must support \nthe forces of democratic change in Burma. I fully support the \nappropriation in this year's foreign operations bill to aid the \ndemocrats in the struggle.\n\n  I think we have to recognize the reality of the situation in Burma \nand our influence over there. Burma is not identical to previous \nsituations in which the United States has successfully pressured \ngovernments who are antithetical to our values of democracy and \nfreedom.\n  First, let me say Burma is not South Africa. Burma is not South \nAfrica. Back in the 1970's and 1980's, the oppressive nature of the \napartheid regime in South Africa led the Senate to impose heavy \nsanctions and isolation to end the regime. In order to do that, we had \nthe support of not only our Western European allies but of the front-\nline nations, those surrounding South Africa, who also lent their \nsupport and joined in the effort to bring an end to apartheid.\n  Unlike South Africa in the 1970's and 1980's, Burma is not surrounded \nby nations ready to shun it. As a matter of fact, Burma's neighbors and \nother states in the region reject the view that isolating Burma is the \nbest means to encourage change. They are pursuing trade and engagement, \nand will do so regardless of what we do or say. Those nations over \nthere who are closest and in closest proximity are maintaining their \nrelations with Burma, seeking to bring about change over a period of \ntime. Isolating Burma is simply not going to work, and we will not have \nthe support of our allies. We will not have the support of our Asian \nfriends.\n  Second, Burma is not Iran. Do not make that comparison to Iran. The \nRevolutionary Islamic Government of Iran is known as a sponsor of \nterrorism and promoter of sectarian unrest throughout the Middle East \nand beyond. Not only does Iran flout the rights of its own citizens, it \nsponsors international terrorism, works to undermine neighboring \ngovernments and pursues the development of nuclear weapons. As a result \nof this, Iran is largely a pariah state. While we might have \ndisagreements with our friends and allies around the world regarding \nour Iranian policy or our policy toward Iran, there is general \nrecognition that the revolutionary government there is pursuing \npolicies contrary to the interests of regional stability and peace.\n  There is no such consensus on the Burmese junta. While many of their \nneighbors express irritation about the refugee flow caused by the \nSLORC's ongoing battles with the various ethnic groups, they view the \nefforts to oust SLORC as a threat to peace and stability in the region. \nThe subcommittee's proposal will not make American policy more \neffective or make possible a more cooperative policy or regional \nconsensus in dealing with SLORC.\n  Let me say that Burma is not China. I do not happen to be a \nparticular supporter of the Clinton administration's China policy in \ngeneral. A central tenet of the policy is that the United States can \nthreaten sanctions on Chinese exports to the United States in order to \nconvince the government of Beijing to live up to its agreements. We \nhave had a longstanding debate over our policy with respect to China. I \nknow many people might disagree with the administration's proposal.\n  I recall, for example, when President Bush was in the White House, \nthere was strong opposition coming from the Democratic side to having \nanything to do with China, because we wanted to impose sanctions \nbecause of their terrible record on human rights. I recall many Members \nstood on this floor and talked about the butchers of Beijing, kowtowing \nto the Chinese, and imposing this policy of sanctions. President \nClinton, when he was candidate Clinton, adopted that policy. Then, when \nhe took office, he saw it was not going to work. We did not have the \nsupport of our allies. We did not have the support of our other friends \nin Asia.\n  So the administration changed its policy toward China, and it is \nbecause of that we have some leverage; we have considerable leverage \nbecause the Chinese export many billions of dollars of goods to this \ncountry. So now, by engaging the Chinese, we are able to exercise some \ninfluence in some areas of concern to the United States, including \nhuman rights, but also with respect to our intellectual property \nrights, which we feel have been violated time and time again.\n\n  So we cannot compare this to China because we do not have that kind \nof policy leverage over Burma. We do not have the kind of export-import \nrelationship with Burma that we have with China, so we do not have the \nleverage to help in bringing about change.\n  For all of the reasons I am suggesting, it is important we create a \nBurma policy in tune with the realities of Burma today and not the \nexamples of South Africa, Iran or China. The alternative that I offer \ntoday sets a course for a coherent American Burma policy which upholds \nour values and, at the same time, expresses our interests in regional \nstability. It does, however, make American values and interests clear \nin a way that gives the administration flexibility in reacting to \nchanges, both positive and negative, with respect to the behavior of \nthe SLORC.\n  In addition, I hope that the amendment I propose would not only allow \nfor exceptions to the subcommittee's proposal, but I want to create \nsome conditionality here, Mr. President. I propose to allow exceptions \nto the policy of no assistance to Burma in three critical areas.\n  First, humanitarian assistance: We do not want to impose sanctions \nthat are basically going to be directed against the people, the Burmese \npeople. That is only going to impoverish them more. So I would have no \nsanctions across the board in terms of including humanitarian \nassistance.\n  Second, there is an exception for counternarcotics effort. The \ncounternarcotics provision, I think, is important, because, as Senator \nMcCain has pointed out on so many occasions, the real victims of a \nfailure to crack down on the narcotics trade in Burma are the millions \nof Americans who are harmed, both directly and indirectly, by our \nNation's epidemic drug abuse.\n  Burma is estimated to be the source of two-thirds of the world's \nproduction of heroin. So, does it make sense for us to eliminate all \nefforts to have a counternarcotics program in Burma? Are we not serving \nour national interests by at least maintaining some policy consistent \nwith trying to stop the flow, interdict the flow, find other \nalternatives for the Burmese people to replace their crops with other \ntypes of crops?\n  My amendment would allow a limited counternarcotics effort in Burma. \nIt is certified to be in our national security interests in accord with \nour human rights concerns.\n  The subcommittee's bill would prohibit all counternarcotics efforts \nin Burma. My amendment would not end the flow of heroin, but I think at \nleast it does not throw in the towel in an effort to stem that \npoisonous stream. The amendment I offered recognizes that, to be \neffective, American policy in Burma has to be coordinated with our \nAsian friends and allies. This is not the case of the unilateral \nactions offered by the subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have traveled in recent years throughout Southeast \nAsia, and I have discussed foreign policy, certainly, with many of the \nleaders there. Frankly, they do not see eye to eye with our policies. \nThat does not mean that we have to necessarily conform our policies to \nthe way in which they view the situation in Burma, but it does mean \nthat we should look on each and every occasion to consult with and, \nwhen possible, cooperate with the other nations of ASEAN, if we hope to \neffect change in Burma.\n  It seems to me that we can get on the floor, point to the oppression \nof the Burmese junta, and we can satisfy ourselves that we are seeking \nto punish them. But if, in fact, we do not have the support of our \nallies, and we do not have the support of those neighbors in the region \nfriendly to us who are seeking to work us with on a multilateral basis, \nthen we can stomp on this stage here and produce no visible effect or \nimprovement on behalf of the Burmese people.\n  Burma is located in one of the most dynamic regions of the world. It \nis the most dynamic region of the world. I suggest, Mr. President, that \nwe have seen the flowering of democracy and freedom in parts of the \nworld where values were quite alien to those that we support. We have \nseen developments, for example, in South Korea and Taiwan that have \nproven democracy can evolve out of formally authoritarian regimes. The \nsame thing can happen in Burma. The best way to do that is to adopt a \npolicy which gives the President some tools to influence the situation. \nThe subcommittee's proposal is all sticks, no carrots. What we seek to \ndo is give the President some limited flexibility to improve the \nsituation on behalf of the Burmese people.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize this is not an effort to \ncontradict what the subcommittee seeks to achieve, but rather provides \nthe President with flexibility. It does not matter whether you support \nthis President or not.\n  Someone asked me whether or not I was carrying the water of the \nadministration. Let me say, Mr. President, I have never considered \nmyself to be a waterboy for anybody. I have never carried water for any \nadministration, if I thought it was simply seeking to accommodate the \nadministration. I think there is only one team. There is not a \nRepublican or Democratic team; there is only one team when it comes to \nforeign policy. We all ought to be on the same side.\n  We ought to try to develop a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. I \nam not seeking to carry the water of the administration, any more than \nI have in the past, when I was accused of not acting on behalf of an \nadministration. What we need to have is a policy which this President \nor, what I hope to be President Dole after the next election, has the \nflexibility to achieve the goals that we all desire, and that is the \npromotion of democracy and humanitarian relief.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my colleague from Maine for his thoughtful \npresentation.\n  I know there are some others on the floor who would like to speak. \nLet me make a few observations here at the outset of the debate. My \ngood friend from Maine mentioned that we had consulted with leaders in \nthe area. The one leader that we have not consulted with is the duly \nelected leader of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi. Her party won 82 percent of \nthe vote in 1990. She is the legitimately elected head of a Burmese \nGovernment that has not been allowed to function. It has not been \nallowed to function because the State Law and Order Restoration Council \nsimply disallowed the election, put her under house arrest until July \n1995, and she still effectively is in that state. They say she is not \nunder arrest anymore, but, in fact, she stays at home most of the time. \nThat is the safest place to stay. She has to sort of smuggle out \nmessages to the rest of the world.\n  So the one leader we have not consulted, Aung San Suu Kyi, has an \nopinion about the proposal in the foreign operations bill. The duly \nelected leader of Burma, receiving 82 percent of the vote, thinks that \nthe approach in the underlying bill is the way to go. Maybe the other \npeople in Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, and other places do not think \nit is the way to go, but the one who won the election, the Western-\nstyle supervised election in 1990, thinks that the only thing that will \nwork are sanctions.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not yet. Mr. President, let me say that in terms of \nthe pain to American business, there are only two companies, both of \nthem oil companies, that are in there and plan to stay. Everybody else \nis pulling out. One oil company decided not to deal with this regime. \nEddie Bauer pulled out, and Liz Claiborne pulled out. The retailers do \nnot want to have anything to do with this crowd, which exists for the \nsole purpose of terrorizing its own citizens. They have a 400,000-\nperson army, armed to the teeth, not because of any expansionist goal, \nbut to suppress and abuse their own citizens. That is all they do. So \nif you want to do business in Burma, you cut a deal with the State Law \nand Order Restoration Council and you enrich them.\n  So in terms of the pain to American business, if this sanctions \nmeasure went into effect, it would affect only two companies--not like \nSouth Africa, in which my friend and colleague from Maine supported the \nSouth African sanctions bill, as did I. My friend from Maine voted to \noverride the President's veto, as did I. A lot of others did, too, a \ngood number of Senators who are still in the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle. That was actually a painful decision because there was a lot \nof American investment in South Africa that had to pick up and leave. \nThere is no question about whether South African sanctions worked. They \nworked. Now, I know there is a feeling around here on the part of some \nthat sanctions never work. The truth of the matter is that sometimes \nthey do and sometimes they do not. We have to pursue these issues one \nat a time, in a pragmatic way, and consider what is appropriate in a \ngiven country.\n  I say to my friend from Maine, and others, that we did not start \nproposing unilateral sanctions the first year. I have been working on \nthis issue for a couple of years, most of the time sort of by myself, \nbecause there are no Burmese-Americans to get us all interested in \nthis. America is a melting pot, and a lot of Americans who came from \nother places get interested in foreign assistance bills. Whether they \nare Jewish-Americans, Ukrainian-Americans, Polish-Americans, they take \nan interest, or Armenian-Americans. There are not many Burmese-\nAmericans. So this issue has not been on the radar screen here. But, as \na practical matter, this is one of the most, if not the most, because \nit ranks up there with North Korea, repressive regimes in the world.\n\n  It has been 6 years since the election. The Bush administration did \nnot pay any attention to the election, and neither is the Clinton \nadministration. The problem I have with the proposal of my friend from \nMaine--and I know it is well-intentioned and popular with the other \ncountries in ASEAN--is that I do not think it will have any impact, I \nsay with all due respect, because the present administration has shown \nno interest in doing anything significant.\n  As I understand the proposal of my friend from Maine, it would, in \neffect, mean increasing aid to SLORC, since the Senate voted 50 to 47 \nin November to put off aid for narcotics. We all understand that the \nAmerican interest in Burma is not because we have a lot of Burmese \ncitizens; it is because we have a lot of Burmese heroin. If you wanted \nto look at it from a purely domestic point of view, that is the \ninterest in Burma.\n  So I guess the question is whether there would be a serious narcotics \nenforcement effort by this crowd running Burma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I think I know the answer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a quick observation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think it would be safe to say that if past performance \nis any indication--and I think it is an indication --there would not be \nany help in stopping the heroin traffic by the group that runs it. I \nthink the indication is that a number of them are benefiting very \ndirectly from this heroin traffic, as the Senator from Kentucky has \npointed out before.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Vermont is right on the mark. Since \nSLORC seized power, opium production has doubled and seizures dropped \n80 percent. The warlord, Khun Sa, has had a complete safe haven. That \nis the kind\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nof cooperation we are getting from the State Law and Order Restoration \nCouncil, which runs Burma with an iron hand.\n  Now, some will suggest that unilateral sanctions are a radical step. \nWell, there is precedent for it, and my friend from Maine mentioned \nsome of the other countries. In many of them, we subsequently had help \nfrom others. I think it is reasonable to assume that if the United \nStates takes the lead, we will not be alone. We will not be alone. \nThings are beginning to stir in the European Union, the European \nParliament, and European companies. Two European companies pulled out \njust in the last week or so. So the movement is beginning.\n  If America will lead, there will be a lot of followers, not initially \nwith ASEAN, I agree with my friend from Maine. They have the biggest \ninvestment there. I can see why they do not want to change the status \nquo. They are doing just fine. It is probably a lot easier for \ncountries that do not have huge investments there to choose not to \ninvest if they do not already have big investments. Certainly, it is \nnot going to be much of a hit to U.S. business to take this step. But \nit is a beginning. It is a beginning.\n  We have pursued unilateral sanctions against Libya, Iran, and Cuba. \nSo we have done this before. It is not completely unique. It is not a \nradical step. It has been 6 years, Mr. President, since the election \nover there--6 years of terrorism and murder, and the ASEAN countries \nare doing business and everybody else is ignoring it.\n\n  It seems to me, at this point, it is not reasonable to assume that \nthis sort of constructive engagement is going to improve. There has \nbeen no improvement--none in 6 years. First, the Bush administration \nand then this administration either (a) has ignored the problem or (b) \ntried to engage in constructive engagement.\n  There are plenty of other Senators who would like to speak. I just \nwanted to lay out for the Senate, as we begin the debate, what the \ncommittee position suggests is not a particularly radical step. This is \ntruly one of a handful of pariah regimes in the world. If the United \nStates doesn't lead, who will?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in full support of the Cohen \namendment to the Burma provisions of H.R. 3540.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs, I strongly object to the present language in the committee \nsubstitute amendment. My problems with the provision are both \nprocedural and substantive.\n  First, on the procedural issue, this matter is clearly one for an \nauthorizing committee to consider, not--with all due respect--an \nappropriating committee. The subject matter of the provision is clearly \nlegislative in nature; it has absolutely nothing to do with funding. \nConsequently, it has no business being included in an appropriations \nbill. In the House, this provision would be subject to a point of order \non that grounds alone, and would have been formerly in the Senate too \nuntil the recent Hutchinson precedent.\n  Second, if enacted into law, the provision would create a significant \nchange in our relationship with Burma. Although I will readily admit \nthat our present relationship with Burma is not especially deep, the \nimposition of mandatory economic sanctions would certainly downgrade \nwhat little relationship we have. Moreover, it would affect our \nrelations with many of our allies in Asia as we try to corral them into \nfollowing our lead. Finally, and I have heard precious little from the \nmanager of the bill on this, it would have a substantial and \ndetrimental impact --to the tune of many millions of dollars--on \nseveral United States businesses with investments in Burma.\n  Consequently, the provision and its possible ramifications are a \nmatter which should be carefully considered by the authorizing \ncommittees of jurisdiction: the Committee on Banking and the Committee \non Foreign Relations. To date, Mr. President, neither committee has had \nthat opportunity. The Banking Committee held a hearing on Burma \nsanctions several weeks ago. At that hearing, the committee heard from \nonly the first of three witness panels; the first panel consisted of \nsupporters of the legislation, while the second and third consisted of \nthe administration--which is opposed to the bill--and sanctions \nopponents. The remainder of the hearing has been indefinitely \npostponed. Under those circumstances, I do not believe that it can be \nsaid that the Banking Committee has had an opportunity to fully \nconsider the matter.\n  As for the Foreign Relations Committee, neither the full committee \nnor my subcommittee has held a hearing on Burma or the sanctions \nprovisions in this Congress. We were prevented from holding hearings on \nthe Burma sanctions bill [Mr. McConnell] Senator from Kentucky because \nthe Parliamentarian ruled it was referable only to Banking. Yet despite \nthe fact that the provision strikes at the very heart of bilateral \nrelations with Burma, neither Senator McConnell or his staff has ever \neven discussed this matter with me or the chairman of the full Foreign \nRelations Committee. When Congress acts it should do so only after \ncareful and considered deliberation, something lacking in this case, \nand not by a last-minute attachment to appropriations legislation.\n  Substantively, I believe the sanctions provided for in the bill are a \ncompletely ineffective way to get Burma's attention. We all know very \nwell that economic sanctions only work if they are multilateral. We've \nseen that proven time after time.\n  It is clear that in this case, we would be the only country imposing \nsanctions. All of the ASEAN countries, especially those which border \nBurma, have told us point blank that they will not join us in imposing \nsanctions. They will continue their policy of constructive engagement \nwith Burma, and they told a recent United States mission to the area \nthat imposing sanctions would be foolish. In fact, Mr. President, no \nother country I know of has agreed to go along with proposed \nsanctions--no other country, Mr. President.\n  Therefore, we are left in a position of imposing unilateral \nsanctions, and unilateral sanctions are just like no sanctions at all. \nIf we prohibit United States companies from doing business in Burma, \nforeign business with no similar handicap will be more than happy to \nstep in and take our place. There is very little I can think of that we \nare in a position to supply to Burma which couldn't be supplied by a \nforeign country were we removed from the arena. This was a principal \nargument put forward by many Senators against imposing sanctions \nagainst the People's Republic of China. I wonder how many of those \nSenators are now arguing in favor of sanctions against Burma?\n  In addition, the Burma provisions strike me as somewhat hypocritical. \nThe Socialist Republic of Vietnam, in same region, is a Communist \ncountry that routinely violates human rights and suppresses democracy; \nfree speech is forbidden, opponents of the government are locked up for \nyears, just like in Burma. But Mr. President, I don't see anybody \nmoving to impose sanctions against that government.\n  On the contrary, we're doing everything we can to increase U.S. \nbusiness there because we believe that's the best way to effectuate \nchange. We've seen that increased business contacts are the best way to \ninfluence China; this seeming truism is the principal reason why we \ncontinue to renew China's most-favored-nation status each year. Most \nSenators have apparently concluded that the same is true for Vietnam. \nWhy, then, are we taking a different position with regards to Burma?\n  Mr. President, I am the first to agree that democracy needs to be \nrestored in Burma, that SLORC has to go, and that Daw Aung Sun Suu Kyi \nand her party are the rightful government of that country. \nUnfortunately, this bill is not going to bring us one step closer to \nbringing that about. All it is going to do is hurt U.S. companies, put \nus out on a limb without the support of our allies or other countries \nin the region, and make us look somewhat foolish.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the committee amendment and support the \nCohen amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cohen \namendment. I was part of a group that perfected an amendment and put \nout a ``Dear Colleague'' letter. It was similar in many\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\nrespects to the Cohen amendment. It had some significant differences, \nand we had a broad support I believe for that amendment. But, Mr. \nPresident, we have determined--Senator Nickles and I, and other \nsupporters of this amendment--that the differences between the \nJohnston-Nickles amendment and the Cohen amendment were not sufficient \nso as to divide our forces. And we believe that essentially this \namendment incorporates what we think is the central thrust of our \namendment. So, therefore, we support it, and I urge my colleagues to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, this is a difficult question. No one defends the \nSLORC, the group that is running Myanmar, or Burma. It is true they are \na bad regime. They are not an Iran in the sense that they do not \npractice state terrorism. They are not a Nazi Germany in the sense that \nthey engage in genocide. But they are plenty bad, Mr. President, and we \ndo not defend them.\n  The question is: Would it be effective to do what Senator McConnell \nhas proposed? Would it be effective? Would it help achieve the end? Mr. \nPresident, I think it would do precisely and exactly the opposite.\n  Mr. President, to cut off American participation in Burma--not \nforeign participation but American participation--would be exactly the \nwrong thing. First of all, it is no sanction because Americans are less \nthan 10 percent of foreign investment in Burma today and the total of \nforeign investment is less than Burmese send back--Burmese expatriates \nfrom around the world send back to their own country. The reason for \nthis is because under the former leader of Burma, General Ne Win, who \nwas there for over two decades, Burma was one of the most hermetically \nsealed countries on the face of the Earth. People did not go outside \nBurma. People did not come inside Burma. It was a totally closed not \nonly economy but society that practiced the most cruel kind of \nrepression; no doubt about that. It has only been in the last few \nyears, Mr. President, that Burma has opened up at all. They have begun \nto let a little bit of light in. Indeed, Unocal, which is an American \ncompany, is in there together with Total, which is a French company, to \ndevelop the gas fields. Actually they want to send the gas to Thailand. \nThe Thais are very strong supporters of this, as you might suspect.\n  And the question is: Is it good to have an American company, or would \nit be better to have Total, the French company, have the contract? \nReally that is the question proposed by the McConnell approach. I \nsubmit it is better to have an American company there.\n  Mr. President, I talked to the President of Unocal. He personally \nhave been talking to these people in what we call the SLORC, the State \nLaw and Order Restoration Council, the group that is running Burma. \nWhether or not he has been successful, or whether or not he is \nbeginning to be successful, you can argue. But I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident, that the President of Unocal --an American--it is better to \nhave him in there than to have only the French because the French and \nthe Europeans have never really helped on human rights matters. I mean \nthey never helped on China. They never helped on other countries around \nthe world. It is always the United States who does the propagation of \ndemocracy and human rights. We have a Louisiana company that has a \nsubcontract there.\n\n  The South Koreans are ready, willing, and able. And, as a matter of \nfact, it is grooming to take their place in Burma. I ask you, Mr. \nPresident. Do you think that the South Koreans are going to be in \ntalking about human rights and democracy? Mr. President, it is much \nmore likely that Americans will do so. When you have a country that has \nbeen so sealed off from Western influences, from civilizing influence, \nfrom moderating influences all these years, it is important to let the \nlight in--the cleansing light of democracy, the cleansing light of \nWestern civilization, the dynamic forces of the free market. It is \nbetter to let those in. Then you have something with which to sanction. \nIf, just as they are letting the light in, you suddenly shut the light \noff, there is neither a sanction to be had nor a loss for the Burmese \nin continuing with their course of conduct.\n  My colleague from Kentucky says that there has been no improvement at \nall; that they have not responded at all. Mr. President, I would say \nthat is debatable. We asked the Burmese to do a couple of things, both \nof which they did. We asked them to release Aung San Suu Kyi. They did, \nas my colleague from Kentucky says. She is not under house arrest. She \nstays at home because it is the safest place. Maybe so. But we asked \nthem to do that, and they did that. She is not in prison. That is not \nmuch but it is something we asked them to do, and they did it.\n  We asked them to release the Members of Parliament. Most of them have \nbeen released. Several hundred have been released. There are a number \nwhich remain in prison. They say there is no Member of Parliament in \nprison, and rather cynically they are able to justify that by saying \nthey decertified those Members of Parliament.\n  So I do not mean to make the case that the Burmese are responding \ncompletely, or responding in good faith, or that there is great reason \nto hope. But, Mr. President, there is some progress and some measurable \nprogress where there was none before. When Ne Win was running that \ncountry, you could not even get American news media in; a member of the \nnews media. Now, Mr. President, there is at least reason to hope.\n  My friend from Kentucky says Aung San Suu Kyi, that brave woman who \ndid in fact win the election, has backed his position. Mr. President, I \ntried to read everything that she has said. I stand second to none in \nmy admiration for her. She is a very brave woman. She has risked her \npersonal safety to stand up for freedom and democracy in Burma. And I \nhope eventually that she will be successful.\n  But I am not aware--I was going to ask my colleague from Kentucky--if \nshe has endorsed the specific language of the McConnell amendment. Has \nshe endorsed this specific language?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Louisiana that I believe \nthe answer to that is yes.\n  Let me read the quote. I have not shown her the language. She said \nthat ``Foreign investment currently benefits only Burma's military.'' \nThese are direct words from Aung San Suu Kyi. ``Foreign investment \ncurrently benefits only Burma's military rulers and some local \ninterests but would not help improve the lot of the Burmese in \ngeneral.'' She says, ``Investment made now is very much against the \ninterests of the people of Burma.'' She said further, these are direct \nquotes in May 1996, this year: ``Burma is not developing in any way. \nSome people are getting very rich. That is not economic development.'' \nAll of those are direct recent quotes.\n\n  I think it is safe to say that she hopes that we will begin these \nkinds of sanctions.\n  A further direct quote from the New York Times of July 19, 1996, \ndirect quote: ``What we want are the kind of sanctions that will make \nit quite clear that economic change in Burma is not possible without \npolitical change.''\n  So I would say to my friend from Louisiana, the answer is no. I have \nnot shown her the actual language. I am totally confident that she \nsupports the approach that I have recommended.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for responding on \nthat. I think the answer to my question is--and I think the Senator was \nhonest in saying--that Aung San Suu Kyi has neither seen nor endorsed \nthis language, that she in fact endorsed sanctions, as the Senator from \nMaine [Mr. Cohen] has in his amendment. It is sanctions. One of the \ncentral questions is this. I made up a little poem. I am not as good at \npoetry as the Senator from Maine is, but my little poem is this:\n\n       A sanction will not a sanction be if it hurts the \n     sanctioner and not the sanctionee.\n\n  What that means is if all you do is cost American jobs and influence \nby substituting, for Unocal, Total, a French company, when Unocal is \ntrying its best to influence the SLORC, influence the government, doing \nwhat it can, and all you are doing is getting the Americans out and \nputting in the French, getting the Americans out and putting in the \nSouth Koreans, then I submit that is no sanction at all.\n  Now, we are told by my friend from Kentucky that there is precedent \nfor this because we have taken unilateral sanctions against Iran and \nLibya and Cuba.\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n  First of all, I think these three countries are greatly \ndistinguishable, the first two practicing terrorism all around the \nworld, and in the case of Cuba, shooting down American planes over \ninternational airspace. Whatever else you may say about Burma, they do \nnot practice state terrorism, nor do they threaten their neighbors.\n  Moreover, my friend from Kentucky says that sanctions sometimes work \nand sometimes do not, and he talks about the example of South Africa. \nThey did, in fact, work in South Africa where you had a united world. \nThe whole world was united against South Africa. In the case of Burma, \nthe United States, to my knowledge, has not one single ally. The \nnations of the area, the ASEAN countries, actively oppose sanctions and \nactively hope that we will engage Burma not just because they want to \ntrade with Burma, and they do, but because they believe that the best \nway to sanitize that regime, to encourage a dialog, to bring democracy \nto Burma is by beginning to engage that country.\n  The European Union 2 weeks ago voted not to impose unilateral \nsanctions. Not even the Danes, whose diplomat there died in prison \nunder very suspicious circumstances, are willing to engage in sanctions \nagainst Burma.\n  The Cohen amendment seeks to have our administration get other \nnations of the world to engage in multilateral sanctions. Multilateral \nsanctions will work. If we can engage the other countries of the region \nand of the world to cooperate with us in sanctions, that, in fact, will \nbe a sanction and will not be what we call friendly fire. Friendly \nfire, as we found out in Desert Storm and as we have always known, \nnever hurts the other side. It hurts yourself. It decreases our \ninfluence with Burma.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge that we pass the Cohen amendment \nand that we seek to help bring democracy to Burma.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Very briefly, I just wanted to make a couple of \nobservations with regard to the comments of my good friend from \nLouisiana.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi has a cousin, an official spokesman, who resides in \nthe United States and heads an organization called the National \nCoalition of Government of the Union of Burma. He is, in effect, Aung \nSan Suu Kyi's spokesman in our country. He is here because he has to be \nhere. He cannot be over there and continue to breathe. I have a copy of \na letter dated July 12, 1996, from him on the very issue that we are \ndebating here this morning. Dr. Sein Win says:\n\n       The immediate imposition of economic sanctions against the \n     ruling military junta is urgently needed. I do not take the \n     impositions of sanctions on my country lightly.\n\n  He understands what we are talking about here.\n\n       I and the democratic forces working to liberate our country \n     know that foreign investment serves to strengthen SLORC. It \n     is providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army \n     and intelligence service whose only job is to crush \n     international dissent.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The situation in my country has deteriorated into free \n     fall.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       I urge you to stand on the side of 42 million freedom-\n     loving Burmese and support economic sanctions against this \n     rogue regime.\n\n  I certainly agree with my friend from Louisiana that the State Law \nand Order Restoration Council is no threat to its neighbors. It is not. \nIt is a threat to its own citizens. That is what this is, a regime of \nterrorism against the Burmese people. If we do not impose sanctions \nunilaterally, who is going to start this? Who is going to take the lead \nif the United States does not? Sooner or later, if the international \ncommunity is going to notice what is going on there and take some \nsteps, it is going to happen because of American leadership.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri is anxious to speak. \nI will come back to this later. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment by \nmy colleague from Maine. I am very much concerned about the impact of \nthe provisions in the underlying bill. Like most, if not all, of my \ncolleagues, I would agree and agree wholeheartedly that the present \nconditions in Burma, or Myanmar, are deplorable. The conditions of \nSLORC cannot and should not be condoned. As I have said in the past on \nmany occasions, their claim to govern is an illegitimate claim. Their \nhold on power through oppression and denial of human rights is one that \nI and, I believe, everyone else in this body would like to see come to \nend as soon as possible.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won an election in 1990 and I am \nconfident would win again if another election were held today. SLORC \ncame to power solely due to its ability to coerce. Period. End of \nstory.\n  The question that we are now trying to answer is, how do we respond \nto the situation? How can the United States influence the activities of \nSLORC to bring about change in Burma and to bring the democratically \nelected government of Aung San Suu Kyi back to Burma?\n  One approach that is taken in the foreign operations appropriations \nbill is to try to achieve change in Burma through total unilateral \nsanctions--unilateral sanctions. This approach assumes that such \nactions will influence and pressure SLORC to change its behavior.\n  I have to commend my colleagues for their eagerness, their dedication \nand the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky to try to see that we \ndo something to bring about change in Burma, but I am not convinced \nthat cutting off what little contact we do have with that country will \nserve the positive purpose we seek. That action, in my opinion, will do \nnothing to bring about change in Burma. Such sanctions would be \nineffective in achieving their purpose and would solely deny the \nBurmese people, the ones we are trying to assist in this whole debate, \nthe positive effect of closer and deeper American engagement.\n\n  What would be accomplished by implementing sanctions unilaterally on \na country where U.S. investment is relatively insignificant, minor, \nalmost unimportant and would be quickly taken up by our competitors? We \nmust remember that all of the nations of Asia and much of Europe, \nincluding France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, disagree with this \npolicy of sanctions.\n  Like the Senator from Maine, I have had the opportunity to visit with \nleaders in the ASEAN countries, and I can tell you that they are not \ngoing to impose sanctions. They believe in engagement. They are going \nto continue to engage in Burma.\n  Is the progress toward peace, human rights, and the recognition of \ndemocratic principles more likely to be furthered by our withdrawing \nfrom the field? I think not. Sanctions did work in South Africa, but \nonly because the United States was part of a much larger coalition. \nThey do not work when we go in as the Lone Ranger and try to cut off \nour minuscule investment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has given us quotes from Aung San Suu Kyi \nand her spokesperson, in which they talk about foreign sanctions. If \nall countries who are now trading with Burma could be enlisted, then \nthere could be a major impact. But I can tell you from talking to--and \nmostly from listening to--the leaders of the countries that are the \nneighbors of Burma, that is not going to happen.\n  Burma is just beginning to open its doors to the outside world. There \nare neighboring countries and other countries in the world anxious and \nwilling to go in. The opening is a unique opportunity that we have not \nseen before, an opportunity to help bring about change, to make things \nhappen. Frankly, I am not so much concerned, not so much interested in \nthe very small investment that our companies may now have in Burma. If \nwe were part of an overall sanctions picture, I would say it would be \nworth it, if other countries would get out as well. But I can see us \nhaving a positive effect in the entire region if we continue to be \ninvolved, if we continue to have the opportunity to exercise U.S. \ninfluence to bring U.S. values to that country. It just makes sense.\n  How can we influence anything if we are the only ones outside the \nroom while the rest of the world is carrying on without us, probably \nhappy to see us play the self-righteous outsider and get\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\nout? I cannot see how punishing United States firms by threatening to \nkeep them out of Burma is an effective way to bring about change. \nUnited States presence, U.S. firms are the ones on the ground who can \nhelp spread American values.\n  Obviously, our global competitors and Burma's neighbors see \nopportunities arising in Burma. I fear they are more interested in \nmonetary gain, in many instances, from such change and not the \nopportunity to bring about the political change that we in the United \nStates are seeking. I can imagine that European and Asian trade \ncompetitors would be wildly supportive and happy to see total sanctions \nunilaterally imposed by the United States on its own companies.\n  Another possibility we must start considering is the security issue \nof continually isolating Burma. To do so could drive them into the arms \nof the Chinese. A strong security relationship between Burma and China \nis not, in my view, in the best interests of the United States. I fear \nto think what it would mean if such a relationship were to lead to a \nport in Southeast Asia for the Chinese Navy.\n  At this time the United States does not do much for Burma. We \npurchase a mere 7 percent of all Burma's exports and provide an \ninsignificant 1 percent of its imports. We provide them no aid. We \nlimit international financing by continuing to vote against loans to \nBurma through international financial institutions. Frankly, these \nvotes are likely to be overridden by other voting countries who seek \nthe opportunities that large-scale projects in Burma would provide. We \nhave very little leverage even now with Burma. To isolate ourselves \neven further from that country would be to give up what little \ninfluence, what positive pressure for change we can bring.\n  The United States can either be at the table and foster meaningful \ndialog and negotiations, or we can walk out of the room. I believe \nthat, recognizing the opportunity that SLORC is providing by opening \nBurma to foreign interests, staying and engaging the country's foreign \nleader is the best hope we have for fostering democratic change in \nBurma.\n\n  We all want to see change in Burma. We all feel that SLORC's actions \nare reprehensible and would like to see the legitimately elected \ngovernment of Aung San Suu Kyi brought to power. I hope, while making \nefforts to bring about these results, we do not give up existing and \nfuture United States interests, not only in Burma but throughout \nSoutheast Asia. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague for an excellent statement. I \necho his comments. I also compliment Senator Cohen for his amendment.\n  Senator Johnston and I have been working on a comparable amendment. \nIt is almost identical. We are not going to offer that. I think it is \nimportant for people to have one alternative to the language in the \nappropriations bill.\n  On page 188 in the bill, it says we are going to have sanctions \nagainst Burma. All of us want to change policies in Burma. Burma has \nbeen repressive. It has denied human rights. We need to make changes. \nSo, how does the committee, or how does the language that we have \nbefore us in the bill, do that? First, it says, ``No national of the \nUnited States shall make any investment in Burma.''\n  Some people, some companies, some U.S. citizens have already made \ninvestments. We are going to say no more investments; no investments, \nperiod. That is a very stark punishment. I am not sure it is punishment \nso much on Burma and officials in Burma as it is on officials of the \nUnited States and people of the United States. The language continues. \nIt goes on and says we will deny United States assistance to Burma.\n  The Cohen amendment does that as well, but it is a little more \ntargeted. Under the language that we have in the bill, it says United \nStates assistance to Burma is prohibited. Under the Cohen amendment it \nsays assistance is prohibited except for humanitarian assistance. We \nare trying to help some people. There has been repression over there. \nIt also says we could continue to have assistance in areas for \ncounternarcotics. Right now there are a lot of narcotics coming from \nBurma. Should we not have United States assistance, some undercover, \nsome open, used to investigate sources of heroin and other drugs that \nmight be leaving Burma and ultimately end up in the United States? The \nlanguage that is in the bill before us would deny any assistance, \nincluding counternarcotics efforts. I think that would be a serious \nmistake.\n  The idea of having a unilateral sanction, I think, is a mistake. I \nthink, if we are going to have sanctions, they should be multilateral. \nIf we are saying only the United States steps forward, no U.S. citizen \nshall invest, and no other country comes forward, there may not be any \nchange whatsoever. Certainly, if we are going to have U.S. sanctions, I \nwant my colleagues to consider--I will not be offering it at this time, \nbut I was considering an amendment that we should at least have a \nreport on the economic impact and whether or not it had any positive \nimpact on achieving our goal.\n  If we have sanctions, certainly we want to know whether they are \nworking or not working. We want to have the changes in Burma, but do we \nmake those changes when we have unilateral sanctions affecting our very \nsmall investments? I doubt it. Certainly they can be offset by other \ncountries.\n\n  Can you have changes when you have multilateral sanctions? Possibly. \nSanctions are difficult in this day and age. When the Carter \nadministration imposed a wheat embargo on Russia for some serious \nabuses, what happened is we lost markets to one of our weak \ncompetitors. In Russia, it was replaced by a lot of other countries--\nAustralia, Argentina and other countries. They expanded their wheat \nbase. They exported to Russia. Russia now does not buy as much from the \nUnited States. They buy from other countries. We just created another \ngroup of competitors in this particular one commodity. Did we change \npolicy in Russia? I do not think so. I do not think that had, really, a \ntriggering impact in making policy changes. I want to make the policy \nchange.\n  Another important segment of the Cohen amendment is that it does give \nthe President some discretion, some leverage, which will have influence \non future decisions on Burma. Do we just want to punish them for past \ndecisions, punish them or punish American citizens? I am afraid we will \nbe punishing Americans more than we will be punishing the Burmese \nofficials.\n  But more important, how do we change future behavior? I think the \nCohen amendment does more toward changing future behavior because it \nsays we are actually giving some discretion. If we do not see \nimprovements, then some sanctions will come about, but the President \nand the diplomatic efforts can be using those for leverage. There is \nnot a lot of leverage when it says no national of the United States can \nmake any investment, the United States can give no assistance \nwhatsoever. I am afraid that will not influence anything toward the \npositive.\n  Frankly, it will cost the United States. It will be taking \ninvestments away from American citizens, I think unquestionably, and I \ndoubt it would have the economic impact desired by my colleague from \nKentucky.\n  I respect greatly the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky. I know he \nbelieves very sincerely in trying to effect change in Burma. I happen \nto share the goal of my colleague from Kentucky. I just think the \nmethod toward best achieving that would be through the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen. I compliment him on \nthat amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I can say quickly to my friend from \nOklahoma before he leaves, I appreciate his kind words about my work on \nthis issue. If I heard him correctly--and I don't want to misstate his \nposition--did I hear my friend from Oklahoma say that he thought \nassisting the regime there was a good idea? Maybe I misheard him.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, no, I did not. I say to my colleague, I \nwas referring to the section that says no assistance whatsoever. I \nwould conclude that to prohibit U.S. contributions involved in any way \ndealing with, I think--we have exceptions for drug interdiction. Can we \nspend money in\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nBurma for drug interdiction, drug identification, undercover or \notherwise? I think we should have an opportunity.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The current law forbids that. We just last year \nimposed a prohibition on dealing with SLORC. So this would, in effect, \nweaken existing law.\n  I wanted to make sure my friend from Oklahoma knew that. Existing law \nsays no U.S. cooperation with SLORC on the drug issue, frankly because \nwe don't trust them. So the Cohen amendment would actually weaken \nexisting law in terms of the U.S. relationship with SLORC. I just \nwanted to make that clear.\n  Let me make a few observations about the argument that the approach \nwe are recommending is inevitably going to be unilateral in nature and \nnobody will follow us.\n  Already there is action in the European Parliament. Let me point out \nto my colleagues what action has been taken this month in the European \nParliament.\n  First, the European Parliament has condemned torture, arrests, \ndetentions, and human rights abuses perpetrated by SLORC. Obviously, \nthat is an easy thing to do.\n  It supports the suspension of concessional lending to SLORC, a little \ntougher step.\n  Third, the European Parliament has called upon members to suspend GSP \nfor exports to Burma because of forced labor conditions.\n  And fourth, Mr. President, and most important, the European Union has \ncalled upon its members to suspend trade and investment with Burma.\n  The July 1996 European Union resolution restricts visas to SLORC \nofficials and their families, something that is in the underlying bill \nand I hope we adopt.\n  The resolution restricts the movement of SLORC diplomatic personnel, \nsuspends all high-level visits, demands full investigation and \naccountability for the death in custody of Denmark, Finland, Norway, \nand Switzerland's consul, Leo Nichols. Let me talk about Leo Nichols. \nLeo Nichols was Aung San Suu Kyi's best friend. He was the European \nconsul who represented a number of European countries in Burma as a \nsort of local consulate official.\n  Leo Nichols was arrested a few months ago for the crime of possessing \na fax machine, Mr. President. In Burma, if you are on the wrong side of \nthis issue, you can be arrested for such things as possessing a fax \nmachine. So Leo Nichols was arrested for possessing a fax machine and \nturned up dead. They had a hard time getting the body. He was denied \nmedication.\n  All of a sudden, Europe discovered Burma, because a European citizen \ngot treated the same way the Burmese citizens are treated on a daily \nbasis--on a daily basis. All of a sudden, a European citizen got \ntreated that way, and Europeans have all of a sudden gotten more \ninterested in this issue.\n  So I raise this point to suggest that if America has the courage to \ntake this step unilaterally, we will not be alone for very long. As a \nmatter of fact, the rest of the world is getting interested in this \nissue. Secretary Christopher called me from Indonesia the day before \nyesterday to talk about this issue. Obviously, he supports the \namendment of the Senator from Maine, and that is certainly OK.\n  Mr. COHEN. If the Senator will yield, I don't believe he does. He \ndoes not express support for this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry, I retract that. Let's put it this way. The \nSecretary of State would like a proposal, I think, that gives the \nadministration wide latitude to manage this issue as they see best, and \nI hope it is not a misstatement of the Senator's amendment that it does \ngive the administration a good deal of latitude.\n  Mr. COHEN. It gives the administration some flexibility. They would \nlike more. Mine does not give them quite as much as they like.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly would not want to misstate the position of \nthe administration, but I am confident in saying the Secretary of State \nwould prefer not to have unilateral sanctions. I think the Senator from \nMaine would agree with that.\n  I have been a little surprised the administration has not gotten \ninterested in this issue, but I think they are getting more interested \nin the issue.\n  The point I was going to make before my friend from Maine stood up \nwas what Secretary Christopher pointed out to me is it was discussed \nfor an hour the other night at the ASEAN meeting. Previously, they \nacted like Burma was not there. Nobody talks about it. It is being \nforced on to the agenda, even in the part of the world that is least \ninterested in doing anything about the regime, for all the obvious \nreasons. They have the biggest investment there.\n  So this is not going to go away, Mr. President. I don't know what is \ngoing to happen on the vote on the Cohen amendment, but it is not going \nto go away until SLORC goes away and until the results of the election \nin 1990 are honored.\n  I don't want to misrepresent at all the position of the \nadministration on the Cohen proposal. All I can say is it is exactly \nwhat the administration and the National Security Council asked me to \naccept on Monday, but they will have to speak for themselves. This \namendment, by the way, is not directed at the Clinton administration. \nThe Bush administration was worse, from my point of view, on Burma than \nthis administration has been. At least they discuss it occasionally.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just conclude this segment by saying I \ndon't think we will be alone very long if we have the courage to take \nthis step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John Lis, a \nJavits fellow currently working on Senator Biden's personal staff be \nextended the privilege of the floor for the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing to yield to whomever \nwants the floor. If no one is seeking the floor, I will suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I understand there are a number of Senators \nwho would like to speak on this measure who cannot come to the floor at \nthis time. So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum in a \nmoment, but then agree to lay aside this amendment so that other \namendments that may be pending can be considered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is going to be further debate on \nthis amendment. But it is my plan, when Senator Cohen has completed, if \nthere are no other speakers at this moment, to lay this amendment \naside. I understand Senator Smith is ready to offer an amendment that \nhe will need a rollcall vote on. We will move to the Smith amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Could I just indicate for the record, during the course of \nthe debate this morning the question of the administration's position \nwas raised. I have since been apprised that the administration does \nlend its support to the Cohen amendment, which prior to the beginning \nof the discussion of this matter it did not. So perhaps they have been \nwatching C-SPAN and have tuned in to see the better part of wisdom in \nsupporting the Cohen amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter, signed by \nBarbara Larkin, Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Cohen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cohen: The Administration welcomes and \n     supports the amendment which you and others have offered to \n     Section 569 (Limitation on Funds for Burma) of H.R. 3540, the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. We believe the \n     current and conditional sanctions which your language \n     proposes are\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n     consistent with Administration policy. As we have stated on \n     several occasions in the past, we need to maintain our \n     flexibility to respond to events in Burma and to consult with \n     Congress on appropriate responses to ongoing and future \n     development there.\n       We support a range of tough measures designed to bring \n     pressure to bear upon the regime in Rangoon. We continue to \n     urge international financial institutions not to provide \n     support to Burma under current circumstances. We maintain a \n     range of unilateral sanctions and do not promote U.S. \n     commercial investment in or trade with Burma. We refrain from \n     selling arms to Burma and have an informal agreement with our \n     G-7 friends and allies to do the same.\n       On the international level, we have strongly supported \n     efforts in the UN General Assembly and the International \n     Labor Organization to condemn human and worker rights \n     violations in Burma. At the UN Human Rights Commission this \n     month, we led the effort against attempts to water down the \n     Burma resolution. We have urged the UN to play an active role \n     in promoting democratic reform through a political dialogue \n     with Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program there is no \n     objection to the submission of this report. We note, however, \n     that the working of two of the sanctions as currently drafted \n     raises certain constitutional concerns. We look forward to \n     working with you and the conferees to address this.\n       We hope this information is useful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to call if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Cohen-Feinstein-Chafee-McCain amendment with respect to \nBurma.\n  Before I begin, I want to express my admiration for the distinguished \nmanager of the bill, Senator McConnell, who has almost singlehandedly \nbrought this issue to the floor. He has been doggedly pursuing \nadjustments to our Burma policy for many months, and has focused the \nattention of the Senate and the administration on this issue in a way \nthat would not have happened otherwise.\n  There is clearly no division, I think, at least, in this body, on the \nnature of the SLORC regime in Burma. It is an oppressive antidemocratic \nregime, and it has systematically deprived the people of Burma of the \nright to govern themselves. There is no disagreement on that point, I \nthink, nor on the desirability of restoration of democracy in Burma.\n  The key question, though, we need to ask, is what is the most \neffective way to advance the goal? In order to answer that question, we \nneed to have a clear understanding of what leverage we have, or lack \nof, on Burma. We also need to have a clear understanding of how other \ninterests in the region will be affected. The key problem with the \nBurma provision, as I view it, in the bill before the Senate, is that \nit presumes we can unilaterally affect change on Burma.\n  I have come, as I have watched world events, to doubt that unilateral \nsanctions make much sense. It is absolutely essential that any pressure \nwe seek to put on the Government of Burma be coordinated with the \nnations of ASEAN and our European and Asian allies. If we act \nunilaterally, we are more likely to have the opposite affect--\nalienating many of these allies, while having no real impact on the \nground.\n  One of the key aspects of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMaine is that it requires the President to work to develop, in \ncoordination with members of ASEAN and other nations having major \ntrading and investment interests in Burma, a comprehensive multilateral \nstrategy to bring democracy and to improve human rights and the quality \nof life in Burma.\n\n  This strategy must include the promotion of dialog between the SLORC \nand democratic opposition groups in Burma. Only a multilateral approach \nis likely to be successful. Knowing that the ASEAN nations, who are \nmoving now toward more engagement with Burma, not less, will not join \nus in sanctions at this time, it is clear that such a policy will not \nbe effective. For example, on the Unocal pipeline, if we apply \nunilateral sanctions, the Unocal pipeline, which is now a joint venture \nbetween France and the United States company, will only be taken over \nby either Japanese interests--I am told Mitsui is interested--or South \nKorean interests. Therefore, what point do we really prove?\n  The Cohen-Feinstein amendment does recognize that there are steps we \ncan and should take at this time. It does ban bilateral assistance to \nBurma, but it does so with three important exceptions. First, it allows \nhumanitarian assistance, which is clearly a reasonable exception in the \ncase of natural disaster or other humanitarian calamity. Second, it \nallows assistance that promotes human rights and democratic values, \nwhich clearly makes sense, since that is what we are trying to promote \nin Burma. Finally, it allows an exemption for counternarcotics \nassistance, if the Secretary of State can certify that the Government \nof Burma is fully cooperating with the United States counternarcotics \neffort, and that such assistance is consistent with United States human \nrights concerning Burma.\n  This last exemption goes to perhaps, I believe, our most important \ninterest in Burma. Sixty percent of the heroin coming into the United \nStates comes from Burma today, and it is a growing scourge on our \ncities. The Burmese Government is not cooperating with the United \nStates counternarcotics interests and is benefiting from the drug \ntrade. The President has decertified Burma on these grounds. But this \nexemption does recognize that if conditions change, it would be in our \ninterest to be able to engage a cooperative Burmese Government in a \ncounternarcotics policy. It is clearly in our interests to have this \nability.\n  The Cohen-Feinstein amendment also directs the United States to \noppose loans by international financial institutions to Burma, and it \nprohibits entry visas to Burmese Government officials, except as \nrequired by treaty obligations.\n  In addition, the amendment requires the President to report regularly \nto the Congress on progress toward democratization in Burma, \nimprovement in human rights, including the use of forced labor, and \nprogress toward developing a multilateral strategy with our allies.\n  The amendment gives us some leverage by making clear that the United \nStates is prepared to act unilaterally if SLORC takes renewed action to \nrearrest, to harm, or to exile Aung San Suu Kyi, or otherwise engages \nin large-scale repression of the democratic opposition. The courage and \ndignity of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues deserves respect and \nsupport from all of us. This provision may provide some measure of \nprotection against increased oppression against them. We may be able to \nhave the effect of nudging the SLORC toward an increased dialog with \nthe democratic opposition. That is why we also allow the President to \nlift sanctions if he determines that Burma has made measurable and \nsubstantial progress toward improving human rights and implementing \ndemocratic government. We need to be able to have the flexibility to \nremove sanctions and provide support for Burma if it reaches a \ntransition stage that is moving toward the restoration of democracy, \nwhich all of us support.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Maine for his \nleadership in crafting this amendment. He has worked closely with the \nadministration, which supports his language. It represents the best \npolicy, I believe, for us to play a role in moving Burma toward \ndemocracy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, with all due respect to the able Senator \nfrom Maine, whom I do respect, I have a problem with his amendment. His \namendment is based on the premise that the United States should wait \nuntil a future time--nobody knows when--a future time to impose tougher \nsanctions against the illegal SLORC regime in Burma. The Cohen \namendment for conditional sanctions provides for a ban on new \ninvestment only ``if the President [of the United States] determines \nand certifies to Congress that,\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n[at some future date,] the Government of Burma has physically harmed, \nrearrested for political acts, or exiled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi or has \ncommitted large-scale repression of or violence against the democratic \nopposition.''\n  Mr. President, the Government of Burma, the SLORC, S-L-O-R-C, as it \nis known, has already done enough to Ms. Suu Kyi, has already committed \nlarge-scale repression and violence, not only against the democratic \nopposition, but against the people of Burma.\n  We know there is forced labor in Burma. There is no question about \nthat. We know that Burma is the source of more than 60 percent of the \nheroin finding its way into the United States, and we know that the \nSLORC regime is implicated in this trade. No question about it. \nHowever, we know that the people of Burma elected the National League \nfor Democracy overwhelmingly in elections 6 years ago, and that it has \nbeen straight downhill ever since that time.\n  The Cohen amendment also provides a waiver to the administration. I \nhave to ask the question--I do so with all respect--are we serious or \nare we not serious about Burma?\n  I support Chairman McConnell and my other distinguished colleagues \nwho have said, enough is enough. Let us stop allowing U.S. investment \nto prop up the SLORC regime's repression. I hope that colleagues will \nvote in that direction when the vote is taken. I thank the Chair and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee for his support for the sanctions against \nBurma. We have been very patient. The chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and I have been hoping since the Bush administration that \nsome administration would take this matter seriously.\n  I do not know whether the chairman agrees with me, but it seems to me \nif there were a bunch of Burmese-Americans, we would have gotten \ninterested in this a long time ago----\n  Mr. HELMS. That is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. A long time ago because this is a country that ranks \nright up there with Libya, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.\n  The proponents of the Cohen amendment will say they are no threat to \ntheir neighbors. I expect that is the case. But 400,000 of these highly \narmed, mean-as-a-snake troops, terrorizing their own citizens and \nlocking up, as the Senator from North Carolina pointed out, the duly \nelected leader of this country in internationally supervised, Western-\nstyle real elections in 1990--they are a real pariah regime. Yet the \ncrux of the Cohen amendment is, as the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee pointed out, that it gives the President total \ndiscretion to keep on doing what he has been doing, which is nothing.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Nothing. So I thank the chairman for his support for \nthis cause.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for the \nvery great work he is doing. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                            burma sanctions\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Cohen as an \noriginal cosponsor of his amendment to improve the language on Burma \nsanctions contained in the foreign operations bill. This amendment is \nconstructive and a better approach to addressing the problem that Burma \nposses for American foreign policy.\n  All of us in this body want the people of Burma to enjoy their human \nrights. But we must avoid a policy that will only make us feel good, \nbut that is unlikely to achieve the goals it is intended to serve. The \napproach advocated by the Appropriations Committee, while well-\nintentioned, is too precipitous. Imposing unilateral sanctions on Burma \nimmediately and lifting them only at such time as the SLORC allows a \ndemocratically elected government to take power may even provoke a \nreaction from the Burmese regime which is the opposite of what the \ncommittee intends.\n  Burma's regional and investment partners do not share the intensity \nof our concern for democracy and definitely do not agree with the \ncommittee imposition of sanctions.\n  The New York Times Monday reported the attitudes of nations attending \nthe weekend meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations \n[ASEAN]. The Indonesian Foreign Minister is quoted as saying, ``ASEAN \nhas one cardinal rule, and that is not to interfere in the internal \naffairs of other countries.'' Far from agreeing with those in the \nUnited States pushing for sanctions, ASEAN took the first step in \nadmitting Burma as a member, giving it official observer status.\n  ASEAN's reaction is important because these are the nations, along \nwith the People's Republic of China and the other nations of Asia, \nwhose views most concern the ruling authorities in Burma. The United \nStates accounts for less than 10 percent of foreign direct investment \nin Burma. It receives only 7 percent of Burma's exports and United \nStates imports account for only 1 percent of Burma's total imports. \nBoth Thailand and Singapore are bigger investors in Burma than the \nUnited States, as are France and Britain. Given these circumstances, it \nis hardly surprising that United States opinion carries less weight in \nBurma than it does elsewhere in the world.\n  Proponents of immediate and sweeping sanctions on Burma have often \ninvoked the example of South Africa. Indeed, Burma may actually exceed \nSouth Africa in its repression. After all, as repugnant as the system \nof apartheid was, South Africa did provide at least a minority of its \npeople with democratic rights while Burma systematically denies these \nrights to all its citizens. Burma certainly deserves the condemnation \nof all freedom loving people.\n  However, Burma is unlike South Africa in a number of ways which make \nsanctions unlikely to yield the same result.\n  First, United States policy toward South Africa was coordinated with \nour allies and that nation's most important trading partners. It was \nmultilateral. There was no serious prospect that when our companies \npulled out of the South African economy others would readily take their \nplace, thereby undermining the effect of sanctions and making their \nchief victim American companies. Second, South Africa was much richer \nthan Burma is today. Per capita income in South Africa was $2,000 when \nwe imposed sanctions. In Burma today it is $200, one of the lowest \nrates in the world. South Africa had a stake in the world economy. \nBurma has just begun to develop an interest in attracting foreign trade \nand investment. Third, Burma is an overwhelmingly rural economy, with \nmanufacturing accounting for 9.4 percent of GDP and 8.2 percent of \nemployment. Fourth, the South African regime and the elite that \nsupported it had historical connections to the nations censuring it. It \nwas not only affected materially by the sanctions imposed on it, but \nmany in South Africa who treasured their ties to the West were dismayed \nby their international isolation.\n  Burma has a long history of self-imposed isolation. Beginning in \n1962, the leaders of Burma believed that their interests were best \nserved by rejecting the pressures of the outside world. Even today, \nafter Burma began an economic opening to the world, that opening is \ndecidedly modest. Tom Vallely of Harvard has pointed out that Vietnam, \na nation struggling with its own market reforms, approved more \ninvestment in 6 months than Burma did in 6 years.\n  We are right to call for the institution of the democratically \nelected government of the National League for Democracy. In 1990, the \npeople of Burma participated in a democratic election, and \noverwhelmingly supported the National League for Democracy. The Burmese \nmilitary thwarted that victory and remains in place today as a standing \ninsult to the proposition of democratic self-rule. They have since \nruled the nation with an iron fist. But as despotic as they are, the \ngenerals who now control Burma constitutes the de-facto government.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Cohen is an attempt to recognize \nboth the rights of the Burmese people and the realities of power and \nhistory. It attempts to narrow the focus of our legislative efforts, \nand give the President, who, whether Democrat or Republican, is charged \nwith conducting\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nour Nation's foreign policy, some flexibility. This amendment has the \nexplicit support of the administration.\n  It has a number of specific advantages beyond giving the \nadministration more flexibility. Conditioning an investment sanction on \na significant deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma, \nnamely the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi or a general crackdown on the \ndemocratic opposition, is a key element which commends the alternative. \nI know that the committee is greatly interested in the safety and \nwelfare of Aung San Suu Kyi. However, I believe it may have erred in \nnot including such a targeted sanction in his own bill. If the language \nin the bill were signed into law, a ban on U.S. investment would come \ninto effect immediately. If the prospect of a United States investment \nsanction is restraining them at all, I see no reason why the Burmese \nauthorities would not rearrest Suu Kyi once the sanction is imposed. \nWhat would they have to lose? What would they have to lose in once \nagain rounding up prodemocracy activists by the hundreds? The Cohen \napproach preserves our options while at the same time making perfectly \nclear the action that the United States would take if the situation \ndeteriorates.\n\n  In the meantime, the Cohen amendment imposes three out of the four \nMcConnell sanctions: prohibition of foreign assistance except \nhumanitarian and counternarcotics assistance, U.S. opposition to \nmultilateral lending, and the denial of U.S. visas to members of the \nregime. While doubts remain about the efficacy of even these limited \nsanctions, they will at a minimum demonstrate American displeasure with \nthe situation in Burma. More importantly, a Senate vote in favor of the \nadministration-supported Cohen amendment will demonstrate the unity and \nresolve of American policy toward Burma.\n  The two exceptions made by Senator Cohen to the prohibition on \nforeign assistance are, I believe, very constructive.\n  Last year, Senator Kerry and I fought to permit counternarcotic \nassistance for Burma. Ultimately, we failed, but the Cohen substitute, \nif passed, will once again permit this vital assistance. As my \ncolleagues know, the United States has not provided assistance of this \ntype to Burma since 1988, despite the fact that Burma is the source of \nmore than 60 percent of the heroin on United States streets. Burma is \nthe largest opium producer in the world. If we are ever to get a handle \non the heroin problem in our own country, in addition to addressing \ndemand, we will have to work with the Burmese. Engaging in the battle \nand achieving some degree of success will result, at the very least, in \ndriving down the supply of opium and driving up the price.\n  To address the concerns of those who point to the possibility that \ncounternarcotics assistance in the hands of the SLORC might give them \nthe means to subdue its ethnic minorities, Senator Cohen's amendment \nrequires the Secretary of State to certify that any proposed \ncounternarcotic program is consistent with United States human rights \nconcerns.\n  The other exception to a ban on assistance in Senator Cohen's \namendment is humanitarian assistance. The committee amendment makes no \nallowance for humanitarian assistance. If the intent of the sanction on \nhumanitarian assistance is to withhold legitimacy from the regime, I \nbelieve its limited value in this respect would be vastly outweighed by \nthe practical ineffectiveness of unilateral sanctions. I am unconvinced \nthat gutting funding for Feed the Children and World Vision is going to \nmake Burma any more disposed toward democracy.\n  I know that many Senators would rather not impose any sanctions on \nBurma. But the committee has decided to weigh in on the formulation of \nUnited States-Burma policy. The SLORC's repression of the Burmese \npeople's pursuit of their God-given rights have made congressionally \nimposed sanctions on Burma inevitable. Senator Cohen has formulated an \napproach which is constructive and respectful of the prerogatives of \nthe President, and more likely to positively influence the situation in \nBurma than will the sanctions adopted by the committee. I commend him \nfor his work on this issue and encourage my colleagues to vote for the \nCoehn amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the State Department to \nSenator Cohen in support of his amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Cohen,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Cohen: The Administration welcomes and \n     supports the amendment which you and others have offered to \n     Section 569 (Limitation on Funds for Burma) of H.R. 3540, the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. We believe the \n     current and conditional sanctions which your language \n     proposes are consistent with Administration policy. As we \n     have stated on several occasions in the past, we need to \n     maintain our flexibility to respond to events to Burma and to \n     consult with Congress on appropriate responses to ongoing and \n     future developments there.\n       We support a range of tough measures designed to bring \n     pressure to bear upon the regime in Rangoon. We continue to \n     urge international financial institutions not to provide \n     support to Burma under current circumstances. We maintain a \n     range of unilateral sanctions and do not promote U.S. \n     commercial investment in or trade with Burma. We refrain from \n     selling arms to Burma and have an informal agreement with our \n     G-7 friends and allies to do the same.\n       On the international level, we have strongly supported \n     efforts in the UN General Assembly and the International \n     Labor Organization to condemn human and worker rights \n     violations in Burma. At the UN Human Rights Commission this \n     month, we led the effort against attempts to water down the \n     Burma resolution. We have urged the UN to play an active role \n     in promoting democratic reform through a political dialogue \n     with Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program there is no \n     objection to the submission of this report. We note, however, \n     that the wording of two of the sanctions as currently drafted \n     raises certain constitutional concerns. We look forward to \n     working with you and the conferees to address this.\n       We hope this information is useful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to call if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Maine as a substitute to Section 569 of \nthis bill regarding sanctions against the regime in Burma.\n  Section 569 is similar to a bill, S. 1511, offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, which I have had the honor to \ncosponsor, and others have done as well. This is very simply a test of \nhow we will respond to democracy denied.\n  For the longest while now, from the time, I would suppose, of Woodrow \nWilson's ``Fourteen Points,'' the United States has actively encouraged \nthe spread of democracy and democratic institutions in the world, \nrightfully thinking that the world would be a safer and better place. \nWe have seen in the course of this century events that would not have \nbeen thought possible at the outset.\n  Here at the end of the century, we see events that would not have \nbeen thought possible. Russia has had two presidential elections, the \nfirst in Russian history. Mongolia has had free elections. The \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia was on the floor speaking just the \nother day about his experience as an observer in Mongolia. Not only did \nMongolia have a free election, but they had observers from around the \nworld and, principally, the United States to attest to that fact.\n  The movement towards democracy is not universal. It has never taken \nstrong hold on the continent of Africa, and yet it now appears in \nEurasia and in South Asia. The Republic of India has just had its 11th, \nI believe, national election since independence, an unbroken sequence \nof democratic elections, with one interval of national emergency but it \nwas for a relatively short period of time and ended with the \nconstitution intact.\n  The Government of Bangladesh has just had a free election between two \nformidable women political leaders who are descendants, in one form or \nanother, of leaders previously deposed and shot, events that are too \ncommon in post-colonial nations. But they have\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\nhad a free election and picked an impressive new Prime Minister to form \na government.\n  British India, as it was called, extended down to the Bay of Bengal \non the eastern side and included not only Bangladesh but what is now \nMyanmar, formerly Burma. The choice between the term Burma and Myanmar \nis a choice of languages, Myanmar is a Burman term. It is a multiethnic \nstate, with eight major ethnic groups, as all those states are, each \nwith many languages--though none at the level of India itself. Burma \nhas four principal languages and historically has had very strong \ndisagreements on the periphery with the governments at the center in \nwhat was Rangoon. The name has been changed, which is a perfectly \nlegitimate thing to do, by the military regime whose initials form the \nunenviable acronym SLORC, as if ``SLORCing'' out of the black lagoon.\n  This is a regime which has not simply failed to move toward a \ndemocratic government, but has overthrown a democratic government, \nimprisoned the democratically elected leaders, a Nobel Prize-winning \nPrime Minister, sir.\n  Burma is largely a Buddhist nation. Tensions between the numerous \nethnic groups resulted in a long and not happy post-colonial \nexperience.\n  I was once our Ambassador to India, and I remember visiting Mandalay, \nwhere we had a one-man consulate. I was being driven around. I came to \nthe area of the city where there were Chinese language signs. I asked \nthe Burmese driver, ``Are there many Chinese here in Mandalay?'' He \nsaid, ``Well, not many now, but before independence, the Indians and \nthe Chinese owned everything around here. And that's why we had to have \nsocialism.'' It was simply a form of expelling persons, moving in the \ngeneral melee of the 19th century colonial Asia.\n  After a series of decent enough governments, possibly too passive \nfrom one event to another, the army seized control. Twenty years of a \nhard dictatorship followed, with a military junta headed by a general \nplaying golf in the shadow of a pagoda, while a nation, a potentially \nrich nation, all but starved.\n\n  It is an experience we have seen before, nothing new, but it was \ncruelly inappropriate to Burma. I visited it at that time. Clearly, a \nland capable of great agricultural product, an industrial-capable \npeople, ruined by government. They stayed ruined a long time, until \nthey rose and realized, no, and in 1990, a free election at long last \nwas held in Burma. The National League for Democracy won 82 percent of \nthe vote, but the military junta did not step down.\n  This was not the beginning. This did not just happen suddenly. There \nwas a movement for a democratic government that has been out in the \njungles for a generation. I think if I had one photograph that would \nsay to me more than anything else about our century, it would be a \njungle clearing, I expect it would be up in the Shan state, where some \n60 or so young men, aged 18, 19, 20--and this is at a time, about 15 \nyears ago, when Ne Win was still in power.\n  Senator Kennedy and I had made efforts such as Senator McConnell is \nleading today. There in perfect English, perfectly formed letters, a \nwhite sign with black letters, script that must have been 30 feet \nlong--these young men were holding this sign which said, ``Thank you \nSenators Kennedy and Moynihan.'' They were out in the jungle and they \nknew, and it mattered that they knew. It kept them going. What we think \nmatters so much in the world on these matters.\n  The military regime that overthrew the democratic government--having \nstepped aside, then a coup immediately followed. The results of the \nelection have not yet been implemented. The Prime Minister elected, \nAung San Suu Kyi, has been released from house arrest, but only just \nbarely. She has, you might say, a patio and a bit of garden, a front \nyard.\n  The world is watching. We are going to hear today--and we will not \nhear wrong--that if we impose these sanctions, American firms will lose \nopportunities, and European firms or Asian firms will take advantage of \nthem. And that may be true. But I wonder for how long, and I wonder in \nthe end at what profit. If our firms are strong and competitive and \ninternational, it is because of the principles the United States has \nstood for in this century, and should continue to stand for.\n  It is one thing when we find we cannot move a nation closer to \ndemocracy. Not many external forces can do that. It comes when the time \nis ready, then so often not even then. But when a democratic regime has \nnot emerged, overwhelmingly supported by an oppressed people who have \nresisted that oppression, who have understood it, who looked abroad for \nany signs of support and seen in the United States, in this Senate \nChamber, such support, emboldened, encouraged, and have risen to claim \ntheir rights as a people, only to have it crushed by a military regime, \nSLORC? No, sir.\n  This is the time for the United States to stand for what is best in \nour Nation, in our national tradition, what is triumphant in the world. \nThis is not a time to allow the overthrow of the democracy. This is no \ntime to beat retreat. This is a time for the McConnell provision for \nsanctions on Burma.\n  And I thank the Chair for your courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, there is no peer in the Senate, in fact, \nin the country, of the Senator from New York in his knowledge of \nhistory. Therefore, I wonder, what is the basis of this hope that other \ncountries, particularly Asian countries, would join in a unilateral \naction started by the United States?\n  Can the Senator tell me, outside of maybe the South African \nsituation, where we have had luck with having others joining us \nunilaterally? If we cannot get the Europeans to join us with Libya, an \ninternational terrorist organization, Iran, the same, and Cuba, how in \nthe world are we going to get them to join with sanctions against \nBurma?\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I do not claim that this is something easily done or we \nwould have done it long since. But I think that it is something which \ncan be done. I think the Republic of South Korea is so little \ninterested in how we feel about matters of Burma, there are ways to \nsuggest to the Republic of South Korea that it might well reconsider \nits position. Not for nothing do we have the United States Army \ndivisions in Korea. If they think that is not really in their interest, \nthat can be arranged, too.\n  I do not dispute the Senator's point. I simply make the argument that \na matter of principle is at stake here. If it is costly, so be it. \nPrinciples are precious.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may follow further on the example you mentioned, \nSouth Korea. If you turn the clock back to 1962, when General Ne Win \ntook control, he had control for over a quarter of a century. At that \ntime, Burma was a relatively prosperous country. South Korea was not \nprosperous and was----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Was devastated.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. A totally repressive regime. The same, I think, would \nbe said for our friends, the Taiwanese.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The difference between our treatment of the three is \nthat we isolated Burma, and General Ne Win isolated himself, whereas, \nbecause of the cold war, we embraced the Taiwanese, we embraced the \nSouth Koreans. Today, having been isolated for over a quarter of a \ncentury, Burma continues to be the same country it was, maybe only \nworse than 30-odd years ago, whereas South Korea and Taiwan have \ndeveloped into thriving, prosperous democracies.\n  Now, does the Senator see any lesson to be learned from this \ndifference in treatment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. Both Taiwan and South Korea have now established \nfreely elected governments. If they were suddenly to be overthrown by a \nmilitary coup, our position would have to be, in my view, very \ndifferent. But it is just such a situation in Burma.\n  I have a letter here from the Office of the Prime Minister of the \nNational Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, which says:\n\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I have been closely following the \n     Burma sanctions bill on the Senate floor and I am extremely \n     alarmed about the proposal put forth by Senator Cohen. As you \n     are no doubt aware, the Senate vote is crucial because it \n     will send a signal to both the prodemocracy movement and the \n     military junta about how people in the United States view the \n     struggle for democracy in Burma.\n\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, \n           Office of the Prime Minister,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I have been closely following the \n     Burma sanctions bill on the Senate floor and I am extremely \n     alarmed about the proposal put forward by Senator Cohen. As \n     you are no doubt aware, the Senate vote is crucial because it \n     will send a signal to both the prodemocracy movement and the \n     military junta about how people in the United States view the \n     struggle for democracy in Burma. Given the reality in Burma, \n     the National Coalition Government categorically opposes \n     Senator Cohen's legislation. The Senate cannot afford to send \n     a wrong signal and there is no other time than now to express \n     its support for the democracy movement through the imposition \n     of economic sanctions.\n       Let me be clear, investments will not bring about better \n     living conditions and democracy to the people because in \n     Burma investments pay for the soldiers, buy the guns and the \n     supplies and ammunition that is used to violently suppress \n     the Burmese people. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the \n     imposition of economic sanctions because it will hurt the \n     ruling military junta. She has categorically expressed her \n     wish that investments in the country cease until a clear \n     transition to democracy has been established. The National \n     Coalition Government fully supports Daw Aung San Su Kyi's \n     call for sanctions and that is why we support Section 569 of \n     the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, ``Limitation on \n     Funds for Burma,'' as tabled by Senator Mitch McConnell and \n     co-sponsored by you.\n       There can be no middle ground here. As it stands now, the \n     Burmese people are not benefitting from any investment coming \n     into the country. These funds are tightly controlled by the \n     military junta and serves to strengthen the oppression of the \n     Burmese people. No entrepreneur can start a business in Burma \n     without enriching either the members of the military regime, \n     their close associates or relatives. The common people do not \n     benefit from investments. I look forward to welcoming U.S. \n     businesses helping rebuild our country once a democratically \n     elected 1990 Parliament is seated in Rangoon.\n       The National Coalition Government also opposes any funding \n     to the military junta in connection with narcotics control. I \n     cannot see a logical reason for the United States to fund a \n     military regime that conspires with and provides a safe haven \n     to the heroin kingpin Khun Sa. It well known that the Burmese \n     Army are partners in transporting the heroin that is \n     devastating the streets of America.\n       I place my trust in the United States Senate to do the \n     right thing. Each vote for sanctions is a vote for the \n     democracy movement in Burma and our people who are struggling \n     to be so desperately free.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Sein Win,\n                                                   Prime Minister.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know my friend from New York is in a \nconference and needs to return to it. I just wanted to commend the \nSenator for his longstanding interest and support for what we are \ntrying to achieve in the underlying bill and further elaborate on the \nobservation of Senator Johnston.\n  I do not think we will be going this alone very long. Both the \nEuropean Parliament and the European Union, this month, July, have \nbegun to get interested in this issue because of the arrest and \nsubsequent apparent killing of a man named Leo Nichols, who was a \nconsulate official for a number of European countries and also happened \nto be, as my friend from New York knows, one of Aung San Suu Kyi's--\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. He was murdered because he was found in possession of a \nfax machine.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the Europeans are interested. One of their own has \nbeen treated like the citizens of Burma have been treated for years.\n  There is an indication that the European Parliament this month, I say \nto my friend from New York, called upon members to suspend trade and \ninvestment with Burma. We will be the leader of the parade.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. When the United States leads, others will follow. I am \nproud to be associated in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from the Washington Post on this issue, ``Burma Beyond the \nPale.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 1996]\n\n                         Burma Beyond the Pale\n\n       On JUNE 22, James ``Leo'' Nichols, 65, died in a Burmese \n     prison. His crime--for which he had been jailed for six \n     weeks, deprived of needed heart medication and perhaps \n     tortured with sleep deprivation--was ownership of a fax \n     machine. His true sin, in the eyes of the military dictators \n     who are running the beautiful and resource-rich country of \n     Burma into the ground, was friendship with Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     the courageous woman who won an overwhelming victory in \n     democratic elections six years ago but has been denied power \n     ever since.\n       Mr. Nichols's story is not unusual in Burma. The regime has \n     imprisoned hundreds of democracy activists and press-ganged \n     thousands of children and adults into slave labor. It \n     squanders huge sums on arms imported from China while leading \n     the world in heroin exports. But because Mr. Nichols had \n     served as consul for Switzerland and three Scandinavian \n     countries, his death or murder attracted more attention in \n     Europe. The European Parliament condemned the regime and \n     called for its economic and diplomatic isolation, to include \n     a cutoff of trade and investment. Two European breweries, \n     Carlsberg and Heineken, have said they will pull out of \n     Burma. And a leading Danish pension fund sold off its \n     holdings in Total, a French company that with the U.S. firm \n     Unocal is the biggest foreign investor.\n       These developments undercut those who have said the United \n     States should not support democracy in Burma because it would \n     be acting alone. In fact, strong U.S. action could resonate \n     and spur greater solidarity in favor of Nobel peace laureate \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and her rightful government. Already, the \n     Burmese currency has been tumbling, reflecting nervousness \n     about the regime's stability and the potential effects of a \n     Western boycott.\n       The United States has banned aid and multilateral loans to \n     the regime, but the junta still refuses to begin a dialogue \n     with Aung San Suu Kyi. Now there is an opportunity to send a \n     stronger message. The Senate next week is scheduled to \n     consider a pro-sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Mitch \n     McConnell (R-Ky.) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). This \n     would put Washington squarely on the side of the democrats. \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will meet next \n     week with counterparts from Burma's neighbors, should \n     challenge them to take stronger measures, since their policy \n     of ``constructive engagement'' has so clearly failed.\n       The most eloquent call for action came last week from Aung \n     San Suu Kyi herself, unbowed despite years of house arrest \n     and enforced separation from her husband and children. In a \n     video smuggled out, she called for ``the kind of sanctions \n     that will make it quite clear that economic change in Burma \n     is not possible without political change.'' The world \n     responded to similar calls from Nelson Mandela and Lech \n     Walesa. In memory of Mr. Nichols and his many unnamed \n     compatriots, it should do no less now.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will my friend from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In that same July meeting of the European Union, did \nthey not reject sanctions against Burma?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do not know whether that was on the agenda or not, \nbut even if they did have it on the agenda, and if they did not approve \nit, that was July. We are just getting started here.\n  The point the Senator from New York and I are making is, if the \nUnited States leads, it is reasonable to believe others will follow.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Can the Senator name me some examples of where that has \nhappened, other than South Africa?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Poland, South Africa.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I say other than South Africa.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Why rule South Africa out? I think South Africa is \nprecisely the parallel.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But the whole world was united.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the United States led in South Africa, \nand others followed. That is what we suggest here. The United States \nought to stand up for what it believes in, ought to put its principles \nfirst. There is every reason to believe that with American leadership, \nthe rest of the world would follow. That is what this is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to discuss some concerns I have \nabout section 569 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, H.R. \n3540--limiting funds for Burma. Before I begin outlining my concerns, I \nwant to thank my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for \npursuing this issue. While we may disagree on the details of the best \npolicy to pursue with Burma, we wouldn't even be having this important \ndiscussion without his leadership\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\non this issue. In addition, I doubt that we would be pursuing a much \nneeded comprehensive, multi-national policy toward Burma. Without such \nan effort, we could certainly find ourselves on the floor of the Senate \nin the future, reacting to some catastrophic event in Burma, having \ndone nothing constructive in the interim.\n  Mr. President, Burma is a nation I have never visited or studied. I \ndo not come to the floor today to debate this issue as an expert on \nBurma. However, I know more than a little about its poor record on \nhuman rights. What we need to debate here is the efficacy of mandatory \nunilateral sanctions in the case of Burma.\n  While we all hope for some small signs of change, I think we all \nshare the concern that hope is not enough to live on--especially for \nthe Burmese people. We recognize the problem there and want to develop \na policy to address that problem.\n  Any change will be slow in coming. However, while patience and \npersistence will rule the day, we need to nurture an environment in \nwhich all Burmese people are respected and treated both humanely and \nfairly.\n  In short, we need to look at putting forward a policy that will \nencourage the changes we seek. In addition, that policy should not \nnegatively impact U.S. nationals and business--without the benefit of \nestablishing changes in Burma.\n  The United States represents a small percentage of foreign investment \nin Burma. It is my understanding that depending on the survey, the U.S. \nranks anywhere from third to seventh. Regardless, the private \ninvestment presence there is not on a grand scale that would likely \nhave any crippling effects on the operations of the current government \nin Burma, the State Law and Order Restoration Council--commonly \nreferred to as the ``SLORC.''\n  In addition, indications from our trading partners in Europe and the \nregion do not demonstrate movement toward the application of sanctions.\n  Cutting off this trade by prohibiting U.S. nationals' private \ninvestment will not affect the current governing regime in Burma. \nHowever, it will affect American companies and American jobs. \nUnilaterally forcing American companies out of Burma at this time will \nsimply provide an economic opportunity for other nations, who will \nquickly step forward to assume the contracts and business opportunities \nof the departing American companies.\n  American companies have taken risks and borne all the startup costs \nfor the contracts they hold in Burma. If their departure results in \nreplacement by companies from our trading partners in Europe and the \nregion, any influence we might have wielded in this foreign policy game \nis lost. All indications at this time lead me to believe that any gap \nleft by U.S. companies in Burma will quickly be filled by others.\n  In addition to the loss of that private level of interaction between \nAmericans and Burmese, the benefit of jobs for Burmese citizens with \nAmerican companies is also lost.\n\n  Mr. President, in order for the United States to encourage Burma to \nmove toward a free society, an American presence should be felt. This \nis best done by private investment in the local economy. Private \ninvestment and other nongovernmental cultural exchanges can provide an \nimportant link with the people of Burma.\n  Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear, I do not support oppressive \nactions such as those taken by the SLORC in its efforts to prevent the \ncitizens of Burma from exercising their basic human and political \nrights. Likewise, I do not support abandoning the 43 million people who \nlive in Burma by withdrawing all American presence. Many times, \nunilateral sanctions hurt only those at the bottom of the economic \nscale, when the intended targets are those at the top.\n  Mr. President, at the core of this debate is the efficacy of \nunilateral sanctions as a tool of foreign policy to encourage change. \nAnd, more specifically, the usefulness of unilateral sanctions in the \ncase of Burma. I feel very strongly that mandatory, unilateral \nsanctions are not the most effective tool of foreign policy.\n  I do not support impacting private industry in this manner if the \nprojected policy will not yield the intended response. We must all \nrealize that while we seek change, Burma is not South Africa, nor is it \nIran. We face a unique situation, and the effectiveness of mandatory \nunilateral sanctions must be judged independently.\n  Mr. President, it is very important, not only for the United States \nbut for other nations as well, to evaluate the situation in Burma and \nwhat ways we can work both independently and together, that will \nencourage the improvements in human rights and will move Burma toward a \nfree and democratic society.\n  I support amending section 569 of this bill to address the concerns I \nhave outlined here today. We can encourage humanitarian relief, drug \ninterdiction efforts, and promote democracy. I believe that these \nactivities, in addition to denying multilateral assistance through \ninternational financial institutions, and the establishment of a \nmultilateral strategy will provide the best roadmap to reach these \ngoals.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think that concludes--at least for \nthis phase--the number of speakers we have on the Cohen amendment. \nSenator Smith is here to offer an amendment.\n  Senator Leahy and I would like to use this opportunity, before \nSenator Smith lays down his amendment, to get approved amendments that \nhave been cleared by both sides. There are eight amendments.\n  With the permission of the Senator from Maine, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Cohen amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment deletes a section I included \nin the bill entitled ``Moratorium on Antipersonnel Landmines.'' This \nsection simply reaffirmed current law. Having received the assurance of \nthe Armed Services Committee that the House conferees on the fiscal \nyear 1997 Defense Authorization bill will recede to the Senate on the \ncertification requirement relating to the landmine use moratorium that \nis in the House version of that bill, I am striking this section in the \nfiscal year 1997 Foreign Operations bill. This assures that current \nlaw, which provides that beginning in 1999 the United States will \nobserve a 1-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines \nexcept in certain limited circumstances, remains in effect as \noriginally adopted by the Senate by a vote of 67 to 27 on August 4, \n1995.\n  I appreciate the efforts by the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond, and his staff, who negotiated this \nagreement with the House conferees. I also want to thank the chairman \nof the House National Security Committee, Representative Spence, for \nhis part.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5024\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds to support the International \n                        Development Association)\n\n       On page 177, line 24, after ``Jordan,'' insert the \n     following:\n       ``Tunisia,''\n       On page 178, line 2, after ``101-179'' insert the \n     following:\n       ``: Provided, That not later than May 1, 1997, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations describing actions by the Government of \n     Tunisia during the previous six months to improve respect for \n     civil liberties and promote the independence of the \n     judiciary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my amendment, which is cosponsored by \nSenator Inouye, adds Tunisia to the list of countries that is eligible \nto receive excess defense equipment from the United States. I am \noffering this amendment because of Tunisia's support for the Middle \nEast peace process, its geographical location between Libya and \nAlgeria, and the fact that its armed forces do not have a history of \nengaging in violations of human rights.\n  Recently, Tunisia opened interests sections with Israel. This was a \ncourageous step, and it is important that the United States affirm its \nsupport for Tunisia's positive role in the Middle East peace process. \nAdditionally, Tunisia is located in an unstable and dangerous part of \nthe world. Colonel Qaddaffi is unpredictable, and he has made no secret \nof his displeasure with Tunisia's actions vis a vis Israel. Algeria, on \nTunisia's western border, is struggling with civil unrest stemming from \nclashes between the secular government and a fervent fundamentalist \nmovement.\n  So while I am extremely concerned about the proliferation of \nconventional weapons in this volatile region, I understand the \nadministration's purpose and I am prepared to support modest amounts of \nexcess defense equipment to Tunisia.\n  However, this amendment also takes into account the serious human \nrights concerns that I and others have about Tunisia. According to the \nState Department and respected international human rights monitors, \ncivil liberties are severely curtailed in Tunisia. Lawyers, journalists \nand human rights activists are frequently harassed, intimidated, jailed \nand otherwise mistreated for expressing their political opinions. Nejib \nHosni, a well-known human rights lawyer, has been accused of various \nmisdeeds and imprisoned, after an unfair trial. Mohammed Mouadda, \nleader of the largest opposition party in Parliament, has been \nsimilarly silenced. Dr. Moncef Marzouki, former president of the \nindependent Tunisian Human Rights League, has been repeatedly harassed \nand his passport has been revoked. These are only three examples, but \nthey illustrate a disturbing pattern.\n  In addition, the State Department reports that the Tunisian judiciary \nis ``not independent of the executive branch, and that judges are \nsusceptible to pressure in politically sensitive cases.''\n  The Tunisian Government should recognize that it only hurts itself by \nacting this way. By attempting to silence its critics, especially \nindividuals who do not advocate violence, it creates resentment and \ncloses out alternative forms of expression, which can lead to violence. \nThis is the antithesis of democracy.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of State to report on actions \ntaken by the Tunisian government to improve respect for civil liberties \nand to promote the independence of the judiciary. Our hope is that the \nTunisian government will treat these concerns with the seriousness they \ndeserve, and initiate a sincere effort to deal with these human rights \nproblems on an urgent basis.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5025\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds to support the International \n                        Development Association)\n\n       On page 135, line 7, delete ``$626,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$700,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States was instrumental in \ncreating the International Development Association, which provides \nconcessional loans to the poorest countries in the world. In this bill \nwe have cut our contribution to IDA $308 million below what the \nPresident requested.\n  The request for fiscal year 1997 was $934 billion, and that only \ncovers the arrears we already owe. The money in this bill for IDA is \n$74 million below the current level.\n  This amendment will bring our contribution to IDA up to the current \nlevel. That is still $234 million below the President's request, but it \nwill at least show that we intend to do everything possible to prevent \nfurther erosion of support for IDA.\n  Some may think it does not matter if we maintain our leadership in \nIDA. They should talk to our economic competitors.\n  They know that IDA is a worthwhile investment, because of the \ncontracts their companies get from IDA-financed projects and, even more \nimportantly, the foreign markets IDA helps create. They know their \nability to influence IDA policies is a direct function of their \ncontributions. As we cut our contribution and our influence wanes, \ntheir influence grows.\n  It is influence many people here would miss, because with it the \nCongress has had a major role in making IDA lending procedures more \nopen and subject to public scrutiny, and in eliminating wasteful \npolicies. Money buys influence in these institutions, there is no two \nways about it.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent of IDA lending goes to Africa, where the \npopulation is expected to more than double in the next 50 years. It \nwould be unconscionable for the richest nation to cut its contribution \nto the largest source of funding for the poorest region in the world, \nwhich is potentially one of the largest emerging markets for American \nexports.\n  People need to realize that foreign assistance is not simply \nassistance for foreigners. It supports our own economic and political \ninterests.\n  This is a critical year for IDA. When the United States indicated to \nthe other IDA donors that we would not be able to contribute to IDA's \nreplenishment this year and could only continue to pay off our arrears, \nthe Europeans established an interim fund to get through this year \nwithout a U.S. contribution.\n  The administration supported that. But the Europeans made a \nmiscalculation, by insisting that the U.S. would not be eligible for \nprocurement for projects financed by the interim fund. While I can \nunderstand why they did that, since the interim fund consists entirely \nof their money, I believe it is misguided as a matter of policy to \nimpose procurement restrictions on IDA-financed projects. I would say \nthat if it were the United States or any other country that was being \npenalized, and whether it were IDA or any multilateral institution.\n  I would have liked to see us fully fund the President's request. That \nwas not possible, since our budget is less this year than last. But I \nam hopeful that by maintaining our current level of funding, the \nEuropeans will see that we are doing our best to eliminate our arrears, \nso we can go on to support IDA's replenishment. With the budget cuts we \nare facing there is only so much we can do in any single year.\n  I hope the Europeans will recognize the significance of what we are \ndoing, and relent on the procurement restrictions. I think it is in \neveryone's interest that the United States remain a strong supporter of \nIDA, and that is not likely if these restrictions remain in effect.\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\n  Mr. President, there is one final aspect to this I want to mention. \nThere has been a lot of talk about what percentage of IDA procurement \nAmerican companies receive. Considering IDA alone, it is about 10 \npercent, largely because American companies have far less experience \ndoing business in Africa than European companies. But when you consider \nWorld Bank and IDA contracts as a whole, U.S. procurement is about 20 \npercent, which is consistent with our share of contributions.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for \naccepting this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5026\n\n       On page 148, line 10 through line 13, strike the following \n     language, ``That comparable requirements of any similar \n     provision in any other Act shall be applicable only to the \n     extent that funds appropriated by this Act have been \n     authorized: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in this group of amendments, there is a \nBumpers amendment on Mongolia, a Reid amendment on female mutilation, \nan Inouye-Bennett amendment on USTTI, three Leahy amendments, and one \nMcConnell-Leahy amendment on authorization restrictions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have no objection to those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5020 through 5026) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5027\n\n(Purpose: To strike funds made available for the Socialist Republic of \n                                Vietnam)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5027.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 105, line 17, strike ``provided further,'' and all \n     that follows through the colon on line 21.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is really a very simple amendment. I \nwill not take too much of the Senate's time to discuss it. Oftentimes, \nlittle things that seem rather insignificant get tucked inside these \nbills that ought to be looked at more carefully, and they do cost the \ntaxpayers a considerable amount of money. I think this is an example of \none of them.\n  The amendment that I am offering removes a provision that now exists \nin the committee bill that provides up to $1.5 million in taxpayer \nassistance for the Communist Government of Vietnam for economic \nassistance. I want to point out to my colleagues that this is not \nhumanitarian foreign aid. This is economic assistance that is above and \nbeyond what we would call humanitarian aid.\n  Very specifically, the bill language states:\n\n       Funds appropriated for bilateral economic assistance shall \n     be made available, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, to assist Vietnam to reform its trade regime through, \n     among other things, reform of its commercial and investment \n     legal codes.\n\n  The committee report language, I say to my colleagues, is even more \nrevealing. It is more specific. It says: ``The initiative seeks to \nassist the Government of Vietnam's efforts to develop trade relations \nwith other nations through reforming its legal system and trade regime \nso as to provide the necessary framework for commercial transactions, \nforeign investments and trade.''\n  I might just say that, depending on your point of view, it may or may \nnot be a worthwhile vote. The question is, should the taxpayers of the \nUnited States of America provide that help when, in fact, there are \ncompanies who will stand to gain substantially if this trade does take \nplace? In other words, under the bill, the money from the American \ntaxpayers will be spent for the cause of making a Communist nation more \nattractive to corporate America. A Communist nation--this does not go \nto the people of Vietnam. This goes to no humanitarian aid here; this \ngoes to the Communist Government of Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is wrong, pure and simple. That is why \nI am offering this amendment to strike this provision. We are in a very \ndifficult time. A lot of cuts--we are trying to balance the Federal \nbudget. When you talk about $1.5 million, that may not seem like a lot \nof money; it is a lot of money where I went to school, a lot of money \nin most families in America unless you hit the lottery--$1.5 million to \nthe Communist Government of Vietnam. We do not provide that kind of \ndollars to Cuba or North Korea. Why are we doing it to Vietnam?\n  The majority of Americans have been very clear over and over again to \nthis Congress in making their voices heard--reduce foreign aid \nspending. This is hardly the time to start a new foreign aid program \nfor a Communist country. I know those who disagree with me will say the \nopposite, but the truth of the matter is, this is the camel's nose \nunder the tent. This is the beginning of foreign aid to a Communist \ncountry; $1.5 million is so small when you look at some of the other \nline items in the foreign aid bill, but it is a substantial sum of \nmoney for many, many families in America today who, I am sure, would \nlove to have just a very small part of that $1.5 million to help with \ntheir budgets, perhaps their fuel oil, or paying for the mortgage, or \nfeeding their children.\n  Why are we providing this money? Why are we putting $1.5 million \ntucked in, hidden in the language of this bill, in the report language? \nWhy are we doing this? Who stands to gain? What is the purpose of this? \nThis is not a case--I want to make this very clear--this is not a \nVietnam bashing situation. It has nothing to do with POW's and MIA's. \nIt has nothing to do with MFN. It has nothing to do with how you feel \nabout normalization, or opening up diplomatic relations with Vietnam. \nThat is not the issue. We have already debated that. So let us not get \ninto that corner. But Vietnam is not a struggling democracy out there \nlike some of the Eastern European countries who are trying to come out \nnow from under the cloak of communism.\n  Vietnam criticized the U.S. Government in its relationship with Cuba \nby applying the sanctions tighter to Cuba, criticized President Clinton \nand criticized Senator Helms and others for Helms-Burton. This is not a \ndemocracy that is getting this $1.5 million. It is a Communist \ngovernment, not the people, the Communist Government of Vietnam. They \njust finished holding their Communist Party meetings in Hanoi last \nmonth. So they are still there. They are still repressive. They still \nhave people in forced labor camps. There is still repression.\n\n  Why do we provide from the pockets of the American taxpayers $1.5 \nmillion to encourage the investment of corporations from America? \nAgain, that debate has been lost. Corporations are investing in \nVietnam. Let them pay their own money to invest in Vietnam. They will \nget a return for their money. The taxpayers do not need to help some of \nthe largest corporations in America to the tune of $1.5 million.\n  Again, I want to point out that this is not humanitarian aid. This is \nnot helping kids who have lost their limbs in the war. It is not \nhelping people get an education, helping people who may have illnesses. \nThat is not what this is about. We have done that before, and I have \nsupported some of that because I believe that in war innocent people do \nsuffer. Unfortunately, that is the case and in the case of Vietnam, \nthat was the case. Innocent people sometimes suffer on both sides of \nthe war, and I have supported humanitarian aid for some of those \npeople. But the committee provision represents nonhumanitarian \nassistance for the Government of Vietnam. There is a big, big \ndifference.\n  I want to again repeat it for emphasis because it is the essence of \nthe argument: This is nonhumanitarian aid. This is helping the \ngovernment, the Communist repressive regime of Hanoi, to do better \nbusiness with American businesses.\n  I want to point out, Mr. President, that in the same bill that we are \ndebating here on the floor, there is a provision which prohibits \nforeign aid to\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\ncountries like Vietnam that are in default. It says here--this is again \nthe same bill, the exact same bill, Mr. President, under ``limitation \non assistance to countries in default,'' section 512: ``No part of any \nappropriations contained in this act shall be used to furnish \nassistance to any country which is in default during a period in excess \nof 1 calendar year in payment to the United States of principal or \ninterest on any loan made to such country by the United States pursuant \nto a program for which funds are appropriated under this act.''\n  Let me just say that this provision has been law for 20 years. Every \nyear it is in the committee bill and every year it is passed and signed \ninto law. I am sure it will again happen this year. Why is it in there? \nIt is in there because we do not want to reward countries who owe us \nmoney that have not paid us back by giving us more. That is why it is \nthere.\n  So I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a report from the \nAgency for International Development dated July 3, 1996, which I have \nsent around to every Senator's office. I hope every Senator will look \nat it because it is important.\n  According to this report which I just cited, Vietnam has been in \nviolation of this law, the law that I just referenced, since May 29, \n1976, 1 year after the North invaded and conquered the South. When it \ntoppled the South, we all remember the helicopters, the people falling \noff rooftops and falling off helicopters in that terrible tragedy, when \nthe tanks from the North roared through Saigon, when it toppled the \nSouth, North Vietnam automatically incurred responsibility for over \n$150 million in economic loans owed to the United States by the \nGovernment of South Vietnam. Those dollars are still on the books, Mr. \nPresident. The country of Vietnam still owes that money. It is still \nunresolved.\n  I am told that negotiations to resolve this debt have been underway \nbetween the United States and Vietnam for sometime now, but no \ntimetable for an agreement is in sight. So with $150 million of \noutstanding debt being held up, not being paid, we now slide quietly, \never so slightly, sleight-of-hand, tucked into this bill a little \nparagraph that says: ``Here is another $1.5 million. We are going to \nreward you. You owe us $150 million. You are still a repressive \nCommunist regime. You repress your people. And now we are going to \ntrade with you, and that is fine.'' That decision has been made. I \ndon't agree with it. The decision has been made. But the question is, \nshould those who decide to trade, some of the largest corporations in \nAmerica, should they be given another $1.5 million of taxpayers' money \nto further their efforts in Vietnam to a country, A, that is Communist, \nB, that is repressive to its people, and, C, that has not paid its debt \nback to the United States of America? That is the basic question. I \nknow that there are a lot of big issues out here on this bill and other \nbills that we face here in Congress, but these little issues, so-\ncalled, really are a lot bigger than they appear to be.\n\n  That was not easy. We had to read this bill to find this.\n  Let me just say there are other countries that are on this list of \ncountries that owe us money, and they are in violation of the Brooke \namendment. They are such countries as Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, \nSomalia, and others.\n  So the question you have to ask yourself is, should we reward this \ncountry with another $1.5 million--just under the table: Here it is? \nWhy should we be asked to make an exception for Vietnam in this bill \nfor nonhumanitarian assistance? What is the reason? Why was this tucked \nin the bill without debate, without any information regarding the \nbackground of this surfacing? Why should we make an exception for \nVietnam among other nations in the world that also owe us money? Why \nshould we be asked to circumvent the intent of Congress?\n  My colleagues, that is what we are doing, because it is very clear in \nthe legislation, very clear, as I said, under section 512, that ``no \npart of any appropriation contained in this act shall be used to \nfurnish assistance to any country which is in default.''\n  So the language is placed in the bill ``notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law,'' which basically wipes this off for the country of \nVietnam--no explanation, no rationale, just tucked in the language. So \nwhy are we doing it in this manner?\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we should not be authorizing a new \nforeign aid program on an appropriations bill for the first time in \nthis clandestine, undebated, secretive manner. That is the issue. That \nis what we are doing.\n  This is neither the time nor the way to start a new development \nassistance program to promote trade with Vietnam regardless of the \namount of money involved. These things tend to grow. We all know that \nonce an economic aid program begins--the Senator from North Carolina, \nwho is in the Chamber, knows full well once a bureaucracy is started, \nonce an aid program is begun, it is pretty hard to keep it from getting \nan increase, let alone eliminated. It reminds me of the Market Access \nProgram which the majority of my colleagues have voted to scale back.\n  So we should keep in mind this is not a case where the taxpayers have \nto fund this, No. 1. IMF, the International Monetary Fund, has helped \nVietnam. United States dollars go into that. The World Bank, United \nStates dollars go into that. They help Vietnam. The Asian Development \nBank, they have already given Vietnam millions of dollars in loans to \nhelp their economy develop. These loans are supported by United States \ntax dollars in part.\n  You can make a case that we should not do that, but I am not making \nthat case. I am saying those are already out there. That is another \nissue. So why provide another $1.5 million in bilateral economic \nassistance when we are already contributing through multilateral \norganizations?\n  There are also private foundations helping Vietnam, helping in the \nreform of its commercial code, such as the Ford Foundation and IRI.\n  I can certainly think of, as I said before, a lot better use of $1.5 \nmillion. I am simply asking that we delete it. My amendment simply \ndeletes the dollars, and I do that because I think we can use it \nbetter. A, we can put it on the debt, which would be my first choice, \nor B, we might be able to use it for something else, for some other \nmore needy cause. There are lots of causes out there that I think are \ndeserving of dollars ahead of this if we want to put $1.5 million \nsomewhere.\n  I think the American people would agree.\n  So, again, Mr. President, this is a small amount of dollars in a big \nbill and in a big budget. I agree with that. But it is not a small \namount of dollars for the average family in America today struggling to \nmake ends meet. The problem is there are a lot of these little $1.5 \nmillion tucked away through the 13 appropriations bills as they weave \ntheir way through Congress. They all add up, as Senator Dirksen used to \nsay, to real money. A million there, a million there. Then it is $1 \nbillion, $1 billion here and $1 billion there. Then it is $1 trillion. \nI do not even know what comes after $1 trillion. What is it, \nquadrillion? I do not know. But it adds up.\n  This is a small item. Granted, maybe it is not worth an hour of \ndebate, somebody will say, but let me tell you something. If you take \ncare of dollars, hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars, and \nmillions of dollars, you will take care of billions and trillions. They \nwill take care of themselves.\n  This is a very important statement we are going to make here. If this \namendment is defeated, if my amendment is defeated, what we have said \nis that providing additional taxpayer aid to the country of Vietnam, a \nCommunist nation like Cuba, is more important than helping children, \nhelping the sick, helping people with AIDS, helping people who need \nhelp with their education, their student loans or retiring, helping to \nretire the national debt.\n  Again, I cannot emphasize more strongly how I feel that it is wrong \nto put this in this legislation. So let me, at this point, Mr. \nPresident, before yielding the floor, ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, on a \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\nbasis, by big majorities, we have in recent years voted, first, to lift \nthe sanctions against Vietnam, and then to open diplomatic \nrelationships with Vietnam because we believe it is important to engage \nVietnam not only in civilized discourse, but to bring them into the \ncommunity of nations. We have had that debate, and this has been \nsuccessfully completed as far as those of us who wish to engage Vietnam \nare concerned.\n  How do we complete the circle? How do we help Vietnam become the kind \nof nation we want it to be? Or to put it another way, what do we want \nVietnam to do? I think if there is one thing we want Vietnam to do it \nis to follow the rule of law, to be a law-abiding country rather than \nto be a Communist country.\n  The two are at opposite ends. To be Communistic is not to be a rule-\nof-law country. To be a rule-of-law country is the opposite. So what we \nhave done here is, working with the Vietnamese, to authorize AID to \nspend up to $1.5 million, not in aid to Vietnam but to give to the \nAmerican Bar Association, the American Law Institute, and the U.S.-\nVietnam Trade Council to help send experts to help Vietnam develop the \nrule of law. Not one cent of this goes to the country of Vietnam, Mr. \nPresident--not one cent. What we will do is what we did with Eastern \nEurope, and as a matter of fact this initiative, which was my \ninitiative in the committee, is patterned after that which we had for \nEastern Europe. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, they \nfound that they had no legal system in Poland, in Czechoslovakia, et \ncetera. And the American Bar Association sent over lawyers and judges \nand others, many of them contributing their time, to help them develop \na legal system, a commercial code, a bankruptcy code, a criminal code--\nall of the codes; and then to train the judges to help run the system. \nThat is what we want to do for Vietnam. The Vietnamese have welcomed \nthis. I spoke to the United States-Vietnam Trade Council. I said the \nthing you can do to best ensure investment in Vietnam, to ensure you \nwill be brought into the community of nations, is to develop a legal \nsystem to follow the rule of law. They were willing and now are anxious \nto have this kind of aid.\n\n  Within the last 2 weeks, a group of legal scholars from Vietnam were \nhere in Washington and I visited with them, including the head of the \nVietnamese bar association as well as Vietnamese judges. They are eager \nand anxious to learn how to put together a legal system modeled on the \nAmerican system. If there is anything we want for Vietnam, how can \nanyone in this body be against Vietnam adopting the rule of law? How \ncan anybody in this body be against training Vietnamese judges to \nfollow the law, Western-style law, propagated by the American Bar \nAssociation? I just do not understand.\n  The reasoning seems to be this. Vietnam is a repressive regime, says \nmy friend, Senator Smith. Therefore, do not give them aid in following \nthe rule of law. That does not compute, to say you are repressive \ntherefore we are not going to help you be less repressive; you are \nrepressive, therefore we are not going to give you and your citizens \nlegal protection. It does not compute.\n  Let me also say the whole predicate for this, which is the so-called \nBrooke amendment, which says you do not give foreign aid to a country \nthat owes you money--in the first place this is usually waived. It has \nbeen waived for a broad number of countries: Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, \nNicaragua, a host of African countries, Eastern European countries. \nBeyond that, the good news is on the $150 million that is owed by the \nVietnamese--which, by the way, was incurred largely before this regime \ncame in--we have come to closure and agreement, as I understand it, on \nall but about $8 million of that $150 million. And there has been a \ncommitment to settle the whole thing.\n  The Vietnamese are trying to do what they can. They have agreed to \nresolve and most has been resolved. And even when it is not resolved, \nwith other countries it is waived. But besides that, it is not foreign \naid. The question is will it help Vietnam? You bet it will help \nVietnam. It will help make Vietnam a law-abiding rule-of-law country. \nAnd that should make it easier for companies to invest there.\n  What is wrong with that? Do we want this Communist country to stay \nCommunist? Or do we want them to have a legal code? It is as simple as \nthat. For the life of me, I do not understand the reasoning that says \nit is wrong to help Vietnam follow the rule of law. I think that is a \nnon sequitur and I hope the Senate will roundly reject the Smith \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nThomas as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Let me just briefly respond. The Senator from Louisiana is \ncorrect in terms of waivers being applied in the past for countries. I \nthink he mentioned Colombia and Peru. That is true. And in most cases \nwhere such waivers were granted, it was related to narcotics, in the \nsense that we wanted to try to help them to stop the flow of narcotics \ninto this country. I think if any Senator wanted to look up the \nbackground on that, they would find out that is the reason for the \nwaiver. I think in most cases they were voted on, these waivers, in the \nSenate, and not tucked into a foreign operations bill.\n\n  Let me also say I am all for Vietnam coming around to the rule of \nlaw. I hope it happens before the end of my speech. But is it \nhappening? If they supported the rule of law they would have free \nelections. The last time I looked I do not think there are free \nelections in Vietnam. If they supported the rule of law they would not \nbe imprisoning people throughout their country without charging them \nwith anything.\n  So, to say we are going to put $1.5 million of taxpayers' money into \nthis trade council to get into Vietnam to encourage them to live by the \nrule of law, we could make the same argument with Cuba. How about North \nKorea or Libya? Why do we not pump a few million dollars in there and \nsee if we can get them to abide by the rule of law?\n  Let me also respond to the position regarding assistance. For Eastern \nEurope, true, we do provide that kind of assistance. But Eastern Europe \nis not Vietnam. Eastern Europe broke out from under the yoke of \ncommunism. They are struggling democracies. They have gotten out from \nunder this Communist tyranny. It is true and I support it. It is true \nwe should provide and I support providing moneys to help those \ncountries to set up a rule of law and to set up a viable free \nenterprise, free market system, and to continue to grow out from under \nthe yoke of communism which they are doing so well right now. That is a \ndifferent situation.\n  They first must make the decision that they want the rule of law. \nWhen they make the decision that they want the rule of law, then they \ndeserve help. And they made that decision when they threw the Soviet \nUnion out, when they broke up the Soviet Union and threw out the \nCommunist tyranny. Vietnam has not made that decision, unfortunately. \nNot only have they not made it, they have criticized us pretty openly \nin recent times, criticized the President of the United States, \ncriticized this Senator, Senator Helms, and criticized others in the \nso-called Helms-Burton amendment here regarding our treatment of Cuba.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SMITH. Certainly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is aware that Vietnam is anxious to have \naid from the American Bar Association in helping them develop the rule \nof law. We have not had that kind of request from Libya and Cuba and \nothers. They are anxious to develop the rule of law. They want the \nAmerican Bar Association in there to help them do that. That is what \nthis is all about. Is that not true?\n  Mr. SMITH. I do not know that you can say emphatically and without \nany doubt that Vietnam is ready to embrace the rule of law. I think, if \nI understand this amendment and I understand the debate here, it is \nmore likely that we are trying to encourage them through these dollars \nto embrace the rule of law and to make it easier for companies who do \nbusiness there to do so under some legal system. That would be my \ninterpretation of it. I do not think Vietnam has embraced the rule of \nlaw and said we will embrace the rule of law if you provide us this \n$1.5 million.\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\n  My point is, I say to my friend, the issue here is really: Have they \nmade the decision and is it fair for us to put $1.5 million in aid in \nthere when we have this money that is already owed us? Why make an \nexception? That is the issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If my friend will yield, what Vietnam has said is that \nthey are anxious to have this aid. I mean this legal help from the ABA \nand the International Law Institute. They are anxious to have this aid \nbecause they want to develop this system.\n  They are in the process of developing a commercial code, a civil \ncode, training their judges in criminal codes. Part of it is helping \nthem draft the laws, and part of it is in training the lawyers and the \njudges, and they want this. They were in my office just 2 weeks ago. \nWhat is wrong with that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Let me tell you what I think is wrong with it. You are \nhoping that this works, and it may. No one can answer that question \ntoday. But it didn't work in Europe until after communism fell. I don't \nthink that you can bifurcate law saying what is here on one side, \nbusiness law, is good and not abiding by the rule of law in terms of \nits treatment of its own people, in terms of imprisoning people without \nhaving them charged. I don't think you can bifurcate those things and \nsay this is OK and we will just overlook this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is my friend saying he will not give aid to help them \nchange the legal system until the legal system is already changed?\n  Mr. SMITH. No.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. At that point, they don't need any help.\n  Mr. SMITH. What I am saying is I think the right approach is to say \nto Vietnam, ``You owe us $150 million. Let's work out a payment \nschedule instead of avoiding it and ducking it. Let's work out a \npayment schedule to return the $150 million that you owe us,'' and once \nthat schedule is set up and we begin to see payments coming back for \nthat, then we can work with them to try to help them set up a legal \ncode that not only applies to helping big business or business do \nbusiness in Vietnam, but also helps the people of Vietnam who are \nsuffering at the hands of a system that does not really have a rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On that point, how would my friend say that we should \ngive that aid? What would be the method of helping them set up that \nlegal system?\n  Mr. SMITH. I think we would say to the Vietnamese Government, ``We \nwant you to repay.''\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I understand. But after they made that decision and you \nsay it is right then to help them set up a legal system, would you not \nuse the American Bar Association and the International Law Institute, \nthe United States-Vietnam Trade----\n  Mr. SMITH. The American Bar Association, I say to my friend, \ncertainly has the financial capability to send lawyers to Vietnam to \nsit down and discuss with them how they might set up a legal system \nwithout having $1.5 million of the American taxpayers' money. The \nAmerican Bar Association donates tens of millions of dollars to \npolitical campaigns, frankly in my friend's party more than my own. I \nthink they certainly have the capability of $1.5 million to go over \nthere, if that is important to them, to set up this business structure.\n  But it would help also that instead of just setting up a business \nstructure to see to it that profits can be made, I hope they also will \nwork on helping these poor, unfortunate souls who sit in prisons for \nyears and years and years without even having charges brought against \nthem because there is no legal system. That is my point.\n  This is not a situation where we go back and replay the normalization \nargument or the MFN argument or diplomatic relations argument. That is \nover. But I do think we need to make a statement that this country is \nstill a hard-line Communist regime.\n  I have been there. I love the Vietnamese people. I have traveled all \nover Vietnam. I have friends there, people I have met. I like the \nVietnamese people. I think they would benefit from a good legal system \nin that country. I don't think just providing $1.5 million in aid is \nthe way to get it. That is the issue.\n\n  The issue is very simple, you either support $1.5 million in foreign \naid to a country that still owes us $150 million that is a hard-line \nCommunist regime or you don't. If you feel that is justified, then you \nvote against my amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I came to the floor to address another \namendment, which, as I understand, has been laid aside so this \namendment could be considered.\n  I have listened with interest to both sides, and I almost have no dog \nin this fight, but I have to agree with the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire. The American Bar Association, if it is so interested in \nthis program, could raise $1.5 million, or whatever it is, before they \ngo to lunch today, get on the telephone.\n  The point I think that Senator Smith is making is that every time \nsomebody gets an idea, let's do this or let's do that, they ask the \ntaxpayers to pay for it. They don't raise the money themselves \nprivately when they could. Some of the fattest cats in this country \nthink up ideas to be financed by the American taxpayers.\n  As the result of all this, this Government is in debt well over $5 \ntrillion. I went in the cloakroom one day a couple of months ago in \nconnection with a report I have been making daily since 1992, \nstipulating and reporting the exact Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness the day before. We were approaching $5 trillion at that time. \nI think we met it a day or two after that. I stepped in and some \nSenators were sitting there. I said, ``How many of you know how many \nmillion are in a trillion?'' These are the people who ran up this debt \nfor the young people of this country to pay. Not one was certain about \nthe answer. There are 1 million million in a trillion, Mr. President, \nas the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows.\n  We have run up this debt by saying, ``This is a good thing to do, \nlet's let the taxpayers pay for it.'' ``This is a good thing to do, \nlet's let the taxpayers pay for it.'' ``This is a good thing to do; oh, \nthis is going to pay for itself.''\n  How many times have I heard that? Senator Smith said these \n``temporary programs.'' I bet you 75 percent of the programs that are \nstarted by the Federal Government and approved by the Congress are \nidentified as ``temporary Federal programs.''\n  For example, the Agency for International Development, when it was \napproved by Congress back in the fifties, was a temporary Federal \nprogram. So was ACDA. So is this one and that one, and so forth. All of \nthem are ``temporary programs'' still going strong with thousands of \nemployees being paid for by the taxpayers.\n  I think that is the point that Senator Smith is making. Ronald Reagan \nsaid one time, ``There's nothing so near eternal life as a temporary \nFederal program.'' I think that is the point of it.\n  I suggest you two fellows get together. Call the American Bar \nAssociation and ask them if they will not raise this million and a \nhalf, or whatever it is, before 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter of support for the amendment from the American Legion.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The American Legion supports your \n     amendment to H.R. 3540, the Foreign Operations bill, which \n     deletes $1.5 million in bilateral economic assistance to the \n     Socialist Republic of Vietnam. We have steadfastly opposed \n     any additional favorable actions toward Vietnam until they \n     make honest and complete efforts to achieve the fullest \n     possible accounting for our POW/MIAs.\n       It is clear that Vietnam can take unilateral actions today \n     in the areas of remains and records that could account for \n     many missing Americans. Moreover, our support for your \n     amendment is further strengthened by the default status of \n     prior U.S. loans prohibited under the so-called Brooke \n     Amendment.\n       An appropriation of $1.5 million to Vietnam at the time to \n     assist in reforming its trade regime would only encourage \n     their continuing intransigence and discourage meaningful \n     unilateral cooperation by them\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\n     in providing the fullest possible accounting. We strongly \n     support your amendment to H.R. 3540. We appreciate your \n     continuing leadership on issues of importance to veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John F. Sommer. Jr.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, other than that, I have no further \ncomments.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield, if he has no objection, I wish \nhe would make me a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nHelms as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to speak against the Smith amendment \nwhich would prohibit funding for economic assistance to Vietnam. I just \nvisited Vietnam 2 months ago and I believe that this amendment would \nmove us in exactly the wrong direction as we attempt to encourage \neconomic and political change in Vietnam.\n  There is a tremendous entrepreneurial spirit pervading the streets of \nHanoi. All along the narrow, winding streets you will find small stores \ncrammed in next to each other, selling every thing under the Sun--\nbooks, postcards, clothes, car parts. The people of Vietnam very \nclearly want to have their own businesses. They want to trade. They \nclearly want a market economy, but they need help to develop it. The \nforeign operations bill provides funding for us to provide assistance \nto teach them economic and legal reforms. This type of assistance will \nonly encourage the country to move farther away from socialism and \ncloser to a Western-style market system.\n  Moreover, this is just the type of reform that United States business \nleaders in Hanoi told me they need to see in Vietnam. It is very much \nin American commercial interests to have investment and especially \nlegal reforms in Vietnam. U.S. businesses are losing money now, but \nthey continue to do business there because they believe change is \ncoming to both the country and the region as a whole and that change \nwill be profitable for them. The type of assistance this bill provides \nfor will encourage that change to come sooner, rather than later.\n  By prohibiting economic assistance to Vietnam, the amendment we are \ndiscussing would needlessly stifle budding, indigenous market reforms \nand hurt United States companies at the same time.\n  It was truly an amazing sight to see the people in Vietnam in the \nstreets, Vietnamese and American businessmen working and chatting \ntogether in a friendly way. That would have been impossible to imagine \n20 years ago. I hope this amendment is not accepted and that we do what \nwe can to encourage Vietnam's development. I yield floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, various Senators have been coming over and \nbringing up amendments and speaking to them. I encourage others, if \nthey have them, to do that. I know that we are trying to accommodate \nthe committees that are meeting, hearings that are going on, and so \nforth, and trying to stack votes when we can. But I know the chairman \nand I wish to finish the bill at a relatively expeditious time. I \nmention this for what it is worth. Mr. President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy to give another stirring speech \nif it would help, as I know I will have the unrestrained attention of \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer who otherwise may find it difficult \nkeeping both eyes open, but I would rather other Senators present their \namendments so we could, as much as I know everyone prefers staying and \nworking on this amendment, so we could get out of here on this thing. I \nunderstand the cloakroom is looking for other amendments.\n  I must say, in seriousness, we end up making policy sometimes \ndirectly and sometimes indirectly on this bill. We do affect the \nauthorization as well as the appropriation on this bill because we do \nnot have a piece of authorizing legislation to work from.\n  I urge Senators to understand what has happened as we have allowed \nourselves to be captured by our rhetoric. The irony is that during the \nReagan administration, I recall Senators still in this body who would \nsay they strongly applaud President Reagan's efforts to curtail foreign \naid. And yet, of course, President Reagan supported nearly $25 billion \nin foreign aid. Now that same rhetoric, they say, ``We have to do \nsomething; now that the Clinton administration is here the foreign aid \nhas risen.'' Well it is now down around $10 or $11 billion under the \ncurrent administration. At some point, we should stop the rhetoric and \nface the reality.\n  The fact of the matter is we have interests worldwide. If we want to \nhave a fortress America, we should make that decision. But I am afraid \nthat is a fortress that would find its walls quickly crumbling. Much of \nwhat keeps our economy growing is our export market. What keeps America \nstrong is the fact we are recognized as a global power with far-\nreaching responsibilities and far-reaching benefits.\n  When we pat ourselves on the back and praise ourselves for the cuts \nthat we have done in international organizations, in international \nefforts, we ought to ask, why is it that some of our strongest economic \ncompetitors like Japan and others are so happy to see us withdraw, so \nthey can step in. The fact is very simple, Mr. President, they are \ncreating jobs.\n  Many countries spend a great deal more than we do as part of their \nbudget on so-called foreign aid and development. The reason they do it, \nof course, is not out of any sense of moral responsibility or altruism. \nThey do it because it creates jobs. It creates an export market for \ntheir products. It creates a presence in these countries as they \ndevelop their own economic powers. It helps stability so they do not \nhave to get involved in regional battles. But it creates jobs.\n  They see the United States withdrawing and withdrawing and refusing \nto get involved in international efforts of economic development in \nthese countries and they see U.S. jobs being lost. Our companies that \nexport, our companies that have the ability to do so, are just laying \noff people left and right as we withdraw.\n  It is strange to me, Mr. President, how some of the same Members of \nthis body who brag about how they will try to stop any efforts for \neconomic development or democracy building in other parts of the world, \nwill stand here and bemoan the fact that other countries in the Pacific \nbasin or Europe or elsewhere are taking away our export jobs. They fail \nto see the connection. Of course, there is a connection.\n\n  As I said this morning, there is also a moral imperative here. In \nparts of sub-Saharan Africa we help out with aid, maybe 20 to 50 cents \nper capita or less. We have spent more for the costs of the \nCongressional Record debating this bill so far today than the per \ncapita income of many of these countries, of whole families, in many of \nthese countries. We will spend 25 to 50 cents there, yet we will use 50 \npercent or more of the world's resources with 5 percent of the world's \npopulation.\n  We have a moral responsibility. No matter how one looks at it, we can \nargue we have a responsibility to help out with other parts of the \nworld. There is our moral responsibility, but also it makes economic \ngood sense.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts on the floor, so I \nyield to him.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAMPBELL). The pending business is \namendment No. 5027, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nSmith.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will take a few minutes to speak to that amendment. I \nwill not spend a lot of time on it.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire but \nrespect his concern about it. I commend to my colleagues that I think \nthe concern expressed by the Senator from New Hampshire is misplaced in \nthis particular instance, and that the real\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\ninterests of the United States are to continue forward in helping to \nbuild a legal code and trade code in Vietnam that is based on our \nnotions and precepts about both the legal systems and trade.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire argues that we should \nnot go forward with this legal program--legal reform program in \nVietnam, which is what it is--because he says Vietnam is in violation \nof the Brooke amendment. The Brooke amendment is an amendment that \nlimits U.S. aid to countries that are in default to the United States \non money owed. The default that he is referring to is a default that \ngoes back to the question of debt emanating from the war, back in the \n1960's.\n  Indeed, the United States and Vietnam have already had a number of \nrounds of negotiations on this debt. The debt does exist. I am not \nsuggesting it does not. However, Vietnam has agreed in principle to pay \nthe debt. It is a debt that has been owed to us from the time that \ncertain property was expropriated during the war. The debt is about \n$150 million in total. As I say, they have agreed to pay that debt, \nwith the exception of about an $8 million amount that remains in \ndiscussion over the question of USDA loans.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we have really resolved the major part of the \nissues with respect to this total debt. In addition to that, we have, \nin the past, on a number of different occasions, waived the Brooke \namendment when it has been in the national interest to do so. We waived \nthe Brooke amendment with respect to narcotics assistance in Colombia, \nwith respect to Peru and Bolivia, for development assistance for \nTanzania, for other African countries, and also for Nicaragua.\n  Mr. President, the Brooke amendment is not really what is at issue \nhere. The issue is, Do we or do we not want to move forward with \nimproving our ability to have a legal system in Vietnam that is based \non our notions and precepts of what the law is and means, and do we \nwant to have a trade regimen that meets the needs of our companies and \nthe rest of the world in trying to do business with Vietnam which moves \ntoward Western values and goals?\n  Mr. President, a number of years ago, I created the Fulbright \nExchange Program for Vietnam. We are now in the fifth year of that \nprogram, and it has been an enormous success. We brought Vietnamese \nacademics, officials, and others to the United States. We have trained \nthem in some of the best schools, some of our best economic \ninstitutions, as well as some of our legal institutions. I think we are \nnow at a point where we are seeing many American professors in law and \ntrade and economics going to Vietnam and teaching in Vietnam.\n  So to suddenly take out of this bill a very small amount of money \nthat is geared to trying to increase the ability to reform the legal \nsystem and economic structure of Vietnam would literally be to turn our \nbacks on 30-plus years of aspirations with respect to that country. We \nare trying to do now, peacefully, what we invested 58,000-plus American \nlives to do during a 10-year war. It just does not make sense to turn \naway from the legal reform program that would be created by this bill, \nwhich is the logical, needed follow-on to the Fulbright program.\n  Vietnam wants our help in developing its legal code. What an \nextraordinary thing. What a great opportunity. For us now to suggest \nthat is not a more peaceful and sensible way of approaching the process \nof changing a system of values and cultural--I do not know what is \nbetter than that. It seems to me that, recognizing that the full debt \nhas been accepted in principle, the only contentious issue within the \ndebt is $8 million of USDA money, it would simply be wrong to turn our \nbacks on these 5 years of progress.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in opposing this amendment and in \naffirming that it is in our interest to continue to invest in the legal \nand economic reform of Vietnam and to bring Vietnam into the world \ncommunity with respect to trade laws and regulations, property laws and \nrights, and all of the means of accountability for those companies that \nare or will be doing business in Southeast Asia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, may I ask what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Smith amendment \nNo. 5027 to the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. As I understand it, at least one or maybe two other \namendments have been set aside for that to be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all necessary \namendments be set aside so that I may call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5028\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit United States voluntary contributions to the \n   United Nations and its specialized agencies if the United Nations \n attempts to implement or impose taxation on United States persons to \n                 raise revenue for the United Nations)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself, \n     Mr. Lott, and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 5028.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n   restrictions on voluntary contributions to united nations agencies\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Prohibition on Voluntary Contributions for the \n     United Nations.--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act may be made available to pay any \n     voluntary contribution of the United States to the United \n     Nations or any of its specialized agencies (including the \n     United Nations Development Program) if the United Nations \n     attempts to implement or impose by taxation or fee on any \n     United States persons or borrows funds from any international \n     financial institution.\n       (b) Certification Required for Disbursement of Funds.--None \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under \n     this Act may be made available to pay any voluntary \n     contribution of the United States to the United Nations or \n     any of its specialized agencies (including the United Nations \n     Development Program) unless the President certifies to the \n     Congress 15 days in advance of such payment that the United \n     Nations or such agency, as the case may be, is not engaged \n     in, and has not been engaged in during the previous fiscal \n     year, any effort to develop, advocate, promote, or publize \n     any proposal concerning taxation or fees on United States \n     persons in order to raise revenue for the United Nations or \n     any of its specialized agencies.\n       (c) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) The term ``international financial institution'' \n     includes the African Development Bank, the African \n     Development Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the European \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American \n     Development Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction \n     and Development, the International Development Association, \n     the International Finance Corporation, the International \n     Monetary Fund, and the Multilateral Insurance Guaranty \n     Agency; and\n       (2) The term ``United States person'' refers to--\n       (A) a natural person who is a citizen or national of the \n     United States; or\n       (B) a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity \n     organized under the United States or any State, territory, \n     possession, or district of the United States.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. President, on January 15 of this year, the Secretary General of \nthe United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, while speaking at Oxford \nUniversity over in England, of course, outlined a series of revenue-\nraising options to pay for the United Nations' day-to-day activities. \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali then went on the British Broadcasting \nCorporation suggesting\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nthat the United Nations should be allowed to collect taxes directly \nfrom American citizens and citizens of all other sovereign nations so \nthat the United Nations ``would not be under the daily financial will \nof member states.'' There was quite a tempest about that idea, and it \nwas not in a teapot.\n  Let me say at the outset that I know Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, not \nwell, but Dot Helms and I went to New York and had dinner with him and \nhis wife and another friend of ours and his wife, and we had a very \nenjoyable evening. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has his own ideas about \nthings, and I have been known to have my own ideas about a few things. \nIt is in that context that I want to comment a little bit about the \nSecretary General's proposed scheme.\n  Absurd as it is, it is not an isolated one. James Tobin, an \ninternational economist, back in 1976 proposed a U.N. tax on currency \ntransfers, and Gustave Speth, present Director of the United Nations \nDevelopment Program--and all through the bureaucracy, here and there, \nwe always use initials, and that is UNDP--the U.N. Development Program \nhas called for a ``global human security fund'' financed from global \nfees such as the Tobin tax on speculative movements of international \nfunds and international tax on the consumption of nonrenewable energy \nand a tax on arms trade. I am not making that comment just idly. That \nis an exact quote of what Mr. Speth proposed.\n  It is no coincidence that 1 week after Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali made \nhis chilling announcement about the need and desire for giving the \nUnited Nations power of taxation, the former distinguished majority \nleader of the Senate, Bob Dole, and Senators Kerry, Shelby, and I \nintroduced what was then S. 1519, which was a bill to forbid any U.S. \npayments to the United Nations if the United Nations attempts in any \nway to levy taxes on the American people. All right.\n  So, Mr. President, the pending amendment--by the way, what is the \nnumber of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The number is 5028.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. The pending amendment is based on S. \n1519, to which I have just referred, and it, like S. 1519, prohibits \nall U.S. voluntary contributions to the United Nations if the United \nNations should make an attempt to levy a direct tax on the American \npeople.\n  Furthermore, the amendment requires the President of the United \nStates to certify to Congress that no United Nations agencies, \nincluding the UNDP, are concocting any sort of scheme for a direct tax \non the American people. I am very pleased and honored that the present \nmajority leader of the Senate, Mr. Lott, and the chairman of the \nCommerce, State and Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg, \nhave joined in offering this amendment.\n  If I could ask whoever is in charge of focusing the television \ncameras, I hope that they will focus on the chart at my side. You will \nsee the bureaucracy of the United Nations. You will also see how we \nhave entitled it. We call it ``The United Nations: One Big Mess.'' That \nis precisely what it is.\n  The United Nations is an enormous and unwieldy maze of independent \nfiefdoms whose bureaucracies are proliferating almost by the hour and \nwhose costs are spiraling into the stratosphere and whose missions are \nconstantly expanding far beyond their mandate. Worse, with its \nunyielding growth--just look at this bureaucracy, if you will--worse, \nwith its unyielding growth and its misguided ideology, the United \nNations is rapidly transforming itself from an institution of sovereign \nnations into a quasi-sovereign entity itself. This unchecked \ntransformation and the Clinton administration's unwise over-reliance on \nthe United Nations, obviously represents a threat to American national \ninterests. That is the reason I am standing here on this floor with \nthis chart right beside me.\n\n  Mr. President, the 53,000--count them--53,000 international \nbureaucrats at the United Nations would find it worthwhile if they \nwould spend just a few minutes reading the Constitution of the United \nStates of America. Despite what these bureaucrats may hope and desire, \nthe United Nations, not being a sovereign entity itself, cannot--\ncannot--levy taxes. We could be grateful that it is not a world \ngovernment.\n  You see, the United Nations exists to serve its members, of which the \nUnited States is one. The United States is also the most generous \nmember of the United Nations--not the other way around.\n  Yet, when you look at this chart--I wish that the thousands of people \nlooking at this chart on television at this moment could have a chance \nto examine it line-by-line. But judging from it, this insatiable U.N. \nbureaucracy has for 50 years now been impervious to any kind of real \nreform. It has grown and mushroomed ``like Topsy.''\n  That is why, from the standpoint of the U.N. bureaucracy, new taxes \non the American people by way of international airline tickets, \nfinancial transactions, postcards sent from overseas--all of these and \nothers--would provide a seemingly endless stream of resources from \nwhich, Heaven forbid, an ever-increasing number of new U.N. programs \nand new personnel and new bureaucrats could be undertaken.\n  Mr. President, if the Secretary General and his allies at the United \nNations develop a program, and should they make the mistake of \npersisting in this U.N. tax scheme, there could very well be the 1996 \nversion of the Boston Tea Party. This time it would be, I guess, in New \nYork Harbor--because working Americans are already overtaxed beyond \nbelief.\n\n  Today, the visible--the taxes that we can see--the visible tax burden \nfor the average working family is a whopping 34.6 percent of their \ntotal income. Tax Independence Day, the day upon which American \ncitizens stop working for the Internal Revenue Service and begin \nworking to feed and clothe their families, is now May 7, a full week \nlater than when Mr. Clinton took office.\n  In addition to this tax burden, every man, woman and child in the \nUnited States now owes an average of $19,494.49 as their share of the \n$5,173,226,283,802.71 debt. It should be no surprise, therefore, that \nthe watchdog group known as the Americans for Tax Reform--a good group \nof people--and 14 Governors around the country, all Republicans, I \nmight add, support the pending amendment.\n  The prohibition on U.N. taxation upon which this amendment is based \nspeaks for itself. Yet the Secretary General and U.N. bureaucrats \ncontinue to raise the specter of more and more taxes on the American \npeople.\n  So I guess it might be said that I am here today to try to help the \nAmerican people make clear that even the consideration of U.N. tax \nauthority is totally unacceptable. I do not want to hear any more about \nit, and I made that clear to Boutros Boutros-Ghali as nicely as \npossible. Passage of this amendment would send a clear message to Mr. \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali and the entrenched bureaucracy at the United \nNations that what is necessary at the United Nations is real reform, \nnot the taxation of the American citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will just answer a \nquestion. I realize he has yielded the floor.\n  I wonder if I might ask the Senator from North Carolina a question. I \nwas just glancing over his amendment.\n  Mr. President, would the Senator tell me, in section (a), the first \nsection, it speaks of the ``United States persons or borrows funds from \nany international financial institution.'' Does that mean that no money \ncould go to them if they were to borrow money from, say, the New York \nCity Bank or other international financial institution just to pay \ntheir payroll? If they borrow from an American bank that has \ninternational affiliates to pay whatever housekeeping bills, would that \npreclude us?\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course not. If the Senator had read the amendment, he \nwould know the answer to his own question.\n  ``(c) Definitions. As used in this section.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would this require in any way cutting money to UNICEF?\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not understand the Senator. Look at me so I can read \nyour lips.\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry. Unlike others, I was trying to follow the \nrules by addressing, Mr. President, the question through the Chair. But \ndoes this require cutting of any funds to UNICEF?\n  Mr. HELMS. There is no intention, expressed or implicit.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My last question. If it was found that they had borrowed \nmoney from international financial institutions as defined here, would \nwe then have to withhold any contributions to UNICEF?\n  If it was found that they were borrowing funds from one of the \ninternational financial institutions as defined--\n  Mr. HELMS. The answer to that is no.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In the amendment, would we then be precluded from \ncontributions to them?\n  Mr. HELMS. The answer is no.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What would we be precluded under those circumstances from \nmaking contributions to? Because we have voluntary contributions to a \nspecialized agency such as UNICEF. If we are not precluded from giving \nto UNICEF, what are we precluded from giving to?\n  Mr. HELMS. Is the Senator really concerned about UNICEF?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator has had----\n  Mr. HELMS. If so, I will be glad to exclude it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Senator has spent years supporting \nUNICEF. As I read this, we are unable to give money to UNICEF.\n  Let us be clear. There are a lot of other things in here. Whatever \nagency provides funds for river blindness, we would be precluded from \nthat. We would be precluded from others.\n  The Senator has an absolute right to have such an intention, but I \njust want to make sure we understand precisely what we are doing. If \nthey borrow funds from any of these international financial \ninstitutions, I would assume this would then preclude our dollars to \nUNDP, UN Environmental Program, the World Food Program, International \nAtomic Energy Agency, UNICEF, and others. Am I correct?\n  Mr. HELMS. The answer is no.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What does it preclude us from giving?\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator wants to read the amendment----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the clerk to read the amendment. Apparently the \nSenator has not read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 5028. On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, \n     insert the following:\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has the amendment \nnot already been reported?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been reported.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so let me read then what we have here. It \nsays, ``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by \nthis act may be made available to pay any voluntary contribution of the \nUnited States to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies \n(including United Nations Development Program),'' and on and on. \n``If''--and what triggers this, among other things--``if the United \nNations * * * borrows funds from any international financial \ninstitution,'' which would include the African Development Bank, the \nAfrican Development Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development, and others as listed, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and so on.\n  Under that, unless some waiver is given, we would be precluded from \ncontributions to UNICEF, International Atomic Energy Agency, World Food \nProgram, and any of these others. I do not know how one could read it \notherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will say, Mr. President, in response to the Senator, I \nthink he is on a fishing expedition and he is not going to catch any \nfish. But UNICEF cannot now borrow money, according to my \nunderstanding. Is that correct? So that question is moot. I do not know \nwhat the Senator from Vermont is talking about. If he wants to exclude \nUNICEF for some personal reason, I will be glad to exclude it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a whole lot of things, but it does \nnot speak of if UNICEF borrows. ``If the United Nations * * * borrows \nfunds from any international financial institution.'' I am not on a \nfishing expedition. I just want to make sure we have a clear record. I \ndo not favor the United Nations or anybody outside of the United States \nor my own State of Vermont raising taxes. But we are talking about if \nthe United Nations borrows, all of these others will then be precluded \nfrom contributions from us.\n\n  I am not trying to get the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nto change his amendment. I just want to make sure we understand what it \ndoes, that is all. He has a perfect right.\n  Mr. HELMS. I say to the Senator from Vermont, what we are doing, you \nread to me from the amendment what gives you a problem and I will \nanswer a question about that. I do not want you characterizing any \nprovision of the amendment. I want you to quote from the amendment \nitself, and then ask me any question you want to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on page 2 of the amendment, where it \nspeaks----\n  Mr. HELMS. What line?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am citing line 3: ``* * * if the United Nations attempts \nto implement or impose any taxation or fee on any United States persons \nor borrows funds from any international financial institution.'' And \nthen, on line 21, we have the definition of those institutions. And on \nline 8, it says, ``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \navailable under this Act may be made available to pay any voluntary \ncontribution of the United States to the United Nations or any of its \nspecialized agencies * * *.''\n  That prohibition follows, as I read this, ``* * * if the United \nNations * * * borrows funds from any international financial \ninstitution,'' as defined in here. I am not arguing that point. I just \nwant to make sure we understand what we are doing.\n  Mr. HELMS. You did not finish reading, Senator. If you had gone ahead \nand finished what you were reading, you would have discovered that this \nwhole thing is based on Boutros Boutros-Ghali's and others' \nrecommendation that the United Nations be given sovereignty to tax the \nAmerican people and other sovereign countries. That is what this whole \nsection is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the idea that anybody is trying to give the \nSecretary General, whoever he might be, of the United Nations, the \nability to impose taxes on the United States is about in the league of \nall these black helicopters that appear in the middle of the night, \nbringing U.N. troops around to take over whatever parts of the United \nStates they are about to do. That is not about to happen.\n  I just want to make sure we understand, in voting for this, we could \nbe cutting off our ability, if the United Nations has borrowed from any \nof these international organizations, our ability to make payments to \nthe U.N. Environment Program, the World Food Program, International \nAtomic Energy Agency, UNICEF, the International Fund for the \nAdvancement of Women, the International Fund Against Torture, the U.N. \nEnvironmental Program, and on and on.\n  That may be wise policy. My suggestion would be that perhaps, as such \npolicy, it should be debated and included in an authorization bill \nwhich would originate in the committee of the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina, the committee he chairs. Should he wish to do that \nin such an authorization bill, he ought to, rather than try to attach \nit onto this appropriations bill. But he is, of course free, as any \nSenator is, to bring up anything he wants.\n  I just want to make sure we know exactly what it is we are voting \nfor. I just wanted the Record to be clear so Senators, those who have \npositions in favor of some of these independent agencies like the \nInternational Fund Against Torture or the World Heritage Agency or the \nInternational Fund for the Advancement of Women or UNICEF, or any of \nthose, probably many others I do not have off the top of my head, they \nmust know that, for whatever it is worth.\n  Mr. HELMS. Maybe the Senator would read my lips, as the statement \ngoes. Nothing in here kicks in unless the United Nations engages in, \nduring\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nthe fiscal year, ``* * * any effort to develop, advocate, promote or \npublicize any proposal concerning taxation or fees on United States \npersons in order to raise revenue for the United Nations or any of its \nspecialized agencies.'' Nothing kicks in. I believe the Senator \nunderstands that. I say, again, if he wants us to eliminate UNICEF, I \nwill be glad to do that. It would be a meaningless gesture, but----\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion of the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina to read his lips.\n  Mr. HELMS. North Carolina, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know Presidential candidates said that, and said they \nwould not raise taxes: ``Read my lips, there will be no new taxes.'' \nBut because I know what happened when we followed that, I would rather \njust read the words. And the words said, ``None of the funds \nappropriated or otherwise made available under this act may be made \navailable to pay any voluntary contribution of the United States to the \nUnited Nations or any of its specialized agencies,'' which include the \nones I have mentioned, if the United Nations borrows funds from any \ninternational financial institution.\n  If the U.N. borrows money to make its payments from these \ninternational institutions because the U.S. and others are in arrears \nin their dues, then we are not allowed to give money to the World \nHeritage Agency, the International Fund for the Advancement of Women, \nthe International Fund Against Torture, the U.N. Environment Program, \nUNICEF, and Lord knows how many others. That is all I am saying. I am \nnot reading anybody's lips. I am just reading the words of the \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is not reading all of it. This amendment will \nnot, of course, kick in unless there is some effort for the United \nNations to tax American citizens. That is all it is. I think it says \nthat.\n  Furthermore, I think, if the Senator will recall, the United Nations \ntried to get borrowing authority from these lending institutions last \nyear, I believe it was, to pay some debts, and that was denied. So that \nis a moot question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. As has \nbeen mentioned, I believe last year, the U.N. Secretary did state he \nintended to pursue the option of imposing a tax on airline tickets, \ncurrency exchanges, postage, energy sources and other programs in order \nto raise additional funds for the United Nations. Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali stated: ``It will be the role of the Secretary General''--and he, \nof course, is the Secretary General--``to bring this project to \nsuccessful fruition in the 21st century.''\n  So we have an unequivocal statement of policy coming from the leader \nof the U.N. that it is the intention of the United Nations' leadership \nto pass a tax on, I guess, citizens of the world, but especially \ncitizens of the United States.\n  I join with my colleague from North Carolina and congratulate him on \nbringing forward this amendment to make it unalterably clear that we \nobject strongly, and will resist in all ways available to us, the \nconcept of the United Nations assessing a tax on any American citizen. \nThe United Nations is an organization which has been mismanaged in the \nmost grotesque ways. The chart that the Senator from North Carolina \nsets forth is only one example of the massive patronage and financial \ndisarray that represents the United Nations.\n  Just a few examples, so folks listening to this do not have to take \nme at my word. The average United Nations salary for a mid-level \naccountant is $84,500. The average salary for comparable non-United \nNations individual would be $41,000, or half of it.\n  The average U.N. computer analyst, that individual receives \napproximately $111,000. That is compared with a counterpart in the \nprivate sector in the New York area of $56,000.\n  The Assistant Secretary General receives $190,000--this is the \nAssistant Secretary General--receives $190,000. That is compared with \nthe pay for the mayor of New York City, which is $130,000.\n  On top of all this, U.N. salaries are not subject to tax. What an \nirony. You have this Secretary General of the United Nations saying \nthat he wants to assess a tax against American citizens when he doesn't \npay taxes, nor do the people who work for him, even though they are \nstationed in the United States. In fact, U.S. citizens working at the \nU.N. don't pay taxes. It is, to say the minimum, ironic.\n  We now, finally, have an inspector general to take a look at the \nmoney that is being spent there. In the first report, the inspector \ngeneral found about $16 million was wasted. The inspector general only \ngot to look at a small slice of the U.N. activity.\n  We, for example, know that they put turnstiles in at the U.N. for \nsecurity reasons, I guess, but they had to pull the turnstiles out \nbecause the staff of the U.N. protested because the turnstiles were \nkeeping track of when they came and went. It became very clear fairly \nquickly that most of them were coming very late and leaving very early, \nso they took the turnstiles out.\n  The U.N. for years has been a dumping ground of political patronage \nfor people around the world. If you have a nation where the president \nor leadership of that nation wants to pay off a few political cronies, \nthey send them to the U.N., put them on a U.N. salary and the United \nStates taxpayer picks up 25 percent of that cost.\n  Yes, we have significant arrearages at the U.N., but we are, as a \nmatter of policy, at least in the Congress, stating that we are not \ngoing to pay down those arrearages until the U.N. has gotten its house \nin order, and it does not have its house in order.\n  We addressed a letter, myself and Senator Dole and Senator Helms, to \nthe General Accounting Office to determine just what rights the \nSecretary General has to assess taxes against American citizens. We \nasked specifically:\n\n       Are there any circumstances under which the U.N. revenue-\n     raising proposal could be binding on U.S. citizens without an \n     act of Congress?\n       What is the process for approval of revenue-raising \n     proposals by the U.N., including the role of the Security \n     Council and the General Assembly?\n       Are there any circumstances under which a U.N. tax proposal \n     could be adopted over U.S. opposition?\n       What is the status under U.S. domestic law and relevant \n     international law of each of the U.N. revenue-raising \n     proposals?\n       What funding sources are available to the U.N. organization \n     apart from contributions from member states?\n       What authority does the U.N. have for each of these \n     sources?\n\n  We have not yet gotten an answer to this request, but that answer is, \nof course, critical to the determination of just what rights American \ncitizens have given away in chartering the U.N. relative to the issue \nof taxation and the policies of the U.N. and the ability of the U.N. to \nassess a tax.\n  Thus, I think it is important that we adopt this amendment so that we \nmake it clear that as a matter of law, the Congress has spoken, that it \ndoes not intend to tolerate attacks against American citizens assessed \nby the U.N.\n  Therefore, I rise in strong support of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. I appreciate his leadership on this matter, and I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nBurma debate be set aside while I offer an amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The amendment of the Senator from Alaska is one that I \nbelieve is going to be accepted, and I therefore ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be laid aside so Senator Murkowski can send \nhis amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wonder, once we have disposed of the \namendment of the Senator from Alaska, if we could have some idea of the \norder of business.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont, as soon as Senator \nMurkowski's amendment is disposed of, we could set votes on the Smith \namendment and the Helms amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to two rollcall votes, the \nHelms amendment and the Smith\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\namendment, with no second-degree amendments in order, at the conclusion \nof the disposition of the Murkowski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5029\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding implementation \n              of United States-Japan Insurance Agreement)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for himself, Mr. \n     D'Amato, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 5029.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 an 18, insert the following:\n\n\nsense of congress regarding the united states-Japan insurance agreement\n\n       (a) Findings.--the Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important \n     bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was \n     reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.\n       (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over \n     the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer \n     possible for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to \n     use exports as the sole engine of economic growth, but that \n     the Government of Japan must promote deregulation of its \n     domestic economy in order to increase economic growth.\n       (3) Japan is the second largest insurance market in the \n     world and the largest life insurance market in the world.\n       (4) The share of foreign insurance in Japan is less than 3 \n     percent, and large Japanese life and non-life insurers \n     dominate the market.\n       (5) The Government of Japan has had as its stated policy \n     for several years the deregulation and liberalization of the \n     Japan insurance market, and has developed and adopted a new \n     insurance business law as a means of achieving this publicly \n     stated objective of liberalization and deregulation.\n       (6) The Governments of Japan and the United States \n     concluded in October of 1994 the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement, following more than one and one-half \n     years of negotiations, in which Agreement the Government of \n     Japan reiterated its intent to deregulate and liberalize its \n     market.\n       (7) The Government of Japan in June of 1995 undertook \n     additional obligations to provide greater foreign access and \n     liberalization to its market through its schedule of \n     insurance obligations during the financial services \n     negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n       (8) The United States insurance industry is the most \n     competitive in the world, operates successfully throughout \n     the world, and thus could be expected to achieve higher \n     levels of market access and profitability under a more open, \n     deregulated and liberalized Japanese market.\n       (9) Despite more than one and one-half years since the \n     conclusion of the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement, \n     despite more than one year since Japan undertook new \n     commitments under the WTO, despite the entry into force on \n     April 1, 1996, of the new Insurance Business Law, the \n     Japanese market remains closed and highly regulated and thus \n     continues to deny fair and open treatment for foreign \n     insurers, including competitive United States insurers.\n       (10) The non-implementation of the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement is a matter of grave importance of the \n     United States Government.\n       (11) Dozens of meetings between the United States Trade \n     Representative and the Ministry of Finance have taken place \n     during the past year.\n       (12) President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary \n     Rubin, Secretary Christopher, Secretary Kantor, Ambassador \n     Barshefsky have all indicated to their counterparts in the \n     Government of Japan the importance of this matter to the \n     United States.\n       (13) The United States Senate has written repeatedly to the \n     Minister of finance and the Ambassador of Japan.\n       (14) Despite all of these efforts and indications of \n     importance, the Ministry of finance has failed to implement \n     the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement.\n       (15) Several deadlines have already passed for resolution \n     of this issue with the latest deadline set for July 31, 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Japan \n     should immediately and without further delay completely and \n     fully comply with all provisions of the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement, including most especially those which \n     require the Ministry of Finance to deregulate and liberalize \n     the primary sectors of the Japanese market, and those which \n     insure that the current position of foreign insurers in Japan \n     will not be jeopardized until primary sector deregulation has \n     been achieved, and a three-year period has elapsed; and\n       (2) failing satisfactory resolution of this matter on or \n     before July 31, 1996, the United States Government should use \n     any and all resources at its disposal to bring about full and \n     complete compliance with the Agreement.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nforeign operations appropriation bill. I think it is timely that we \nhave an expression of the Congress toward Japan's failure to follow the \nletter and the spirit of the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement.\n  For many years, Madam President, I have been an advocate of \nencouraging the Japanese to open up their markets, as we have opened \nour markets to Japanese firms, to ensure that we maintain our \ncompetitiveness by having an open-market concept.\n  It has been very difficult over the years for United States firms to \ndo business in Japan. One of our more successful U.S. international \nmarkets has been through the competitiveness of the U.S. insurance \nindustry. The industry has proven its ability to compete in numerous \ncountries throughout the world, providing a degree of service and \ncoverage at competitive costs. We seem to have a significant exception \nin our ability to do business in Japan.\n  It is interesting to note that Japan has the second largest insurance \nmarket in the world. However, most of Japan's market is shared by \nJapanese companies. Foreign and U.S. competition share less than 3 \npercent of the Japanese market. In comparison, Japanese and other \nforeign insurers have over 10 percent of the United States insurance \nmarket.\n  What we are talking about, Madam President, is addressing equity. The \nUnited States and Japan negotiated over a year and a half, beginning \nOctober 19, 1994, and the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement was \nsigned in June 1995. Japan committed to a further liberalization under \nthe World Trade Organization. In April 1996 Japan passed new insurance \nbusiness laws.\n  Despite these commitments over this extended period of time, no \nprogress has been made. The United States and Japan spent several \nmonths negotiating over the meaning of an agreement that they signed 19 \nmonths ago. This is traditional in many of the business customs in \nJapan. You negotiate extensively, you negotiate with a committee, and \ntime marches on. As the Japanese have observed, time and time again, \nmany such firms simply give up, go off and do something else, because \nthey simply cannot afford to spend that much time trying to open the \nmarket.\n  During this timeframe, Japan threatened to relax rules in the one \nsmall sector where foreign companies have some market share, yet they \ncontinue to protect the larger sectors where Japanese firms are \ndominant.\n  It is the same old story. We have an agreement, then that yields no \nresults. We have seen it in the construction business analogy, and \nthere has been this reference, ``Well, to come into the Japanese market \nyou really need to have experience. You need experience to get a \nlicense.'' How do you get a license? You have to have experience. You \ncannot get a license without experience. It is like ping-pong, going \nback and forth. You cannot have one without the other. You soon come to \nthe conclusion you cannot get there from here.\n  We signed 74 agreements with Japan. I have the utmost respect for the \nJapanese negotiators, the Japanese tradition and the Japanese way of \nbusiness. I have had an extensive career in business with the Japanese. \nThey are hard negotiators. They are fair negotiators. They will take \nadvantage of a person who is not on his toes. But, by the same token, \nwith regard to access into their markets, for the most part, they \nsimply stonewall us. This is not something that we have seen much \nrelief on over the years. The agreements have not translated into \nmarket access. Our trade deficit with Japan was about $60 billion in \n1995--the largest with any country.\n\n  The insurance issue is important. It has been raised at the highest \nlevel, with our President meeting with Prime Minister Hashimoto. The \nlast time the meeting was in Japan. We have had dozens of meetings \nbetween the USTR\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nand the Ministry of Finance. I have raised it time and time again in \nmany forums, business discussions, and in interactions with the \nJapanese side. Last month, I sent a letter, with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Roth and Chairman D'Amato to President \nClinton to express our legitimate concerns about the lack of action. We \nnoted that ``Congress has a responsibility to ensure that trade \nagreements are honored, and to act when they are not.'' It is time to \nact, because they are not.\n  Madam President, this amendment and the resolution I am offering \ntoday would call on the Minister of Finance to fully comply with the \nprovisions of the agreement. This is the voice of the Congress \nspeaking. If the matter is not resolved by July 31 of this year, that \nwould be the deadline that would direct the U.S. Government to use all \nof its resources to bring about compliance.\n  I also call on my colleagues and Chairman Roth to join me in pushing \nfor the resolution, to hold hearings in the Senate Finance Committee if \nthe issue is not resolved on the Japanese side. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution. I understand the floor managers will accept \nthis.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, the Senate's unanimous vote in favor of \nthe Murkowski amendment demonstrates once again the serious concerns \nMembers of this body have about the lack of action by the Japanese \nMinistry of Finance to implement its obligations under the United \nStates-Japan Insurance Agreement.\n  The Senate fully expects Japan to live up to its agreements. The \nMinistry of Finance's behavior on this issue is particularly \nunfortunate because it undermines the credibility of the Government of \nJapan.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure trade agreements are honored, \nand to act when they are not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n5029 offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 5029) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, under a unanimous-consent agreement \nwe entered into, we are about to have two rollcall votes. But Senator \nLeahy and I have cleared five amendments. We would like to dispose of \nthose first, which means we will have completed action on 15 \namendments. There will be approximately 20 remaining. But the good news \nis only about four of those are going to require rollcall votes.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 5030 through 5034\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send five amendments to the desk, \nen bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendment numbered 5030 through 5034.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5030\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the conflict in \n                               Chechnya)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n          SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN CHECHNYA\n\n       Sec.  . (a) Congressional Declaration.--The Congress \n     declares that the continuation of the conflict in Chechnya, \n     the continued killing of innocent civilians, and the ongoing \n     violation of human rights in that region are unacceptable.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns Russia's infringement of the cease-fire \n     agreements in Chechnya;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     bring an immediate halt to offensive military actions in \n     Chechnya and requests President Yeltsin to honor his decree \n     of June 25, 1996 concerning the withdrawal of Russian armed \n     forces from Chechnya;\n       (3) encourages the two warring parties to resume \n     negotiations without delay so as to find a peaceful political \n     solution to the Chechen problem; and\n       (4) supports the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe and its representatives in Chechnya in its efforts \n     to mediate in Chechnya.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, my purpose in offering this amendment is \nto focus the attention of the United States once again on the terrible \ntragedy unfolding in Russia. The text of the amendment parallels the \nlanguage of a resolution approved last week by the European Parliament \ncondemning the violence in Chechnya and supports the sentiment of \nlegislation passed by the Russian State Duma this week criticizing the \nactions of the Russian Government.\n  As I speak, Russian war planes and heavy artillery continue to \ndevastate civilian areas of Chechnya. While the attention of the \nWestern news media has faded, the violence in Chechnya continues to \nworsen. Based upon pictures of the devastation, I accept estimates of \nup to 30,000 civilian casualties--primarily innocent men, women and \nchildren.\n  Madam President, by breaking the cease fire in Chechnya, the Russian \nmilitary has unleashed yet another terrible cycle of abuses on both \nsides of this conflict. A recent Russian news report tells of Russian \nsoldiers cutting the ears off of dead Chechens as trophies. In an \nunprovoked act of hatred Russian troops in Chechnya this week opened \nfire on three cars of civilians, killing most and finishing off the \nsurvivors with bayonets. The Russian people have endured acts of \nterrorism possibly inspired by the fighting in Chechnya, and the \nRussian military suffered its own tragedy with the discovery of several \ntortured and executed prisoners of war.\n  Compounding the tragedy in Chechnya is the fact that President \nClinton has failed to voice criticism or complaint of the Russian \nactions. He even found occasion at a United States-Russian summit in \nMay to speak in defense of the Russian actions by comparing them \nfavorably to our own Civil War. I understand Russia's interest in \nmaintaining its territorial integrity, but the current action is \ninexcusable.\n  If President Clinton will not speak for the Nation's conscience then \nwe in the Senate must. The Russian actions in Chechnya must stop. The \nmassacre of innocents is unacceptable and will negatively affect \nrelations between our countries.\n  Madam President, the military action in Chechnya has been conducted--\nand continues--with a degree of brutality and reckless regard for \ncivilian life that no democratic government can sustain. It is my great \nconcern that, in addition to the killing of countless innocent victims, \nthis violence in Chechnya is bringing to an end the short journey \nRussia has made toward the development of a democratic government.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5031\n\n  (Purpose: To allocate funds for demining operations in Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 125, line 2, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided, That, of the funds appropriated \n     under this heading, $2,000,000 shall be available only for \n     demining operations in Afghanistan''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5032\n\n    (Purpose: To require the United Nations vote report to include \n             information about American foreign assistance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n\n  requirement for disclosure of foreign aid in report of secretary of \n                                 state\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Foreign Aid Reporting Requirement.--In \n     addition to the voting practices of a foreign country, the \n     report required to be submitted to Congress under section \n     406(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal \n     Years 1990 and 1991 (22 U.S.C. 2414a), shall include a side-\n     by-side comparison of individual countries' overall support \n     for the United States at the United Nations and the amount of \n     United States assistance provided to such country in that \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) United States Assistance.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``United States assistance'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 481(e)(4) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291(e)(4)).\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, current law requires the Secretary of \nState to publish an annual report that tells the Congress how often \nforeign countries voted with the United States at the Union Nations. \nUnfortunately, this report leaves out a key statistic, and that is how \nmuch foreign aid we are giving to the countries that vote against us.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary to include the amount of \nforeign\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\naid that these nations receive and a side-by-side comparison of voting \nrecords and foreign aid appropriations.\n  This amendment will assemble this important information in a \nconvenient and easily accessed resource. It will assist those in the \nCongress and in the public in their assessments of the merits of \nAmerican foreign aid programs.\n  I believe that there is good reason to scrutinize these two \nstatistics. The American taxpayers work hard for the money that flows \nto foreign countries through the Treasury. The American taxpayers are \ntold that foreign aid encourages support for American aims and \ndiplomatic initiatives.\n  Analysis of the United Nations votes of foreign aid recipients, \nhowever, reveals the fallacy of this rationale; 64 percent of American \nforeign aid recipients voted against the United States more often than \nnot in the 1995 session of the United Nations.\n  India, for example, received $156 million in foreign aid in 1996. \nIndia, however, declined to support American diplomatic initiatives as \na gesture of appreciation and voted against the United States in 83 \npercent of its U.N. votes. India thus offered less support to the \nUnited States than Iran and Cuba.\n  The ten countries that voted against the United States most often at \nthe United Nations will nonetheless collect $212 million from the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The United Nations sent troops to Haiti to restore President Aristede \nand also sent $123 million in aid. Nonetheless, Mr. President, Haiti \nvoted against the United States 60 percent of the time.\n  President Clinton engineered a $40 billion bailout for Mexico, and, \nyet, Mexico voted against us in 58 percent of its U.N. votes.\n  Mr. President, the countries that voted against us more than 50 \npercent of the time at the United Nations collected about $3.1 billion \nin American foreign aid in 1996. The American taxpayers worked millions \nof hours in fields and factories to earn that money.\n  Clearly, however, gratitude is not a popular response to a generous \nflow of funds from the pockets of the American people.\n  The American people deserve to know the effects of large streams of \nforeign aid. The taxpayers deserve to know that a limited number of \nforeign aid recipients did, in fact, thank the American people with \ntheir votes. Israel voted with us 97 percent of the time. Latvia voted \nwith us 87 percent of the time. Hungary voted with us 83 percent of the \ntime. This amendment will collect these statistics in a single and \neasily accessed source.\n  This amendment thus adds an informative sunshine provision to the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act. An informed Congress is best able \nto make intelligent decisions. I thus believe that it is important to \nbring this information together in a single report and hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in support of this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5033\n\n (Purpose: To require a GAO study and report on the grants provided to \nforeign governments, foreign entities, and international organizations \n                       by United States agencies)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n\nreport on domestic federal agencies furnishing united states assistance\n\n       Sec.   . (a) In General.--Not later than June 1, 1997, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall study and \n     report to the Congress on all assistance furnished directly \n     or indirectly to foreign countries, foreign entities, and \n     international organizations by domestic Federal agencies and \n     Federal agencies.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) Domestic federal agency.--The term ``domestic Federal \n     agency'' means a Federal agency the primary mission of which \n     is to carry out functions other than foreign affairs, \n     defense, or national security functions.\n       (2) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 551(1) of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (3) International organization.--The term ``international \n     organization'' has the meaning given the term in section 1 of \n     the International Organization Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. \n     288).\n       (4) United states assistance.--The term ``United States \n     assistance'' has the meaning given the term in section \n     481(e)(4) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2291(e)(4)).\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, many people in this Chamber believe \nthat all the foreign aid that we send to other countries is included in \nthis one spending bill. But this is not the case. I have discovered \nthat domestic agencies are also in the foreign aid business.\n  This amendment will require the General Accounting Office to complete \na report about grants to foreign entities by Federal Government \nagencies. This study will be limited to domestic agencies--those not \nengaged in foreign affairs or national security matters--and it will \ntrack the amount of aid to foreign countries that flows outside the \nForeign Operations budget.\n  I took to the floor of this Chamber last week to illustrate the \nstream of taxpayer dollars that flows to foreign nations through \ndomestic Federal agencies.\n  I pointed out that the Environmental Protection Agency spent $28 \nmillion on 106 grants to foreign countries from 1993 to 1995.\n  I revealed that the EPA sent $20,000 to the Chinese Ministry of \nPublic Security. The Ministry of Public Security is a national police \nforce that issued shoot-to-kill orders during the pro-democracy rallies \nin 1989.\n  The purpose of this EPA grant to the Ministry of Public Security was \nfire extinguisher maintenance. I hope that my colleagues will agree \nthat a nation that developed nuclear technologies--which it sells to \ncountries like Iran and Pakistan--can maintain fire extinguishers \nwithout the American taxpayers' money.\n  The EPA spent another $20,000 to look into methane emissions from \nlivestock in Nepal. The EPA claims that the Congress is crippling its \nability to protect our environment, and, yet, their budget can manage \n$2,000 for fringe benefits and $5,000 for travel expenses for \nresearchers in Nepal.\n  The EPA sent $65,000 to Poland to survey local environmental issues. \nThe taxpayers will be delighted to learn about the uses of their hard-\nearned tax dollars: $16,000 for fringe benefits, $18,000 for travel \nexpenses, and $6,000 for equipment costs.\n  The EPA sent $300,000 to Bolivia, one of the largest drug-producers \nin South America, for an emissions inventory. The EPA approved $23,000 \nin travel expenses and, while these scientists are on their \ninternational trips, EPA provided a generous $200 per diem.\n  This chart illustrates that these are not isolated case: $319,000 to \nMexico for a satellite landscape survey; $300,000 grant to Estonia to \ncollect, analyze and disseminate environmental information for \neffective environmental decisionmaking; $50,000 to Sweden for a \ndatabase and global distribution of a newsletter about energy-efficient \nlighting; $134,000 to Mongolia and $194,000 to Botswana to study \ngreenhouse gasses.\n  If this Congress intends to balance the Federal budget--and I believe \nthat many of us do--we most certainly need to take a good look at the \nwasteful spending that benefits foreign countries.\n  EPA complains that cuts in its budget will devastate their efforts to \nprotect the environment. The EPA argues that it cuts money for \ninspection and enforcement actions. However, the EPA still found $28 \nmillion for foreign countries.\n  I was elected to the Senate in 1992 on a pledge to bring common sense \nto Washington.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, these grants defy common sense.\n  The Congress debates and passes a foreign aid budget--we sent over \n$12 billion abroad last year--that reflects our decisions about foreign \naid. It is not the business of domestic agencies--agencies that \ncomplain that their budgets are too small--to send the taxpayers' money \nto foreign countries.\n  These grants are representative of a culture of waste that pervades \nthe Federal Government. In fact, not only does the EPA send millions of \ntaxpayers' dollars abroad every year, but oversight of these grants is \nnonexistent.\n  The EPA Inspector General reported last year that these grant \nofficers essentially funnel the money overseas and close their eyes.\n  Domestic agencies need to attend to domestic matters.\n  Their budgets are separate from the foreign aid budget for good \nreason. Their responsibilities are in the United States, not in China \nor Mexico.\n  This amendment calls for a GAO report to examine the depth and scope \nof these problems.\n  I believe that this is the least that the taxpayers deserve and thus \nhope that my colleagues will join me in support of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 5034\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the use of certain development funds for Africa)\n\n       On page 105, beginning on line 12, strike ``amount'' and \n     all that follows through ``should'' on line 13 and insert \n     ``amount made available to carry out chapter 10 of part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to the \n     Development Fund for Africa) shall''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nKentucky, the chairman of the subcommittee, for the excellent job he \nhas done in structuring a good and fair bill in the face of severe \nconstraints. While it is not everything that any of us would like, he \nhas been very attentive to the concerns of his colleagues and I \nappreciate his efforts.\n  I rise in support of the amendment offered by the senior Senator from \nIllinois. The Senator has been an effective, outspoken, and persistent \ndefender of assistance to Africa throughout his congressional career. \nHe, together with the senior Senator from Kansas, have been true \nfriends of Africa, wielding a stick when appropriate and assuring that \nthe United States follows through with humanitarian and development \nassistance where appropriate. Africa has made dramatic strides over the \nlast two decades, thanks in some part to the constant efforts of these \ntwo Senators. They will be sorely missed both in this body and around \nthe world.\n  The amendment before us is a modest one. It does not change the \nfunding levels laid out in the bill. It does not earmark a specific \ndollar amount, but ties funding for the Development Fund for Africa to \nthe overall level of funding in the development assistance account. \nThis amendment does not stake out a bigger pot for Africa, it merely \nensures that Africa will receive the funding that both this committee \nand the administration agree it should receive.\n  I appreciate the efforts that have been made by the chairman to \nrestructure the foreign aid accounts and reduce earmarks. What this \namendment seeks to do, however, is to ensure that aid to Africa, the \nworld's most needy continent, is sustained. Traditionally, funding for \nAfrica has fallen victim to sudden needs elsewhere in the world. This \namendment would protect Africa from suffering a disproportionate share \nof future cuts.\n  Our assistance to Africa is designed to help various nations achieve \nimportant goals over the long term. These goals cannot be reached if \nour financial support fluctuates wildly. The problems we are combating \non the continent are entrenched, and will only be rectified if we have \nstaying power. Unlike other areas of the world, we cannot hope to \nachieve our goals in Africa simply by doing short demonstration \nprojects and assuming that the example will spark comprehensive reform. \nReform in Africa takes significantly more work. But the rewards should \nbe significantly greater as well. It has tremendous potential for \npolitical evolution, economic development, and growth of markets. In \naddition to reducing human suffering and bringing greater stability to \na large area of the world, success in Africa will prove to be very \nimportant to us and our economy in the future.\n  I appreciate the efforts that the chairman already has made to make \nassistance to Africa a priority. But I hope that he will agree to \naccept this amendment as a modest way to ensure this does not change.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I appreciate the efforts of Chairman \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy for working to include the amendment I \noffered along with Senators Kassebaum, Feingold, Moseley-Braun, \nJeffords, Feinstein, and Mikulski on the Development Fund for Africa. \nWe all share the conviction that aid to Africa should be a priority.\n  Africa has two unfortunate distinctions--it is both the poorest and \nthe most ignored continent. That is why, 8 years ago, Congress \nestablished the Development Fund for Africa to ensure aid for sub-\nSaharan Africa was given a high priority within our foreign aid budget. \nUnfortunately, aid to Africa was considered expendable when resources \nwere sought for other purposes. We realized, however, that the United \nStates has an interest and a duty to help out the impoverished in that \nregion, and that the Development Fund for Africa was a good way to help \nmeet our commitment. It would be senseless now, with the measure of \nhope that we see in Africa, even while it still suffers from poverty, \npollution, and the scourge of AIDS, to abandon our support for sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  Our amendment does not add new money. It maintains the language, \nworked out by Senators McConnell and Leahy, that protects aid to sub-\nSaharan Africa from being cut disproportionately in a development \nassistance account that is getting smaller. I commend the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee for their support for Africa, and I \nthink this amendment can strengthen their efforts to see that aid to \nthis region is maintained as an important priority. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that aid to sub-Saharan Africa is \nprotected in the conference report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. These amendments include a Helms amendment on \nChechnya, a Brown amendment on demining Afghanistan, two Faircloth \namendments on foreign aid and domestic agencies, and a Simon amendment \non Africa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5030 through 5034) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have a request from Senator McCain \nto speak for 5 minutes before the vote that we are about to have.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am certainly not going to preclude the \nSenator from doing that. I think we are going to be in a position soon \nwhere we are going to have a series of votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to each of the votes we will be \nhaving on this legislation there be 4 minutes equally divided under the \ncontrol of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself, so that \nthe proponent and opponent would have 2 minutes prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my assumption is that the Senator \nfrom Arizona is on the way as we speak. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes before the votes that we are about to enter into.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I inquire of the Senator from Kentucky, would the \norder of business following the two votes that are going to be taken \nsoon be that when those votes are completed, Senator Hatfield and I \nwill be recognized to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that the \nSenator from North Dakota is willing to enter into a time agreement of \n40 minutes on that amendment, and it would be my intention to lay aside \nthe pending amendments and go to the Dorgan amendment as soon as we \ndispose of these rollcall votes.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, and I are \nwilling to enter into a time agreement. We simply ask that we be \nallotted 40 minutes to present our amendment. So any time agreement \nthat is consistent with that requirement is satisfactory with us. We \nwould be prepared to offer the amendment following the second vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am told on this side that an hour \ntotal time would be acceptable on this side. So I gather that would \ngive my friend from North Dakota and his supporters 40 minutes and the \nopponents 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That would be satisfactory.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I, therefore, ask unanimous consent \nthat when we turn to the Dorgan amendment, the time be limited to 1 \nhour, with 40 minutes to be controlled by the Senator from North Dakota \nand his supporters and the balance of the time by the opponents of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Kentucky further request that there \nbe\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\nno second-degree amendments to the amendment by the Senator from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And that there be no second-degree amendments to the \nDorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, since the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, had asked for 5 minutes before the vote, now Senator \nSmith understandably would like to have 5 minutes as well. So I would \nlike to announce to my colleagues that it looks as if we are at least \n10 minutes away from a vote on the Smith amendment and a vote on the \nHelms amendment.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith be allowed to \nproceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Kentucky add to that so that people \ncan know that we are going to vote at 2:30? The Senator from Arizona is \nhere now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would object to any further efforts to delay the \nvotes. So I think Senators can be assured that 10 minutes from now, \nthere will be two votes: a vote on the Smith amendment, and a vote on \nthe Helms amendment. Both Senator Smith and Senator McCain have 5 \nminutes each. The manager of the bill cares not who goes first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question now occurs on the amendment \nNo. 5028 offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thought the unanimous-consent \nagreement allowed the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, to proceed for 5 minutes \neach, I gather, in relation to the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5027\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I hope that we are not going to make this \namendment something that it is not in the debate here in the closing \nmoments.\n  This amendment is very simple. It simply strikes $1.5 million out of \nthe bill, saves the money, which is, in essence, $1.5 million in \nforeign aid to the country of Vietnam. Vietnam is a Communist country. \nIt has nothing to do with diplomatic relations. It has nothing to do \nwith any of the other issues--normalization, or other issues that we \nhave had some differences here on in the past.\n  This is a question, and I think it is the ultimate question, of $1.5 \nmillion going to North Vietnam, or the country of Vietnam. These are \ndollars that allegedly, by opposition--by the discussion from the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston--are going to be used by the \nAmerican Bar Association to somehow make Vietnam suddenly a system that \nis going to be falling in line with our legal system here in America, \nor at least that is the ultimate goal.\n  The point is the American Bar Association donates tens of millions of \ndollars to candidates, mostly candidates on the other side of the \naisle. They have plenty of money. There is no need to take $1.5 million \nof the taxpayers' money to do this. The country of Vietnam, I say to my \ncolleague, is $150 million in arrears.\n  The law which is in this very bill says very clearly under bilateral \neconomic assistance that this is precluded; this is forbidden. Now they \nhave made an exception in this provision, in this bill. That is what is \nwrong.\n  So the issue here is, Do you believe that North Vietnam, a country \nthat denies basic human rights to its people, should get $1.5 million \nthat the American Bar Association can certainly spend on their own, if \nthey want to promote a legal system in Vietnam that may or may not be \npatterned after the United States of America?\n  We have no guarantee this is going to happen. There are no guarantees \nwhatsoever that if the American taxpayers spend $1.5 million that \nsomehow, miraculously, Vietnam is going to adopt our legal system. It \nis absolutely outrageous. It is the most outrageous argument I have \nheard since I have been in the Senate. It is crazy.\n  Not only that, if we are really concerned about having a legal system \nin Vietnam that is like America, what about a legal system that would \nprotect these poor unfortunate souls who are imprisoned all over \nVietnam with no charges against them, who have been held in reeducation \ncamps for years and years with no charges--just held there, no system, \nno trial, no nothing? That is what this is issue is about.\n  If the people in the trade council want to trade with Vietnam, we \nhave had that debate. Senator McCain and I have had that debate. This \nis not that debate. That is fine. The issue is not that. The issue is \nwhether or not, in the interest of producing a legal system that \nsomehow is going to reflect ourselves, our own legal system, that we \nshould spend $1.5 million of the taxpayers' money.\n  This is a new foreign aid program. It is the camel's nose under the \ntent. It is $1.5 million of foreign aid to a Communist country that \nowes us $150 million in debts. They have not paid them. They have not \ntried to pay them. There has been no restructuring, or anything else, \nany attempt whatsoever.\n  That is the issue. It is not the responsibility of the American \ntaxpayers to pay for this just because there is a group --if you look \nat the corporations, these are big corporations, not to mention the \nABA. There is plenty of private money. We have the world banks and \nother international organizations that have helped Vietnam. We donate \nto those. We provide dollars. We give dollars to these international \norganizations. Why now have another $1.5 million of taxpayers' dollars \nin new foreign aid go to this country? It is wrong. It is absolutely \nwrong.\n  No matter how you feel about the issue of trade with Vietnam, that is \nnot the issue here. The issue is, do we give Vietnam another $1.5 \nmillion in foreign aid in the hopes that somehow they are miraculously \ngoing to adopt our legal system and have trial by jury and have this \nnice legal system patterned after the United States of America? It is \nabsolute nonsense. Maybe they will or maybe they will not, but they \nwill not use $1.5 million of the taxpayers' money to do that. How about \nreforming Vietnam's election laws, to become a democracy? This is not \nwhat this is all about.\n  The argument about the nations of Eastern Europe who have come out \nfrom under the yoke of communism, that is the point. They came out from \nunder the yoke of communism, and when they did, then we could help them \nas we have done. This is not the case here.\n  What is next? Maybe we ought to help the North Koreans. Maybe we \nought to give them a couple of million bucks, and maybe they will--\nmaybe they will--pattern their legal system after ours. How about Cuba? \nMaybe they will pattern it if we give them a couple million, too.\n  This is absolutely wrong. I am absolutely shocked that there would be \na lot of opposition to an amendment to take $1.5 million out of this \nforeign operations bill for something like this.\n  So, in conclusion, the point is very simple. If you want to give $1.5 \nmillion of new foreign aid to North Vietnam in the hopes that they are \ngoing to pattern their legal system after the United States of America, \nvote against the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  It is important that the legal system in Vietnam be more aligned to \nWestern business and Western investment and Western practices and \ndemocracy. I believe that the Vietnamese have agreed in principle to \nrepay their debt. In fact,\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\nthey have assumed the debt that South Vietnam had incurred in some \nrespects.\n  I am also informed by the administration that the only major dispute \nis over about $8 million of the $150 million debt. I think it is \nimportant. The language of the bill says that the committee urges AID \nto provide up to $1.5 million for the Vietnam legal reform initiative, \nand then it goes on to say that the committee is aware of the \nparticular expertise of the American Bar Association, the International \nLaw Institute, and the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, which \nstrongly recommends that AID consider implementing the initiative \nthrough these organizations. So it is my understanding that the money \nwould not go directly to the Vietnamese Government but to these \norganizations.\n  I believe that the distinguished managers of the bill can help me \nout. I believe that is the reason the language was included as it was, \nso that there would be development of trade relations and also \nassistance to provide the necessary framework for commercial \ntransactions for foreign investment and trade.\n  So, as you know, there are many American corporations doing business \nover in Vietnam today. I am told that some are doing very well. Some \nare not doing very well. One of the reasons some are not doing very \nwell is because of the lack of a legal framework. I am convinced that \nit may be in our national interest to see that happen.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, is there any time remaining at all?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes on each side under the \nprevious unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SMITH. I just would like to respond briefly to the last point \nthat Senator McCain made.\n  In the committee bill in question here, the language that my \namendment strikes is under the heading ``Title II,'' which is \n``Bilateral Economic Assistance, Agency for International Development, \nDevelopment Assistance.'' This is to furnish assistance to any country.\n  Now, here we have a situation where this is under economic \nassistance, so it is going directly to Vietnam because that is exactly \nwhat the language says. The actual committee language reads: ``Funds \nappropriated under this heading shall be made available to assist \nVietnam,'' et cetera. That is what the language says. So that is what \nis happening. Maybe the intent is different. I do not question \nanybody's intent here, but the language says that this money is to \nassist Vietnam. And that is what I object to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished manager of the bill in the hopes that maybe he might \nclear this up. Could I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he can help us \nout. I am not trying to get him into a problem here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend I am not sure I can.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On page 27 of the report accompanying the bill that I am \nlooking at----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I really think Senator Johnston, who is the author, \nought to respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The way I read it, it says the committee ``strongly \nrecommends that AID consider implementing the initiative through those \norganizations.'' I ask the Senator from Louisiana, is that the correct \ninterpretation of the language in the bill?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona that is \nprecisely what is contemplated. That is precisely what the report \nlanguage says.\n  The bill language says this would aid Vietnam, and, indeed, it does \nby aiding Vietnam to set up a legal system. But as the report language \nsays, the committee is aware of the particular expertise of the \nAmerican Bar Association, et cetera, and recommends that AID consider \nimplementing the initiative through these organizations. So it \nexplicitly calls for implementing the help to Vietnam's legal system \nthrough the American Bar Association, the International bar----\n  Mr. McCAIN. International Law Institute and the trade council.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. International Law Institute, yes, and the trade \ncouncil. So this does not go to Vietnam. It goes to these organizations \nwhich would help Vietnam set up the rule of law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question now is on agreeing to amendment No. 5027 offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nLautenberg] is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 239 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lautenberg\n       \n  The amendment (No. 5027) was rejected.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5028\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 5028 offered by the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nHelms].\n  There are 4 minutes equally divided. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. FORD. There must be respect for the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will not proceed without order in the \nChamber.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding there are 2 minutes on each \nside in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the 2 minutes to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will just be very brief before we go to \nthe vote on this amendment sponsored by the Senator from North Carolina \nand the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. The amendment will \nshut down any possible U.N. ambitions to tax American citizens. The \namendment, as I understand it, would prohibit U.S. contributions to the \nU.N. or U.N. agencies if they develop, advocate or publicize U.N. tax \nproposals. I think it is a necessary and important precaution to \ninclude this in the Foreign Operations bill. I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield the 2 minutes under my control to \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my friend from Vermont.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak to the amendment regarding the \nUnited Nations offered by our distinguished colleague and my successor \nas the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms.\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\n  I have the utmost respect for Senator Helms, but I have deep concerns \nabout the amendment he proposes.\n  As one who participated in the San Francisco conference which drew up \nthe U.N. charter, I have tried over the years since both to support and \nimprove the organization any way I could.\n  And the United Nations, I would argue, has accumulated a solid record \nof achievement. It has not lived up to all of its potential, but for \nevery example that critics give of the U.N.'s failures, there are \nnumerous countervailing examples of success--in brokering peaceful \nsettlements to violent conflicts worldwide; in halting the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons; in protecting the international \nenvironment; and in immunizing the world's children and preventing the \nspread of disease.\n  The U.N.'s record is lofty, not only for its thought, but it has made \nthe world a truly better place. The United Nations has enabled the \nUnited States to avoid unilateral responsibility for costly and \nentangling activities in regions of critical importance, even as it \nyields to the United States a position of tremendous authority.\n  U.S. leadership at the United Nations is threatened by our inability \nto pay our dues and meet our obligations. Amendments such as these only \nendanger our position further. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this amendment says that if the United \nNations could borrow money from an international lending organization, \nas defined in here, we would not be able to make our contributions to \nindependent agencies. That means we could not make our contributions to \nUNICEF, to the various environmental organizations, the protection of \nwomen, or other such organizations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. The Senator \nhas 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, what the distinguished Senator from \nVermont has said is not applicable at all. He knows--anybody who has \nread the amendment knows that nothing happens until the United Nations \nbegins to talk about taxing the American people. That is clear in the \namendment. It does not need any obfuscation from the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROMANIA'S PROGRESS TOWARD NATO MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Romania emerged from years of brutal Communist \n     dictatorship in 1989 and approved a new Constitution and \n     elected a Parliament by 1991, laying the foundation for a \n     modern parliamentary democracy charged with guaranteeing \n     fundamental human rights, freedom of expression, and respect \n     for private property;\n       (2) Local elections, parliamentary elections, and \n     presidential elections have been held in Romania, with 1996 \n     marking the second nationwide presidential elections under \n     the new Constitution;\n       (3) Romania was the first former Eastern bloc country to \n     join NATO's Partnership for Peace program and has hosted \n     Partnership for Peace military exercises on its soil;\n       (4) Romania is the second largest country in terms of size \n     and population in Central Europe and as such is strategically \n     significant;\n       (5) Romania formally applied for NATO membership in April \n     of 1996 and has begun an individualized dialogue with NATO on \n     its membership application; and\n       (6) Romania has contributed to the peace and reconstruction \n     efforts in Bosnia by participating in the Implementation \n     Force (IFOR).\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--Therefore, it is the sense of \n     the Congress that:\n       (1) Romania is making significant progress toward \n     establishing democratic institutions, a free market economy, \n     civilian control of the armed forces and the rule of law;\n       (2) Romania is making important progress toward meeting the \n     criteria for accession into NATO;\n       (3) Romania deserves commendation for its clear desire to \n     stand with the West in NATO, as evidenced by its early entry \n     into the Partnership for Peace, its formal application for \n     NATO membership, and its participation in IFOR;\n       (4) Romania should be evaluated for membership in the NATO \n     Participation Act's transition assistance program at the \n     earliest opportunity; and\n       (5) The United States should work closely with Romania and \n     other countries working toward NATO membership to ensure that \n     every opportunity is provided.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5039 through 5044), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may give a status report on behalf of Senator \nLeahy and myself.\n  We have disposed of 24 amendments. There are two that have been laid \naside that will be dealt with later. Senator Leahy and I are aware of \nonly 12 left, of which 3 may need rollcalls. One of the three has a \ntime agreement, and that is, of course, the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, which I believe is triggered under a \nprevious unanimous-consent agreement at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \nagreement, the Senator from North Dakota is to be recognized to offer \nan amendment. One hour of debate has been established, with 40 minutes \nunder the control of the proponents and 20 minutes for the opponents.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Under the unanimous-consent agreement, there are to be no \nsecond-degree amendments. The Senator from Massachusetts had, prior to \nthat point, asked to offer a second-degree amendment that is acceptable \nto myself and Senator Hatfield.\n  I ask that the unanimous-consent agreement be modified to allow the \nSenator from Massachusetts to offer a second-degree amendment when \nappropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request provides \nthat I now offer the amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Hatfield \nand others and that we have 40 minutes on our side in the 1-hour time \nagreement. The Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Texas have \nasked if they could intervene with an amendment that they intend to \noffer that will take 5 minutes on each side. I have no objection, by \nunanimous consent, to allowing them to go 5 minutes each. I understand \ntheir amendment would be agreed to. Following the 10 minutes, I ask \nthat we then have the 1 hour, 40 minutes allotted to us to offer the \namendment on foreign arms sales.\n  So, Mr. President, I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend, I \nbelieve it is a freestanding bill, not an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8741-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8777-S8781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PAM LYCHNER SEXUAL OFFENDER TRACKING AND IDENTIFICATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, we have before us a bill that relates to \ntracking and identifying sex-offenders. Senator Biden, myself, and a \nnumber of other Senators have worked very hard on this bill. Forty-nine \nStates in the Union have set up systems which track known sexual \npredators because, of all the types of criminal activity, the \nprobability that someone who commits a sexual predatory act will commit \nthat type of crime again--especially against a child--is 10 times \nhigher than the probability that any other type of crime will be \nrepeated.\n  The problem with only having State laws is that people are moving \nacross State lines to try to avoid detection. What our bill does is it \nsets up an FBI-based Federal tracking system which will track all \nmovements of sexual predators, whether they move across town or across \nState lines. This system will give us an interactive database, and it \nwill greatly enhance the ability of our communities, our law \nenforcement officials, and our families to protect our children against \nsexual predators.\n  Mr. President, again, I have named this bill, in working with Senator \nBiden, for Pam Lychner, one of the victims of the tragic TWA crash.\n  We have named this bill for her not because of how she tragically \ndied, but because of how she lived. Pam Lychner was one of our Nation's \ngreatest victim's rights advocates. She cared enough for that cause, in \nthe words of the old Hallmark Card commercial, ``to give her very \nbest.'' And in doing so, she reminded people all over my State and \npeople all over America that we are never going to be able to deal with \nthe violent crime problem in this country until those of us who are not \nvictims of crime are as outraged by these atrocities as are the victims \nthemselves.\n  I thank my colleagues for letting this bill pass the Senate. I think \nit is vitally important that we identify and try to monitor sexual \npredators and I think we owe it to our society and to law-abiding \ncitizens to do this.\n  I believe that this bill will provide society with a very strong tool \nwhich will strengthen local law enforcement, give our families the \nability to protect our children, and which will establish a data base \nthat the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, and other youth organizations can \nuse to check out those who want to be trusted with our children.\n  I think this bill will save lives and I think it will provide greater \ncomfort and greater security to our families. I am very proud of this \neffort and I thank Senator Biden for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Gramm and I are now offering a \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1675, a bill originally offered in April by \nmyself and Senator Gramm along with Senators Hutchison, Faircloth, \nDorgan, Kyl, Shelby, Campbell, McConnell, Stevens, McCain, and \nThurmond. This legislation strengthens and improves the Jacob \nWetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender \nRegistration Act.\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\n  The Jacob Wetterling Act, enacted as part of the 1994 crime law, \nrequires States to enact laws to register and track the most violent, \nthe most horrible--and least likely to be rehabilitated--criminals our \nNation faces today. I refer to those criminals who attack our children \nand criminals who are sexually violent predators.\n  These criminals must be tracked. And local law enforcement must know \nwhen these criminals are in their communities. This was the reason I \nworked to include this important measure in the 1994 crime law. And I \nwill also point out that almost all States have taken great strides to \nbuild an effective tracking system.\n  Now we seek to build upon this progress to meet three specific goals.\n  First, we must have a nationwide system that will help State and \nlocal law enforcement track these offenders as they move from State to \nState and will help by providing a back-up system of tracking.\n  Second, while most States have established or are about to establish \nthese systems, if any States fail to act, we cannot allow there to be a \n``black-hole'' where sexual predators can hide and are then lost to all \nStates. A nationwide system will track offenders if States do not \nmaintain registration systems.\n  Third, we must ensure that the most serious sexual predators are \nrequired to remain registered with law enforcement officials for the \nrest of their lives.\n  All of these key goals will be met by this legislation. In addition, \nour amendment will offer some improvements which are made possible by \nthe nationwide system this amendment will provide. For example, our \nbill will--\n  Require all offenders to verify their address on a regular basis by \nreturning verification cards with their fingerprints and recent \nphotograph.\n  Require that a nationwide warning is issued whenever an offender \nfails to verify their address or when an offender cannot be located.\n  Institute tough penalties for offenders who willfully fail to meet \ntheir obligations to register with the nationwide system in States \nwhere there is no registration and in cases of offenders who move from \none State to another.\n  Notify law enforcement officials not only when an offender moves to \ntheir area, but also when an offender moves out of their neighborhood.\n  To offer just one of the practical problems a national database will \nhelp local law enforcement address--Delaware law enforcement, because \nDelaware is so close to other States, will certainly need to know if a \nsexual predator lives just over the line in Pennsylvania. And only a \nnational database can provide this information.\n  To offer a real life example of why a nationwide system is needed--in \nDelaware, a sex offender was released last year. Fortunately, \nDelaware's offender registration law requires this offender--Freddy \nMarine--to be tracked by Delaware law enforcement. Since his release, \nMarine has moved to another State. The nationwide system established by \nthis bill will help make sure that if Freddy Marine moves back to \nDelaware--our State law enforcement will know, and knowledge is the key \nto effective enforcement.\n  In summary, the sex offender tracking and identification bill is \npossible because States such as Delaware and Texas have done the hard \nwork to build statewide registration systems. We now seek to build a \nsystem where all movement of sexually violent and child offenders can \nbe tracked and we will go a long way toward the day when none of these \npredators will fall between the cracks.\n  I am glad that we can now offer and pass with the unanimous consent \nof the Senate this important legislation to protect our children from \nsexual offenders. I hope that our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives will take up and pass the companion bill to this \nlegislation and enact these vital protections for our children.\n  Mr. President, this is the next step in the approach to start action \nwhich Senator Dorgan, I, Senator Gramm of Texas, and others were doing \nwith the crime bill. We decided that we were going to nationalize it--\nit became known as Megan's Law, and it was also called the Jacob \nWetterling Act, again named after a victim in this case--to make sure \nevery State had the ability and the requirement, in order to get \nFederal funds, that they had a State registry so that we know the \nStates and communities can know. It became known as Megan's Law because \nof the celebrated tragic case in New Jersey. It was included in the \noriginal crime bill.\n  What we did not do that Senator Dorgan and Senator Kerry--first \nSenator Gramm came to me and asked me about participating in this, and \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts and others, because all of a sudden it \nbecame pretty clear that there was a gaping hole. If, in fact, we have \nregistration, for example, in Delaware, and our State is registering \nsex offenders so people know whether a pedophile has moved into the \nneighborhood after having been released from the jail, that gives the \ncommunity some protection. But there was no vehicle or mechanism until \nwe passed the Gramm-Biden law.\n  We are going to rename the law. For the person in Delaware who is in \na position where a pedophile who lived in Chester County, PA--literally \n4 miles or 5 miles from Wilmington, DE--moves across the line, there is \nno vehicle. There is no mechanism for the Pennsylvania authorities to \nnotify the authorities in the State of Delaware.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I were talking about this. He \npoints out that in his State, he has the same circumstance, if, in \nfact, you move from one State to another. As a matter of fact, his \nState does not even have a registry yet, which is one of his concerns \nhe mentioned to me because it is sort of behind the rest of us. They \nare not moving.\n  The bottom line of this is real simple. We want people to know. We \nwant a system to be available where it is a nationwide system that will \nhelp State and local enforcement people track offenders as they move \nfrom State to State, providing a backup system for tracking.\n  Second, while most States have established or are about to establish \nthese systems, if any State fails to act, we cannot allow there to be a \nPennsylvania black hole out there, a black hole that Massachusetts now, \nfor example, is part of, because if folks who are pedophiles in \nMassachusetts are moving into Rhode Island, or any other place, or even \ninto Massachusetts, there is nobody who knows. So we need a nationwide \nsystem.\n  Third, we have to assure that the most serious sexual predators are \nrequired to remain registered with law enforcement officials for the \nrest of their lives. This is not just being unnecessarily punitive. The \nrecidivism rates are high, and the notification saves lives.\n  We require all offenders to verify their address on a regular basis \nby returning verification cards with their fingerprints and a recent \nphotograph. We require that a nationwide warning is issued whenever an \noffender fails to verify their address or an offender cannot be \nlocated. We institute tough penalties for offenders who willfully fail \nto meet this requirement. We notify law enforcement officials not only \nwhen an offender moves to an area, but when they move from an area.\n  Let me offer one practical example of the need for this nationwide \ndatabase. A sexual offender in Delaware named Freddie Marine is \nnotorious. While in Delaware, every community was notified. But he \nmoved out of Delaware. He may be over in Maryland or New Jersey. He is \nas much of a threat to a child in New Jersey or Maryland as he was in \nDelaware. But no one knows. There is no way they can know.\n\n  So this nationwide database will provide that. It has been a \npleasure. People kid--when they said, ``This is the Gramm-Biden \namendment, well, we will let this go through. It must be OK.'' But the \ntruth is the Senator from Texas and I work an awful lot on these \ncriminal justice issues, and we are more in agreement than not. I thank \nhim for, quite frankly, pointing out this black hole that I referred to \nearly on. It is a pleasure to work with him. And I thank my friend, \nSenator Dorgan, for not only letting this go through but being on the \nground floor when we put the Jacob Wetterling legislation together; and \nmy friend from Massachusetts, who has been very, very concerned about \nthe failure of his State to move, as it should have, in making sure to \nhelp fill this black hole. I thank him very much.\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time, which is a rarity for me to do on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read and agreed to, the bill be deemed to \nhave been read the third time, and passed, as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related to \nthe bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will never \nforget the morning that we walked through this jungle. We had traveled \n3\\1/2\\ hours by car, then back up in riverbeds, and finally walked. And \nI walked into a jungle clearing somewhere between Nicaragua and \nHonduras.\n  As I began to see a group of people in that clearing, I saw a very \nyoung boy wearing a blue uniform. I found out later that it was a \nmilitary uniform purchased from Sears. Yes, our Sears. All of those \nsoldiers were outfitted in uniforms from Sears. But it was not so much \nhis uniform that captured my attention. It was seeing a young boy who \nappeared to be 10 or 11 years old carrying a machine gun. It turns out \nthat the machine gun was in that young boy's hands courtesy of the \nUnited States as well.\n  Well, that conflict and that set of military arms transfers led to a \nlong debate. We debated for years about whether we should or should not \nhave sent arms to the contras. But it got me interested. I wondered, to \nwhom are we sending arms around the world? What kind of arms are we \nsending? Who gets America's jet fighter planes? Who acquires American-\nmade tanks? Who acquires American guns and cluster bombs? And I \ndiscovered that the United States of America is the largest arms \nmerchant in the world. In 1994, we delivered over $10 billion of the \n$20 billion worth of arms spread all over this world, arms used for \ndefense and for killing, in some cases arms provided to both sides of \nthe same conflict by American arms merchants and by our Government.\n\n  Fifty two percent of the worldwide arms deliveries were from the \nUnited States of America. We offer today an amendment called the code \nof conduct amendment, a commonsense approach to address the issue of \nthe arms trade.\n  It is interesting and tragic, I think, that selling arms to some \nparts of the world comes back to haunt us. American troops in Panama, \nIraq, Somalia, and Haiti lost their lives facing weapons made in this \ncountry or weapons from technology this country furnished others. \nSomeone made a profit selling arms to someone that should not have \nreceived the arms and American uniformed men and women then faced those \nsame weapons in a conflict.\n  U.S. arms are often turned against innocent civilians. The United \nStates has offered F-16 fighters to Indonesia's military regime despite \nthe fact that U.S. weapons have already been used in the occupation of \nEast Timor. Two hundred thousand civilians have been slaughtered there.\n  The definition in the dictionary of the word ``boomerang'' is ``an \nact that backfires on its originator.'' That is what we find with \nsome--not all, some--of the foreign military arms sales, a boomerang, \nan arms trade policy that ends up killing American soldiers, violating \nhuman rights, and giving away American jobs.\n  We do not come to the floor of the Senate suggesting that we not \nfurnish arms anywhere in the world. Allies of ours that need arms to \ndefend themselves should receive those arms. Democracies around the \nworld that need arms to feel safe and secure should receive those arms. \nThe question we ask is, should there not be some minimum standard of \nconduct that measures whether and when we send those arms?\n  We propose a commonsense approach in this legislation. And I should \nadd that this kind of legislation is being considered by our allies in \nEurope and other places in the world, and we hope we will have a safer \nworld if others and ourselves will adopt this kind of code of conduct \nwith respect to arms transfers. Our commonsense approach is this.\n  First, to be eligible to receive American-made arms, we would expect \na government must be promoting democracy through fair and free \nelections, civilian control of the military, rule of law, freedom of \nspeech and of the press.\n  Second, we would expect a country receiving our arms to respect human \nrights. We would expect them not to commit gross violations of \ninternationally recognized human rights.\n  Third, we would expect that a country receiving our arms would \nobserve international borders and not be engaged in armed aggression \nagainst its neighbors in violation of international law.\n  Fourth, we would expect countries receiving our armaments to \nparticipate in the U.N. Conventional Arms Registry, which provides \ntransparency to the world arms market by listing major arms sales and \ntransfers.\n  We provide that a President may waive the criteria on an emergency \nbasis. I conceive that there are circumstances in which that might well \nbe necessary. We would provide for that waiver. We do not include arms \nexport credit arrangements under Section 23 of the Arms Export Control \nAct, such as the Foreign Military Financing program.\n  What we are trying to do is think through the question, is there not \nsome basic standard by which we judge whether an arms transfer to some \nother part of the world makes sense? Is it only profits? Do we only \ncare that someone can make some additional profits by taking an \nincredibly sophisticated weapons machine, a jet fighter, for example, \nand selling it anywhere in the world? Is it only profit or is there \nsome other measure that is important? Senator Hatfield and I and many \nothers believe there ought to be some measure, and it is called the \ncode of conduct.\n  It is interesting that the boomerang I mentioned is not just having \nAmerican-made weapons turned on American soldiers. It is also moving \nAmerican jobs elsewhere. Lockheed Martin secured a sale of F-16's to \nTurkey in\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nexchange for the planes being built in Turkey. What that means, of \ncourse, is, to the extent that sale would have made sense in the first \nplace and met the criteria, someone else has the economic advantage of \nthat sale.\n\n  But our major concern is not jobs. Our major concern is to promote \nand create a safer world, and it is not a safer world when we send \nAmerican soldiers to deal with trouble in the world and they find \nthemselves facing the barrel of an American-made weapon provided to a \ngovernment that should not have received it in the first instance, \nprovided without any review, without any standard code that we develop \nthat says, ``Here are the conditions under which we will transfer these \narms shipments.''\n  Those who would oppose this might say we are trying to shut off arms \nsales. That is simply not the case. There will remain arms sales. Arms \nmanufacturers in this country produce a sophisticated product, in most \ncases the best in the world. Other countries often want those products \nfor their common defense. We understand and accept that there will be \narms transfers, but we believe it is time for this country to adopt a \ncode, a standard, by which we judge whether an arms transfer to this \ndictator or that dictator or this country or that country makes sense \nfor this country's long-term well-being. The fact is that weapons have \nbeen sold in circumstances where the sale has not been in the best \ninterests of United States, and that is why we offer this legislation.\n  Let me, Mr. President, reserve the remainder of the time, since I see \nthat my distinguished colleague Senator Hatfield is on the floor. Let \nme say, before he begins, that Senator Hatfield has been at this longer \nthan others of us in the Senate. I deeply admire the work he has done \nin the Senate and for this country, and I feel deeply honored to \nparticipate with him in offering this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the Senator 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think it is very obvious I have a \nproblem of laryngitis.\n  I thank my good friend, Senator Dorgan, for taking leadership on this \nparticular amendment. I feel strongly enough about it to be here to do \ntwo things; one, to support the amendment, but the other is to \napologize to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, Mr. \nMcConnell, for offering a rider to an appropriations bill, which I ask \neverybody to refrain from doing. So I guess there is no virtue of \nconsistency in this particular environment we work in.\n  Let me associate myself with the eloquent statement made by Senator \nDorgan to explain this bill. I would only try to add perhaps one or two \nperspectives.\n  First of all, I think we have to recognize that we are not locking \nthe President out of an action that he might have to take if he has a \nproblem in an emergency situation. In other words, the President would \nhave the power to make a waiver, a waiver of the criteria we have set \nup in this amendment in case he feels that our national interest is at \nstake and to make a waiver that is in the interest of our national need \nand our national security. So it is flexible in that sense.\n  Let me pick up on Senator Dorgan's examples of how this expands the \nvulnerability of our own troops when they are sent abroad for \npeacekeeping activities after we have delivered arms. Let me take a \nspecific. From 1981 to 1991, $154 million of arms were delivered to \nSomalia from the United States. Then when you begin to look at how that \nstimulated the arms race and endangered our national security, \nultimately the total cost of arms to Somalia was $1.2 billion--25,800 \nUnited States troops were deployed, 23 were killed in action, 143 were \nwounded. That is the kind of return we had on that one example, of \nsending troops.\n\n  Also, today we are building more F-16's in Ankara, Turkey, than we \nare in Fort Worth, TX. It does not help American workers, as some may \nsay, and we, indeed, need to help employment in this country. We find \nthat 88,000 jobs could be created in the United States in offsetting \nsome of this extraordinary subsidy of arms. In other words, we do not \nlose jobs by cutting down the export of arms. We are creating them in \nother sectors of our economy, where there is great need.\n  Mr. President, I was reared in a generation where among our required \nreading in high school was a book called ``Merchants of Death.'' It was \na story of how the Krupp Works and other manufacturers of arms in \nCentral Europe sent their arms out to both sides. In fact, they were \nsometimes guilty of stimulating conflict in order to sell their arms.\n  We were reared in a manner of saying that is immoral; surely our \nNation would never be guilty of such a crime against humanity. Yet I \nhave to say, since the Soviet Union has become unraveled, we are now \nunquestionably the No. 1 merchants of death in this world by our export \nof arms. We not only export them as a market, we go around promoting \nit. We go around ballyhooing the arms that we have, the arms that are \nexhibited in the Paris Air Show and many international conferences that \nsupposedly are for some international benefit. It is an arms peddling \nactivity. We even let our Embassies be instructed to facilitate arms \ntransfers as part of their duty in the country in which they are \nrepresenting the United States. I cannot understand how people around \nthis country will tolerate much further this kind of export that we \nhave engaged in.\n  It started with, perhaps, Charles de Gaulle. That is the way he \nfunded his military budget, was to sell arms abroad. Unfortunately, \nback in 1962, that was the policy of the United States of America. That \nbecame the policy in 1962, when the President decided in order to help \nfund some of our own military budgets, we would export arms. This idea \nof funding a domestic need by exporting our arms is, to me, immoral and \nis counterproductive.\n  So I am very hopeful we will support this particular amendment. It is \nflexible. It takes into consideration emergencies unforeseen. And it \ndoes not lock the President out. In fact, all it does is to say the \nCongress has some joint responsibility in that kind of policy that was \nrecommended by the President's review commission on arms, that the \nCongress should have some kind of role in assessing this from time to \ntime.\n  We have not had a debate on this floor for 20 years on this subject, \na comprehensive debate. I am not sure in 1 hour we are going to have it \ntoday. But at least it is a small step, I think, in raising this issue \nso the American public will understand our failure to uphold our \nresponsibilities in governing some of this export of death.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts after I make a couple of observations about the comments \nof the Senator from Oregon.\n  In 1993, the United States supplied 75 percent of all weapons sold to \nthe Third World, the countries who can least afford to be buying arms--\n75 percent of the weapons that went to the Third World came from the \nUnited States. According to our State Department and their own human \nrights report, more than three-quarters of our arms sales in 1993 went \nto undemocratic governments. In other words, three-quarters of the arms \nwe send around the world goes to governments listed by the State \nDepartment as authoritarian governments with serious human rights \nabuses. The people who live in those areas where these American weapons \nare coming in have every right to wonder about America. This \nlegislation allows us to develop some standards that move in the right \ndirection.\n\n  Mr. President, let me yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5046 to Amendment No. 5045\n\n  (Purpose: To promote the establishment of a permanent multilateral \n          regime to govern the transfer of conventional arms)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\nfor immediate consideration. I assume that will not come up in time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the time is used or yielded back, the \nsecond-degree would not be in order.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we had a unanimous-consent agreement a few \nmoments ago, allowing for the second-degree to be reported at such time \nas we deemed appropriate. I ask unanimous consent at this time I be \npermitted to submit my second-degree amendment, under the 5 minutes I \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5046 to amendment No. 5045.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRANSFERS REGIME.\n\n       (a) International Efforts.--The President shall continue \n     and expand efforts through the United Nations and other \n     international forums, such as The Wassernaar Arrangement on \n     Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and \n     Technologies, to curb worldwide arms transfers, particularly \n     to nations that do not meet the criteria establish a section   \n     04, with a goal of establishing a permanent multilateral \n     regime to govern the transfer of conventional arms.\n       (b) Report.--The President shall submit an annual report to \n     the Congress describing efforts he has undertaken to gain \n     international acceptance of the principles incorporated in \n     section   04, and evaluating the progress made toward \n     establishing a multilateral regime to control the transfer of \n     conventional arms. This report shall be submitted in \n     conjunction with the submission of the annual request for \n     authorizations and appropriations for foreign assistance \n     programs for a fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before I explain my amendment I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, for his \nextraordinary, long involvement in an effort to help educate and lead \nthe U.S. Senate to a more rational approach to this question of \nproliferation, nuclear and conventional. When he leaves the Senate \nthere will be an enormous gap with respect to that leadership and his \nvoice, always clear even with laryngitis. I also welcome Senator \nDorgan, whose history is not as long, but whose commitment is equally \nas passionate. I look forward to working with him in the future.\n  Their amendment embodies a fundamental shift in the way the United \nStates needs to deal with the transfer of conventional weapons to the \nrest of the world. Like so many other aspects of our national security \ntoday, arms sales and other military assistance needs still to be \nadjusted to the realities of the post-cold-war world. The central theme \nof our foreign policy has changed from containment of communism to \nexpansion of democracy. So we no longer need to send these massive \namounts of weaponry to our surrogates around the world in an arms race \nagainst communism.\n  Instead, we need to evaluate the effect that arms transfers have on \nregional stability, on the promotion of democracy, and on the \nprotection of human rights. The legislation in front of us seeks to do \nthat. It makes democracy, human rights, and nonaggression the central \ncriteria for decisions on arms transfers. But equally important, it \nforces the U.S. Congress to take responsibility for approving such \ntransfers to countries that do not meet the criteria set forth in the \nlegislation.\n  Under the present system, the President just makes a determination of \nwhich countries will receive what weapons. In theory, the Congress \ncould act to disapprove a specific sale, but in practice we all know it \nis very difficult and extremely rare that happens. We ought to be more \ninvolved as a Congress in making these decisions. This legislation \ngives us a prominent role that is appropriate to the money that we \nspend on behalf of the taxpayers and to the interests we represent in \nthe world. There still will be cases when it serves the interests of \nour country to transfer arms to countries that do not meet the criteria \nof this legislation. But in those cases, the Congress will have to \nagree with the President that such a transfer bolsters United States \nnational security needs.\n  These changes in this legislation will focus congressional attention \non the question of what really serves our interests and will, I hope, \nlead to a reduction in the extraordinarily dangerous worldwide \nproliferation of conventional weapons.\n  My amendment seeks to simply add one new section to this language. It \ninstructs the President to expand the international efforts to curb \nworldwide arms sales and to work toward establishing a multilateral \nregime to govern the transfer of conventional weapons.\n  The amendment also requires the President to report annually to the \nCongress on steps that he is taking to gain international acceptance of \nthe principles incorporated in this legislation and on the progress he \nis making toward establishing a permanent multilateral structure for \ncontrolling arms shipments.\n  I support the goals of this legislation, Mr. President. We ought to \nstop selling arms to nations, but the fact is that it is not just \nenough for us to set that example. The French, the Germans, Chinese, \nthe Japanese, a host of other countries will rush in to fill the vacuum \nthat we leave. What we need to do is create an international effort \nwith our leadership that will provide the underlying force for this \namendment and to guarantee that we do reduce arms proliferation in the \nworld and slow the conventional arms race of which we are currently the \nleader.\n  I thank the distinguished Senators from Oregon and North Dakota for \ntheir leadership, and I believe that my amendment is acceptable. If so, \nwe can act on it immediately.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is no further debate. If the Chair is \nready, we can act on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The question is on agreeing to \nthe Kerry amendment No. 5046.\n  The amendment (No. 5046) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I yield back whatever time remains to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I commend \nboth the Senator from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Byron Dorgan, and the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nSimon, who is present on the floor, for their longtime support of this \ncode of conduct.\n  I am a newcomer to this. Let me tell you what I feel. I am one who \nvotes for defense appropriations. I want to see this Nation strong. I \nbelieve there is a deterrent value in having the best equipment, the \nbest training and the most advanced technology for our armed forces. I \nbelieve that there is a price for freedom, and it is eternal vigilance.\n  But I did not come to the U.S. Senate to make the entire world less \nsafe in the future than it was when I arrived. This code of conduct is \nan enormous addition to a major public policy debate and there are \nhuman dimensions to these decisions.\n  Every time I look into the big round eyes of my little 3-year-old \ngranddaughter, Eileen, it is almost impossible not to ask, ``Am I \ncontributing to the kind of world in which I want my granddaughter to \nlive? Is the world a safer place because of what I do in this body?'' \nAnd I think about what that world will be like when she is 13 and 23 \nand 33 years old. That is not so long. Technology moves so fast, \nthough. What kind of weapons will there be? Who will have them? How \nwill they be used? Will they be used against her in some way?\n  I am sorry to say these are not just the ruminations of an \noverprotective grandmother. These are very real and very frightening \nquestions the people of America must ask themselves, because our \ncountry remains the biggest, the boldest and the largest arms purveyor \nin the world today.\n  Which brings us to the question that is before us: What should U.S. \npolicy be regarding the sale of weapons?\n  I truly believe we need to take more time in deciding to whom we sell \nweapons, not only as a matter of conscience, but as a matter of \nnational security.\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\n  What happens to the deterrent value of our military strength when we \nexport technologies and weapons systems that are equal to that which \nour own troops use?\n  For example:\n  Kuwait had the new M1-A2 main battle tank before it was even \ndelivered to U.S. forces. Saudi Arabia now has these tanks as well.\n  We have exported Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the \nUnited Arab Emirates.\n  F-16 and F-15 fighter planes, almost exactly what our Air Force is \ncurrently flying, have been exported to Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, \nSingapore, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n  Turkey and South Korea, as has been stated, are building F-16 \nfighters under coproduction agreements with the United States. In fact, \nthere are more people, as Senator Hatfield said, building these planes \nin Turkey than there are in the United States.\n  The upgrades of these F-16's will not even be performed by the United \nStates. They will be done by Denmark, Sweden and Norway.\n  One of the main reasons the United States overwhelmed Iraq's military \nin the Gulf War was because our equipment was more technologically \nadvanced. What will be the result the next time we go to war and our \ntroops look across the battlefield at the same tank they are sitting \nin?\n  U.S. weapons have already been used against the United States \noverseas.\n  During the eighties, we sent Somalia 4,800 M-16 rifles, 84 106-\nmillimeter recoilless rifles, 24 machine guns, 75 81-millimeter mortars \nand landmines. Guess what the ``technicals\" of Somali warlord Mohammed \nFarah Aideed used to ambush and kill 30 Americans soldiers? Our own \nweapons.\n  Iran has deployed the American Hawk anti-aircraft missiles in the \nStraits of Hormuz, which were exported to the Shah decades ago before \nthe revolution.\n  Three-hundred U.S. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles provided to Afghani \nrebels are unaccounted for and are reportedly being sold on the black \nmarket.\n  Although we don't know the cause, wouldn't it be tragically ironic if \nthe downing of TWA Flight 800 was because of a Stinger missile obtained \non the black market?\n  Libya and North Korea may have acquired U.S. Stinger missiles through \nthis very same black market.\n  How will these weapons be used? How stable are the regions to which \nU.S. weapons and technology are being transferred? Did you know that \nTurkey used U.S. COBRA helicopters to destroy small Kurdish villages?\n  Today, Iran is using the same F-14 fighters we exported to the Shah.\n  Allies change and governments fall. What happens if the Government of \nSaudi Arabia falls into Islamic fundamentalist hands?\n  What happens if tensions between Pakistan and India reach the boiling \npoint? We are today escalating an arms race between these two \ncountries.\n  Since the Reagan administration, arms have been treated more as items \nfor international commerce than as tools to advance our national \nsecurity. I believe this is dangerous and ultimately self-defeating.\n  The President, any President, is confronted with strong incentives to \nsell arms abroad, to bolster allies whose security is in our interest, \nto encourage diplomatic and economic cooperation. I don't believe it is \nrealistic to think that in the face of these pressures, any American \nPresident alone is able to unilaterally change course and substantially \nlimit arms sales without strong congressional support and even \ninitiation. That is what we are considering today, initiating a code of \nconduct.\n  So it is for these reasons that I believe the code of conduct on arms \ntransfers will help to bring some increased transparency and added \nconsideration to the whole arms sales process. The code of conduct \nrequires the President to develop a list of countries to which our \nGovernment may export weapons systems. Their criteria, outlined by the \nDorgan/Hatfield amendment, is very basic, reasonable and flexible.\n  In instances where a country may not qualify, the President has the \nability to ask the Congress for a national security waiver, or he may \nenact an emergency waiver on his own so that nation may receive U.S. \narms. In this way, the President maintains the flexibility he needs to \ndeter aggressors and conduct foreign policy.\n  The United States continues to be the unquestioned leader in weapons \ntechnology. However, the United States currently exports 52 percent of \nall global arms sales, making us the leader in this dubious category as \nwell. If we continue to export advanced and often sophisticated best \nweapons systems to volatile areas, we put our own troops and our \nnational security at risk maybe not today, but what about next year and \nthe next decade?\n  I am not saying that the United States should export no arms, but we \nmust have a rational arms sales policy that first and foremost protects \nU.S. national security, and second does not gratuitously exacerbate a \nglobal arms race. I am very afraid that if we continue to export the \nnumbers and kinds of weapons systems and technologies we are currently, \nwe will be less secure in the future, not more.\n  It is time for the United States to show a different kind of \nleadership, one encouraging restraint and transparency in the sale of \narms around the world. By enacting the Code of Conduct, the United \nStates will take an important step forward in a global effort to make \nthe world a safer place for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 6 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first I want to thank Senator Hatfield and \nSenator Dorgan for their leadership on this.\n  I am rounding out 22 years on Capitol Hill. I am a slow learner, Mr. \nPresident, but I have learned two things, among others. One is, do not \nget too cozy with dictators. Eighty-five percent of our weapons sent \nabroad are sent to nations the State Department identifies as human \nrights abusers. I think we ought to be careful. Second, I have learned \nthat weapons we send abroad may be used against us. Senator Feinstein \nmentioned Somalia. We could be mentioning Panama, Haiti, Iraq, and \nother nations.\n  Back--I do not know--2 or 3 years ago I was in Angola with Senator \nFeingold and Senator Reid and visited the Swedish Red Cross place where \nthey were fitting artificial limbs for children and adults. I saw the \nhuge numbers of people in Angola being fitted for those limbs in part \nbecause of American mines, in part because of American mines purchased \nwith American funds. We are today, as has been pointed out, the No. 1 \narms merchant in the world. And 56 percent of the arms sold abroad, are \nsold by the United States.\n  While we are the No. 1 arms merchant, do you know where we are in \nforeign economic assistance to other countries, compared to the other \nWestern European countries, Australia, New Zealand and Japan? We are \ndead last. One-sixth of 1 percent of our national income goes to help \nthe poor beyond our borders. Norway is above 1.2 percent, and the other \nnations in between. And when you contrast what we do with weapons and \nwhat we do with economic assistance, it is kind of interesting.\n  From July 11 to 18, the National Basketball Association signed \ncontracts totaling $927 million for free agents. Do you know what we \nare doing in providing development assistance for all of Africa, the \npoorest nation, poorest continent today, when you except Egypt? We are \nspending a total of $628 million, less than we spent in 1 week for free \nagents for the National Basketball Association.\n  We need some sense of perspective. And for us to spend this amount of \nmoney on development assistance for poor countries, and then eagerly \nget every buck we can get so we can sell arms, and we do not care \nwhether they are dictators or not dictators, that just does not make \nsense. Without this particular amendment, frankly, we are not going to \ndo anything.\n  We have not turned down an arms request from another country since \nthe early 1980's when we turned down an AWAC's request from Saudi \nArabia.\n  This amendment would start to put us in the right direction. Again, \nlet me go to the bottom line. The No. 1 lesson\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\nwe ought to learn is, do not get too cozy with dictators. And, No. 2, \nwhen you sell arms abroad to dictatorships, they may be used against \nyou. I think those two lessons are just fundamental. I hope that we get \na good vote on this amendment. I am realistic. Our friends in the \ndefense industry obviously want to kill this amendment. But the merits \nare so overwhelming I hope we can pass it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Inouye, I ask \nunanimous consent that privilege of the floor be granted to Roxanne \nPotosky, from his staff, during the consideration of H.R. 3540, the \nforeign operations appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Senator Pell.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my Senate colleague.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have been deeply impressed over the years \nby the strong and unwavering commitment to arms control shown by the \nsenior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield. The Senator, who I am pleased \nto call a friend, has numerous accomplishments in the field of arms \ncontrol to which he can point with pride.\n  As only one example, the current multinational moratorium on nuclear \ntesting is essentially the result of an initiative he took several \nyears ago as ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. As many \nof my fellow Members are aware, a major effort is under way at the \nConference on Disarmament to bring to a successful close negotiations \non a comprehensive test ban to follow the international moratorium \nbrought about largely through the efforts of the Senator and others of \nlike mind.\n  I am pleased, too, that the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, \nhas taken such a strong interest in this amendment, and I note with \npleasure that we are joined by a number of cosponsors in support of the \nArms Transfers Eligibility Act of 1996.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to provide congressional review of \nthe eligibility of foreign governments to be considered for United \nStates military assistance and arms transfers and to establish clear \nstandards for arms cooperation.\n  In effect, the major change proposed in the legislation is to \nemphasize a requirement for congressional involvement and approval that \ndoes not now exist. For 2 decades now, arms sales have been carried out \nunder procedures giving Congress the right to disapprove particular \nsales if they appear inadvisable. Interestingly enough, in those 20 \nyears, the Congress has come close on several occasions, but it has \nnever succeeded in getting a resolution of disapproval enacted. This \ndoes not mean that Congress has not had a significant role. A large \nnumber of sales have been modified or withheld by the executive branch \nfollowing congressional consultations. As ranking Democratic member and \nformer Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I can assure you \nthat the dialog on arms sales with succeeding administrations has been \ndetailed and in depth and that a number of risky, threatening or \ndestabilizing transfers have been averted.\n  I understand and appreciate the Senator from Oregon's deep concern \nover continued arms races throughout the world and his desire to apply \nserious limits and controls through the legislation now under \nconsideration. I can also understand why some in this body would prefer \na system under which the positive approval of Congress would be \nrequired for transfers and assistance to a number of particular \ncounties, as contrasted with the present emphasis on the right of \ndisapproval.\n  While I very much support the underlying concept of this initiative, \nas we explore this and other concepts further, we will want to take \ncare to ensure that the legislation is workable in real world \nsituations in its final form. For instance, certain questions are \nraised by the prohibition on arms transfers and assistance to \ngovernments other than democracies. The prohibition would appear to \nexclude any monarchy, emirate or sheikdom. All of those nations in the \nPersian Gulf that are scared to death of Iran and Iraq are kingdoms, \nemirates or sheikdoms, and would thus be ineligible for transfers or \nassistance, unless given a Presidential waiver and approved by \nCongress.\n  We will also want to make sure that we do not create a situation in \nwhich our decisions on transfers and some assistance are less balanced \nand deliberate and more chaotic or haphazard. It is very important that \nour defense industry and its thousands of American workers understand \nthat we want both to improve the standards under which transfers are \nallowed, but that we will remain dedicated to our national security \ninterests and to the security of our friends and allies throughout the \nworld.\n  I am sure that these and other concerns can be met and strong, \npositive legislation that earns solid, bipartisan support can emerge. I \nwould hope that is the case because much more needs to be done to put a \nlid on the continuing, desperately costly arms competition throughout \nthe world.\n  For the moment, I think it is important that we affirm our belief \nthat democratic values, respect for human rights, avoidance of armed \nconflict in violation of international law, and participation in the \nU.N. register of conventional arms are all reasonable standards by \nwhich we should judge whether we wish an arms relationship with another \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Congressional Review \nof Arms Transfers Eligibility Act I support the amendment of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, and the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  The world is awash in weapons, and there is not a political leader \nfrom any of the world's major arms sellers who has not made speeches \nabout the evils of the arms trade.\n  Unfortunately, their rhetoric is not matched by action. In the United \nStates, the defense industry, backed by the Pentagon, is using every \ntrick in the trade to expand arms exports. The competition is fierce. \nOur allies, the Russians, the Chinese, and many others, are doing the \nsame thing.\n  One would think that our experience in the Persian Gulf, where our \ntroops came under fire by Iraqi soldiers armed with weapons we gave to \nIraq during its war with Iran, or in Somalia where our troops were \nkilled by United States-made weapons, would give us pause.\n  The weapons we sell have repeatedly fallen into the wrong hands. If \nthey have not been used against us, they have often been used to commit \nabuses against innocent people elsewhere. In Afghanistan today, United \nStates and Soviet weapons are being used to destroy what little is left \nof that country. Liberia is suffering the same fate. Turkey has used \nour weapons against Kurdish civilians. Indonesia, which faces no \nexternal threat, uses our weapons to crush internal dissent. In Central \nAmerica, our weapons were used to commit unspeakable atrocities.\n  In the period since the end of the cold war and despite the collapse \nof the Soviet Union, we have exported $83 billion worth of military \nequipment, an increase of 140 percent. Most of this equipment has gone \nto developing countries, including to undemocratic governments whose \narmed forces have been among the worst abusers of human rights. U.S. \narms account for almost half of the weapons exported to those \ncountries.\n  The governments of many developing countries cannot even feed their \nown people, and have no discernable enemy. Yet because of the political \nclout of their armed forces, scarce funds that might be available for \neducation and health care and other social services are spent on \nweapons.\n  One would hope that the days of selling arms to dictators would be \nover. But this amendment would not prevent us from selling or giving \narms to a dictator, or even to a government that engages in gross \nviolations of human rights.\n  What this amendment would do, is define basic criteria for the \ntransfer of arms. Even if a government is not democratic, violates \nhuman rights, and fails to participate in the U.N. registry of \nconventional arms, it would still be eligible for U.S. military \nequipment\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nunder this amendment, if the Congress agrees.\n  I suspect if we asked the American people, the majority would say \nthis amendment does not go far enough.\n  What could possible be wrong with giving Congress a say over these \ndecisions? Haven't we had enough of our own weapons coming back to \nhaunt us?\n  Some have argued that this amendment would hurt the arms industry. \nBaloney. It is a well-kept secret that the economic burdens of arms \ntransfers is costing taxpayers billions of dollars, including both \ndirect and indirect costs. By the end of this decade, more than half of \nU.S. weapons sales will be paid for by American taxpayers.\n  The real issue is what is right for national security. That is the \nprimary criteria for arms transfers, and this amendment does not alter \nthat one bit.\n   Mr. President, it is long overdue for Congress to exercise some \nmeaningful review of decisions to sell arms to governments that do not \nmeet the most elementary standards of conduct. That is all this \namendment does. It should have been the law a long time ago.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today I will cast my vote in favor of \nthe Hatfield amendment to prevent U.S. arms exports to countries that \nare undemocratic or that violate human rights--unless, of course, our \nnational security interests override those concerns.\n  I am well aware of this legislation's shortcomings, and I do not cast \nthis vote lightly. But today I dissent from those who would continue to \nexpand America's arms exports.\n  We cannot stand by indefinitely as the current international arms \nbazaar continues to grow. And we must in honesty acknowledge that \nAmerica's arms export policy has substantially contributed to the \nproblem. Fully half of all international weapons transfers in 1994 came \nfrom the United States. A year later, in 1995, we more than doubled the \nnumber of major conventional weapons that we sent abroad.\n  Arms transfers can serve important American interests and, indeed, \nthe majority of our shipments go to our NATO allies or to our major \nstrategic allies in other regions of the world. These important \ntransfers that serve our national interests would withstand closer \nscrutiny by Congress.\n  But too often we have seen arms we transferred abroad used to repress \ndemocracy and human rights rather than to support freedom. As chairman \nof the Africa Subcommittee, I have seen teenagers in Liberia and Angola \nwho have learned to shoot before learning to read. I have seen \ncountries whose meager coffers have been drained to purchase weapons of \nwar while their people suffer an unconscionable standard of living. \nPerhaps during the cold war, when we were locked in a global struggle \nwith communism, considerations such as these were necessarily \nsecondary. But no more.\n  We cannot be responsible for the misconduct of other governments. But \nwe can refuse to participate in arming repressive regimes or \nstrengthening the hand of those who grossly violate human rights. We \ncan encourage the forces of liberty abroad--in countries friend and foe \nalike--by making clear that the price for American arms includes \nprogress on human rights and democratic government.\n  The liberal transfer of arms abroad puts our national interest at \nrisk. Our soldiers already have faced American weapons in combat. More \noften, they have faced weapons supplied freely by other major arms \nexporters. Yet, as long as we are the world's largest seller of arms, \nwe have little leverage to press other exporters to curtail transfers \nwe oppose.\n  Mr. President, I am under no illusion that this legislation will \nbecome law. But for that very reason, I view this as a vote not just \nabout the specific language and procedures in this amendment but about \nthe overall direction of America's arms export policy. I believe that \npolicy, on the whole, is headed in the wrong direction. For that \nreason, I am voting for a change.\n\n\n             The Dorgan-Hatfield Code of Conduct Amendment\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleagues the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and \nthe senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield. This amendment would \nsignificantly reform the criteria by which U.S. arms sales are \nevaluated and enhance the roll of Congress in the process.\n  Under the Arms Export Control Act, arms sales are reviewed for their \ncompliance with several criteria, including whether a foreign \ngovernment respects human rights and avoids acts of international \naggression. Under this amendment, consideration would also be given to \nwhether a government adheres to democratic principles and whether it \nparticipates in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. And \nunder this amendment, Congress would review and pass judgement on any \nsale that the Administration has approved to a nation that did not meet \nthese requirements.\n  While Congress technically has the option to disapprove of any sale \nthat does not meet the criteria of the Arms Export Control Act, in \nfact, it rarely exercises that right, and little attention was paid to \nmany controversial sales. At no time was a comprehensive review of \npending arms sales actively examined and approved by Congress. This \nprocess is no longer acceptable, and the changes that this amendment \nwould bring to this process are welcome.\n  Yes, the Cold War is over, but we all realize that in many respects, \nthe world does not seem like a safer place, in part because American \narms are helping to fuel conflicts around the world that we then must \ntry to resolve. An obvious way to reduce the frequency of this \nhappening is to more closely scrutinize the sales being made to \ncountries who do not share our basic ideology and respect for human \nrights. And the Congress should be given a greater role in this \nprocess.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dorgan-Hatfield amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains for the opposition to this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not use that. I understand \nSenator Domenici is lurking and may be available to offer his \namendment. And there is a little more debate on the Burma amendment. \nAnd we may well stack three votes for around 6 o'clock, or thereabouts, \njust to give an overview of where we are.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, with regard to the Dorgan amendment, the \nClinton administration is strongly opposed to the amendment on the \ngrounds that human rights and democracy are relevant criteria but not \nthe only criteria about which arms sales should be evaluated. Regional \nsecurity and stability may be overriding considerations in making a \ndecision to proceed with a transaction. Arms transfers serve key \nforeign policy concerns and no single issue can be the only or primary \nconsideration.\n  Let me give you an example, Mr. President. The amendment could well \ncut off the transfer of arms to key allies in the Middle East, for \nexample, or in central Europe. And so the question arises, is this \nreally in our best interest to make this kind of certification process \na precondition for the transfer of arms to key allies?\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will not be approved. \nRarely do I find myself speaking on behalf of the Clinton \nadministration, but my suspicion is that any administration would be \nopposed to this, that it would not be in our Nation's best interests.\n  I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time, if \nI can locate Senator Domenici. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is the Senator from Kentucky yielding back \nhis time? If so, I will take the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have 3 minutes remaining, is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suspect most administrations oppose this \nkind of proposal because it does not allow them complete and \nunrestrained freedom to do whatever they want wherever they want in the \nworld.\n  However, this proposal has an enormous amount of common sense. We are \nnot proposing something that would restrict critically needed arms \ntransfers to our allies in the Middle East, for example. We \nspecifically have a provision in this amendment that resolves that \nissue. That cannot be argued.\n  I say this: With respect to arms transfers that have occurred in \nother parts of the world over all of these years, this country ought to \nstart to rethink these issues. We sold Iraq cluster bombs for its war \nagainst Iran, and only because of our superior air power did American \ntroops not face those same American-made cluster bombs in the Middle \nEast.\n  We sold Somalia 4,800 M-16 rifles, 8,400 6-millimeter recoilless \nrifles; 24 machine guns, 75 81-millimeter mortars, landmines. Guess \nwhat happened? Mr. Aideed would use them to kill 23 American soldiers.\n  This has really gone on long enough. There ought to be some basic \nstandard by which we measure whether it is in our country's interest to \ncontinue shipping arms to every single dictator in the world, to \ncountry after country, dictator after dictator, without regard to how \nthose countries behave or without regard to whether American men and \nwomen wearing our uniforms may face those same weapons made by American \nworkers again at some point in the future.\n  We are not proposing anything radical. We are proposing something \nthat says arms transfers ought to be made in circumstances where they \nare promoting democracy, where they are respecting human rights, not \nkilling innocent people, where they are observing international \nborders, not attacking their neighbors, and where they participate in \nthe U.N. conventional arms registry. That makes a lot of common sense.\n  It is especially now time for this country to lead. It is time for \nAmerica to provide leadership on this issue. Frankly, this chart is \nappalling. This country, the symbol of freedom, the torch of liberty \nfor the world, ought not be the world's arms merchant. No one ought to \nbe able to point to a chart and say the United States of America \nprovides 52 percent of all the arms transfers in the world. And a \nsubstantial majority go to countries in which the State Department says \nthose countries are countries with authoritarian governments who are \nabusing human rights of people in their own countries.\n  I do not ever want to be able to point to a chart like this in the \nfuture. I want foreign arm sales and military sales and arms transfers \nto be made when it represents good common sense, when it is in our \ninterest, when it is in the world's interest. If we can provide \nleadership and the Europeans can provide leadership to develop a code \nof conduct on when arms should be transferred, this will be a safer \nworld--yes, for the children that Senator Feinstein talked about, for \nmy children, your children and all children.\n  To keep doing what we are doing makes no good sense at all for anyone \nin this world. It provides a more unstable and a more unsafe world. \nThis amendment, if adopted, would provide for a safer, more stable \nworld. I hope the Senate, when it votes this evening, will finally, \nafter some two long decades of having this discussed, take the first \nstep to say this is the right direction, this is a step toward a safer \nworld, this is a step toward American leadership to do what is right.\n\n  I yield the floor and I yield back the balance of my time. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the Dorgan amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside to take up an amendment of Senator Domenici and \nSenator D'Amato.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5047\n\n   (Purpose: To restrict the availability of funds under the Act for \n        Mexico until drug kingpins are extradited or prosecuted)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in \nbehalf of myself, and Senators D'Amato, Hutchison, Feinstein, \nMurkowski, Shelby, Helms, Hatch, Gramm of Texas, Bingaman, Kempthorne, \nand Faircloth, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Murkowski, \n     Mr. Shelby, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Faircloth proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5047.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n\n        PROSECUTION OF MAJOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS RESIDING IN MEXICO\n\n       Sec. ____. (a) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration shall submit a report to the \n     President--\n       (A) identifying the 10 individuals who are indicted in the \n     United States for unlawful trafficking or production of \n     controlled substances most sought by United States law \n     enforcement officials and who there is reason to believe \n     reside in Mexico; and\n       (B) identifying 25 individuals not named under paragraph \n     (1) who have been indicted for such offenses and who there is \n     reason to believe reside in Mexico.\n       (2) The President shall promptly transmit to the Government \n     of Mexico a copy of the report submitted under paragraph (1).\n       (b) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--None of the funds appropriated under the \n     heading ``International Military Education and Training'' may \n     be made available for any program, project, or activity for \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if, not later \n     than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President certifies to Congress that--\n       (A) the Government of Mexico has extradited to the United \n     States the individuals named pursuant to subsection (a)(1); \n     or\n       (B) the Government of Mexico has apprehended and begun \n     prosecution of the individuals named pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(1).\n       (c) Waiver.--Subsection (b) shall not apply if the \n     President of Mexico certifies to the President of the United \n     States that--\n       (1) the Government of Mexico made intensive, good faith \n     efforts to apprehend the individuals named pursuant to \n     subsection (a)(1) but did not find one or more of the \n     individuals within Mexico; and\n       (2) the Government of Mexico has apprehended and extradited \n     or apprehended and prosecuted 3 individuals named pursuant to \n     subsection (a)(2) for each individual not found under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is an amendment that is \nurging Mexico, is pleading with Mexico, to cooperate to bring to \njustice the 10 most wanted, previously indicted drug lords living in \nMexico.\n  Now, Mr. President, anyone in the Senate who has read the record over \nthe past 10 years of what the Senator from New Mexico has said and done \nwith reference to Mexico would know that I have been a staunch advocate \nof those policies in Mexico which are calculated to create a better \nstandard of living for the Mexican people and to increase their \neconomic prosperity.\n  I have from time to time even bragged too about the quality of the \nMexican leadership, as it looks in hindsight. I do not regret that one \nbit. Frankly, my State is one of those States that borders on Mexico, \nand we know better than the rest of America that unless and until \nMexico prospers and their standard of living for their average people \ngoes up, the problem of illegal activities on the border can never be \ncontrolled.\n  What I do today is not a very major monetary measure. There is no \ngreat big money denial. The economic package that is in place is not \ntaken into account. We do not assault it and remove pieces of it, we \njust take a tiny program worth $1 million in foreign aid for military \neducation and training. The amendment provides that it shall not be \ndelivered to the Mexican Government unless and until they cooperate \nwith us to do some things.\n  Let me talk for just a little bit with the Senate and with the people \nwho are observing this, and yes, I might say to the leaders of the \nRepublic of Mexico, we have some very distinguished Senators who are \nvery pro-Mexico who are\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\non this amendment. You will note a couple are from the State of Texas, \nmy immediate neighbor. You will note one is from California, another \nmajor border State.\n  I will start by asking a couple of questions: Do you know how much \ngood law enforcement work and taxpayers' money it takes to get an \nindictment of a major drug trafficker or drug kingpin? An indictment is \na grand jury's written accusation issued after it has heard significant \nevidence. The next step in the judicial process is supposed to be a \ntrial. Getting an indictment is the sum of surveillance, interdiction \nof evidence, usually massive quantities of drugs, wiretaps, untangling \nthe money-laundering networks. It is not uncommon for a border agent or \ntwo to lose their lives in a case where an indictment is sought and \nobtained.\n  According to the Department of Justice, there currently are 99 \noutstanding U.S. extradition requests for 110 criminals known or \nbelieved to be in Mexico who have been indicted in the United States-- \n107 Mexican nationals have been indicted under our Federal drug kingpin \nstatute, which is a very large number, at a very large expense, and a \nvery major risk of life.\n\n  This has not occurred because anybody is picking on Mexico. This has \noccurred because we know in the United States that the enormous growth \nin drug trafficking through Mexico, which I will delineate with more \nspecificity shortly, is having an enormous negative affect on \nAmericans, and that unless we take some of those kingpins, some of \nthose multimillionaires, who have huge cartels that are growing as fast \nas the cartels did in Colombia a decade ago, and we put some of those \npeople in jail--whether it is Mexican jails or American jails--then at \nleast one-half of the equation of trying to get drug trafficking under \ncontrol is going untended. We are leaving a huge portion of it \nunattended and doing nothing about it.\n  Now, many of these requests, Mr. President, are for violent \nindividuals involved in the drug trade. They include the top leaders of \nfour major Mexican cartels. In the U.S., we get indictments, but the \nindictments are not worth the paper they are written on because the \nMexicans won't try these people in their own courts, and they will not \nhonor our extradition requests.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know that Mexican officials will say they are \ntrying, and they will say we must be understanding, and that they are \nhaving difficult times. Well, let me suggest that this Senator \nunderstands that. What I am trying to do with this amendment is to let \nthe Senate go on record saying to Mexico: Do something about it. Your \nfriend from the north, the United States, wants to be helpful. If you \nneed more help in terms of apprehending these criminals and trying \nthem, if you need more help from the executive branch of our \nGovernment, speak to us and ask us for it.\n  Obtaining indictments is a dangerous business when you are dealing \nwith drug lords and drug kingpins. In fact, last year, 140 Border \nPatrol agents were assaulted while apprehending illegal alien drug \nsmugglers. So you ask, why don't we do more on the border by way of \npatrols? Why don't we put more people there? I will tell you pretty \nsoon that we have done pretty well at putting in more. But 140 of these \nagents were assaulted while apprehending illegal alien drug smugglers. \nAll of this money has been spent in efforts needed to culminate in \nbringing these drug dealers to trial.\n  All of this is necessary if we are ever going to stop the drug trade. \nOnly after Senator D'Amato held hearings on this issue in the Banking \nCommittee in March did Mexico finally extradite its first national--\nactually he had dual citizenship--to the United States. Since then, \ndrugs have continued to invade our border, causing crime and despair. \nThe ``unextraditables,'' as the drug lords call themselves, live \ncomfortably. This is unacceptable. The situation at the border is \ngetting worse. Drug seizures used to be measured in ounces and pounds. \nNow they are measured in tons.\n  Several years ago, the smugglers cut the ranchers' fences and caused \nmischief at night. For anyone who has seen our border, it is a couple \nof strands of barbed wire that border between Mexico and America. In \nmany places, it is two single strands of barbed wire. There is Mexico \non one side and America on the other. Here is a rancher from Mexico on \nthis side and a rancher on this side.\n  Now, instead of just cutting fences and doing mischief at night, \nheavily armed Mexican drug gangs terrorize the ranchers in broad \ndaylight. Some of the ranchers have sold their ranches, according to \ninformation we have, to the gangs or to their front men.\n  Several years ago, an El Paso customs inspector was killed by a drug \nsmuggler who was running the border. More recently, a 12-year-old girl \nwas injured when a drug smuggler was trying to run through the border \ncrossing at one of the crossings in El Paso, TX. These smugglers now \nhave 18-wheelers and 727 jet airplanes. They own them, travel around in \nthem, in defiance of everyone.\n  Just yesterday, in the Washington Post, Ricardo Cordero Ontiveros, \nwho quit the Mexican attorney general's office, charged that corruption \nand inaction at the border had prevented key drug-related arrests. He \ncited two examples: an intentionally unacted upon case. Even though \nthere was a reliable tip, no action was taken, and they could have \ncaptured Ismael Higuera Guerreo, when he was in the community of Los \nCabos in Mexico. It was clear that he could have been arrested. He went \nunattended. He is the right-hand man of the Tijuana drug cartel run by \nBenjamin and Ramon Arellano Felix.\n  On another occasion, Mexican officials had been advised that a jet \ncarrying 20 tons of cocaine was going to land on an airstrip known to \nbe used by the drug dealers. The Mexicans knew about it ahead of time. \nIn addition, the plane was unable to lift off again after landing. But \nbelieve it or not, even after landing and being unable to take off, the \ncocaine was never intercepted.\n  Caro Quintero, who heads up the cartel at Guadalajara and is one of \nthe top ten most wanted, openly admitted on a Mexican radio program \nthat Mexican authorities ``don't find me because they don't want to. I \ngo to banks, I drive along the highways, I pass through military and \nFederal police check points, and it doesn't matter that they know me. \nEverybody knows me, and nothing happens,'' says this kingmaker.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment concerning Mexico, which I, \nunfortunately, believe should be added to this bill. I say \n``unfortunately'' because it is not often that I come to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate to criticize our neighbor from the south. Mexico has, \nin recent years, made tremendous progress on a number of issues \nconcerning its relationship with the United States. I believe we are \nstill quite appropriately called their best friends.\n  Northern Mexico is becoming, however, a land of laundered drug money, \nriddled with corruption and violence. I have been a longtime friend, \nand I don't cavalierly say these things. It bothers me greatly. It is a \ncountry with a young and vibrant population and has the potential for a \nreal future. But drug-driven cartels are threatening the very \nsovereignty of Mexico.\n  For many Mexican residents, the map of northern Mexico is determined \nby the frequently changing territories controlled by drug-trafficking \norganizations. There is one area where I believe there has not been \nenough progress, and that involves Mexico's failure to capture, \nprosecute, or extradite to the United States known major drug \ntraffickers under indictment in the United States.\n  This amendment--I read off the sponsors--would at least send a signal \nthat this concerns us greatly, not that we are trying to tell Mexico \nwhat to do, but essentially that we are worried. We hope the leaders of \nMexico are worried. We see what has happened to other countries, and it \nis going to happen to Mexico.\n  All this amendment does is prohibit the release of a small amount of \nmoney which was going to be appropriated under this bill. It says it \nwill not be released until they either turn over to the U.S. for us to \nprosecute, or until Mexico apprehends and prosecutes the 10 most-wanted \nof the already U.S.-indicted drug kingpins living in Mexico. This drug \ntrade is $100 billion a year as a business operation in Mexico.\n  The State Department estimates that Mexico supplies 20 to 30 percent \nof\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nthe heroin, 80 percent of the marijuana, and 70 percent of the cocaine \ncoming into the United States. One drug dealer reportedly makes $200 \nmillion a week from sales to the United States to our children across \nthis land. In my State of New Mexico, use of drugs by teenagers is \nskyrocketing because the two interstates transverse our State, and they \nare used as a communication link to take the cocaine and other serious \ndrugs from their border habitats across this land.\n  These cartels are like multinational companies with sophisticated \noperations that rival any of the Fortune 500. They have advanced \nnetworks of drug distribution channels. One drug baron is called ``The \nLord of the Skies'' because he has a fleet of 747's at his disposal. He \nis headquartered in Juarez, not far from my state.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Does the Senator really believe that the number of \noutstanding requests, 99 criminals, have been identified and indicted?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Some of these go back 3 and 4 years with these \nextraditions?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are longstanding.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is it not true that there has only been one Mexican-\nnational who has been extradited to this country out of all of those \nrequested?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. That happened after the hearings were \nheld.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That person was a child molester. It was right to send \nhim here. But none of the others who have been indicted for murder or \ndrug dealing--have any of them at all been extradited?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To our knowledge, statements that I made here would \nindicate that they have not--except for Juan Garcia Abrega who had duel \ncitizenship. I know of the Senator's genuine interest. I praise him for \nactually starting this. The Senator from New York started this in a \nhearing that had to do with the certification of Mexico a ``fully \ncooperating'' with the drug effort. They were certified by our U.S. \nDepartment of State. We did not succeed in not getting them \ndecertified. That was not the case. I am not here trying to do that. \nBut I think it is quite appropriate that the Senator from New York is \non the floor as this amendment is offered, because he has had great \nconcern about this issue.\n  I want to suggest to him and to those who are listening that as a \nborder State of New Mexico next door to Texas we are becoming the \nvictims of this drug wave from Mexico in ways you cannot believe. I \ntold you that our border is the barbed wire fence. There is evidence \nthat, in the State of Texas, the kingpins or their followers with their \nmoney are buying the ranches on the border so they will have a habitat, \na place of refuge, in America on an American ranch on the American side \nof the border. It is already tough to get rid of them and apprehend \nthem and to arrest them. What if they own the place?\n  I have asked that a serious investigation of that take place. I for \none recognize property rights. But it would not take much for me to be \nin favor of a statute that would take that land away from them. If we \ncan find any relationship to drug money, we ought to confiscate those \nranches under our forfeiture statutes. Those ranchers may have been \npaid. I do not know. It seems like some have been scared to death. But \nI believe they have been paid.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. With drug money?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With drug money. What else? They are there with that \nmoney all night long.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. In some cases they have paid many times the value.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We understand that there are, at least anecdotally, a \ncouple of stories around that they were paid much more than the value \nof the land. I do not see why they would not. That land is cheap. These \nranchers are in big trouble. As you know, we have had a drought. The \nprice of grain is very high. The cattle are at the lowest price in many \ndecades. So they are hurting financially. You put these drug smugglers \nand their threats on top of that financial burden to make these \nranchers really hurt and you do not have much life on that border.\n  In addition, in a city like Albuquerque, which is on the main \nhighway, an interstate to go east out of El Paso, TX, and Juarez, we \nare just literally feeling the pressure in many of our neighborhoods \nwhere gangs now all have drugs; where cocaine is everywhere. That is \njust the spillover in transit across America to probably get it up to \nNew York where they can sell a lot more of it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Seventy percent of the cocaine in the streets of America \ncome right through the passageway from Mexico that the Senator has \ndescribed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in 1993, GAO reported that Mexico had \nbecome the primary transit country for steering Colombian cocaine into \nthe United States.\n  These cartels are like multinational companies, with tremendously \nsophisticated operations that rival those of any of the Fortune 500. \nThey have advanced networks of drug distribution channels.\n  One drug baron is called the Lord of the Skies because he has a fleet \nof 747's at his disposal. He is headquartered in Juarez, not far from \nmy State.\n  Some estimate that the Mexican cartels budget close to a half a \nbillion dollars per year to pay bribes to corrupt officials, including \nofficials in the United States.\n  The wealth, combined with the violence inherent in the drug trade, \nhas proven deadly in Mexico and I fear that if these drug lords are not \nbrought to justice, the violence may spill over into the United States.\n  In Juarez, one young drug smuggler was found shot in the head 23 \ntimes--the victim of a violent attack carried out on the orders of one \nof the drug lords.\n  A recent Los Angeles Times story reported how wealthy Mexican drug \nsmugglers have intimidated ranchers and infiltrated police and \nsheriff's departments, drug task forces and even the court system on \nboth sides of the west Texas/Mexico border.\n  These last reports are particularly troubling to me, because my home \nstate lies just to the west of Texas and because citizens in New Mexico \nare beginning to see many of the same problems faced by their Texas \nneighbors.\n  Without an effective drug control and interdiction strategy involving \nhelp from the Mexican government, the 175 miles of shared Mexico/New \nMexico border can, and does serve as a huge segment of the pipeline \nthrough which illegal drugs flow into the United States.\n  According to the DEA, in the past 2 years, law enforcement officials \nseized over 60,000 pounds of marijuana, 3,000 pounds of cocaine and 51 \npounds of heroin at the major points of entry from Mexico into New \nMexico.\n  These numbers pale in comparison to the quantities of drugs which \nactually make it into the United States: law enforcement officials \nestimate that we stop only around 10 percent of the drugs that \nsmugglers bring to our borders.\n  One drug baron offered the police chief of Tijuana $100,000 per month \nto ``turn a blind eye'' to drug trafficking in that city. When the \nchief refused and instead got tough with these drug dealers, he was \nbrutally murdered on a highway in Tijuana.\n  In 1993, Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas-Campos was gunned down \nat the Guadalajara airport. Many believe that his murder was an \naccident, related to a feud between violent drug groups. The Cardinal \nhowever was an outspoken critic of the cartels, and some believe that \nhis murder may not have been an accident.\n  Congress has continuously funneled resources to the Southwest Border \nin an attempt to control drug smuggling, but without Mexico's \ncooperation, the United States cannot possibly control the flow of \ndrugs into the country.\n  Patrolling the border costs taxpayers a lot of money. Funding for the \nBorder Patrol has increased by $183 million or 42 percent in the last \nthree years. Congress has increased Border Patrol staffing to add at \nleast 700 new agents each year for the past 3 years and we now have \n5,253 border patrol agents in the field; 328 of those agents are on \nboard in New Mexico.\n  Despite this stepped-up law enforcement presence at the border, the \namount of drugs entering this country\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\nfrom Mexico continues to grow. As we all know, more drugs lead to more \ncrime.\n  A group which I helped establish, called New Mexico First, recently \npublished a report on crime in New Mexico. The report notes that the \n``common and recurring characteristic--of those committing crime in New \nMexico--is substance abuse.''\n  When President Zedillo was elected in 1994, he stated that drug \ntrafficking was the single greatest threat to his nation's security. \nThese statistics demonstrate that Mexican drug trafficking also is a \nthreat to our security.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will restrict a small amount of United \nStates aid to Mexico until the President certifies that Mexico has \neither extradited or prosecuted themselves, the DEA's 10 most wanted \nMexican drug kingpins.\n  The amount of aid to Mexico is not the issue here. What is at issue \nis whether Mexico will cooperate more completely with our attempts to \ncapture and imprison these drug barons.\n  I wish my colleagues would invite them to the border to better \nunderstand the situation. The drug cartels are well equipped. They have \nout planned, out manned, and outgunned the U.S. Border Patrol, Customs \nService and DEA.\n  The Clinton administration claims that one of its new drug policies \nis to attack drugs at their source.\n  While this is not a new idea, I would suggest that the best way to \nattack the source of drugs in the United States is to go after the \nmajor suppliers in the country which sends us the vast majority of our \nillegal narcotics.\n  There is no greater threat to our borders and our population than the \nthreat that drugs will continue to flow unimpeded into our country from \nMexico. This amendment goes right to the top of these drug cartels and \ncalls upon Mexico to get tough.\n  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly \nthose from border states, will join with me in support of this \namendment.\n  I want to say, so that anybody listening who might think that we are \nnot doing our part, that the U.S. Government has indicted these \ncriminals. That is not easy. That is costly. We put our best people on \nit. They take risks, and they get hurt.\n  We have dramatically increased our Border Patrol. This year, we will \nincrease it still more. But until some of them know they are going to \njail and their property confiscated, it is a losing battle. We cannot \nput up a fence between our two countries. It has never been there. It \nwill never work. But we surely can together cooperate in a new kind of \nfence--a fence of cooperation in terms of getting rid of the criminals.\n  This will not do much. Mexico can say, who cares about that little \nmillion dollars? I did not put $50 million in or $20 million of the aid \ngoing to them. I just said, let us give ourselves a little bit to hang \nthis on and let it be a signal, a message, to our friends. Let us try \nto put some of these people in jail.\n  My last admonition, before the Mexican officials react and say we \nshould not be doing this, I hope they understand that Americans are \nvery worried about the increase in drug use in this country. They are \nlooking around. They are going to be easily convinced that we should do \neverything we can on these borders in apprehension and trial of these \nkinds of people and we want Mexico to know that you cannot let yourself \nbe corrupted by it because it is going to destroy your country. We are \nreally not here as gringoes from the north trying to tell you what to \ndo. We are really trying to be helpful, and I hope it is taken in that \ncontext.\n  In any event, I hope we start seeing some trials or returns to \nAmerica for trial of some of these already known criminals who have \nbeen indicted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the debate on \nthis very important amendment.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me first say that I think it is \nobvious over the years that the senior Senator from New Mexico has \ndemonstrated repeatedly that he is one of the most discerning, \nknowledgeable, and thoughtful of all of our Members on both sides, and \nas the record indicates--not the rhetoric of Senator Domenici; the \nrecord--there has been no greater friend to the people of Mexico, no \ngreater friend. As a matter of fact, I attempted to get his support on \nsome legislation that I have proposed that would take tough action for \nthe inaction of the Mexican authorities in a number of cases, and the \nSenator felt it went too far, it was too harsh, that, indeed, these are \nour allies, these are our friends, these are our neighbors, the Mexican \npeople in particular.\n  There is no one who has greater empathy for the plight of those \nMexicans who are attempting to earn a living, and he has been \nsupportive in terms of making moneys and resources available to help \nthe Mexican economy. So I think it means that there is a point at which \neven the strongest of friends, the greatest of supporters must say to \ntheir friends and to their allies, ``You are not doing enough,'' and \nthat is what Senator Domenici's amendment says.\n  It does not act in a manner in which it could in terms of being much \nmore punitive, but it sends a signal--and it is an important signal, \nand it is about time that we say it to our friends, because we are \ntalking about friends--of one country recognizing the sovereignty of \nanother country and recognizing our responsibility as good neighbors \nand being there. This Congress of the United States was there, the \nPresident was there, Republicans and Democrats were there in Mexico's \ntime of need. I myself had great reservations, but my colleague said, \nno, it is important that we give to the Mexican Government and more \nimportantly to the people an opportunity to be able to pay their debts, \nto meet their obligation, to work their way out. There they were. There \nwas Senator Domenici, a supportive friend and ally.\n  But there comes a point in time when you have to say, how is it that \nyou can protect drug smugglers, criminals, people involved in killings, \nin murders, in the distribution of billions of dollars worth of cocaine \nand crack that is creating havoc in the streets of America? How can you \nas an ally protect these people?\n  Mr. President, we have 99 warrants outstanding and 110 people \nidentified over a period of 4 years, since 1992, and only one Mexican \nnational has been extradited. There are some who we could go into \ndetail about who prance around, who live openly without fear of \napprehension because the police and the Mexican Government in control \nof the various provinces, indeed, are part and parcel of the cartel--\nonly one attempt to extradite, only one attempt. And when they do go \nthrough some of the process, it is rigged. No successful extradition of \na Mexican national except one, when they heard of a hearing of the \nBanking Committee in March of this year. We say wonderful for that one. \nThat was a child abuser.\n  Talking about abuse of children, what is creating more havoc with our \nyoung people than the menace of drugs entrapping people?\n  The State Department by its own report says--this is not Senator \nDomenici or Senator D'Amato. This is the U.S. Department of State, \nBureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, \nInternational Narcotics Control Strategy Report, March 1996. Senator \nDomenici referred to part of that--page 140:\n\n       No country in the world possesses a more immediate \n     narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico.\n\n  I am not going to read the rest, because then it goes into detail and \ntalks about the tons and tons of drugs and we cannot get one of these \nMexican traffickers extradited. We have indicted them--killers, \nmurderers.\n  Let me give you the testimony of a border agent just this March, \ntestimony of a brave person, because there are some people who did not \nwant him to testify before our committee. Senator Feinstein and I had a \nhearing on proposals that would, yes, impact on Mexico because we do \nnot think our friend and ally is doing nearly enough. It is really \ngiving aid and comfort to killers, to terrorists, to people who are\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\nterrorizing our communities, to the drug lords.\n\n  This is the testimony of T.V. Bonner. He is the National President of \nthe Border Patrol Council, those people who are out there, the agents \nout there. Let me just read to you this little part of his testimony \nbecause this is real. This is what is going on. T.V. Bonner says:\n\n       On January 19, 1996, Border Patrol Agent Jefferson Barr was \n     shot and killed while intercepting a group of drug smugglers \n     in Eagle Pass, Texas. One of his assailants was wounded in \n     the exchange of gunfire. The individual fled to Mexico where \n     he was captured.\n\n  They captured him.\n\n       The FBI interviewed the suspect in a hospital in Mexico, \n     and the United States subsequently charged him with murder \n     and sought his extradition. The Government of Mexico has \n     refused to extradite the accused. Even though the United \n     States has an extradition treaty with Mexico . . ., not a \n     single Mexican national has been extradited to date, despite \n     numerous requests.\n\n  That is not totally accurate because when Senator Feinstein and I had \na hearing before the Banking Committee, the same day or the day before, \nthey announced: ``We are going to extradite someone,'' an unnamed \nperson. They would not even tell us who it was. We said, ``Who is it?'' \n``We don't know, but we are going to extradite someone.''\n  Now, what does it take to get the Mexican Government--and this is the \nMexican Government. This individual who shot and killed a U.S. border \nagent was arrested and yet we have not been able to get him extradited. \nHow outrageous.\n  I think this amendment of the Senator is so thoughtful. I believe we \nhave to go further. But at some point in time we have to say we are not \ngoing to continue to do business as usual. We have an obligation to \nprovide for domestic tranquility. Our country is failing miserably, \nRepublicans and Democrats, for years.\n\n  Oh, during every campaign we get more border agents, more this, more \nthat: Show business. After the campaign--I saw it happen in the last \nadministration and the administration before that--after the election \nis over everything is forgotten, the agents do not get the support, \nthey do not get the equipment, and it just dwindles down.\n  It has happened with this administration. We went from 100-plus \npeople in the White House working on international drugs and domestic \ndrugs down to nothing. Election time comes, they see on the scope that \nthis is an important issue, that drug use is up, so they bring in a \nrespected leader, General McCaffrey, terrific and respected, and I do \nnot want to demean him and his efforts, but we should not be part-time \nwarriors, fighting for domestic tranquility in our communities, to keep \nour streets safe.\n  We ought to be ashamed of ourselves for allowing the plight of \nAmericans, to be held captive in so many communities where they are \nafraid to go out, to take a walk in the park, to go to church in the \nmorning, to use mass transportation in off-peak hours because they may \nbecome a victim. And so much of it, 70 percent of it the FBI Director \nestimates, is powered by illegal drugs: 50 percent of the violent \ncrime. And here our ally is giving aid and comfort to drug dealers and \nkillers.\n  We could go into example after example. Because I think it is so \npoignant, although Senator Domenici referred to it I am going to take \nthe liberty of referring to it again, that is the article that appeared \nyesterday--yesterday. How prophetic.\n  This amendment, by the way, was prepared long before this article, \nlong before this article. How prophetic that it appeared in the \nWashington Post yesterday. Let me just read part of it. Listen to these \nwords:\n\n       It's a joke for the people of Mexico and for the people of \n     the United States who think Mexico is fighting drugs.\n\n  Do you know who makes that statement? The former agent in charge, \nRicardo Cordero Ontiveros. He was the former head of the National \nInstitute for Drug Combat branch in the border city of Tijuana.\n  Do you know what he said, the former head, because, you see, he would \nnot succumb to the payments that they offered him, he refused to turn \nhis head another way? This article goes on to report that at one point \nhe was told by his superiors: Why don't you keep quiet. Do you know how \nmany people want this job? Somebody is willing to pay as much as $3 \nmillion for this job that you have--$3 million. Then he was told you \ncould make $100,000 a month. Just keep quiet.\n  Let me go on. He says:\n\n       The only thing they are fighting for is to make them \n     disappear from the newspapers.\n       Brandishing official memos and tape recordings that . . . \n     proved his points, Cordero said that [the attorney general] \n     cut him off when he tried to present evidence.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Lozano told me that people would pay $3 million to have my \n     job. . .. He was so angry I thought he would hit me.\n\n  Here is what the attorney general's office says.\n\n       Mr. Cordero Ontiveros is obliged to prove the seriousness \n     of his allegations, not just to go to the news media. . ..\n\n  What do you think somebody does when the attorney general tells him \nto keep quiet, when the record demonstrates clearly we cannot get \nproven killers and murderers extradited when they actually have them in \ncustody of the Mexican Government? Our own border agents are wondering \nabout our commitment to this war when they see our U.S. agents being \nshot and killed and a total failure of our Government to be able to get \nour friends and our allies to cooperate and have the murderers and have \nthe drug dealers turned over.\n  I compliment Senator Domenici for his thoughtful amendment. I think \nit should serve as a harbinger of things we are prepared to do with our \nfriend and ally, unless they begin to treat us as friends; unless they \nbegin to respect us and our rights and the rights of our citizens and \nour youngsters who are being victimized every day as a result of their \nfailure to even enforce basic, fundamental law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Domenici's \namendment. This amendment would restrict all International Military \nEducation and Training [IMET] funds to Mexico until the Mexican \nGovernment extradites the leading drug trafficking figures hiding \nthere.\n  It is clear that there is a flood crossing our borders that threatens \nthe very health and lives of all Americans--a flood of drugs, crime, \nand money laundering. The source of that flood is Mexico.\n  At a joint Finance Committee and Senate International Narcotics \nhearing Senator Grassley held earlier this week, I brought the \ndeteriorating situation in Mexico to the attention of Secretary of the \nTreasury Robert Rubin. At that hearing I raised the issue of Mexican \ncooperation in apprehending and extraditing drug traffickers wanted in \nthe United States. I also questioned whether Mexico is really making \nany effort to enforce its own laws on official government corruption or \nif it is just spinning its wheels in endless prosecutions that never \nresult in convictions. I am expecting answers to the questions and more \nin the coming week as we hold another hearing on this issue.\n  The dramatic increase in drug trafficking from Mexico is one of the \nunfortunate by-products of NAFTA trade liberalization and our success \nin getting tough on drug smuggling in the Caribbean. Reacting to the \npressure of U.S. efforts such as ``Operation Gateway'' in Puerto Rico, \ndrug smugglers have found even greater access to the U.S. in Mexico. \nThe Mexican Attorney General has estimated that traffickers accumulate \n$30 billion in revenues each year. Mexican traffickers or their front \ncompanies have also purchased numerous ranches or Maquiladora plants in \nMexico and the United States to ferry drugs across the Rio Grande.\n  The impact is undeniable. Only ten years ago, almost no cocaine came \nacross the border from Mexico. Today, nearly 70 percent of all cocaine \ncoming into the United States passes through Mexico. Mexico also \nsupplies between 20-30 percent of the heroin consumed in the U.S. and \nup to 80 percent of the imported marijuana. In fact, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration [DEA] estimates that Mexico earns over $7 \nbillion a year from the drug trade, making illegal drugs Mexico's third \nlargest export to the United States.\n  The United States response to this escalating crisis has been \ninadequate. While the President talks tough on drugs and crime--backing \nit up in the\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\ncase of Colombia--when it comes to Mexico he has bent over backwards to \naccommodate failure. Based on mutual declarations of cooperation at the \nSummit of Americas and the limited success of Mexican and United States \nefforts to seize large drug shipments, President Clinton certified to \nCongress on March 1, 1996 that Mexico was ``fully cooperating'' with \nU.S. counter-narcotics efforts. This allowed $38.5 million in bilateral \naid to continue to go to the Mexican government in addition to the $20 \nbillion of U.S. taxpayer funds provided in the tesobono bail-out last \nyear.\n  Our good intentions and assistance have produced few results. \nMexico's efforts to eliminate corruption among government officials and \ncapture the worst drug offenders have produced thunder but no rain. To \ndate, there have been no convictions in the hundreds of ongoing \nprosecutions for corruption among officials in the Mexican Attorney \nGeneral's office. There has been little more success within the \nMinistry of Finance or federal police. Laws which have been on the \nbooks for years to end government corruption have been ignored while \nhundreds of cases have been thrown out of court over minor \ntechnicalities.\n\n  Even more glaring is the lack of a bilateral extradition treaty \nbetween the United States and Mexico. As of April 15, 1996, there were \n99 outstanding formal extradition requests by the United States to \nMexico involving 110 different individuals. Mexico has acted on only \none of these requests--that of Juan Garcia Abrego who is being held \nwithout bond in Texas in advance of his September trial. He faces a \nlife sentence. I have asked Secretary Rubin to provide detailed \ninformation on the current status of all the United States requests, \nespecially for members of the drug cartels that have been indicted in \nthe United States and are fugitives in hiding in Mexico--Denjamin \nArellano-Felix and his brothers Francisco, Ramon and Javier; Amado \nCarillo Fuentes; and, Miguel Caro Quintero.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to get tough with Mexico just as we did \nin the Caribbean. The United States must send a strong message to \nMexico that there are limits to our patience. We must continue to \nstrengthen our partnership to stop the drug trade. But we cannot \ncontinue to flail in endless investigations and prosecutions nor can we \ncontinue to allow criminals to avoid extradition to the United States \nto face judgment. We must ratchet up the pressure on the government of \nMexico to clean up this tide of drugs, crime, and official corruption \nor risk our neighbor becoming another Colombia.\n  This amendment by Senator Domenici provides that message. It provides \na targeted and flexible response to the building problems in Mexico. It \nalso serves notice that the Mexican Government must improve the \nenforcement of its laws and agreements. We must make clear that our \nrelationship cannot continue to be one where the United States gives \nand gives while Mexico takes and takes. This was not acceptable with \nColombia and it should not be with Mexico either.\n  Mr. President. If Congress and the President are really serious about \nkeeping Mexico from ``becoming Colombia'' and reducing international \ncrime and drug trafficking, we must take action now. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Domenici's amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Domenici and \nD'Amato in introducing the pending amendment. The United States has a \nstake in Mexico--as our neighbor, as a key trading partner, and as the \nrecipient of a $20 billion loan underwritten by American taxpayers. \nMexico's problems often become, in a very real way, our problems. No \nproblem affecting our two nations is more critical than drug \ntrafficking because it directly effects the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  At the same time, we must not forget that for many, many years, the \nU.S. State Department turned a blind eye to widespread drug corruption \nin Mexico. In its latest International Narcotics Control Strategy \nReport, the U.S. State Department admits that in 1995 ``endemic \ncorruption continued to undermine both policy initiatives and law \nenforcement operations'' in Mexico. The report adds that ``official \nMexican Government corruption remains deeply entrenched and resistant \nand comprises the major impediment to a successful counter-narcotics \nprogram.''\n  So, Mr. President, it is no surprise that Mexico is the gateway to \nthe United States for smuggling in massive amounts of cocaine and \nheroin. Mexico is also a major producer of methamphetamine, one of the \nmost dangerous drugs available. Many corrupt officials in the Mexican \nGovernment have long had an open door policy for the Mexican cartel \nkingpins, providing protection for a price. Mexican President Ernesto \nZedillo has made some positive gestures to combat drugs and drug \ncorruption, including appointing an Attorney General from the \nopposition PAN party and supporting money laundering legislation.\n  Nor is it a surprise that violent crime in the United States is \nincreasingly linked to drugs. The Justice Department estimates that \nover one-third of violent crimes are committed by people in illegal \ndrugs.\n  Regrettably, over the past 5 years, cocaine and heroin seizures in \nMexico, as well as arrests of Mexican drug traffickers, have dropped by \n50 percent. Seventy percent of cocaine enters the United States through \nMexico, all too often with the assistance of corrupt Mexican police \nofficers. Drug kingpins spend an estimated $500 million annually to buy \npoliticians and law enforcement officials. There are too many credible \nallegations that these officials assist kingpins' efforts to expand \ntheir power and conceal ill gotten gains. While Zedillo administration \nofficials may not be accomplices, they are supposedly responsible for \nthe investigation and prosecution of these drug traffickers and corrupt \nofficials.\n  Yet each year, in exchange for empty promises and well publicized \nanti-drug speeches, the U.S. administration certifies that the Mexican \nGovernment has ``cooperated fully'' in the war on drugs and continues \nto provide military equipment, technical assistance, and precious \nforeign aid.\n  Mexico is indeed our neighbor and a sort of business partner. The \nState Department is obviously nervous about offending Mexican \nGovernment officials by pushing them to take strong measures to fight \ndrugs and corruption. Foggy Bottom must get over its nervousness. The \nUnited States has no greater national interest than to protect the \nsafety and security of American people, especially the most innocent--\nour children and grandchildren.\n  It won't help either the Mexican or American people for the U.S. \nGovernment to make the tragic mistake of providing unrestricted \nassistance to a corrupt, morally bankrupt 67-year-old regime. This \namendment will send the message that we demand cooperation with the \nMexican Government--but real, effective cooperation, not more empty \npromises.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and the distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee in offering an amendment which I \nthink is of great importance.\n  As my colleagues know, the problem of drugs coming into our country \nfrom Mexico has reached epidemic proportions.\n  Seventy percent of all illegal drugs entering the United States, \nincluding three-quarters of all the cocaine and 80 percent of all \nforeign-grown marijuana, are smuggled through Mexico. Ninety percent of \nthe precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine are \nsmuggled into the United States from Mexico.\n  We need cooperation from Mexico in many aspects of counternarcotics: \nfrom border control, to cracking down on money laundering, to combating \ncorruption.\n  There has been some progress in these areas, but not nearly enough, \nand much more is needed. Perhaps the most basic area in which we need \ncooperation is in cracking down on the drug lords who run the smuggling \nrings. Mexican drug lords are getting rich poisoning our kids, and the \nMexican Government must help us do something about it.\n  That means extraditions. Although the United States has had an \nextradition treaty with Mexico since 1978, Mexico has never extradited \na Mexican national to the United States for drug charges.\n  Juan Garcia Abrego was not extradited--he was deported as an American\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\ncitizen. And extradition orders have been signed for one Mexican \nnational, Jesus Emilio Rivera Pinon, but he remains in a Mexican jail. \nNinety-nine outstanding formal extradition requests have not been acted \nupon.\n  This amendment is designed to create additional incentive for Mexico \nto move forward with the extradition of our most wanted drug lords. If \nMexico does not arrest them, they should at least arrest and prosecute \nthese drug lords themselves.\n  If Mexico fails to take these steps, the United States will withhold \nfunding for the International Military Education and Training Program \nwith Mexico. This is a reasonable, and not overreaching, point of \nleverage to encourage the Mexicans to do what they should be doing \nanyway.\n  If Mexico will comply with these extradition requests, it will be an \nimportant step toward addressing the problem of Mexican drug \ntrafficking.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you, \nMr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. If we are \nfinished, do we then proceed to a vote? What is the situation, I ask \nthe manager of the bill?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My plan is to lay aside the Domenici amendment and go \nto the Brown amendment. It is the plan to stack several votes. That we \nwould take them up, again this is just a guess, an estimate, around 6 \no'clock. It would be my plan. I understand no one wants to speak in \nopposition to the Domenici amendment. Has the Senator gotten the yeas \nand nays?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just summarize very quickly so no \none will think these indictments that the American Government has put \nall these resources in are just indictments of people who are out there \ndealing in a few ounces of cocaine. I want to give just four names, \nwith a brief biography, that are under indictment, that it is \nincredible to this Senator that Mexico does not know about and could \nnot, if willing, to either apprehend and try in Mexico or extradite \nthem to the United States.\n  Here is one:\n  Tijuana cartel, Arellano-Felix organization: Benjamin Arellano-Felix \nand his brothers Francisco, Ramon and Javier head Mexico's most violent \ndrug family. They are responsible for the murder of Catholic Cardinal \nJuan Jesus Posadas in Guadalajara in 1993. Some believe that the \nMexican Cardinal was killed by accident during a violent confrontation \nbetween rival drug dealers, but others believe he may have been killed \nbecause of his vocal opposition to the drug trade.\n  Let me move on to the Jaurez cartel:\n  Amado Carillo Fuentes is now considered the wealthiest and most \npowerful drug baron in Mexico. He has a strong relationship with Miguel \nRodriguez Orejuela, the leader of the Colombian Cali cartel. Carillo is \nknown as the ``Lord of the Skies'' because he owns a fleet of 727's \nwhich allows him to transport drugs from Colombia to Mexico. His drug \noperations are estimated to bring in $200 million a week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more complete biography of these \ncartel leaders be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLeaders of the Major Mexican Drug Cartels Indicted in the United States\n\n\n              tijuana cartel (arellano-felix organization)\n\n       Benjamin Arellano-Felix and his brothers Francisco, Ramon \n     and Javier head Mexico's most violent drug family. They are \n     responsible for the murder of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus \n     Posadas in Guadalajara in 1993. Some believe that the Mexican \n     Cardinal was killed by accident during a violent \n     confrontation between rival drug dealers, but others believe \n     he may have been killed because of his vocal opposition to \n     the drug trade. The Arellanos also are responsible for the \n     murder of Frederico Benitez Lopez, the Tijuana police chief \n     who vowed to clean up the city and refused to accept a \n     $100,000 per month bribe from the brothers. The cartel \n     controls the 1,000 miles of border between Tijuana and \n     Juarez. The DEA estimates that the cartel generates around \n     $15 million every two weeks and has a $160-400 million net \n     worth. The Arellanos, once known for publicly flaunting their \n     protection from local Mexican police and federales, now are \n     fugitives in hiding in Mexico. Benjamin and Francisco have \n     been indicted in San Diego for drug trafficking.\n\n\n              juarez cartel (carillo fuentes organization)\n\n       Amado Carillo Fuentes is now considered the wealthiest and \n     most powerful drug baron in Mexico. He has a strong \n     relationship with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the leader of \n     the Colombian Cali cartel. Carillo is known as the ``Lord of \n     the Skies'' because he owns a fleet of 727's which allows him \n     to transport drugs from Colombia to Mexico. His drug \n     operations are estimated to bring in $200 million a week. \n     Murders in Juarez have increased since he took control of the \n     organization, and in 1995 the leader of a juvenile gang \n     Carillo used to smuggle drugs across the border was found \n     shot 23 times in the head. Carillo is the nephew of Ernesto \n     Fonseca Carillo, who was imprisoned in Mexico in 1985 for the \n     torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena. \n     Carillo has been indicted in Miami for heroin and marijuana \n     trafficking, and in Dallas for cocaine distribution.\n\n\n               sonora cartel (caro quintero organization)\n\n       Miguel Caro Quintero now heads the group made up of \n     remnants of the old Guadalajara Cartel, best known for their \n     involvement in the brutal 1985 torture and killing of DEA \n     Special Agent Enrique Camarena. The Sonora Cartel was among \n     the first Mexican organizations to transport drugs for the \n     Colombian kingpins. The group's main trafficking routes run \n     through Arizona border area known as ``cocaine alley'' with \n     movements also coordinated through the Juarez Cartel in the \n     territory controlled by that organization. Caro Quintero \n     openly admitted on a Mexican radio program that Mexican \n     authorities ``don't find me because they don't want to . . . \n     I go to banks. I drive along highways, I pass through \n     military and federal judicial police checkpoints and it \n     doesn't matter that they know me--everybody knows me.'' \n     Miguel's brother Rafael is serving time in a Mexican maximum \n     security prison for his involvement in the Camarena murder, \n     but reportedly runs the cartel from jail. Miguel has been \n     indicted in Denver and Tucson on drug trafficking charges.\n\n\n                gulf cartel (Garcia Abrego Organization)\n\n       Juan Garcia Abrego was the first major Mexican cartel \n     leader expelled to the United States for trial. In January \n     1996, Mexico claimed that his dual U.S./Mexican citizenship \n     allowed them to deport him to the U.S. to face his \n     indictment. Mexico's government had offered a $1 million \n     reward for his capture, and the FBI offered an additional $2 \n     million. Members of Garcia Abrego's group remain in Mexico \n     and continue to smuggle narcotics. The Gulf Cartel was the \n     first to begin accepting payment from Colombian drug lords in \n     cocaine rather than cash and they at one time were \n     responsible for half of the cocaine entering the United \n     States from Mexico. The Gulf Cartel also shipped bulk amounts \n     of cash across the U.S. border and during a four-year period \n     (1989-93) the U.S. seized $53 million in cash belonging to \n     the organization. Two American Express bankers in \n     Brownsville, Texas were indicted for laundering $30 million \n     for Garcia. Garcia Abrego is currently held without bond in a \n     west Texas prison awaiting trial in September. If convicted, \n     he faces life imprisonment. Seventy members of his \n     organization have been prosecuted in the U.S.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, drugs are the engine of violence. \nAccording to the DEA, 50 percent of all violent crime happens because \npeople are on drugs. One-third of all homicides in the United States \nhave a relationship to narcotics. The relationship to this amendment, \n70 percent of the cocaine comes across from Mexico; 50 percent of the \nmarijuana, and much of the other substances that we fear so much. In \nfact, substantial amounts of Mexican-grown heroin is sold here.\n  In summary, we go through a great effort to indict Mexican drug \nkingpins and the indictments are not worth the paper they are written \non because 99 outstanding extradition requests, 110 individuals are \nunder indictment from us, and the Mexican Government will do nothing \nabout it so far.\n  Mexico is the safe haven for drug smugglers. Indicted drug lords live \nan open life in a notorious style, in many cases, in many parts of \nMexico. When the DEA Administrator was in Mexico in April, one of the \ntop three most wanted barons called in to a talk show and stated, as I \nhave said before: ``They don't find me because they don't want to. I go \nto banks, I drive highways, I pass through Federal judicial policy \ncheck points, and it doesn't matter.''\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\n  Mr. President, I hope this discussion today, and the vote, which I \nthink will be overwhelming, will indicate to Mexico we are gravely \nconcerned about our country and at the same time we are gravely \nconcerned about theirs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Domenici \namendment be temporarily laid aside. As I indicated earlier, it is my \nintention to take it up for a rollcall vote along with some other \namendments that have been laid aside, probably around 6 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, due to a failure to communicate, I did not \nconvey to the floor manager of the bill my very strong opposition to \nthe Dorgan amendment. The time was yielded back.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized for 5 minutes prior \nto the vote on the Dorgan amendment, which I feel is fatally flawed and \nwill have very serious consequences. I would like to have the \nopportunity to have appropriate time to address that amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I am happy to respond to a question of my friend \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is it not true that my amendment which would restore \nthe funding level for the international narcotics funding was seconded \nunder regular order?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding. It is my recollection that the \nSenator from Georgia came over last night and first offered the \namendment that would restore the drug funding level to the request of \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is correct. We have now, it is my understanding, \ndisposed of 24 amendments?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. There is an amendment which I have pending, but we \nhave been unable to get the other side to agree to a time for debate, \nwhich is holding up this amendment which restores their President's, \nour President's, funding for international narcotics.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Georgia, we had hoped that his \namendment would be first voted on this morning since he was first to \nthe floor last night to offer a very responsible amendment, which I \nhappen to support.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the response of the Senator from Kentucky \nand for, of course, his work on this bill and assistance on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following consideration \nof this amendment, my amendment No. 5018 be the regular order and that \nthere be a time agreement of 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nobviously, I do not object, but I do not see anyone on the Democratic \nside in the Chamber. In fairness to them, I feel they should be given \nan opportunity to respond.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Leahy, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5019\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think maybe it is appropriate, when we \nspeak about those countries that are responsible in large measure--and \nit is not countries, it is governments, corrupt governments, corrupt \nofficials who give aid and comfort to drug dealers, traffickers, \ngrowers, money launderers, the whole cartel--probably no case cries out \nfor this country taking action more than the nation of Burma on behalf \nof the people of Burma and on behalf of the citizens of my State and \nthe citizens of this country.\n  When we look at the record as it relates to drugs, in 1994, Burma was \nresponsible for 94 percent of the opium produced worldwide. It is \nestimated that 60 percent of the heroin that comes into the United \nStates originated in Burma.\n  When we look at the record of not only the question of narcotics and \nthe dismal record in terms of counternarcotics efforts, there is only \none thing that is even worse, and that is its record with respect to \nhuman rights. It kills those who are in opposition; it slaughters them. \nIt imprisons those who speak out against them.\n  Their record on human rights and counternarcotics and its refusal to \nlet the democratically elected National League for Democracy assume \noffice should be immoral, and, more important, it is immoral, but it \nshould be unacceptable to our Nation.\n  We need to send a strong message. Somehow we have become so imbued \nwith economics and what company is going to benefit and make more money \nthat we have lost the moral fiber to stand up for our citizens. I \nbelieve this. And I do not believe it is just the case as it relates to \nthe legislation we discussed sponsored by Senator Domenici with respect \nto Mexico. I don't think it is just Burma, but certainly this is a case \nthat cries out.\n  In 1988, the SLORC--SLORC--that stands for the State Law and Order \nRestoration Council. What a name; what a name. Talk about a fascist \nname. The State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, has one of \nthe most dismal records in human rights. They were responsible for \nkilling more than 3,000 prodemocracy demonstrators--3,000--and \nthousands more have been jailed, thousands more driven from their \nhomes, thousands more hiding. That is this SLORC group. Their record in \ncounternarcotics is one of total complicity with the drug lords and the \ngenerals--total complicity. That is where they earn a lot of their \nmoney.\n  But now we are supposed to be doing business with them, helping them, \nhelping their economy, helping their people. We are supposed to totally \nignore the fact that they don't help their people, that they enslave \ntheir people, that they kill their people, that they deny them free and \nfair elections and say, ``If we can allow projects to go there, it will \nfoster democracy.''\n  That was not fostering democracy when we took on the Soviet Union for \ntheir failure to address the human rights and human needs and \nconsiderations of its people. We did not say ``Let's give them most-\nfavored-nation status.'' We did not say, ``Oh, no, you can continue to \ndiscriminate against Jews and Catholics and Pentecostalists'' when the \nSoviet Union was engaged in that barbaric treatment of their citizens.\n  We said if a country doesn't respect its citizens, how do we ever \nexpect it to respect the rights of others, the rights of our citizens. \nHow quickly we forget. Incredible.\n  This country has lost the moral fiber that we don't even have the \nability to stand up to those countries who are sheltering known \nterrorists and killers who are responsible for killing U.S. citizens. \nWhy? The same reason: economics, greed, avarice.\n  ``So and so is developing a big project there. It's an American \ncorporation. If they don't do it, somebody else is going to do it.'' \nHow often we hear that.\n  Then, when we are able to unite the people of this country, we have \nto worry about our allies. We passed a bill, the Iranian-Libyan \nsanctions bill, that said, ``Listen, if you're going to help support \ntheir petroleum fields and they are going to continue to export \nterrorism''--and they have two people who we have indicted, two Libyan \nagents responsible for blowing a plane out of the air, Pan Am 103, we \nindicted them with specificity, Libyan agents, hiding in Libya. We \ncannot get them to turn them over here.\n\n  Yet, since 1988, when that tragedy took place, we didn't even have \nthe courage to stop the importation of Libyan oil. We said, ``We can't \nbuy Libyan oil, can't buy it,'' and we went around and pounded our \nchest. Well, we didn't do through the front door what we allowed the \noil man to deliver on the side or the back, because while we said U.S. \ncompanies can't do it, domestic companies, their foreign subsidiaries \ndid.\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\nThey did that with both the Iranians and Libyans.\n  What a mockery. What a sham. How do you expect our allies to pay \nattention to us when we say, ``We want you to join with us''?\n  It all comes down to the same thing, and maybe it takes a little \nlonger to get to the point, and the point is, it is nothing more than \ngreed, money and avarice, and, consequently, we have really allowed \nthose states, whether they are smuggling drugs in here, whether they \nare bringing terrorists with bombs in here, whether they are killing \nour citizens in planes or in bases, to feel that they can operate with \nimpunity, and we are not even going to take economic sanctions against \nthem.\n  Our allies: ``You will not allow our companies who do business with \nthe Libyans to do business here?'' Let me tell you, if we do not have \nthe moral fiber to stand up and protect the rights of our citizens, it \nis no wonder why the people are angry and frustrated with all of us--\nwith some of us even more--because they think it is all politics and we \nare not serious. In many cases, I think they are absolutely right. I \nreally do. I think they are right.\n  Business is important. Providing economic growth and opportunity is \nimportant. But freedom and liberty is more important. The human dignity \nof each and every individual and their rights to live without being \nterrorized, both in this country and abroad, are more important.\n  We should not be providing succor and comfort to those who deprive \nmillions and millions of people an opportunity to live free, an \nopportunity to be able to have their vote count and not just have some \ngroup, thugs by the name of SLORC, come in and take over whenever they \nwant.\n  We have a right to say to those countries who are involved in \nexporting terrorism, whether it be by way of bomb or whether it be by \nway of drugs, that we are not going to countenance doing business with \nyou as usual, and we are certainly not going to give you aid and \ncomfort, and we are certainly not going to permit you to have access to \nthe international money markets where U.S. citizens are participating \nin the international banks and say you can do business as if you are a \ngood and decent citizen, when you are not.\n  I support the moves that we are taking and that this bill calls for \nin dealing with the SLORC in Burma. I just think it is symptomatic of \nthe kinds of things that we have to do if we are really going to stand \nup and say that this Nation does make a difference, it does respect the \nrights of citizens, its citizens and others, to live in dignity and in \nfreedom.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I just want to commend the Senator from New York for \nhis observations about Burma. What is going on here, of course, is they \nhad a Democratic election in 1990, internationally supervised. The side \nthat won got 82 percent of the vote. And the State Law and Order \nCouncil locked up most of the leadership and put the leader herself \nunder house arrest for 5 years.\n  That is what is going on here. We fiddle around--not just this \nadministration, but the previous one--and have done nothing. As the \nSenator has pointed out, they have done absolutely nothing.\n  So the underlying bill calls for sanctions against Burma, something \nlong overdue. I want to commend the Senator from New York for his \nleadership on this issue for his support.\n  We have had a sort of disjointed debate here on the Burma issue, Mr. \nPresident, over the course of the afternoon. At some point I am going \nto ask unanimous consent that all of that debate be consolidated in the \nCongressional Record because it will be hard for the readers to follow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received today \nfrom the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, Office of \nthe Prime Minister, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, \n           Office of the Prime Minister,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: We understand that Senator Cohen \n     has introduced an amendment to your bill--Section 569 of the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, ``Limitation on Funds \n     for Burma.'' We have to reiterate our total support for your \n     version of the bill because it is the most and only effective \n     way of persuading the ruling military junta in Burma to enter \n     into a dialogue with the pro-democracy leaders.\n       If the U.S. Senate fails to vote for economic sanctions on \n     the junta as outlined in your bill, it will send a wrong \n     signal to Burma. The military junta will see it as a sign of \n     weakness on the part of the United States and encourage it to \n     step up the ongoing suppression of the democracy movement.\n       The National Coalition Government therefore opposes Senator \n     Cohen's legislation. The Senate cannot afford to send a wrong \n     signal. The imposition of economic sanctions is needed \n     because currently investments are only enriching the military \n     junta and its associates and are discouraging them to \n     negotiate with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the imposition of \n     economic sanctions because it is the best option available at \n     this moment. She understands Burma situation clearly and \n     would not initiate a move that would harm the people. Daw Suu \n     has categorically expressed her wish that investments in the \n     country cease until a clear transition to democracy has been \n     established. The National Coalition Government fully supports \n     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's call for sanctions and that is why we \n     have expressed our total support for your bill.\n       I look forward to welcoming U.S. businesses helping rebuild \n     our country once a democratically elected 1990 Parliament is \n     seated in Rangoon. The Burmese people will remember who their \n     friends are.\n       The National Coalition Government also opposes any funding \n     to the military junta in connection with narcotics control. I \n     cannot find myself to condone any funding to a regime that \n     plays an active role in providing a secure and luxurious life \n     to the heroin kingpin Khun Sa.\n       I place my trust in the United States Senate to do the \n     right thing. Each vote for sanctions is a vote for the \n     democracy movement in Burma and our people who are struggling \n     to be so desperately free.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Sein Win,\n                                                   Prime Minister.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, essentially what it says is:\n\n       If the U.S. Senate fails to vote for economic sanctions on \n     the junta as outlined in your bill--\n\n  Referring to the underlying bill . . .\n\n     it will send a wrong signal to Burma. . . . [It will] step up \n     the ongoing suppression of the democracy movement.\n       The National Coalition Government therefore opposes Senator \n     Cohen's [amendment].\n\n  Which we will be voting on later, which is supported by the Clinton \nadministration.\n\n       . . . currently investments are only enriching the military \n     junta and its associates and are discouraging them to \n     negotiate with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the imposition of \n     economic sanctions because it is the best option available at \n     this moment. She understands the Burma situation clearly and \n     would not initiate a move that would harm the people. . . . \n     The National Coalition Government fully supports Daw Aung San \n     Suu Kyi's call for sanctions and that is why we have \n     expressed our total support for your bill.\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado is on the \nfloor. He has an amendment to offer as well. We would like to take that \nup. Have we laid the Domenici amendment aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Domenici amendment is laid aside.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, before I offer my amendment, I simply want \nto express my strong appreciation to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky for his raising the question of the loss of rights in Myanmar. \nThe fact is, that the level of political suppression that has gone on \nthere is one that Americans cannot ignore. If we are to be true to our \nbeliefs, and true to our commitment to freedom and human rights that is \nheld so dearly by both parties, we cannot stand idly by.\n  I believe some Members have expressed concern that perhaps there \ncould be a different way to phrase the concerns that the Senator from \nKentucky has expressed. And I hope that we will have a debate on that, \nthat positive suggestions will come forward. Certainly we ought to use \ntactics that are most likely to be successful.\n  So some change in those words may be in order. But I hope that debate \nover the words does not lose sight of the intent and the very \nsignificance of the Senator from Kentucky's action. The\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\nfact is, we cannot stand idly by and ignore what has happened in that \ncountry and not stand up and speak out and take efforts that can be \neffective.\n  I believe that this subject will get a lot of debate. I suspect the \nconference committee may well come up with ways to amend the language \nthat we have here. But I want the Senator from Kentucky to know that \nfree people around the world appreciate his efforts, and appreciate him \ncaring enough to move forward to have this Congress consider sanctions. \nI, for one, will be looking forward to the process that may well \nperfect the language that the Senator has. But I hope it does not \ndilute the spirit of what he is offering because I think that is the \nessence of the way Americans think about foreign policy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5058\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the NATO Participation Act of 1994 to \n     expedite the transition to full membership in the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization of emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe.)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the bill. I \nsend the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Helms, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Specter, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Gorton, \n     Mr. Abraham, Mr. Stevens, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5058.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is the third in a series of efforts \nthe Congress has made to address the issue of NATO expansion. Today the \nhearts of tens of millions of Americans are with us. No, not physically \nhere in this Chamber, but they listen and they understand what we \ndebate when we talk about NATO expansion.\n  Millions of Americans find their heritage hailing from central \nEurope. Over the last century--I should say most particularly the last \nhalf-century--they have had to swallow hard as this Nation watched \nCzechoslovakia dismembered by the Munich agreements, which Chamberlain \nagreed with, and saw a country that could have been the bulwark against \nHitler and Naziism dissolved and abandoned by its allies.\n  Millions of American hearts sank as they saw Poland invaded by the \nNazis and, moreover, an agreement between the Soviets and the Nazis to \ndivide and dismember that country. Moreover, their hearts sank as they \nwatched the free countries around the world back away from promises and \npledges of support. And we learned the painful lesson in World War II \nthat one country's freedom is not independent of another country's and \nthat aggression cannot be ignored.\n  These are countries that now share our commitment to Democratic \nvalues. And many of them, as new converts, are passionate believers. \nBut the trail of history does not end with World War II. It follows \ninto the tragic period of after World War II where some of these \ncountries were abandoned, without an effort to save them from Soviet \ndomination. The level of suffering that they have endured has truly \nbeen extraordinary in humankind.\n  Now the question comes, with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end \nof the cold war, as to whether or not we will recognize that other \ncountries have a claim to control their foreign policy, that is, \nwhether other countries can cast their sphere of influence over central \nEurope and dictate to them their foreign policy. That is what this \nseries of amendments over 3 years with regard to NATO expansion has \ndealt with, the hesitancy of the administration to allow democratic \ncountries in central Europe who wish to join NATO to be allowed to join \nNATO.\n  These are countries that have democratized their country, that have \ngiven civilian control over the military, and have expressed an \ninterest and a desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with America and \nother countries in NATO, to make the world safe for democracy. The \nhesitancy that has come out of the administration has been as to \nwhether or not they should allow the government in Russia to cast its \nsphere of influence over the policy of those countries, whether or not \nwe would defer to Russia in terms of deciding whether they should be \nallowed to join NATO or not.\n\n  It was out of concern over this policy, that I believe to be \nmistaken, in which we offered the first NATO Participation Act in 1994. \nThat measure recognized their plea for NATO membership and authorized \nan assistance program to aid in their preparing to become Members of \nNATO.\n  The administration failed to act decisively concerning this issue, \nand in the following year we followed up with the NATO Participation \nAct of 1995 which develops specific criteria which those countries \ncould be judged as to whether or not they were prepared to join NATO \nand receive aid to help them further move toward it.\n  Mr. President, another year passed without the administration acting. \nAnd thus, the purpose of the third NATO Participation Act.\n  The measure that is before the Senate does the following things, Mr. \nPresident. First of all, it authorizes funds for transitional \nassistance for countries in central Europe wishing to join NATO. Mr. \nPresident, this is not a huge amount of money in terms of dollars in \nthe foreign assistance bill but it is an enormous issue in terms of the \nsignal we send to free people around the world. It specifically names \nthree countries that are eligible for transitional assistance in moving \ninto NATO. Now, that is not NATO membership, but it is transitional \nassistance to NATO.\n\n  Second, it establishes clear standards for other Central European \ncountries to meet to be eligible for transitional assistance. The \npurpose here was to take the thoughts of the administration and others \nand put them forward in clear rules so the countries who want to join \nfree people pledging to defend freedom in the North Atlantic region \nknow what they are working toward.\n  Third, Mr. President, it sets a clear policy statement for NATO \nexpansion.\n  Next, it establishes standards for an authorization, for a regional \nairspace initiative.\n  Mr. President, this is a measure that is bipartisan. It is strongly \nsupported by the administration. I might make clear that they strongly \nsupport the authorization for the regional airspace initiative. I do \nnot mean to imply they strongly support this amendment. The portion \nthat deals with the regional airspace initiative, which I believe can \nhave a significant value in helping countries develop a common language \nthrough equipment and procedures, in helping to deal with air traffic \ncontrol problems, can be of help. I should emphasize while this is not \nmandatory in terms of participation, it is supported by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, this is a bipartisan bill. We are fortunate to have \nSenator Simon join as a cosponsor of this bill, as well as Senator \nLieberman and Senator Mikulski. In the past, NATO expansion has \nreceived strong support from both sides of the aisle. I must say, Mr. \nPresident, I believe this measure is strongly supported by both \nDemocrats and Republicans throughout our country, by a large measure.\n  In addition, the House has voted on a version that is nearly \nidentical to this provision, and given its strong and clear support by \na vote of 353 to 62, the House voted for the similar NATO expansion \nprovision.\n  I might add, we have a stronger position in the White House for this \nmeasure than we have ever had. The administration has sent out a letter \nindicating they do not oppose this measure.\n  Mr. President, let me not mislead Members. I believe--it is at least \nmy belief--the White House has some concerns about various provisions \nof it. They are not opposing it. It is the strongest, most supportive \neffort we have had in these last 3 years. I believe the key to making \nthis work is indeed to get all parties--the administration, Congress, \nDemocrats, and Republicans--to work together for a common purpose.\n  Mr. President, there are some differences between this measure and \nthe measure that passed the House of Representatives. Let me just name \ntwo of\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nthem that may be the more significant, although I am not sure there are \nsignificant differences. In the findings, paragraph 15, in the wording \ninvolving the caucuses, ours is not as strong a language in terms of \nindicating a NATO involvement in the caucus as the House language. I do \nnot mean to indicate we lack interest in the caucuses, or concern. We \ndo, and we express that. There is a difference between our language and \nthe House language with regard to caucus States.\n  Second, we add in this bill specific criteria for the transition into \nNATO. We thought in the interest of being clear and precise and moving \nahead, that was helpful. Those are the key differences with the House \nbill. On the whole, they are not major. I do not anticipate any problem \nin working out the differences in conference.\n\n  I should indicate, Mr. President, there are at least three concerns I \nam aware of, and I know Members obviously are much more able to \narticulate their concerns and offer alternatives than I. Senator Simon \nis interested in offering a modification of the measure that deals with \nthe history of deployment of nuclear weapons in some NATO countries. I \nview--while we have not seen final language that Senator Simon offers--\nI view that as an accurate statement of the past policy, and can well \nbe a plus.\n  Senator Biden has concerns about making it clear that Slovenia is \nimmediately eligible for the transitional assistance in the measure \nthat is before the Senate. We have not placed them in the three \ncountries that are designated as immediately eligible for assistance, \nbut I think Senator Biden has identified a country that does meet the \nstandards, as I understand them. I do not consider that to be a major \nproblem.\n  In addition, my understanding is that a very thoughtful Member of the \nSenate, Senator Nunn, has concerns, particularly with paragraph 4 in \nthe findings, and my hope is we will be able to consider his concerns \nand work something out with regard to that.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to take an extended amount of time with \nregard to this except to say this: What we do with this amendment is \nvery important. The symbolism is far more important than the modest \namount of money that is authorized in this bill. The message it sends \nis that the countries of Central Europe are not going to have their \nfate decided by the influence of another country; that their fate will \nnot be decided by someone saying that they have a sphere of influence \nthat controls that part of the world; that we recognize their ability \nto commit themselves to free and democratic principles, and to seek \nalliances that will help secure their land. That is enormously \nimportant, and it is a commitment that we should not back down on.\n  Second, Mr. President, I hope every Member has some sense in their \nheart and in their mind and in their very being how these countries \nhunger to be free and independent and how much they look to the United \nStates with admiration, and, yes, with love and with commitment. They \nsee America as a country that has held up the torch of freedom and \nliberty, and they want to join us. They want to join us in the burden \nof holding that torch of freedom high. They want to join us in making \nsure the world is safe for democracy.\n  If we turn our backs on them, we turn our backs on the very ideals \nthat made this country strong and free and independent. Can we turn our \nbacks on Central Europe's freedom? Of course, it has happened before. \nBut who among us would come forward saying that turning our backs on \ntheir freedom worked prior to World War II or worked after World War \nII? My guess is every Member would have to admit that those were \nfollies of policies, that the world lost millions of lives because we \nfailed to recognize how much their yearning for freedom was tied to \nours.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is offered in the hope we will not \nrepeat the mistake of the past, that we will respect their admiration \nand their desire to stand with us, and that we will continue the clear \nsignal that we care about their freedom and their future.\n  I welcome the debate on this issue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Georgia wants \nto speak on this issue, but my preference would be, and I consulted \nwith Senator Leahy on this as well, to dispose of some agreed-to \namendments. I have also consulted with the Democratic leader, who would \nlike to have a couple of votes shortly because he must be absent from \nthe Senate around 6:30.\n  It would be my plan, I say to my friend from Georgia, just for his \ninformation, to have votes on the Hatfield-Dorgan amendment and the \nDomenici amendment beginning at 5:50, and then we would go back to the \npending amendment of Senator Brown, on which I know the Senator from \nGeorgia wishes to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Brown amendment be temporarily laid \naside.\n  Mr. NUNN. Reserving the right to object, I do not mind laying aside \nthe amendment and going ahead with the votes, but I would like to make \na brief statement of 2 or 3 minutes, outlining my concern here on this \namendment before we vote.\n  Beyond that, if that is accommodated, I do not object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was going to suggest the Senator from Georgia go \nright ahead.\n  Mr. COHEN. I want to inquire in terms of when we intend to proceed to \nvote on my amendment. Is it following the resolution of the Brown \namendment, at some time later this evening?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. COHEN. At what point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Maine, I want to just make a \nfew more remarks about his amendment, and I am not aware of any \nspeakers, other than I assume he would like to close on his own \namendment, but we will need to do that after we dispose of these.\n  Mr. COHEN. I understand that. We will dispose of the other two \namendments. There was no indication how long the Brown amendment may \ntake this evening. I am just trying to find out whether or not we----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Brown amendment is controversial, then we will \nmove on with Burma. We will lay Brown aside and dispose of Burma and go \nback to Brown for whatever discussion may be forthcoming.\n  Mr. COHEN. All right.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 5059 Through 5065, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send seven amendments to the desk, en \nbloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendments, en bloc, numbered 5059 through 5065.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5059\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding expansion of \n eligibility for Holocaust survivor compensation by the Government of \n                                Germany)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n  sense of congress regarding expansion of eligibility for holocaust \n           survivor compensation by the government of germany\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) After nearly half a century, tens of thousands of \n     Holocaust survivors continue to be denied justice and \n     compensation by the Government of Germany.\n       (2) These people who suffered grievously at the hands of \n     the Nazis are now victims of unreasonable and arbitrary rules \n     which keep them outside the framework of the various \n     compensation programs.\n       (3) Compensation for these victims has been non-existent \n     or, at best, woefully inadequate.\n       (4) The time has come to right this terrible wrong.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress calls upon the \n     Government of Germany to negotiate in good faith with the \n     Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany to \n     broaden the categories of those eligible for compensation so \n     that the injustice of uncompensated Holocaust survivors may \n     be corrected before it is too late.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5060\n\n     (Purpose: To allocate funds for commercial law reform in the \n             independent states of the former Soviet Union)\n\n       On page 117, line 14, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated under this heading $25,000,000 shall be \n     available for the legal restructuring necessary to support a \n     decentralized market-oriented economic system, including \n     enactment of necessary substantive\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\n     commercial law, implementation of reforms necessary to \n     establish an independent judiciary and bar, legal education \n     for judges, attorneys, and law students, and education of the \n     public designed to promote understanding of a law-based \n     economy''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5061\n\n(Purpose: Urging continued and increased United States support for the \n     efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia to bring to justice the perpetrators of gross violations of \n              international law in the former Yugoslavia)\n\n       Findings. The United Nations, recognizing the need for \n     justice in the former Yugoslavia, established the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``International Criminal Tribunal'');\n       United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 of May 25, \n     1993, requires states to cooperate fully with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal;\n       The parties to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina and associated Annexes (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Peace Agreement'') negotiated \n     in Dayton, Ohio and signed in Paris, France, on December 14, \n     1995, accepted, in Article IX, the obligation ``to cooperate \n     in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other \n     violations of international humanitarian law'';\n       The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed to as \n     Annex 4 of the Peace Agreement, provides, in Article IX, that \n     ``No person who is serving a sentence imposed by the \n     International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and no \n     person who is under indictment by the Tribunal and who has \n     failed to comply with an order to appear before the Tribunal, \n     may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or \n     other public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina'';\n       The International Criminal Tribunal has issued 57 \n     indictments against individuals from all parties to the \n     conflicts in the former Yugoslavia;\n       The International Criminal Tribunal continues to \n     investigate gross violations of international law in the \n     former Yugoslavia with a view to further indictments against \n     the perpetrators;\n       On July 25, 1995, the International Criminal Tribunal \n     issued an indictment for Radovan Karadzic, president of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration of Pale, and Ratko Mladic, \n     commander of the Bosnian Serb administration and charged them \n     with genocide and crimes against humanity, violations of the \n     law or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949, arising from atrocities perpetrated \n     against the civilian population. Throughout Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in \n     Sarajevo, and for the taking of United Nations \n     peacekeepers as hostages and for their use as human \n     shields;\n       On November 16, 1995, Karadzic and Mladic were indicated a \n     second time by the International Criminal Tribunal, charged \n     with genocide for the killing of up to 6,000 Muslims and \n     Srebrenica, Bosnia, in July 1995;\n       The United Nations Security Council, in adopting Resolution \n     1022 on November 22, 1995, decided that economic sanctions on \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) \n     and the so-called Republika Srpska would be reimposed if, at \n     any time, the High Representative or the IFOR commander \n     informs the Security Council that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serb authorities are failing \n     significantly to meet their obligations under the Peace \n     Agreement;\n       The so-called Republika Srpska and the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have failed to arrest and \n     turn over for prosecution indicted war criminals, including \n     Karadzic and Mladic;\n       Efforts to politically isolate Karadzic and Mladic have \n     failed thus far and would in any case be insufficient to \n     comply with the Peace Agreement and bring peace with justice \n     to Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       The International Criminal Tribunal issued International \n     warrants for the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic on July 11, \n     1996.\n       In the so-called Republika Srpska freedom of the press and \n     freedom of assembly are severely limited and violence against \n     ethnic and religious minorities and opposition figures is on \n     the rise;\n       It will be difficult for national elections in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina to take place meaningfully so long as key war \n     criminals, including Karadzic and Mladic, remain at large \n     and able to influence political and military developments;\n       On June 6, 1996, the President of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal, declaring that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia's failure to extradite indicted war criminals is a \n     blatant violation of the Peace Agreement and of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions, called on the High \n     Representative to reimpose economic sanctions on the so-\n     called Republika Srpska and on the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Servia and Montenegro); and\n       The apprehension and prosecution of indicted war criminals \n     is essential for peace and reconciliation to be achieved and \n     democracy to be established throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate finds that the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     merits continued and increased United States support for its \n     efforts to investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators \n     of gross violations of international law in the former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the President of the \n     United States should support the request of the President of \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     for the High Representative to reimpose full economic \n     sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Servia and \n     Montenegro) and the so-called Republika Srpska, in accordance \n     with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1022 (1995), \n     until the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Servia and \n     Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb authorities have complied with \n     their obligations under the Peace Agreement and United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions to cooperate fully with \n     the International Criminal Tribunal.\n       (c) It is further the sense of the Senate that the NATO-led \n     Implementation Force (IFOR), in carrying out its mandate, \n     should make it an urgent priority to detain and bring to \n     justice persons indicted by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal.\n       (d) It is further the sense of the Senate that states in \n     the former Yugoslavia should not be admitted to international \n     organizations and fora until and unless they have complied \n     with their obligations under the Peace Agreement and United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions to cooperate fully with \n     the International Criminal Tribunal.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise on a matter of some urgency. \nSeveral colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, and I, have \nintroduced an amendment which we hope will advance the twin causes of \npeace and justice in the former Yugoslavia. I thank my co-sponsors, \nSenator Lugar, Senator Biden, Senator Specter, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Hatch, Senator Levin and Senator D'Amato, for \njoining in what is, and must be, a bi-partisan effort to bring indicted \nwar criminals to justice. It should now be apparent that we cannot \ndivorce peace from justice in this traumatized region. To fail to \naddress fundamental issues of justice in the former Yugoslavia, and \nBosnia in particular, will mean the certain failure of the current \ninternational efforts to secure a lasting peace in the region.\n  I will explain why the problem is one requiring urgent attention in a \nmoment. Let me first summarize the problem and the solutions required.\n  The problem is that progress in the rebuilding of Bosnia has been \nslow at best. This slowness is, in part, due to the slowness in \novercoming the antagonisms engendered throughout a tragic war and the \neffect of the creation of ethnic areas. Nevertheless, the majority of \nBosnian peoples of all ethnic affiliations, desperately seek peace and \naccommodation. Bosnia had been a relatively unified, multiethnic state, \nwith extraordinarily high percentages of interethnic marriages, prior \nto the manipulative actions of power hungry nationalist leaders during \nthe late 1980's. It can again become a multiethnic state, if those \nseeking to build civil institutions and a civil society are allowed to \ndo so by those initially responsible for these antagonisms and \ndivisions.\n  The problem, then, is simply stated: those attempting to build a \ncivil society with functioning democratic institutions, are being \nprevented from accomplishing their mission. The prerequisites for such \na development include fundamental protections of human and minority \ngroup rights, and the rule of law.\n  But how can these conditions be achieved while war criminals are \nroaming freely in and out of the Bosnian Federation? Gross violations \nof law, such as the support and direction of snipings and massacres of \ninnocents, have made Karadzic and Mladic war criminals. The underlying \nphilosophies which guided those actions continue to drive these men \ntoday. Institution-building, a task that many Bosnians are working \ndiligently towards, is imperiled by the very xenophobic, ultra-\nnationalist criminals that contributed to the dismantlement of Bosnia \nin the first place.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the recent efforts of Ambassador Holbrooke \nto reduce the deleterious effects of war criminals that are allowed to \nfreely impact on Bosnian politics. This is a substantial accomplishment \nthat will do much to help us reach our ultimate goal. However, the \nsigned statement in which Radovan Karadzic has agreed to remove himself \nfrom the political life of the country, is not the final end we must \nseek. Let's not forget the reasons\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\nwe call for the apprehension of these war criminals. Support and \ndirection of indiscriminate snipings of men, women and children during \nthe long, agonizing, siege of Sarajevo, as well as, the unspeakable and \ncalculated acts of genocide at Srebenica, in which men were \nexterminated and buried in mass graves, underline the reasons for the \nnecessity of this resolution. Recent discoveries of the mass graves in \nSrebenica, with the grueling sight of twisted bodies, a sight not scene \nin Europe since the liberation of Dachau and Auschwitz, will ensure \nthat antagonisms will remain alive so long as justice is hindered by \ntimidity. No peace can survive in this torn land as long as justice is \nnot achieved. The freedom of these criminals is an insult, a wound to \nthose hundreds of thousands of people who lost relatives or who were \nforcibly removed from their homes during the war. That the future peace \nof the region should depend on the word of war criminals with a track \nrecord for breaking promises, seems an absurdity; surely fellow \nBosnians will view the situation that way when elections arrive in \nSeptember.\n  Now, let me be clear, Mr. President, that the Bosnian people bear the \nbrunt of the responsibility for putting their house in order. Yet, they \nneed help in this process. We have provided that help, both with a \nmilitary component, the NATO-led Implementation Force, or IFOR, and the \ncivilian reconstruction effort, led by the High Representative, Carl \nBildt. Let us remember that the peace agreement forged at Dayton, that \nled to this peace mission, was done for two reasons: One, because it is \nan important U.S. interest that we control the conflagration that \ncould, and still can, spread to our allies in Europe; and Two, because \nthe costs of our intervention are reasonable, given the benefits, and \nthe intervention is politically and militarily feasible.\n  But, as I said, the intent of our mission in Bosnia, the intent \nshared by many peace-seeking Bosnians, is being contravened by war \ncriminals who are continuing to poison the politics of the region. Our \npurpose in Bosnia remains a national interest that can and should be \npursued. However, we are failing to implement the peace plan hammered \nout at Dayton. We are failing to execute a plan that provides for \nfeasible solutions. By so doing, we are guaranteeing a failure for \ninstitution-building in Bosnia. By allowing the virtual free reign of \nwar criminals, we are not adhering to agreements we made which were \ndesigned to achieve success. This leaves Bosnians at the mercy of \ncriminals and undermines confidence in the law. The results, to date, \nare obvious: refugees are unable to return to their homes, freedom of \nmovement is severely limited due to a continuing solidification of \nethnic camps within the country, and the conditions for free and fair \nelections are non-existent. Mr. Cotti, the OSCE Chairman, confirmed \nrecently that conditions for a free and fair vote do not exist.\n  Mr. President, here then is my first reason for pressing the urgency \nof this issue. With elections scheduled for September 14, we have \nlittle time to reverse this situation. The first task to reversing this \nsituation must be the apprehension of war criminals, most notably the \nformer President of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Radovan Karadzic, and \nthe Bosnian Serb General, Ratko Mladic. The tools for effecting their \napprehension are available to us at minimal cost. We are not asking for \nhouse-to-house searches by IFOR troops to apprehend these war \ncriminals. All that we are demanding is that IFOR has as one of its \nprimary missions, the apprehension of indicted war criminals in the \nconduct of its many routine patrols. Despite administration claims to \nthe contrary, troops on the ground continue to confirm that \napprehending war criminals is not a priority actively sought by \nmilitary members on the ground. Apprehension of these war criminals is \nnot only a prerequisite for success of peacekeeping in the country, it \nis a requirement of the signatories of the peace accord.\n  Apprehension of the war criminals is, then, our first task because \nnone of the other conditions required for peace in Bosnia, that I have \ndiscussed, can be addressed while the criminals remain influential. \nDespite their two indictments for genocide and crimes against humanity, \nby the International Criminal Tribunal, as well as, the issuance of \ninternational arrest warrants by the Tribunal, Karadzic and Mladic have \ncontinued to control or influence the organs of government, the media, \nas well as, party politics and party competition. They do not need to \nhold formal positions of power to exercise this influence. In this \nsituation, moderates seeking peace continue to place their lives at \nrisk. Certainly, the politics of a free people, with freely organized \nand competing parties, is impossible under these circumstances.\n  Mr. President, we have the capabilities for shaping the peace in \nBosnia. The need to shape conditions for the upcoming elections is an \nurgent one. This urgency has been proclaimed by a recent letter of \nPresident Clinton written by Human Rights Watch. This excellent letter \nstates quite eloquently the necessity for immediate apprehension of the \nwar criminals. More importantly, this letter has 72 signatories. The \ngroups that have signed on to this letter are diverse, including, \nAmnesty International, B'nai B'rith, and Doctors of the World.\n  My second reason for pressing the urgency of pursuing war criminals \nlies in the threat to U.S. and NATO credibility as our threats are made \nand then ignored. These recent occurrences are very reminiscent of the \nfailure of previous peace efforts that spoke loudly but carried a \nlittle stick. The costs of failed prestige, however, are significantly \nhigher. Now, it is the resolve of the U.S. and NATO that is on the \nline. It is essential both to NATO's long term future, as well as, the \nsuccess of the Bosnian mission, that the NATO-led IFOR not become a \npaper tiger as did its predecessor, UNPROFOR. U.S. leadership and \ncredibility are also directly impacted by the actions and reactions in \nBosnia. The United States threatened to reimpose sanctions on Belgrade \nunless Karadzic and Mladic were removed from power by the end of June. \nAnother deadline has come and gone, and we are again failing to follow \nthrough on our threats. What might have emerged from the recent G-7 \nsummit as a powerful statement with respect to apprehending war \ncriminals in Bosnia, instead became a replay of U.S. credibility being \nsnubbed by thugs in Bosnia. We hope that another snubbing is not soon \nto follow Ambassador Holbrooke's efforts, although I am not hopeful.\n\n  The final reason that I am pressing this issue as one requiring \nurgent attention is that apprehension of the war criminals is the \nstrategic action required, at this time, which can determine whether \npeace in Bosnia will be fleeting or long-lived. Mr. President, I fear \nthat if we do not act now on the issue of apprehension, our forces will \nhave been sent to Bosnia for naught. Elections, with the current mix of \nethnic-based politics, will only solidify opposing camps bent on ethnic \nexclusion. Further conflict over ethnic enclaves will certainly ensue. \nTragically, any uncertainties on this issue will almost certainly \nembolden the ultra-nationalists to set up their terror campaigns \nagainst dissenting, moderate voices. The greatest irony of all could be \nthat we intervened for peace only to ensure that ethnic based divisions \nbecame not only more solid, but also legitimated by the very elections \nthat we insisted upon.\n  A Washington Post editorial stated the problem well. Referring to the \nrecent disregard of IFOR and the High Representative by Karadzic, the \nPost has this to say:\n\n       Recall that peace was not meant simply to consolidate and \n     extend ``ethnic cleansing,'' a process that carries with it \n     the confirmation of massive injustice and the prospect of \n     further war. It was meant to open a path back to a multi-\n     ethnic federal Bosnia. The Karadzic taunt is taking Bosnia \n     exactly the wrong way. It is making the would-be peacemakers \n     in and out of NATO, not least Clinton, bit players in a \n     Karadzic-led charade.\n\n  Mr. President, we can assist in the creation of conditions for free \nand fair elections. Eliminating the taunts from the ``Karadzics'' and \nthe ``Mladics'' of Bosnia is the first step. And, no new initiatives \nneed be diplomatically crafted. We must insist upon enforcement of our \nagreements made at Dayton. Security Council Resolution 1031 charged \nIFOR with ensuring compliance with the Dayton agreement, which includes \na requirement that all parties cooperate with the Tribunal. Article 29 \nof the Tribunals' statute sets forth the various forms of cooperation \nthat are due, including ``the identification and location of persons,'' \n``the arrest or detention of persons,'' and ``the\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\nsurrender of the transfer of the accused to the International \nTribunal.''\n  That said, the resolution that my colleagues and I have put forward \nis designed to see that our international agreements are enforced. It \ncalls for four actions, each of which has already been agreed upon in \nother international fora. First, it calls for the increased and \ncontinued U.S. support for the efforts of the International Criminal \nTribunal to investigate and bring to justice war criminals. Second, it \ncalls for support by the United States for economic sanctions on the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia and the so-called Republika Srpska \nunless those regimes comply with their obligations to apprehend the war \ncriminals. Third, it calls on the signatories to Dayton and those \nguided by the relevant U.N. resolutions, to exercise their authority to \nbring the war criminals to justice. Finally, it calls for the \nprohibition of the offending parties, specifically the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia and the so-called Republika Srpska, from admission to \ninternational organizations and fora, until these parties comply with \ntheir obligations under the Dayton Peace accord.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator \nLieberman for his initiative in once again calling to the Senate's \nattention to the problem of the continued freedom of indicted war \ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia, by offering this amendment to the \nForeign Operations bill expressing support for the efforts of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. Although I have some \nquestions and concerns about how certain portions of this amendment \nwould be implemented, especially with respect to the NATO-led \nImplementation Force's (IFOR) detention of indicted war criminals, I \nsupport the part of this amendment which calls for reimposition of \neconomic sanctions on the so-called Republika Srpska and the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia unless and until certain war criminals are \ndelivered to the War Crimes Tribunal. For too long, we in the West have \nallowed these indicted war criminals and their allies to thumb their \nnoses at those who would bring them before the bar of justice. That \nmust not continue.\n  All of the signatories to the Dayton accord agreed to meet certain \nobligations, one of which was to ensure full and effective \nimplementation of the agreement ``to cooperate in the investigation and \nprosecution of war crimes and other violations of international \nhumanitarian law.'' That obligation must be borne squarely by the \nFederal Government of Yugoslavia. So far, even in the face of recent \nintense pressure from U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic has \nrefused to budge on this question, and to apply sufficient pressure on \nhis Bosnian Serb allies to allow these war criminals to be arrested and \nbrought to the tribunal to face charges.\n  On two separate occasions since July of last year, the International \nCriminal Tribunal issued indictments for Radovan Karadzic, former \nPresident of the Bosnian Serb administration of Pale, and Ratko Mladic, \nmilitary commander of the Bosnian Serb administration, charging them \nwith genocide and crimes against humanity, as well as numerous other \ncharges outlined in the amendment. Each time, the so-called ``Republika \nSrpska'' and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have failed to arrest \nand turn them over for prosecution.\n  Most recently, just 2 weeks ago, the War Crimes Tribunal re-issued \ninternational arrest warrants for Karadzic and Mladic, charging them \nwith genocide and other crimes against humanity. This time, the \nwarrants authorized their arrest if they cross any international \nborder, and are again based on substantial credible evidence of their \ninvolvement in initiating and/or overseeing some of the worst \natrocities of the war.\n  In my view, it is virtually impossible for free and fair national \nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina to take place in September as long \nas key war criminals, including Karadzic and Mladic, remain at large \nand able to influence political and military developments. Although I \nacknowledge and commend the effort by Mr. Holbrooke earlier this month \nwhich resulted in the agreement to remove Karadzic from office--which \nhopefully will at least remove him from involvement in the political \nprocess once and for all--the fact that Mladic was not subject to this \nagreement, and that both Mladic and Karadzic remain free and able to \ninfluence events there remains a serious problem. As Mr. Holbrooke \nhimself observed, the agreement he was able to reach fell far short of \nwhat he was seeking, and far short of the steps necessary to fully \ncomply with the Peace Agreement which the U.S. is seeking.\n\n  This amendment acknowledges that the Dayton signatories on the Serb \nside have ignored their key responsibilities, by refusing to bring \nindicted war criminals to justice, and calls for several steps to force \nthat action. I believe the most prudent course of action is to \nreinstitute economic sanctions in response to the failure of the \nsignatories of the Peace Agreement to detain these individuals, and \nconvey them to the Hague. That is the most substantial leverage we now \nhave in the West over these people, and it is time to use it.\n  After careful consideration, almost a year ago I supported the \nparticipation of U.S. peacekeepers in the NATO peacekeeping mission in \nBosnia. I did so because I believed then and I believe now that the \nDayton Agreement was the best, and probably the last, chance for peace \nin the region. Although not yet fully implemented, it has proven to be \nsuccessful in stopping a brutal civil war and given the parties a \nchance to recover, rebuild their cities and rebuild their nations.\n  But even though we have played a key role in developing and carrying \nout this agreement, let us not forget one critical thing: this is their \nagreement, not ours. It was developed by the parties, not imposed by \noutsiders. They have asked other nations, including the U.S., to help \nsecure the future of that agreement. And by signing the agreement, they \nassured us, NATO, and the UN Security Council that they will respect \nits terms. The Serbs have failed to fulfill their commitments on war \ncriminals, and that failure requires a tough response.\n  Bringing indicted war criminals to justice is a centerpiece of the \npeace process. Continued failure to bring Mladic and Karadzic before \nthe International Criminal Tribunal will seriously hinder the ability \nof the parties to conduct free and fair elections in September, by \nallowing these war criminals to remain as the focal point for \nnationalist fervor and attention, and by allowing them to influence \nevents there. We must increase the pressure on those who would seek to \nundermine the peaceful future of the former Yugoslavia. This amendment \nshould help, however modestly, to do that.\n  I join Senator Lieberman in his call to support the request of the \nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal to reimpose full \neconomic sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and on the so-\ncalled Republika Srpska, in accordance with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions. These sanctions should remain in place until \nBosnian Serb authorities have fully complied with their obligations \nunder the Dayton accord to cooperate fully with the International \nCriminal Tribunal. For those who take seriously the rule of law, the \nobligations of justice, and the judgments of history, there is no other \nresponsible alternative but to finally bring these indicted war \ncriminals to justice.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5062\n\n   (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on the delivery by the \n         People's Republic of China of cruise missiles to Iran)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n    sense of senate on delivery by china of cruise missiles to iran\n\n       Sec. 580. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) On February 22, 1996, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence informed the Senate that the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China had delivered cruise missiles to \n     Iran.\n       (2) On June 19, 1996, the Under Secretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security Affairs informed Congress \n     that the Department of State had evidence of Chinese-produced \n     cruise missiles in Iran.\n       (3) On at least three occasions in 1996, including July 15, \n     1996, the Commander of the United States Fifth Fleet has \n     pointed to the threat posed by Chinese-produced cruise \n     missiles to the 15,000 United States sailors and marines \n     stationed in the Persian Gulf region.\n       (4) Section 1605 of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation \n     Act of 1992 (title XVI of Public Law 102-484; 50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note) both requires and authorizes the President to impose \n     sanctions against any foreign government that delivers cruise \n     missiles to Iran.\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     immediately halt the delivery of cruise missiles and other \n     advanced conventional weapons to Iran; to\n       (2) the President should enforce all appropriate United \n     States laws with respect to the delivery by that government \n     of cruise missiles to Iran.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last November, Vice Admiral Scott Redd, \nCommander of the United States Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf, \nrevealed that Iran had begun developing an integrated ship, submarine, \nmissile, and mine capability in the Persian Gulf. The missile component \nwas to be a new type of Chinese-made cruise missile--known as the C-802 \nmissile. It is an anti-ship cruise missile. It is about 20 feet long, \nhas a range of 75 miles and carries a 350 pound warhead. This is a low \nflying, turbojet-powered, cruise missile. This is a highly advanced \nconventional weapon in every sense. It can evade radar and will make \nany missile offensive launched by the Iranian Navy difficult to track. \nAt that time, it was reported that these missiles would be deployed on \npatrol boats, also provided by China. In addition, news reports \nindicated that Iran was seeking a land-based version of the C-802 from \nChina.\n  In January, Admiral Redd reported that Iran had test fired a C-802 \nmissile. The Admiral noted that this new weapon, in the hands of the \nIranians represented a ``new threat dimension'' to the many tankers and \nships that use the Persian Gulf as a commercial shipping lane, and of \ncourse, to the 15,000 Americans--sailors, marines, and airmen--in the \nPersian Gulf.\n  Last February 22nd Dr. John Deutch, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the \nintelligence community ``continues to get accurate and timely \ninformation'' on ``cruise missiles to iran.'' And, on June 19 \nUndersecretary of State Lynn Davis--the State Department's senior non-\nproliferation official--told the House International Relations \nCommittee that the federal government has ``evidence\" that Chinese \ncruise missiles are in Iran.\n  So, Mr. President, there is no doubt that Chinese cruise missiles are \nin Iran. Further, I do not expect anyone would disagree with Admiral \nRedd's assessment that these advanced weapons represent an immediate \nand real threat to our interests and most important, to our fellow \nAmericans in the Gulf.\n  Mr. President, in 1992 Congress passed the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\nproliferation Act of 1992. It is commonly known as the Gore-McCain \nact--for the honorable former Senator from Tennessee, now Vice \nPresident of the United States; and the distinguished senior senator \nfrom Arizona. Their legislation calls for very severe sanctions against \ncompanies and countries that knowingly transfer advanced conventional \nweapons to Iran. ``Knowingly'' is not at issue here; nor is there a \nquestion of whether a cruise missile is an advanced conventional \nweapon.\n  The Sense of the Senate amendment I have offered along with my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is very simple. \nIt merely calls on the Chinese authorities to cease deliveries of \ncruise missiles to Iran. Second, it calls on the President to enforce \nthe law. Nothing more.\n  Frankly, action from the Administration is long overdue. After \nAdmiral Redd reported the test firing last January, I and three of my \ncolleagues--the distinguished Chair of the Banking Committee, Senator \nD'Amato; the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Mack; and the \ndistinguished Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Specter--\nsent a letter to the President, urging that the Gore-McCain law be \nenforced. Simply put, we urged the President to impose sanctions, or \nwaive them if he deemed that necessary. That letter was dated January \n31, 1996--nearly 6 months ago. The President has not taken any action \nin response to this letter. I will ask unanimous consent later that a \ncopy of this letter to President Clinton appear in the record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n\n  Our letter apparently was not the first call for action. According to \na story that appeared in the Washington Times on February 10, 1996, the \nPentagon recommended to Undersecretary of State Davis that the Clinton \nAdministration declare China in violation of Federal law for exporting \nadvanced cruise missiles to Iran. When was that recommendation made? \nLast September--10 months ago.\n  I have been quite outspoken about Chinese weapons proliferation \nactivities this past year. Sadly, there has been too much to talk \nabout. I referred earlier to the testimony by Director Deutch last \nFebruary. In his testimony, Director Deutch noted that the People's \nRepublic of China also had transferred nuclear technology and M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan--both sanctionable offenses under Federal law. The \nM-11 transfer, in particular, is quite disturbing because the Clinton \nadministration obtained a written agreement from China in September \n1994, which stated that China would cease transferring ballistic \nmissiles and related technology to Pakistan. Finally, this week, it was \nreported that China may have transferred ballistic missile guidance \nsystems to Syria, which if true would be sanctionable under Federal law \nas well.\n  This is quite a track record of proliferation, Mr. President. It is a \ntrack record that is fostering instability in South Asia and the Middle \nEast. It is a track record that has put the lives of our troops in the \nregion in even greater danger. Congress has provided the tools for the \nExecutive Branch to punish weapons proliferators. Our Nation's non-\nproliferation policy is based on a simple premise: proliferation \ncarries a heavy price. Yet, even with this track record, the \nadministration has yet to take any action, or impose any price against \na nation that is providing cruise missiles to a terrorist nation.\n  Mr. President, recently Congress sent to President Clinton the Iran \noil sanctions act. I know my good friend from New York, Senator \nD'Amato, has worked very hard on this legislation. He is to be \ncommended for his efforts. I hope the President will sign it.\n  Clearly, if we are going to get tough on those who buy Iranian oil, \nwe should get even tougher on those who sell advanced cruise missiles \nto the Iranians. We owe that to our friends and allies who utilize the \nPersian Gulf to further their commercial interests. Most important, we \nowe that to Admiral Redd and all of our fine men and women serving our \ncountry in the Persian Gulf. That's why we should pass this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I mentioned earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: It has come to our attention that Iran \n     recently test-fired a new, low-flying cruise missile. This \n     missile was identified as a C-802 anti-ship missile, which is \n     produced by the People's Republic of China (PRC). If that is \n     the case, we believe sanctions may have to be imposed against \n     the appropriate parties in the PRC pursuant to federal law. \n     This warrants your immediate attention.\n       As you may know, today's New York Times reported that the \n     Iranian Navy test fired a C-802 cruise missile from the \n     northern Arabian Sea on January 6, 1996. Vice Admiral Scott \n     Redd, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fifth Fleet, \n     stated that the C-802 adds a ``new dimension'' to Iran's \n     military capabilities against free shipping in the Persian \n     Gulf. This mobile missile can evade radar and will make any \n     missile offensive launched by the Iranian Navy difficult to \n     track.\n       Mr. President, Title XVI of the Fiscal Year 1993 Department \n     of Defense Authorization Bill contains the Iran-Iraq Non-\n     Proliferation Act. This act provides for sanctions against \n     any persons and countries respectively, that transfer certain \n     advanced conventional weapons to Iran. The act also defines \n     advanced conventional weapons to include ``long-range \n     precision-guided munitions'' and ``cruise missiles.''\n       Clearly, Admiral Redd's acknowledgement of the C-802 test-\n     firing would appear to be an official recognition of an \n     illegal transfer to Iran of advanced conventional weapons by \n     Chinese defense industrial trading companies. Please inform \n     us as soon as possible of your intention either to enforce \n     the sanctions pursuant to federal law, or to seek a waiver.\n       Thank you for your attention to this vital national \n     security matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry Pressler.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Alfonse D'Amato.\n     Connie Mack.\n\n\n[[Page S8803]]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5063\n\n  (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on delivery by China of \n                 ballistic missile technology to Syria)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\nSENSE OF SENATE ON DELIVERY BY CHINA OF BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY TO \n                                 SYRIA\n\n       Sec. 580. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Credible information exists indicating that defense \n     industrial trading companies of the People's Republic of \n     China may have transferred ballistic missile technology to \n     Syria.\n       (2) On October 4, 1994, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China entered into a written agreement with the \n     United States pledging not to export missiles or related \n     technology that would violate the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime (MTCR).\n       (3) Section 73(f) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2797(f)) states that, when determining whether a foreign \n     person may be subject to United States sanctions for \n     transferring technology listed on the MTCR Annex, it should \n     be a rebuttable presumption that such technology is designed \n     for use in a missile listed on the MTCR Annex if the \n     President determines that the final destination of the \n     technology is a country the government of which the Secretary \n     of State has determined, for purposes of section 6(j)(1)(A) \n     of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.

Mr. President, the amendment I have offered along with \nmy friend and colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is very simple. \nI offer it in response to recent reports that China has shipped \nballistic missile technology to Syria. This was first reported in the \nJuly 23rd edition of the Washington Times. I'm sure all my colleagues \nagree that this is a very serious allegation. It is the latest dark \nchapter in what certainly is a troublesome year for nonproliferation \nadvocates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Times \nstory just mentioned be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Specifically, our intelligence sources noted that last \nmonth a defense industrial trading company--the China Precision \nMachinery Import-Export Corp.--delivered military cargo to the \nScientific Studies and Research Center in Syria.\n  China Precision Machinery is to missile production what McDonald's is \nto burger production. In fact, the United States had imposed sanctions \ntwice against China Precision Machinery--in 1991 and 1993. In 1993, the \nfirm shipped M-11 ballistic missile technology to Pakistan--a violation \nof the so-called Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR. The MTCR \nsanctions were lifted 1 year later after China promised the United \nStates it would not export M-11's or related technology. If the Syrian \nmissile deal proves to be true, it would represent a clear violation of \nboth the MTCR and the 1994 agreement.\n  The Syrian firm that was reported to have received the cargo is the \nheart of Syria's efforts to produce ballistic missiles, and other \nadvanced conventional arms. The firm is reported to be building a \nversion of the Scud C ballistic missile. If Syria has received M-11 \nrelated technology, that would represent a significant technological \nupgrade in Syria's ballistic missile capability. No doubt, it would \ndestabilize a region struggling to achieve peace.\n  Our weapons proliferation laws are based on a simple premise --\nproliferation carries a price. Traditionally, sanctions under the MTCR \nare imposed only after a clear determination has been made that a \nspecific violation has taken place. However, in 1994 Congress passed \nlegislation I sponsored that would lower the standard of proof when a \nsuspected transfer goes to a nation that supports international \nterrorism. Clearly, any MTCR violation is very troublesome--to the \nUnited States and the other 30 nations that are co-signers of the \nagreement. However, our law is clear--when missiles or missile \ntechnology are being sent to a terrorist country, far more swift action \nis necessary. In that case, the President need not wait for conclusive \nevidence--he can impose sanctions and compel the sanctioned country to \ncome forward to prove it has not violated the MTCR.\n\n  The reason for this lower standard is obvious--we need to be far more \naggressive to ensure ballistic missiles and related technology do not \nfall into the hands of terrorist elements.\n  Let me make clear that the amendment I have offered today does not \nmake any firm conclusions about the reported transfer from China to \nSyria. It simply makes three key points: First, it is in our Nation's \nnational security interest to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles \nand related technology to Syria; second, it calls on China to honor its \n1994 agreement not to export missiles or related technology that would \nviolate the MTCR; and third, it calls on the President to exercise all \nlegal authority to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles and related \ntechnology to Syria. That's all my amendment calls for, Mr. President. \nI'm sure all of my colleagues would agree with each of those points. \nI'm sure my colleagues will agree that the MTCR agreement and the laws \nwe pass to enforce it mean nothing unless enforced vigorously.\n  I'm sure my colleagues also would agree that any effort by Syria to \nexpand its ballistic missile capability represents a direct and clear \nthreat to our friend and ally, Israel. Just as important, it could \nthreaten current efforts to achieve a lasting, secure peace in the \nregion. The people of Israel know all too well what it feels like to be \non the receiving end of a ballistic missile attack. The people of \nIsrael looked to us to stand by them during the Gulf War to withstand \nthe Scud assaults on their country. We did stand by them.\n  The Gulf War is now a memory, but the threat and reality of a \nballistic missile attack remains. We should still stand by Israel. The \nbest way we can do so is to enforce the MTCR agreement--to ensure that \nthose who engage in missile proliferation will pay a heavy price. \nThat's what my amendment calls for.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 10, 1996]\n\n             CIA Suspects Chinese Firm of Syria Missile Aid\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       The Chinese manufacturer of M-11 missiles sent a shipment \n     of military cargo to Syria last month that the CIA believes \n     may have contained missile-related components, agency sources \n     said.\n       The CIA detected the delivery to Syria early in June from \n     the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corp., described \n     as ``China's premier missile sales firm.''\n       The suspect military delivery raises questions about \n     China's pledge to the United States in 1994 not to export \n     missiles or missile components that would violate the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime.\n       It also follows China's recent export of nuclear-weapons \n     technology to Pakistan in violation of U.S. anti-\n     proliferation laws, which was disclosed by The Washington \n     Times in February.\n       The Syrian company that received the Chinese cargo was \n     identified as the Scientific Studies and Research Center, \n     which conducts work on Syria's ballistic missiles, weapons of \n     mass destruction and advanced conventional arms programs, the \n     CIA said in a classified report circulated to senior U.S. \n     officials.\n       The Syrian center is in charge of programs to build Scud C \n     ballistic missiles and a program to upgrade anti-ship \n     missiles.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies said the Syrian center has \n     received help from the China Precision Machinery Import-\n     Export Corp. in recent years for both missile programs.\n       ``The involvement of CPMIEC and the Syrian end user \n     suggests the shipments [last month] are missile-related,'' \n     one source said.\n       The exact nature of the equipment was not identified, but \n     it was described as ``special and dangerous,'' the source \n     said.\n       CIA and State Department spokesmen declined to comment.\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\n       Chinese officials promised the State Department in 1994 not \n     to export M-11s or their technology in exchange for a U.S. \n     agreement to lift sanctions against Chinese Precision \n     Machinery and the Pakistani Defense Ministry, which were \n     involved in M-11-related transfers.\n       The missile-control agreement bars transfers of missiles \n     and technology for systems that travel farther than 186 miles \n     and carry warheads heavier than 1,100 pounds. Transfers of \n     both the Chinese M-11 and Syria's Scud C are banned under the \n     accord.\n       Syria has purchased Scud C missiles in the past from North \n     Korea and is working on developing production capabilities \n     for them, according to U.S. officials.\n       The delivery of Chinese missiles or components to Syria, if \n     confirmed, would trigger sanctions against China because \n     Syria is classified by the State Department as a state \n     sponsor of international terrorism.\n       William C. Triplett, a China specialist and former \n     Republican counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, said the administration does not need hard \n     evidence to impose sanctions because the sales involved \n     Syria.\n       A 1994 amendment to the Arms Export Control Act, sponsored \n     by Sen. Larry Pressler, South Dakota Republican, says the \n     president may presume a transfer violates the 31-nation \n     missile-control agreement if it goes to a nation that \n     supports terrorism.\n       ``If it goes to a terrorist country, we consider that a \n     much more significant event than if it goes some other \n     place,'' Mr. Triplett said.\n       China Precision Machinery already is under intense scrutiny \n     within the U.S. government over the earlier M-11 sales to \n     Pakistan.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies concluded earlier this year that \n     Chinese M-11s are operational in Pakistan, but the State \n     Department is challenging the intelligence conclusion to \n     avoid having to impose sanctions on China.\n       U.S.-China relations have been strained over Beijing's \n     proliferation activities, as well as disputes concerning \n     human rights and widespread copyright infringement.\n       In May, the Clinton administration decided not to impose \n     sanctions on China for violating U.S. anti-proliferation laws \n     with sales of nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan because \n     Chinese officials claimed they did not know the sale took \n     place.\n       China Precision Machinery has been slapped with U.S. \n     economic sanctions twice in the past. The Bush administration \n     in 1991 sanctioned the company, which is part of the official \n     Chinese government defense-industrial complex, for selling \n     missile technology to Pakistan. Sanctions also were imposed \n     in 1993, again for the transfer of M-11 technology.\n       Kenneth Timmerman, director of the consulting firm Middle \n     East Data Project, said the Syrian center that received the \n     June shipments from China is a major agency involved in \n     weapons research, procurement and production.\n       Mr. Timmerman said that North Korea and China have helped \n     to build two missile-production centers in Syria and that \n     Syrian missile technicians have been trained in China.\n       Israel's government said in 1993 that Chinese technicians \n     were working in Syria to develop production facilities for \n     missile-guidance systems, according to Mr. Timmerman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5064\n\n  (Purpose: To treat adult children of former internees of Vietnamese \n  reeducation camps as refugees for purposes of the Orderly Departure \n                                Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\nRefugee status for adult children of former vietnamese reeducation camp \n        internees resettled under the orderly departure program\n\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering reinstates the \neligibility for resettlement in the United States of the adult married \nchildren of Vietnamese reeducation camp detainees.\n  Last April the State Department declared that the unmarried adult \nchildren of reeducation camp detainees would no longer be considered \nfor derivative refugee status under the Orderly Department Program \n[ODP]. In short, it said these people, roughly 3,000 people, would be \npermitted to come to the United States only under worldwide refugee \nstandards and that any special obligation we may have had to them had \neffectively been fulfilled. The amendment I am offering corrects this \nby once again making them eligible under the ODP. It has been evaluated \nby the Congressional Budget Office, and I am informed that it will have \nno significant budgetary impact.\n  The amendment has the support of the Catholic Conference and Refugees \nInternational. I ask unanimous consent that letters from these \norganizations supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               International Rescue Committee,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to express the \n     International Rescue Committee's deep appreciation for your \n     amendment to H.R. 3540 which reinstates refugee status to \n     adult children of former reeducation camp prisoners in the \n     Orderly Departure Program.\n       Since 1989, about 150,000 former prisoners and their \n     families have successfully resettled in the United States \n     through the ODP. However, in April 1995, the Department of \n     State announced that adult unmarried children of former \n     prisoners would no longer be permitted to accompany their \n     parents to the U.S. Since then, approximately 3,000 unmarried \n     adult children of former prisoners have been stripped from \n     existing cases and denied resettlement. Their parents, former \n     reeduction camp prisoners, waited years for their casework to \n     be processed and relied on the promise of refuge for their \n     entire family. Now these former prisoners are being asked to \n     leave their children behind to an uncertain fate.\n       Your amendment represents a just and practical approach to \n     this group of refugees. These refugees need their adult \n     children to help them resettle successfully; they are older \n     and some are not in good health. Their children would help \n     make their resettlement economically, as well as emotionally, \n     viable.\n       The IRC fully supports your efforts to overturn this \n     arbitrary and unfair policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert P. DeVecchi,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Migration and Refugee Services,\n\n\n                             Office of the Executive Director,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the United States \n     Catholic Conference, I would like to express our deep \n     appreciation for your ongoing support for the Indochinese \n     refugee program. We support your Amendment to H.R. 3540 which \n     reinstates derivative refugee status to the unmarried adult \n     children of former reeducation camp prisoners. Alleviating \n     the suffering of those imprisoned for aiding the purposes of \n     the United States in Vietnam has made the former re-education \n     camp prisoner program the core of the Indochinese refugee \n     program.\n       Since completion of negotiations with the Vietnamese \n     government in 1989, about 150,000 former prisoners and their \n     families have successfully resettled in the United States. \n     However, in April 1995, the Department of State announced \n     that adult unmarried children of former prisoners would no \n     longer be permitted to accompany their parents to \n     resettlement. This arbitrary change in policy affects \n     approximately 3,000 adult children, many of whom remained \n     unmarried in order to qualify to accompany their parents. \n     This inhumane decision to force apart long suffering families \n     should not be allowed to taint the final stages of this \n     dignified program.\n       Your Amendment, which restores the original policy, is not \n     only just but also represents practical resettlement policy, \n     as the aging former prisoners would have a much better \n     possibility of establishing an economically viable family \n     unit if their unmarried adult children were permitted to \n     accompany them.\n       Thank you again for your commitment to this special group \n     of refugees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Swenson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Refugees International,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your Amendment to H.R. \n     3540, to reinstate refugee status to adult children of former \n     internees. Granting refugee status to family members, \n     especially unmarried adult children, who are vulnerable to \n     persecution, has\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n     been, and continues to be, of utmost importance. Refugee \n     status is the only way to include these children into the \n     Orderly Departure Program. Since its establishment in 1975, \n     the program has allowed 150,000 prisoners and their families \n     to resettle here successfully. When the Department of State \n     changed the eligibility criteria of this program, it \n     jeopardized the possibility of U.S. resettlement for \n     thousands of former prisoners and their families. By \n     reinstating the established U.S. policy allowing for the \n     resettlement of former prisoners with their married, adult \n     children, the successful resettlement of these former \n     prisoners might become a reality.\n       Approximately 3,000 unmarried adult children of former \n     prisoners have been stripped from existing cases and denied \n     resettlement since April 1995. Many of these children have \n     remained unmarried to qualify for resettlement together with \n     their parents and siblings. These children would suffer from \n     the persecution they would undoubtedly face in Vietnam; \n     meanwhile, their parents would once again be victimized. \n     After waiting years for their casework to be processed and \n     relying on the promise of refuge for the entire family, these \n     former prisoners are now being asked to leave their children \n     behind to an uncertain fate. Furthermore, these former \n     prisoners need their adult children to help them resettle \n     successfully; they are older and some are not in good health. \n     Their children would help make their resettlement \n     economically, as well as emotionally, viable.\n       By pressing to reinstate the former U.S. policy allowing \n     reeducation camp internees to resettle with their adult, \n     unmarried children, you have taken a step forward to help a \n     truly vulnerable group.\n       Thank you for your continued interest in the plight of \n     these and all Indochinese refugees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Lionel A. Rosenblatt,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under current policy, since the change, Vietnamese \nnationals who are able to establish that they were imprisoned for the 3 \nyears in Vietnam as a result of their connection with the Republic of \nVietnam or the United States war effort in Vietnam are admitted to the \nUnited States as refugees. Permitted to accompany them are their \nspouses and unmarried sons and daughters under the age of 21.\n  However, in many cases, these former prisoners have only adult \nchildren and have suffered so terribly from their imprisonment or are \nof sufficient age that they require their assistance. From the \ninception of ODP until last April, this situation was accommodated, as \nwas the imperative to keep families together, by allowing adult \nunmarried children--over the age of 21--to immigrate with them to the \nUnited States.\n  The State Department has cited several reasons for removing their \neligibility. Among those listed in a letter to me were: First, the \nassertion that the sons and daughters of former prisoners no longer \nface persecution as a result of their parents' association with the \nformer South Vietnamese government. Second, the persistent problem of \nfraud associated with claims. Third, and the need to complete \nresettlement of the current case load in order to bring the program to \na close and into conformity with worldwide refugee procedures.\n  I would like to make my case for this amendment in part by addressing \nthese points one at a time.\n  On the first point, the assertion that ``there is no evidence that . \n. .  the adult children of former detainees are subject to official \npersecution based on their parents' association with the former South \nVietnamese government,'' I should point out that the new State \nDepartment report on human rights, which covers the time period in \nwhich this decision was made, does cite a limited degree of \ndiscrimination encountered by these families.\n  On the second point, the problem with fraud, I believe fraud has \nalways been a problem in administering U.S. immigration policy or any \nother Government program. The fact is that the world is still brimming \nwith people who want to make a better life for themselves in the United \nStates, and many times they will say and do whatever it takes to \nachieve their dream. It is the task of our immigration policy to \nidentify fraud and disqualify intended immigrants appropriately. The \nexistence of fraud, however, is no reason to exclude an entire class of \nprospective immigrants who merit consideration. This seems to me very \nunfair to those with legitimate claims. If the existence of fraud is a \nreason to shut down a class of eligibility, I am not sure any \nimmigration program on the books could pass muster.\n  On the third point, the need to bring the ODP program to a close, I \nwould appeal to principle. ODP was designed to fulfill a special \nobligation we have to those who identified themselves with our cause \nduring the war in Vietnam. It should remain open until we have \nfulfilled our commitment to the fullest extent. It should not be \nbrought to a close prematurely by changing eligibility requirements. \nThe former re-education camp detainee sub-program of ODP is 90 percent \ncomplete. It is not fair to those who are left--those who have waited \nthe longest--to be told that they can either drop out of the program or \nleave their adult children behind.\n  If the original policy is not restored, these children will have to \nwait at a minimum 6 years before immigrating to the United States to \ncare for their parents.\n  I was assured by the State Department last year that in response to \nmy concern and the concerns of others, that ``INS and ODP (would) \nremain alert to individual cases in which there are significant \nhumanitarian reasons for allowing an aged-out son or daughter to \naccompany the principal applicant.'' Although this assurance was made \nwith some qualifiers, I accepted it. I am informed now, however, that \nexceptions have not, in fact, been made.\n  It is very important to many former detainees that their adult \nchildren be permitted to emigrate with them, often because of their \nadvanced age or deteriorating health. Additionally, many of their \nchildren have made life decisions, such as refraining from marriage, \nbased on the requirements of a program which has now changed its \neligibility standards.\n  I would like to close by commending the committee for addressing this \nissue in their report. Indeed, as stated in the committee report on the \nbill: ``It was not the original intent of the program [ODP] to see the \nformer prisoners separated from their family in such a manner.''\n  The United States has a special obligation to those Vietnamese who \nhave been persecuted for their association with the United States and \nthe cause of freedom for which we fought. They certainly deserve, at \nthe very least, the benefit of a consistent, compassionate admission \npolicy for themselves and their families.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5065\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following,\n       Sec.   . 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall provide a \n     report in a classified or unclassified form to the Committee \n     on Appropriations including the following information:\n       (a) a best estimate on fuel used by the military forces of \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK);\n       (b) the deployment position and military training and \n     activities of the DPRK forces and best estimate of the \n     associated costs of these activities;\n       (c) steps taken to reduce the DPRK level of forces; and\n       (d) cooperation, training, or exchanges of information, \n     technology or personnel between the DPRK and any other nation \n     supporting the development or deployment of a ballistic \n     missile capability.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr President, one amendment is by Senator Inouye, with \na colloquy between Mr. Pressler and myself; an amendment by Senator Kyl \nregarding legal reform in Ukraine; an amendment by Senator Lieberman \nregarding war crimes tribunal; an amendment by Senator Pressler \nregarding PRC and Iran missile transfer; a Pressler amendment with \nreference to Syria; a McCain amendment regarding ODP; an amendment by \nmyself relating to Korea.\n  For all Members of the Senate, I say that with the disposition of the \namendments that we are currently aware of, we are almost completed. \nOther than the amendments which have been laid down, I am not aware of \nany other amendments upon which we will have to have votes. So we are \ngetting close to the end of the line here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments, \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5059 through 5065), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nBond\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\nis on the way to use his 5 minutes just prior to the Hatfield-Dorgan \nvote.\n  I yield to Senator Nunn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5058\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will just take a moment at this juncture, \nbecause I know the Brown amendment will be laid aside. My friend from \nColorado has indicated he will be willing to work with me and Senator \nBiden on troubling language in this amendment. I think it is essential \nto work out the troubling language.\n  There are several paragraphs that are indeed troubling here. I say \nthat with this background: On June 27, I proposed an amendment on the \nfloor and worked with Senator McCain and, as I recall, Senator Cohen \nand others in offering the amendment posing a substantial and very \nimportant series of questions to the administration, to the President, \nto answer regarding NATO enlargement.\n  Now, Mr. President, I recall once coming in on the floor when I was a \nmuch younger Senator and watching the esteemed Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Humphrey, propose a series of questions to the floor manager of \nthe bill, and without ever pausing, and I think without realizing it, \nhaving said that he had to have the answer to these questions before he \nvoted on the measure that was pending, he proceeded to answer his own \nquestions and to come out on one side of the issue in a very decisive \nway. He answered his own questions, and nobody else intervened, and he \nsolved his own problem.\n  Mr. President, I don't think we ought to do that regarding the \nquestions that have been posed in a serious way. These questions were \nposed to the administration on June 27 by a unanimous vote in the \nSenate. A number of paragraphs in the Brown amendment would answer \nthose questions only 2 weeks later, without any kind of analytical \nreport, or any kind of thought process even, by the administration.\n  I don't believe we were posing these questions to ourselves. I think \nwe were posing them to the administration and asking them seriously to \nanswer them. So I hope that we can not have some of the findings that \nare in the Brown amendment, and particularly the paragraph in that \namendment which states in paragraph 4 on section 4, page 8:\n\n       The process of enlarging NATO to include emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not stop \n     with the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \n     as full members of the NATO Alliance.\n\n  These countries are all doing well and should be considered as NATO \nmembers under the due process that has been set forth. But for the \nSenate of the United States to decide and imply that that already has \nbeen decided, which is what this amendment does, it seems to me is \nanswering the question, the serious question, with no analytical \nprocess at all and without consulting the administration or our \npartners in NATO.\n  So, Mr. President, I have a long history of being involved in NATO. I \nhave written at least three reports on NATO, and I really think it may \nbe time to remind the Senate of the United States about that history. I \nam prepared to do so. I normally do not like to take the time of the \nSenate. But on an amendment of this magnitude, where we are making \nfindings, it would be entirely inappropriate for the Senate to vote on \nthis without having a very keen reminder of the history of NATO and \nwhat the alliance is all about. That may take several hours, maybe even \nseveral days.\n  I am hoping that we will be able to eliminate the provisions in the \nBrown amendment that answer the serious questions without any \nintervening report from the administration, and all in a 2-week period \nafter the Senate has gone on record, I believe unanimously, in favor of \nposing these serious questions in a serious way.\n  I will be glad to work with my friend from Colorado. I know the \nSenator from Delaware, Senator Biden, has some questions himself that \nwe will be glad to work on. I see the Senator from Missouri on the \nfloor. I wanted to let my colleague know that this is a serious \namendment about a serious subject matter. I have serious reservations \nabout the way the amendment is now drafted. I will be glad to work with \nmy friend from Colorado on the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is on the \nfloor to claim his 5 minutes prior to the vote on the Hatfield-Dorgan \namendment.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that, at 5:55, the Senate proceed \nto back-to-back rollcall votes, first a 15-minute rollcall vote on the \nHatfield-Dorgan amendment, and that the second amendment be a 10-minute \nrollcall vote on the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5045\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and the managers of the bill. I rise in \nopposition to the Dorgan-Hatfield amendment. I have great respect for \nboth of the sponsors of this amendment. I can sympathize with their \nobjectives. I think they are operating from the noblest of motives. \nOnce again, I believe that this amendment causes far more problems than \nit solves. The current Arms Export Control Act requires the executive \nbranch to assure that any sales are in the interest of the foreign \npolicy of the United States. When the executive branch decides to go \nforth with a sale, the Congress is notified and reviews the sale. \nModifications to sales or a withdrawal of the sale request has occurred \nbecause of these congressional reviews. Pakistan is one such example.\n  Now, the restrictive nature of the amendment on which we are going to \nbe voting in a few minutes would arbitrarily cut out all but a few \nselect countries in the world. Many other countries would argue that \nperhaps even the United States could not meet these standards. There is \nyet to be a clear definition of a political prisoner or what \nconstitutes aggression under international law or discrimination on the \nbasis of race, religion on gender. Very few countries have a history of \nelective democracy such as ours. We are not against the intent of this \namendment, but I think it puts overly restrictive limitations on the \nadministration and on our military and economic sectors.\n  There are over 40,000 export licenses for munitions issued per year \nwhich we may very well have to review on a case-by-case basis above and \nbeyond what the executive branch already does.\n  Some of our NATO allies would be called into question. For example, \nTurkey, as well as our long-term friends like Israel who might be \nchallenged on the basis of the treatment of Palestinian terrorists, or \npolitical prisoners. Spain can be attacked on the basis of its \ntreatment of Basques, or perhaps even England for its quagmire with the \nIRA. Saudi Arabia and Egypt could be adversely affected by this \namendment.\n  Where we have not had contact in countries like Cuba, communism \ncontinues to flourish in spite of our ever increasingly restrictive \nsanctions. They are not working there. This amendment would not prevent \nthe procurement of weapons. It would allow the procurement of weapons \nfrom possibly rogue states and arbitrarily lock us out of a major \nconduit of foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious amendment. Its effect would be \nto immobilize the administration from normal conduct of its foreign \npolicy, trade policy, and military policy as it would create lists of \ncountries for congressional approval every year and then await for \napproval each year. Each year this body would be tied up in the process \nof giving a country-by-country approval needlessly antagonizing \ncountries who support our policies. And it will most likely not affect \nthe trade policies of our competitors, including allies. There will be \nno reduction in arms sales--only in U.S. businesses, jobs and, most \nimportantly, U.S. influence.\n  The influence extends beyond business and military interests. It \nextends to our ability to work diplomatically and subtly across all \npolicy issues. The world has changed, continues to change. The \nCommunist monolith is crumbling. But the fact is that the countries \nwith whom we have had a defense relationship are in general gravitating \ntowards more democratic political systems and market-oriented \neconomies.\n  There is no empirical evidence that by unilaterally denying ourselves \naccess to other countries' military and\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\npolitical infrastructures that we have had or will have any positive \nimpact on democratizing them or improving their human rights records.\n  The legislation is counterproductive. It would make the world less \nstable. We would have less influence over proliferation and lose our \nability to provide a positive political effect on a military policy of \nfriendly countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize that while this amendment has been \noffered with all good intentions and with the highest of purposes, it \nis a significantly flawed piece of legislation that would have very \nmuch an unanticipated and very harmful impact.\n  I hope we will vote it down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Missouri to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 65, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 241 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--65\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record \nreflect that Congressman Bonior was instrumental in formulating the \nproposal that is reflected in the amendment on the Chernobyl disaster \nsponsored by Senators Abraham and Levin, and I also ask unanimous \nconsent that the following Senators be listed as cosponsors of Senator \nBumpers' amendment on Mongolia: Senators Hatfield, Gorton, Simon, \nJohnston, Burns, Reid, and Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5058\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate now resumes consideration of the \namendment by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], No. 5058.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Slade \nGorton be added as a cosponsor of the Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have been working in the interim to try \nto accommodate Members' concerns. I spelled out concerns by Senator \nSimon, Senator Nunn, and Senator Biden.\n\n\n                   Modification To Amendment No. 5058\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have reached agreement with Senator \nSimon that I believe is a clear statement of current NATO policy with \nregard to thermal nuclear weapons and their deployment. I hereby ask \nunanimous consent that the Simon-Brown amendment be incorporated in the \nBrown amendment, or more precisely, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify my amendment with the Simon language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has the right to modify his own amendment. The amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       Add on page 7 at the beginning of line 13:\n       (21) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not \n     allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory \n     although they are accorded the full collective security \n     guarantees provided by article V of the Washington Treaty. \n     There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of \n     nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, \n     particularly in the current security climate, however NATO \n     retains the right to alter its security posture at any time \n     as circumstances warrant.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we also have had concerns expressed about \nCroatia. It is my understanding we have cleared on both sides sense-of-\nthe-Senate language that relates to Croatia and their potential future \ndiscussions with NATO countries. I ask that I be allowed to modify my \namendment to include that sense-of-the-Senate language regarding \nCroatia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Again, the Senator has the right to modify his \nown amendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the last \nrequest to modify, I ask that Senator Gorton be added as a cosponsor of \nmy Croatian amendment No. 5043 agreed to earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, with regard to the NATO amendment, my \nunderstanding is that we are working with Senator Nunn. He has concerns \nhe would like to share. We are also working with Senator Biden to work \nthrough his concerns. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we can see the light at the end of the \ntunnel. There is a vote left to be held on the Cohen amendment and on \nthe Coverdell amendment. We are hoping that the Brown amendment will be \nworked out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the Cohen amendment occur at \n7:20\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\nand that the time between now and 7:20--that is 20 minutes on a side--\nbe equally divided, and the time controlled by Senator Cohen and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kentucky tell us \nwhat we might expect for the remainder of the evening?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I thought I had just done that. Let me make it \nclear. We are going to vote on the Cohen amendment at 7:20. Remaining \nto be disposed of are the Coverdell amendment--your side has indicated \nthey are willing to reach a time agreement on that--there is a Brown \namendment, just discussed by Senator Brown, to which Senator Nunn \nobjects at the moment. Discussions are going on between the two of \nthem. We hope to get that resolved. It is possible we can go to final \npassage after that. There are a few other amendments, but we are \ngetting very close to finishing up here.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Can we add, with respect to the Cohen amendment, there be \nno second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I modify my unanimous consent agreement that no \nsecond-degree amendment is in order. I say to my friend I will make a \nmotion to table at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5019\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate faces a moment of profound \nmoral choice. We are dealing here with the proposal of the Senator from \nKentucky, joined by others, to place the United States emphatically on \nthe side of the freely elected democratic regime of Burma, which was \nelected with 82 percent of the vote and then instantly overwhelmed by a \nmilitary coup.\n  The restoration of a military regime, which had earlier, in 1962, \ncrushed the nascent democratic society of Burma. Before that Burma had \nsucceeded through a succession of elections beginning with one for a \nconstituent assembly prior to independence, and then three free \nelections thereafter. As I say, this all ended in 1962 and was followed \nby 25 years of atrocious government and oppression under General Ne \nWin. The country never submitted to this. The resistance was always \nwidespread, emphatic, admirable to a degree that Americans can only \nimagine, given our long and stable history. Now, the issue has become \nan international issue. Our Senate was the first to raise this issue in \n1988, and we have persisted in the matter. The proposition is to \nisolate the military regime, to deny it the recognition of the free \nworld and to make clear that such denial has consequences in the \neconomic development of that potentially rich and prosperous and happy \nsociety.\n  I speak with some knowledge of Burma, not enough, but enough to know \nhow important this is to the whole movement toward democracy in Asia.\n  We have just seen Russia conduct two democratic presidential \nelections, the first in their history. We have just seen Mongolia \nconduct a free election and choose a democratic government. The Senator \nfrom Virginia and former Secretary of State Baker were both in Mongolia \nas election monitors. There are many such nations in the early stages \nof a democratic transition. We must associate with them and stand by \nthem. And when democracy is threatened we must make our objections \nknown. Just this June, the European Parliament has risen up and stated \nthat the time has come for the whole of the European Union to boycott \nthis regime. Most American firms have already done so. Most American \nobservers have urged us to act.\n  The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial of May 30 this year, put it \nthis way:\n\n       Throughout the world, foolishness and greed are sometimes \n     draped with a veil of respectable sounding phrases like \n     ``constructive engagement,'' based on the promise that by \n     doing business in a country like Burma you expect to change \n     it. The problem is that once companies and governments climb \n     into the boat with dictators, they are very reluctant to rock \n     it, lest their deals go overboard.\n\n  The request for this embargo, the proposition, has been endorsed by \nSecretary of Commerce Kantor who stated last month with regard to \nSerbia, South Africa, Libya, and Iran, ``There are times when economic \nrestrictions done in an appropriate fashion can be very helpful. With \nregard to Burma, I'm in favor of taking effective action with regard to \nthe actions of this regime.''\n  Witnesses from South Africa, who benefited to a degree no one could \nimagine from American leadership in just this mode, Nelson Mandela and \nBishop Tutu, have told us to have faith in our own experience. Burma \nwill yield if the democracies stay together and the United States \nleads.\n\n  Most emphatically and importantly, the elected Prime Minister, an \nextraordinary person, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu \nKyi, asks us to do this. She has sent videotaped to the European \nParliament last week with a statement supporting sanctions. She said, \n``What we want are the kind of sanctions that will make it quite clear \nthat economic change in Burma is not possible without political \nchange.''\n  That is the record of the past three decades. A country that could be \nprospering today is all but prostrate because of the military regimes \nthat have succeeded, one after the other. She went on to say, ``We \nthink this is the time for concerted international efforts with regard \nto the democratic process in Burma.''\n  That, I respectfully suggest, is what is at issue in the vote we are \nsoon to have. I hope chairman McConnell will prevail. I hope democracy \nwill prevail. I cannot doubt it will if we but keep to a firm line of \nprinciple and conviction. I thank the Senator for his time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York for his inspirational remarks. He has been \na very knowledgeable observer of the Burmese scene for many years. I \nthank him for his leadership on this most important issue.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the junior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me first say that I want to commend \nthe manager of this bill, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, for \nhis leadership and his courage in saying clearly that the United States \ndoes stand up for those who are oppressed, that we have the courage to \nlook at facts as they are, as discomforting as they may be, and \nsometimes painful for people to recognize.\n  We have become a world so interested in commercial advantage that we \nlook aside. We make believe things are not happening. Sometimes it is \nnot pleasant to acknowledge that there is evil, that there are people \nthat we know, governments that we do business with that are involved in \nperpetuating evil. The killing of innocent human beings, killing \nthem, imprisoning people, terrorizing them, depriving them of their \nmost basic fundamental freedoms that are important. And if we just \ncontinue business as usual with them, as if all is well, because we may \nbe commercially advantaged, then I suggest to you that we are betraying \nthe greatness and the heritage of this country. We betray the \nprinciples on which so many have laid down their lives for our freedom \nand the freedom of others. That principle, when we have adhered to it, \nhas always inured to the benefit of mankind and, more particularly, the \nbenefit of our citizens here, not just the people who we have stood up \nfor abroad.\n\n  Our history is replete with the times in which we have stood nobly \nand fought for freedom, and the times we have stepped aside and looked \nand allowed a petty dictator to terrorize his people on the altar of \npolitical expedience. We have contributed to many of the nations who \nfall under totalitarian domination, because we did business as if \nnothing was wrong with petty dictators. We condoned, in essence, their \nactions.\n  This is an opportunity for us to do what is right and to stand for \npeople who are oppressed. No one has brought this to the table in a \nmore eloquent\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\nway than the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, who has \npointed out very clearly that those people who are fighting for \nfreedom, who are there and being oppressed, say, ``Don't believe this \nnonsense that if you cut off doing business, you are going to be \nhurting the average citizen, because you are not because the government \nthat is in control now, the junta, the dictatorship, will use those \nfunds for their own purposes, and no real economic benefit will come to \nthe people.''\n  So I hope that we will continue to maintain the beacon of freedom and \nthat we will support the chairman's mark.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have but a few comments. I find it \nimportant to make them in support of the Cohen amendment. Mr. \nPresident, this debate, in my opinion, is not about being soft on a \nbunch of thugs.\n  At the core of this debate is the effectiveness of mandatory \nunilateral sanctions as a tool of foreign policy to encourage change in \nBurma. It is about the best policy to pursue that will bring about the \nchanges that we all want to see in the nation of Burma.\n  As we address this situation, it is important that the United States \nengage other nations. A multilateral effort to evaluate the situation \nin Burma and develop ways we can work both independently and \ncollectively will encourage the improvement in human rights and will \nmove Burma toward a free and democratic society.\n  Mr. President, I support the Cohen amendment and all that it \naddresses. We all can encourage humanitarian relief, drug interdiction \nefforts, and the promotion of democracy. I believe that these \nactivities, in addition to denying multilateral assistance through \ninternational financial institutions, and the establishment of a \nmultilateral strategy will provide the best roadmap to reach the goals \nwe seek in Burma.\n  I congratulate Senator Cohen for his effort in offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are there other speakers?\n  Mr. COHEN. I believe there is one other.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cohen \namendment. I think we would all like to truly believe that, in an area \nof the world remote to the United States, this country can unilaterally \nimpose a sanction which is going to have an effect. But it is not \nsupported by anyone else in the area. I know of no other country in the \narea that will support this sanction.\n  Additionally, the administration--the State Department and the White \nHouse--is in support of the Cohen-Feinstein amendment. In essence, what \nthis amendment does is, as Senator Craig just stated, seek to develop a \nmultilateral alliance of the ASEAN countries, and others, to be able to \ndeal with the problems that the SLORC regime presents to the people of \nBurma, or Myanmar, as some people might say. I think it is a well \nthought out amendment. It is an important amendment.\n  There is one U.S. economic venture in that country, and let us speak \nabout it and speak about it candidly. It is a joint venture between \nUnocal and the French to build a pipeline. They will build schools, \nthey will build hospitals, they will put to the community an \nopportunity for economic upward mobility. Let us say the unilateral \nsanction passes, and let us say Unocal cannot go ahead, do you know who \nwill take Unocal's share in this? Mitsui, a Japanese company, or South \nKorea. They will do it without building hospitals, and they will do it \nwithout the schools. I wonder what is gained by it.\n  I hear many people say, ``Shut down an economy and that will change a \nregime.'' I really believe that when you have an economy and you \nparticipate in it, and you bring Western values to a country, and you \nhelp with schools and you immunize kids, all of which is happening, it \ncan be particularly effective.\n  Now, I very much respect Aung San Suu Kyi. I wish her well, and I \nthink the SLORC regime would be well advised to work with her to \nimprove the standard of living. And, at the same time, I believe it is \nextraordinarily important that the administration, and whatever \nadministration, and the State Department, and whatever State \nDepartment, begin to develop the kind of multilateral alliance with the \nASEAN countries that can be effective in meeting the human rights needs \nin this region.\n  So I believe that the Cohen-Feinstein amendment, which provides that \nthere be no bilateral assistance, other than humanitarian and \ncounternarcotics until the Government of Burma is fully cooperative \nwith the United States on counternarcotic efforts, and the program is \nfully consistent with the United States human rights concerns in Burma. \nIt promotes multilateral assistance by asking the Secretary of the \nTreasury to instruct the United States executive director of each \ninternational financial institution to vote against any loan or other \nutilization of funds of the respective bank to and for Burma.\n  I think it makes a great deal of sense. I urge an ``aye'' vote on the \nCohen-Feinstein-Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments. I have been \nasked to advise my colleagues that the administration supports the \nCohen-Feinstein-Chafee amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record from \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Department of State so advising my \ncolleagues that the administration supports the Cohen amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Cohen,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cohen: The Administration welcomes and \n     supports the amendment which you and others have offered to \n     Section 569 (Limitation on Funds for Burma) of H.R. 3540, the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. We believe the \n     current and conditional sanctions which your language \n     proposes are consistent with Administration policy. As we \n     have stated on several occasions in the past, we need to \n     maintain our flexibility to respond to events in Burma and to \n     consult with Congress on appropriate responses to ongoing and \n     future developments there.\n       We support a range of tough measures designed to bring \n     pressure to bear upon the regime in Rangoon. We continue to \n     urge international financial institutions not to provide \n     support to Burma under current circumstances. We maintain a \n     range of unilateral sanctions and do not promote U.S. \n     commercial investment in or trade with Burma. We refrain from \n     selling arms to Burma and have an informal agreement with our \n     G-7 friends and allies to do the same.\n       On the international level, we have strongly supported \n     efforts in the U.N. General Assembly and the International \n     Labor Organization to condemn human and worker rights \n     violations in Burma. At the U.N. Human Rights Commission this \n     month, we led the effort against attempts to water down the \n     Burma resolution. We have urged the U.N. to play an active \n     role in promoting democratic reform through a political \n     dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program there is no \n     objection to the submission of this report. We note, however, \n     that the wording of two of the sanctions as currently drafted \n     raises certain constitutional concerns. We look forward to \n     working with you and the conferees to address this.\n       We hope this information is useful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to call if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. The definition of ``new investment'' in Burma in Section \n569 of the amendment includes the entry into certain types of \ncontracts. Does it also cover performance of contracts, or commitments \nentered into or made prior to the date of sanctions?\n  Mr. COHEN. It is not the intention of this legislation to compel U.S. \npersons to breach or repudiate pre-sanctions contracts or commitments.\n  Mr. BREAVY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment I \nhave cosponsored with my distinguished colleagues Senator Cohen, \nSenator Johnston, Senator, McCain, Senator Feinstein, and Senator \nChafee. I believe this amendment makes sense because it strikes a \nbalance between unilateral sanctions against Burma and unfettered \nUnited States investment in that country.\n  Mr. President, the supporters of this amendment share the same \nobjective as the supporters of unilateral sanctions. We all want to see \nan end to the\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\nbrutal, oppressive Burmese dictatorship and a return to a democratic \ngovernment. No one will argue that the current regime in Burma is \nanything less than brutal, illegitimate and deplorable in almost every \nrespect and recent events suggest that the government is escalating its \noppression of the democratic opposition, even in the face of \ninternational condemnation. We all want to see the quick demise of this \nregime but we differ with opponents of this amendment on the way to \nbring this change about. In an effort to promote democratic change in \nBurma, this amendment prohibits new U.S. investment if the government \nrearrests or otherwise harms Aung San Suu Kyi, the most eloquent voice \nfor democracy in that country.\n  Although the United States accounts for only ten percent of all \nforeign investment in Burma, allowing U.S. businesses to operate there \nwill enable us to continue raising our concerns over human rights. I \nbelieve a U.S. voice in this process is critical if we are ever going \nto see real change in Burma. This amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Maine also requires the President to work with our ASEAN \nallies and other trading partners to develop a comprehensive strategy \nto bring democratic change to Burma and improve human rights.\n  Mr. President, if our goal is to affect change in a foreign country, \nI don't believe unilateral sanctions are necessarily the right \napproach. We have seen what happens when the U.S. imposes unilateral \nsanctions. Our European and Asian allies are hesitant to follow suit \nand in this case, a U.S. withdrawal would just mean that foreign \ncompanies would fill the void when we leave. Abandoning our commercial \ninterests in Burma will do nothing to advance human rights and \ndemocracy in that country which is the objective we all share. The U.S. \nalready exerts pressure on the military regime in Burma by prohibiting \nU.S. economic aid, withholding GSP trade preferences, and decertifying \nBurma as a narcotics cooperating country, which requires us by law to \nvote against assistance to Burma by international financial \ninstitutions. This amendment takes the additional step of prohibiting \nnew investment in Burma if the government commits large scale \noppression against the democratic opposition. Our goal is to prevent \nrepression of the democratically elected government and to promote a \ndialogue between their voices of democracy and the military regime.\n  This amendment has the support of Democrats and Republicans as well \nas the Administration. It is a reasonable compromise on a very \ndifficult issue. I thank my colleagues who have worked on this \namendment and I urge it adoption.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cohen \namendment on United States policy toward Burma. The current language \nwithin the foreign operations appropriations bill mandates immediate \nunilateral sanctions against Burma. The purpose of these sanctions is \nto punish Burma's ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration \nCouncil or SLORC, for failing to accede to the desire of the Burmese \npeople for democracy and freedom and for its many past violations of \nbasic human and civil rights.\n  I agree with the goals of Senator McConnell and Senator Moynihan. Not \none person in this distinguished chamber will disagree that the United \nStates has a clear national interest in seeing a democratically elected \ngovernment in charge of a free society in Burma. The question is \nwhether the immediate imposition of unilateral investment sanctions is \nthe best policy to achieve that goal. I do not believe that they are.\n  First, Burma is not a throw-away issue. The wrong U.S. policy could \nsubstantially damage our relations with our close friends and our \nregional influence. The United States has a clear national security \ninterest in balancing the rising influence of China in Asia. Our full \nengagement in southeast Asia is an integral part of that balance. \nUnfortunately, the administration has long been unable to articulate \nand clearly demonstrate the reliability of our long-term commitment to \nthe region. In the face of this uncertainty, ASEAN is taking steps to \nensure Burma and Vietnam become members to counterbalance Chinese \ninfluence. The U.S. willingness to work with them on Burma is seen as a \nkey test case of the U.S. commitment.\n  Second, our allies do not support sanctions now and said as much to \nPresidential envoys Ambassador Brown and Mr. Roth. Bringing Burma into \nASEAN and the ARF force the SLORC to accept and live up to the values \nand responsibilities that membership entails in much the same way as \nNATO membership will require of the countries of central Europe. This \napproach establishes a forum for pressuring the SLORC to negotiate with \nAung San Suu Kyi and other democracy movement leaders. Unfortunately, \nU.S. moral suasion on behalf of sanctions will have little impact \nunless the situation in Burma deteriorates dramatically. Expecting \nothers to follow our lead even if it goes against their own cold \ncalculation of national interests only ensures that we are falling on \nour own sword.\n  I want to make it clear that the SLORC and Burma are not the 1990's \nequivalent of apartheid in South Africa. South Africa relied on access \nto the outside world. Isolating them cut off the very roots of their \nexport-oriented economy. For most of the past 30 years, Burma isolated \nitself from the world. Only now is Burma establishing ties with the \noutside world. Isolating them now would be about as effective as \nprunning a tree. In particular, United States investment in Burma--save \nfor oil interests--is minimal and even its loss would have little \nimpact because others will take our place. With South Africa, sub-\nsaharan Africa was also united in support of sanctions. There is no \nsimilar regional mandate for action with Burma.\n  When sanctions were imposed against South Africa they were \naccompanied by extensive contact and assistance to the black community \nin South Africa and the NGOs working with them. The current language on \nBurma has none of that and would cut off our access and ability to \nsupport the democracy movement.\n  There are no potential incentives for the SLORC to work with Suu Kyi \nas none of the sanctions will be lifted until a fully democratically-\nelected government comes to power. But, as we saw in South Africa and \nbefore that in Poland, the movement to democracy is often a slow, \ntentative process and include transitional governments. If events \nunfold in a similar fashion in Burma, the current language has no means \nfor easing or eliminating sanctions to cultivate the growth of \ndemocracy.\n\n  The current language would also give SLORC the wrong signal that it \ncan do whatever it wants because we have already used up all our \nbullets.\n\n\n                  our policy and the current amendment\n\n  Instead of the current draconian sanctions proposed in the \nlegislation before us, we should adopt an approach that effectively \nsecures our national interests. The Cohen amendment does just that.\n  One, it establishes a framework for United States policy towards \nBurma that stimulates intimate cooperation with our allies in the \nregion, especially ASEAN, that is clearly in the national interest.\n  Two, it draws a clear line in the sand that should the situation in \nBurma deteriorate the United States and our allies would impose \nmultilateral sanctions on Burma or the United States would go it alone \nif necessary. SLORC will be on notice and have to be on their best \nbehavior.\n  Three, it provides incentives for SLORC and Suu Kyi and the other \ndemocratic leaders and ethnic minorities to start talking and move \ntowards democracy and freedom. It would permit assistance to the \ndemocracy movement, support efforts to curb the flow of heroin, and \nensure that Americans can visit, talk with, and influence the people in \nBurma as they have everywhere from the Albania to South Africa.\n  Four, it allows the President to remove sanctions and other \nrestrictions should there be progress towards the establishment of a \nfull democratic government or if we are merely punishing U.S. \ninvestors.\n  Finally, it requires the administration to work closely with the \nCongress developing a multilateral strategy to bring democracy to Burma \nand in implementing the sanctions.\n  Mr. President. This is a solid strategy and bipartisan view of what \nthe\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\nUnited States' policy towards Burma should be. It is a far better one \nthan that currently envisioned in the legislation before us. I strongly \nurge my fellow colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that if my colleagues are \nlooking for some ideological touchpoint on this issue, they will not \nfind any. It is going to be an odd collection of players on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  As my senior colleague from Kentucky just indicated, the Clinton \nadministration supports the Cohen amendment, and I oppose the Cohen \namendment, along with Senator Moynihan, from whom you have heard, \nSenator Leahy who spoke earlier on the issue, and then Senator Helms \nand Senator Faircloth also will be opposing the Cohen amendment.\n  So if you are looking for some ideological guidelines, you will not \nfind any on this issue. So this would be a good vote upon which to just \nsort of set aside party label or ideological leaning and look at the \nfacts and think about what America stands for.\n  The facts are these: In 1990, in Burma they had a Western-style, \ninternationally supervised election. Eighty percent of the vote went to \nthe National League for Democracy, a party organized around a dynamic \nleader that is becoming increasingly well-known in the world, Aung San \nSuu Kyi. As soon as the election was completed and it was clear who had \nwon, the ruling military junta, supported by a 400,000-person army, \nused entirely internally to control the people of Burma, locked up most \nof the leadership and put Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. She was \nessentially incommunicado until July 1995, 2 days before a bill that I \ncrafted and introduced was introduced here in the Senate last July.\n  They claim she was released. Well, it is some kind of release. She is \nallowed to address, from home, friends and supporters who come around \nsometimes on a weekly basis. But they do that at some risk. She does \nnot feel comfortable communicating with the outside world. Yet, she \nsmuggled out a tape a week ago for use at the European Union in their \nParliament debate in which they call upon their members to institute \nunilateral sanctions.\n  So, clearly she does not feel comfortable to just sort of pick up the \nphone and call some reporter and say, ``This is how I feel.'' But she \nhas been getting her views out. She and the legitimate Government of \nBurma, much of it now in this country, support the provisions in the \nunderlying bill and oppose the Cohen amendment. I have already put that \nletter, received today, in the Record.\n  I do not want to be too hard on the Clinton administration because, \nobviously, this is not a very partisan issue. We have people all over \nthe lot on this question. But they are basically not interested in \ndoing anything about this problem. But that does not distinguish them \nfrom the Bush administration, which had no interest either.\n  So there has been bipartisan neglect to address this problem. Neither \nadministration has distinguished itself by ignoring a problem which I \nguarantee you, if there were a bunch of Burmese American citizens, we \nwould have been bouncing off the walls 6 years ago over this. But there \nare not any Burmese American citizens. We have a lot of Jewish \nAmericans who are interested in Israel, a lot of Armenia Americans who \nare interested in Armenia, and a lot of Ukraine Americans who \nare interested in Ukraine. Boy, when we hear from them, we get real \ninterested. But you take some isolated country that did not have the \nimmigration pattern to this country and somehow we act like it does not \nexist.\n\n  But with the Burmese regime, the State Law and Order Restoration \nCouncil, SLORC--you can hardly say it without laughing, but it is not \nfunny--runs a terrorist regime in Burma. Some people may say, ``Well, \nit is none of our affair.'' Sixty percent of the heroin in our country \ncomes from Burma--60 percent of it. Heroin from Burma is tainting the \nlives of thousands of Americans. This regime cooperates with the people \nwho send it here. So it does have a direct effect on Americans living \nhere in this country as well as offending every standard that we have \ncome to believe in and to promote around the world.\n  It is safe to say that the Burmese Government can be in a rather \nunique category with North Korea, Libya, Iran, and Iraq. It is just a \nsmall, little family here of truly outrageous regimes, and all the rest \nof them we have a great interest in and we have sanctions against or we \nare working to try to diminish the influence of in one way or another. \nBut this country we seem to have no interest in.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Maine actually makes the situation \nworse, in my opinion. It will allow aid to this pariah regime to \nincrease. In other words, in the opinion of the Senator from Kentucky, \nit is worse than current law because last year we voted to cut off a \nnarcotics program in that country because we did not have any \nconfidence in dealing with this outlaw regime. This would make those \ndealings possible again should the administration decide to engage in \nit.\n  The second condition in the Cohen amendment which seems to me to be \ntroublesome is it makes Aung San Suu Kyi's personal security the issue \nrather than the restoration of democracy. In other words, if you see \nthat Aung San Suu Kyi is in trouble or there is large-scale trouble or \nviolence, then you can take certain actions if you want to, but you do \nnot have to because all of it can be waived.\n  In short, with all due respect to my good friend from Maine, it seems \nto me that this amendment basically gives the administration total \nflexibility to do whatever they want to do, which every administration \nwould love to have. I can understand why they support this amendment. \nBut looking at the track record of this administration and the previous \none, given the discretion to do nothing, nothing is what you get. \nNothing is what we can anticipate from this administration, and that is \nwhat we got from the last one.\n  Let me say this is not a radical step. Some people think that we \nshould never have unilateral economic sanctions against anybody, but a \nlot of those people make exceptions for Cuba, for example. ``Well, that \nis different,'' or they make an exception for a renegade regime like \nLibya.\n  The truth of the matter is we have occasionally used unilateral \nsanctions, and they have not always failed. I mean, it is very common \nto say they always fail. They do not always fail. In fact, we have a \nconspicuous success story in South Africa, a place where America led. \nWhen we passed the South Africa sanctions bill in 1986, which my good \nfriend from Maine supported, and when we overrode President Reagan's \nveto, which both of us voted to override, we were not sure it was going \nto work. All of these arguments about unilateral sanctions were made \nthen. Everybody said, ``Well, nobody else will follow.'' In fact, \neverybody followed. America led and everybody else followed, and South \nAfrica has been a great success story.\n\n  I think those followers are right around the corner. The European \nUnion and the European Parliament took this issue up in July of this \nyear--this month. Why did they get interested? Aung San Suu Kyi's best \nfriend, a man named Nichols, a European who had been a consulate \nofficial in Rangoon for a number of different European countries, as \nthe distinguished senior Senator from New York pointed out a minute \nago, was arrested earlier this year. His crime was possessing a fax \nmachine, and they killed him. He is dead; murdered.\n  So the Europeans all of a sudden have gotten interested in this \nbecause one of their own has been treated by the Burmese military like \nit has been treating the Burmese people for years. Carlsberg and \nHeineken, two European companies, are pulling out. American companies \nand one oil company decided not to go forward, and all of the retailers \nwho were either in there or on the way in are coming out--Eddie Bauer, \nLiz Claiborne, Pepsico are coming out. If America leads, others will \nfollow.\n\n  Finally, let me say that this is what Aung San Suu Kyi would like, \nand she won the election. She is familiar with all the arguments that \nare made by those who do not want unilateral sanctions, that only the \npeople of Burma will be hurt. She is familiar with those arguments. She \ndoes not buy it. She does not agree to it. This is what she has to say. \nShe said:\n\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\n\n       Foreign investment currently benefits only Burma's military \n     rulers and some local interests but would not help improve \n     the lot of the Burmese in general.\n\n  She said in May this year, quoted in Asia Week:\n\n       Burma is not developing in any way. Some people are getting \n     very rich. That is not economic development.\n\n  On Australia Radio in May of this year, she was quoted as saying, a \ndirect quote:\n\n       Investment made now is very much against the interests of \n     the people of Burma.\n\n  So, Mr. President, that sums up the argument. If America does not \nlead, no one will. If given total discretion, all indications are that \nthis administration will have no more interest than the last one. The \nduly elected Government of Burma is in jail or under surveillance, and \nwe do nothing. This is the opportunity, this is the time for America to \nbe consistent with its principles.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Cohen amendment will not be \napproved. I have great respect for my friend from Maine. But I think on \nthis particular issue he is wrong, and I hope his amendment will not be \napproved.\n  Mr. President, last week, when she learned the European Parliament \nand European Union were debating a response to the death of their \nHonorary Consul, Leo Nichols, Aung San Suu Kyi was able to smuggle out \na videotape appealing for sanctions against the military regime in \nRangoon. This is the most recent of many courageous calls by the \nelected leader of Burma for the international community to directly and \nimmediately support the restoration of democracy and respect for the \nrule of law in her country. She has repeatedly summoned us to take \nconcrete steps to implement the results of the 1990 elections in which \nthe Burmese people spoke with a strong, resolute voice, and the NLD \ncarried the day.\n  Less we forget, the NLD did not squeak by with a 43 percent mandate \nas did our sitting President--the leader of the free world. The NLD \nclaimed 392 seats in the parliament winning 82 percent of the vote. Now \nthat's a mandate.\n  Unfortunately, a shining moment for democracy has been blackened by a \nruthless dictatorship. To this day, the generals who make up the State \nLaw and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] maintain a chokehold on \nBurma's life.\n  Burma is a battleground between democracy and dictatorship, between \nthose who believe in open markets and those who openly market their \nself-enriching schemes, between the many who embrace freedom and the \nfew who breed fear, and between Suu Kyi's supporters and SLORC's \nsycophants.\n  There are few modern examples where our choice is so stark, where the \nbattle lines are so sharply drawn.\n  Shortly after her appeal to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Suu \nKyi called the elected members of the 1990 Parliament to meet in \nRangoon. True to her commitment to be inclusive of all Burmese, she \neven invited SLORC supporters who had been elected.\n  SLORC's response was swift and devastating. In a matter of 48 hours \nthey rounded up over 200 members of the NLD. If the member was absent \nwhen troops arrived for the arrest, a family member was detained \ninstead. While each and every arrest was outrageous, I want to call \nattention to one which ended tragically.\n  As many people know, Suu Kyi's father died when she was quite young. \nIn stepped Leo Nichols. He assumed an important role in her life \noffering friendship and support. He was often referred to as her \ngodfather. The closeness of their relationship was reflected in the \nfact that following her release last July, Suu Kyi had breakfast every \nFriday morning with her ``Uncle Leo''.\n\n  Sixty-five years old, Leo Nichols was picked up in the April sweep \nand charged with the illegal use of a fax machine. Even the State \nDepartment acknowledged that his relationship with Suu Kyi was the \nmotive behind his arrest. For his crime he was sentenced to 3 years \nprison. Suffering from a heart condition, he was denied medication and \nkept in solitary confinement at Insein Prison until June 20, when he \nwas transferred to Rangoon General Hospital. An hour later he died, \naccording to SLORC of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was immediately buried, \nwith family and friends warned not to attend the funeral.\n  Given his transfer, death, and hasty burial, accounts of his torture \nhave been difficult to confirm. There has been claims that he was badly \nbruised and beaten--true or not, there is no question his detention \ncontributed to his death, reconfirming the brutal nature of this \nregime.\n  Leo Nichols is not SLORC's only victim. There is no question that \narbitrary killings, detentions, torture, rape, and forced labor and \nrelocations are tools routinely abused to secure SLORC's position, \npower and wealth. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Burma has \ninvestigated and documented the abuses in several reports which I urge \nmy colleagues to read.\n  Nonetheless, some may argue that Burma is too far away from the \nUnited States to warrant any interest, time, or attention. But, there \nare compelling reasons for every community and politician to be \nconcerned about developments in Burma beginning with our drug epidemic.\n  The 1996 International Narcotics Control Report makes the following \npoints:\n  Burma is the world's largest producer of opium and heroin;\n  Opium production has doubled since SLORC seized power;\n  Burma is the source of over 60 percent of the heroin seized on our \nstreets; and\n  SLORC is making less and less effort to crack down on trafficking, in \nfact there has been an 80 percent drop in seizures and the junta is \nactually offering safe haven to Khun Sa, the regions most notorious \nnarco-warlord.\n  Now this is a regime with over 400,000 armed soldiers, evidence that \nif SLORC wanted to crack down on trafficking, they clearly have the \nmeans to do so.\n  The Golden Triangle's deadly exports initially caught my eye, but it \nis the administration's policy--or lack thereof--which fixed my gaze. \nThis is one of the few occasions where the White House has been \nconsistent; unfortunately, they have been consistently wrong.\n  As Suu Kyi has repeatedly emphasized since her release, Burma today \nis not one step closer to democracy. Indeed, I think the situation has \nseriously, dangerously, and unnecessarily deteriorated.\n\n  In November 1994, after a long, disheartening silence, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard, traveled to Rangoon to issue \nan ultimatum. The administration called international attention to \ntheir new, tough line. SLORC was expected to make concrete progress in \nhuman rights, narcotics, and democracy. If they were appropriately \nresponsive, they could expect improved ties. If not, in Hubbard's \nwords, ``the U.S. bilateral relationship with Burma could be further \ndown-graded.''\n  As most of us learn early in life, you don't taunt a bully. SLORC \nmoved swiftly to call our bluff. Major attacks were launched against \nethnic groups, generating tens of thousands of refugees. Democracy \nactivists were rounded up, tortured, and killed. Negotiations over Red \nCross access to prisoners ground to a halt, prompting the organization \nto close its office in Rangoon. And, the administration remained \nstrangely silent.\n  As the situation worsened, there was another burst of interest, and \nMadeleine Albright was dispatched to repeat the message. This time it \nwas underscored with a personal meeting and statement of support for \ndialog with Suu Kyi. Those of us who follow Burma were hopeful that our \nU.N. Ambassador with a reputation for toughness would press forward \nwith a clear strategy.\n  Sadly, again, SLORC rose--or should I say sunk--to the occasion. As \nthe noose tightened around Suu Kyi and the NLD, the administration \nremained silent.\n  In the wake of the April sweep against the NLD, there was stepped up \ngrass roots interest in sanctioning Burma. To preempt these calls, once \nagain the administration dispatched officials to size up the situation. \nThis time, instead of visiting Rangoon, they traveled the region.\n  A stinging column carried in the Nation, characterized the American \napproach as ``outspoken and critical but its repeated messages or \nthreats often carry no weight because of a lack of back up action. It \nis a typical case of words not being matched with deeds.''\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  The column quoted a senior Thai official who suggested the trip was \n``a conspiracy to thwart attempts by the U.S. Congress to pass an \neconomic sanctions bill which is gaining growing support.'' The \nofficial went on to note ``The American government is good at making \nempty threats and last week's trip is just another example.''\n  In briefings following up the trip, the State Department made clear \nthat the Special Envoys were not dispatched with a specific message--\nthey had no orders to press any agenda for action--and as the Nation so \nclearly stated: ``The two failed to spell out, in concrete terms, \npossible U.S. retaliatory measures.''\n\n  After hollow policy pronouncements and weak-willed waffling from the \nadministration, SLORC is convinced it will pay no price for repression. \nWe are left with few real options with the potential for success.\n  The business community understandably prefers the status quo. They \nsuggest that our ASEAN partners will not support a strategy of \nescalating isolation. A tougher line will only result in a loss of \nmarket share to our French, Italian, or other competitors.\n  But, let me point out, just as the call for sanctions has grown \nstronger in the United States, it has resonated through corporate halls \nand the corridors of power in Europe.\n  The European Parliament has called upon its members to take action to \nsuspend trade and investment in Burma. The European Union has taken up \nlegislation suspending visas and all high level contacts with the \nBurmese.\n  Heineken and Carlsberg have pulled out in response to public \npressure. And, in an important development, the Danish Government has \nsold off all its holdings in TOTAL, the French oil company with the \nlargest investment in Burma. In announcing its decision, a spokesman \nfor the fund said it was made in anticipation of ``a possible \ninternational boycott of TOTAL due to its engagement in Burma and \nbecause of a televised report showing the intolerable living conditions \nin that country.''\n  In this context, U.S. sanctions are hardly a radical step. In fact, I \nthink it would be an unprecedented embarrassment to all this Nation \nrepresents to fall behind the European effort in supporting Burma's \nfreedom.\n  In addition to suggesting that sanctions will only hurt U.S. \nbusiness, opponents of my legislation argue economic progress will \nyield political results. This is Vietnam, they say. Burma is like \nChina.\n  Well, I am a vocal advocate of MFN for China. I have supported \nnormalizing relations with Vietnam. In both instances, we have \neffectively used an economic wedge to pry open access to totally closed \nsocieties. Trade is an important tool in these two cases because it is \nour only tool.\n  Burma is quite different. In Burma, millions of people turned out to \nvote for the NLD. The fact that they were robbed of the reward of free \nand fair elections defines both America's opportunity and obligation.\n  The appropriate analogy with Burma is not China or Vietnam, it is \nSouth Africa where our application of sanctions clearly worked, just \nask Nelson Mandela. That is the course I recommend the United States \npursue.\n  In 1996, the advocates for democracy in Burma are facing the same \nchallenges as the 1986 opponents of apartheid. I heard exactly the same \narguments then, as I do now. Let me draw some parallels for you.\n\n  When Senators Roth, Dodd, and I introduced the first sanctions bill a \ndecade ago, both the Reagan administration and the business community \nargued the political value of our sizable capital investment.\n  U.S. investment was a meaningful catalyst for change. Major American \ncorporations called attention to their hiring policies, scholarship \nprograms, and contributions to hospitals, schools, and community \ndevelopment projects.\n  In sum, I was told that withdrawing U.S. investment would hurt, not \nhelp, the common man. Not so, says Bishop Tutu. In an April letter to \nthe Bay Area Burma Roundtable he said, ``The victory over apartheid in \nSouth Africa bears eloquent testimony to the effectiveness of economic \nsanctions.''\n  There are other, relevant parallels.\n  South Africa was the African fault line in our cold war struggle for \npower. With Soviet proxy forces engaged in neighboring conflicts in \nAngola and Mozambique, South Africa assumed an important position in \nour regional security strategy.\n  The Chinese colonization of Burma should sound similar alarms. If \nthere is a single issue which should cause our ASEAN partners deep \nconcern, it is the expanding military and political ties between \nRangoon and Beijing. Like South Africa, Burma may not represent an \nimmediate security problem, but the long term regional trends demand \nour attention.\n  In South Africa, there was a grassroots, well-organized, vocal \nAfrican-American constituency supporting sanctions.\n  In Burma, the constituency should be every American community \nconcerned by our drug epidemic.\n  In South Africa, good corporate citizens developed a corporate \nconscience and pulled out.\n  In Burma, Amoco, Columbia Sportswear, Macys, Eddie Bauer, Liz \nClaiborne, Levi Strauss, and now Pepsi have answered the call to \ndivest.\n  In South Africa, sanctions affected substantial, longstanding foreign \ninvestment.\n  In Burma, less is at stake and sanctions are largely preemptive.\n  But, American investment--however little--is still propping up a few \ngenerals. We are not improving the quality of life for most Burmese. \nU.S. capital is simply subsidizing global shopping sprees for a handful \nof SLORC officials and their families.\n  Just as SLORC has increased pressure on Burma's democracy movement, \nwe must increase pressure on SLORC. I believe the time has come to ban \nU.S. investment and aid and oppose any international lending to this \npariah regime. We should cut off the source of SLORC's power.\n\n  Several weeks ago, Suu Kyi noted:\n\n       There is a danger that those who believe economic reforms \n     will bring political progress to Burma are unaware of the \n     difficulties in the way of democratization. Economics and \n     politics cannot be separated, and economic reforms alone \n     cannot bring democratization to Burma.\n\n  She has emphatically opposed any foreign investment, calling instead \nfor the international community to take firm steps to implement the \n1990 elections. And, while she has stressed the NLD's commitment to \nsolving political problems through dialogue, she recently warned the \nworld that she was not prepared to stand idly by as SLORC attacked her \nsupporters.\n  Shortly after these remarks, SLORC surrounded her compound with razor \nwire, effectively cutting off the thousands of loyal and peaceful \ncitizens who make a weekly pilgrimage to hear her speak.\n  Suu Kyi is prepared to accept her rearrest. Although she is under \nconstant surveillance and severely limited in her movements, she has \nnot chosen to join her husband and children in exile. Aung San Suu Kyi \nhas sacrificed over and over again to secure Burma's freedom.\n  Let us hope it will not take the sacrifice of her life to impel this \nadministration to assume the mantle of leadership, fitting for the only \nremaining superpower, and chart a course for the ship we captain called \nliberty.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will reserve the 45 seconds.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 53 seconds.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thomas \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Cohen amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as my friend from Kentucky has indicated, \nwe have to set aside ideology on this particular vote, that and labels. \nHe would have you believe that those who support the Cohen-Feinstein-\nChafee amendment are for repression, for dictators, for brutality, for \nhouse arrests, against sanctions, against morality, against protecting \nAung San Suu Kyi, against democracy.\n  My friends, it is not nearly so simple. And perhaps I have overstated \nthe\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\nstatements of my friend from Kentucky, but when we have allegations \nmade that this is a profound moral choice, that this measure that I \noffer would, in fact, negate the impact of sanctions upon this \nparticular regime, that it would lend support to the military junta--\nand we have heard statements made by our colleague from New York that \nadoption of the Cohen amendment would, in fact, aid and comfort the \nenemies of democracy--I must speak out with some vigor on such \nsuggestions, or even implication.\n  We heard talk about the European Parliament boycotting Burma. Well, \nthe European Union said no. As a matter of fact, there is a report in \npapers as of yesterday: ``A Danish proposal for sanctions against Burma \nwas toned down last week to one condemning the Government of SLORC.'' \nSo they toned it down from sanctions to simply condemning, and we \ncondemn them.\n  It was said that Mickey Kantor favors the subcommittee's approach, \nour Trade Representative favors it. I do not understand that. We have a \nletter introduced on behalf of the administration that the White House \nsupports the approach that I and Senators Feinstein and Chafee and \nothers have taken.\n  No one has fought harder, if we talk about ideals, than our colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain. He spent more than 6 years in prison \nkeeping that flame of idealism alive, representing this country in a \nway that few of us can even begin to contemplate, and yet he is \nsupporting the approach that I am suggesting.\n  Those of us who are urging the support of this amendment are, in \nfact, calling for sanctions. We are calling upon our administration to \nimpose sanctions, to not issue visas--except those required by treaty--\nto any government official from Burma. We are insisting that we cast a \nvote of ``no'' on any international lending organization loans to \nBurma. We are saying that if they make any attempt to imprison or \nharass Aung San Suu Kyi, sanctions go into effect immediately, that no \nfurther business can enter that particular country.\n  We are for sanctions. We are for, however, limited exemptions in the \nfield of human rights, certainly for humanitarian assistance. Does \nanyone here want to cut off an attempt to feed starving people?\n  On counternarcotics: We have heard by just the last vote, an \noverwhelming vote, of our concern about narcotics coming into this \ncountry. Over two-thirds of all the heroin production in the world is \ncoming out of Burma, are we saying let us walk away? Do we not want to \nengage in any way, even if it is certified by the administration that \nthe SLORC is cooperating to try to reduce the flow of narcotics coming \ninto our country? Is that what we want to go on record in favor of? Do \nwe want to deny funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, \norganizations that people like Senator McCain are actively involved in, \nthat actively promote change by the Burmese junta?\n  My amendment tries to carve out a narrow exemption to give some \nflexibility to this administration or the next administration, not \nsimply to look to the past and punish this junta for past deeds, but \nrather to see if there is any way we can use whatever leverage we have, \nand it is very small, to encourage this junta to come into the 21st \ncentury of pro-democratic activity.\n\n  It has been suggested that we have commercial interests in mind. I do \nnot represent any oil companies. I do not have any business interests \nin mind. What I am asking is, what is the most effective way to produce \nchange? Do sanctions work? Yes and no. They worked in South Africa \nbecause the world supported it. The frontline countries in Africa \nsupported it. The frontline countries in Asia do not support this \naction by the subcommittee. Iran is another exception where sanctions \ncan and do work. It is a terrorist-sponsoring nation, destabilizing its \nregion, and so there is world condemnation of Iran.\n  And China, let me just mention China. Mr. President, I was looking \nthrough my desk here while the debate was going on, and I came across \nsome interesting remarks made by my former colleague from Maine, \nSenator Mitchell, some years ago in 1991-92, when debating China. He \nsaid something at that time that I think may bear some relevance here \ntoday. He said:\n\n       The year-long renewal of most-favored-nation trade status \n     for China has brought the world precisely nothing in the way \n     of reform in the Chinese regime.\n       It has not encouraged the Chinese regime to respect the \n     human rights of any Chinese citizen.\n       It has not emboldened the Chinese Government to broaden its \n     experiments with a market economy beyond one province.\n\n  That was said back in 1991, and then again in 1992. He may have been \nright at that time as far as his perception, but things have changed in \nChina. They are now, in fact, making changes in Shanghai. They are now \nproviding a legal system based upon ours, they are giving an accused \nindividual a right to an attorney before he can be arrested and \napprehended. They are making vast changes. It comes about more slowly \nthere, not nearly as fast as we would like, but change has occurred.\n  Yes, we are standing up to our ideals on the issue of democracy in \nAsia, but when you talk to the Chinese they say, you talk about ideals. \nFor 200 years you enslaved people. You put people in chains. You \ntreated them like subhumans. You robbed them of their families and \ntheir dignity and their lives, and it was not until about 30 years ago \nyou finally decided to change. Give us an opportunity to bring about \nchange in this region. Do not lecture us that you achieved your ideals \nall in one period of time.\n  So it took time for us to change over here. What we are saying with \nour amendment is that we can make more change in Burma from within than \nfrom without, and we can bring Burma out from the dark ages of \nrepression into the sunlight of the 21st century and prodemocratic \nactivity. We can do this not by trying to turn away, and trying to \nisolate them--because we cannot do it effectively--but by having some \nlimited contact from within.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that the passage of my amendment will \naccomplish the goals that we all want to change the military \ndictatorship's activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend \nfrom Maine, his amendment makes everything permissible or able to be \nwaived. There is no indication that this administration is interested, \nand, frankly, nor was the last one, in tightening the screws on Burma. \nIf we want to do something about a pariah regime in Burma, tonight is \nthe time. This is the vote. I hope all my colleagues will oppose the \nCohen amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of boycott \nresolutions, a list of letters supporting sanctions, and a group of \neditorials, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Boycott Resolutions\n\n       American Baptist Convention.\n       State of Massachusetts.\n       San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, CA.\n       Santa Monica, CA.\n       Ann Arbor, MI.\n       Chicago, IL.\n       Madison, WI.\n       Seattle, WA.\n\n                      Letters Supporting Sanctions\n\n       National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma\n       AFL-CIO\n       UAW\n       Bishop Tutu\n       Betty Williams, Huntsville, TX, Nobel Laureate, 1976\n       Asia American Civic Alliance of Florida\n       Kachinland Projects for Human Rights and Democracy of \n     Illinois\n       Democratic Burmese Student Organization\n       United Front for Democracy and Human Rights\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From The Boston Globe, June 19, 1996]\n\n                           Weld's Opportunity\n\n       Awaiting Gov. William F. Weld's signature is a bill that \n     would prohibit the commonwealth from purchasing goods or \n     services from companies that do business with the \n     illegitimate military dictatorship ruling Burma. Weld should \n     sign this bill, not because it might work to his advantage in \n     the U.S. Senate contest with John F. Kerry, but because this \n     is legislation that embodies a principle of democratic \n     solidarity rooted deep in the American tradition.\n       The people of Burma voted overwhelmingly in 1990 for the \n     party of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Although \n     her National League for Democracy won more than 80 percent of \n     the seats in Parliament, the State Law and Order Restoration \n     Council, or SLORC, thwarted the will of\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\n     the voters by seizing power and conducting a reign of terror. \n     The junta profits from a narcotics trade that exports more \n     than 60 percent of the heroin sold on the streets of American \n     cities. And because the uniformed thugs of SLORC have \n     accumulated tremendous debt, they are dependent upon foreign \n     aid and investment and are desperately trying to counter a \n     grass-roots campaign for American sanctions.\n       The timing of Weld's opportunity could not be more \n     fortuitous. State Rep. Byron Rushing's Selective \n     Contracting'' bill, modeled on legislation that helped end \n     apartheid in South Africa, reaches the governor at a time \n     when thousands of Burmese democrats have been risking their \n     lives each weekend to attend gatherings at Suu Kyi's house in \n     Rangoon, and when the Clinton administration has dispatched \n     envoys to Asian and European capitals to make the case for \n     multilateral sanctions.\n       If the envoys fail in their mission, a Senate bill proposed \n     by Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and co-sponsored \n     by Democrats Patrick Moynihan of New York and Patrick Leahy \n     of Vermont, will ask the United States to take the lead, as \n     it once did for the people of Poland.\n       Weld has a chance to help protect Suu Kyi and her followers \n     and to encourage Washington to do the right thing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 15, 1996]\n\n                           Burmese Repression\n\n       The Burmese military junta has outdone itself in \n     advertising its own crude ineptitude. Frustrated by the \n     popularity and prestige of their democratic opponent, Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, the generals have now erected huge red \n     billboards denouncing the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate as a \n     foreign stooge. But every Burmese knows that Mrs. Aung San \n     Suu Kyi endured years of house arrest rather than leave the \n     country her father helped free from foreign rule. The real \n     threat to the Burmese people is the junta, formally known as \n     the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc.\n       The billboard blitz follows the recent detention of some \n     250 members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for \n     Democracy, the undoubted winner of 1990 elections the Slorc \n     then nullified. When, despite the crackdown, she attracted \n     larger and larger crowds for speeches from her house, the \n     junta responded with a decree banning virtually all political \n     activities. So unwarranted were these measures that even \n     diffident Thailand and Japan have condemned Burmese human \n     rights abuses. Japan is the largest outside aid donor to the \n     country the Slorc has renamed Myanmar.\n       Washington has commendably taken the lead in generating \n     support for more effective collective measures to help the \n     beleaguered Burmese democrats. The Clinton Administration has \n     sent two senior diplomats, William Brown and Stanley Roth, to \n     sound out Myanmar's neighbors on taking stronger political \n     and economic measures against the Slorc. The mission itself \n     may help deter still harsher repression. Its findings may \n     also determine the feasibility of a ban on new American \n     investment, as proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell of \n     Kentucky, which the Administration is still weighing.\n       When the Slorc lifted Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest \n     last year, there was hope that the generals might loosen \n     their stranglehold on Myanmar. Unhappily, that has not proved \n     to be the case. Until the Burmese junta frees its political \n     prisoners and enters into genuine negotiations with Mrs. Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and her supporters, it merits the strongest \n     international condemnation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 1996]\n\n                         Burma Beyond the Pale\n\n       On June 22, James ``Leo'' Nichols, 65, died in the Burmese \n     prison. His crime--for which he had been jailed for six \n     weeks, deprived of needed heart medication and perhaps \n     tortured with sleep deprivation--was ownership of a fax \n     machine. His true sin, in the eyes of the military dictators \n     who are running the beautiful and resource-rich country of \n     Burma into the ground, was friendship with Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     the courageous woman who won an overwhelming victory in \n     democratic elections six years ago but has been denied power \n     ever since.\n       Mr. Nichols's story is not unusual in Burma. The regime has \n     imprisoned hundreds of democracy activists and press-ganged \n     thousands of children and adults into slave labor. It \n     squanders huge sums of arms imported from China while leading \n     the world in heroin exports. But because Mr. Nichols had \n     served as consul for Switzerland and three Scandinavian \n     countries, his death or murder attracted more attention in \n     Europe. The European Parliament condemned the regime and \n     called for its economic and diplomatic isolation, to include \n     a cutoff of trade and investment. Two European breweries, \n     Carlsberg and Heineken, have said they will pull out of \n     Burma. And a leading Danish pension fund sold off its \n     holdings in Total, a French company that with the U.S. firm \n     Unocal is the biggest foreign investor.\n       These developments undercut those who have said the United \n     States should not support democracy in Burma because it would \n     be acting alone. In fact, strong U.S. action could resonate \n     and spur greater solidarity in favor of Nobel peace laureate \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and her rightful government. Already, the \n     Burmese currency has been tumbling, reflecting nervousness \n     about the regime's stability and the potential effects of a \n     Western boycott.\n       The United States has banned aid and multilateral loans to \n     the regime, but the junta still refuses to begin a dialogue \n     with Auug San Suu Kyi. Now there is an opportunity to send a \n     stronger message. The Senate next week is scheduled to \n     consider a pro-sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Mitch \n     McConnell (R-KY.) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). This \n     would put Washington squarely on the side of the democrats. \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will meet next \n     week with counterparts from Burma's neighbors, should \n     challenge them to take stronger measures, since their policy \n     of ``constructive engagement'' has so clearly failed.\n       The most eloquent call for action came last week from Aung \n     San Suu Kyi herself, unbowed despite years of house arrest \n     and enforced separation from her husband and children. In a \n     video smuggled out, she called for ``the kind of sanctions \n     that will make it quite clear that economic change in Burma \n     is not possible without political change.'' The word \n     responded to similar calls from Nelson Mandela and Lech \n     Walesa. In memory of Mr. Nichols and his many unnamed \n     compatriots, it should do no less now.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 28, 1996]\n\n                          The Bullies of Burma\n\n       The thuggish military men who rule Burma have now rounded \n     up more than 200 democracy activists who were planning to \n     meet last weekend. Again they show their regime, which goes \n     by the appropriately unappetizing acronym SLORC (State Law \n     and Order Restoration Council), to be worthy only of \n     international contempt.\n       To the extent that Americans are at all familiar with \n     Burma's plight, it is thanks to the courage of Aung San Suu \n     Kyi, leader of the nation's democracy movement. Her National \n     League for Democracy won an overwhelming victory in \n     parliamentary elections in 1990, but SLORC refused to give up \n     power, putting her under house arrest and jailing many of her \n     colleagues. Although Aung San Suu Kyi was nominally freed \n     last July, after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the regime \n     has refused even to begin talks on a transition to democratic \n     rule.\n       It was to celebrate, as it were, the sixth anniversary of \n     those betrayed elections that Aung San Suu Kyi called a \n     meeting. In fear of the democrats' popularity, SLORC rounded \n     up many of her supporters, including should-be members of \n     parliament. This is far from SLORC's only abuse. Even before \n     the latest events, hundreds of political prisoners remained \n     in jail, according to Human Rights Watch/Asia. The regime \n     promotes forced labor, press-ganging citizens to act as \n     porters in areas of armed conflict and to build roads, \n     according to the U.S. State Department. It has built a \n     massive army, equipped mostly by China. And Burma is the \n     world's chief source of heroin.\n       The United States already has barred official aid or \n     government loans to Burma and has influenced the World Bank \n     and other multilateral organizations to follow suit. Now Sen. \n     Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wants to bar private investment \n     as well, a step supported by many of Burma's democrats. U.S. \n     firms are the third-largest investors, Sen. McConnell said, \n     led by Unocal Corp., which is helping develop Burma's natural \n     gas fields. The structure of the dictatorship ensures that \n     much of the benefit of foreign investment goes into the \n     generals' pockets.\n       The most active proponents of trade, investment and \n     engagement with Burma have been its neighbors in Southeast \n     Asia. A nation of 42 million with high literacy rates and \n     abundant natural resources, Burma cannot be ignored. But \n     after SLORC's latest abuses, the burden is on those advocates \n     of ``engagement'' to show what they have achieved and explain \n     why sanctions should not be tightened. As much as South \n     Africa under apartheid, Burma deserves to be a pariah until \n     SLORC has given way.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is all time used up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate today is considering an $11 \nbillion foreign aid appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. To hear \nthe almost hysterical hue and cry about the so called devastating cuts \nin foreign aid--which is simply not so--some Americans may be misled to \nbelieve that the Agency for International Development [AID] will go \nbroke if it does not receive its $7.5 billion portion of this expensive \nforeign aid pie.\n  That, as I say, is simply not true--it is not even in the ballpark of \naccuracy. You see, Mr. President, much of this foreign aid money--all \nof it taken from the pockets of the hardworking American people--will \nbe sitting for the next several years in what is known in Washington as \na pipeline. This pipeline, which today contains more than $6.7 billion, \nwill allow AID to continue its spending orgy for years to come--even if \nCongress cut every penny from AID's budget this year. Simply put, this \npipeline is the best-kept secret among the bureaucrats at the Agency \nfor International Development--the foreign aid giveaway mechanism.\n  The pending amendment, which I am offering on behalf of myself and \nthe distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, proposes to reduce the \namount of money in the AID pipeline by requiring that all money \nremaining for more than 4 fiscal years in the pipeline be returned to \nthe U.S. Treasury. In its study of Agency for International \nDevelopment's pipeline, the General Accounting Office has recommended \nthat un-used foreign aid be returned after 2 years. If enacted, this \namendment would cut nearly $1 billion from foreign aid.\n  Mr. President, you see that $3.2 billion provided by Congress to AID \nin fiscal year 1995 remains unspent; more than $1.6 billion from fiscal \nyear 1994 has yet to be spent. This hidden reservoir of funds dates \nback even to foreign aid approved by Congress in 1985--more than a \ndecade ago--which has been reposing all the while in the pipeline.\n  Why does all this money remain in the pipeline? Well, according to a \n1991 General Accounting Office study, half of this money is unspent due \nto unrealistic or deliberately overstated project assessments by AID \nemployees. But there is another reason for the existence of this \npipeline. AID simply has received too much money over the years and, \nrather than admit that it cannot spend the money wisely, AID \nbureaucrats simply have stashed the money away in its secret \nbureaucratic pipeline until someone figures out a creative way to give \nit away.\n  Larry Byrne, AID's assistant administrator for management, in a 1995 \ninternal E-mail spoke volumes about how the AID does business. \nAccording to Mr. Byrne, AID is ``62 percent through this fiscal year \nand we have 38 percent of the dollar volume of procurement actions \ncompleted; we need to do $1.9 billion in the next 5 months. So let's \nget moving.'' This AID administrator, Mr. Byrne, warned that this money \nin the AID pipeline, ``imperils our ability to argue we need more \nmoney.''\n  Lest anyone believe that this huge pipeline is merely an isolated \nproblem, perhaps some details regarding AID's pipeline in various \ncountries will be of interest. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthis chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         AID'S HIDDEN SLUSH FUND                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Country                       Pipeline through 1996   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEgypt.....................................  $1.93 billion               \nRussia....................................  566 million                 \nPhillipines...............................  330 million                 \nUkraine...................................  217 million                 \nSouth Africa..............................  205 million                 \nIndia.....................................  102 million                 \n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\n                                                                        \nMozambique................................  72 million                  \nPeru......................................  71 million                  \nBolivia...................................  63 million                  \nBangladesh................................  59 million                  \n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total AID pipeline..................  6.76 billion                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: AID Fiscal Year 1996 Statistical Annex.                         \n\n\n  Mr. HELMS. So, Mr. President, this pipeline affects almost all of the \n101 countries to which AID hands out the American taxpayers' money. For \nexample, the pending bill provides more than $800 million in economic \naid to Egypt, despite the fact that more than $1.9 billion in \npreviously-appropriated foreign aid, lingers to this day in Egypt's \npipeline. This bill allows more money for Russia--yet this nation has \nalready received, but not yet spent, $566 million in United States \nforeign aid. India has $102 million in un-used foreign aid. At the \ncurrent rate of spending all new foreign aid obligations to India could \ncease and it could still receive United States foreign aid \nuninterrupted for at least 3 more years.\n  The list goes on and on. The Philippines has $330 million in unspent \nUnited States foreign aid; Peru has $71 million. All told, a whopping \n$6.7 billion in U.S. tax dollars--some more than a decade old--remains \nunspent. The pending amendment proposes that $1 billion in surplus \nforeign aid will be returned to the Treasury, thereby reducing the \namount Americans are forced to pay for the spiraling Federal debt.\n  I will conclude by providing what I consider one of the most \negregious abuses of AID pipeline. In 1991--5 years ago--President Bush \nordered all foreign aid to Pakistan be ceased because of that nation's \ndevelopment of a nuclear bomb. Apparently, the bureaucrats at the \nAgency for International Development did not get the message because, \nas recently as 1995, AID spent more than $27 million for projects in \nPakistan. This year, AID plans to provide more than another $5 million. \nSo, despite the President's decision to cut all foreign aid to Pakistan \nin 1991, AID's pipeline continues to gush with surplus giveaway money \nthat the American taxpayers have been forced to provide.\n  Mr. President, the American taxpayers have been forced to provide \nmore than $250 billion in development and economic aid since AID was \ncreated, as a temporary agency in 1961. And AID certainly appears to be \ndoling out cash to any number of nations around the world by making \ncertain that this pipeline of foreign aid will continue to flow well \ninto the next century.\n  Mr. President, I submit that it's high time that we do something for \nAmericans. This amendment offers a fine opportunity: It will return to \nthe U.S. Treasury $1 billion in unspent--and unneeded--foreign aid.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5080\n\n   (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate in opposition to the \n military overthrow of the government of Burundi and to encourage the \n  swift and prompt end to the current crisis, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       The Senate finds that:\n       The political situation in the African nation of Burundi \n     has deteriorated and there are reports of a military coup \n     against the elected government of Burundi, and;\n       The continuing ethnic conflict in Burundi has caused untold \n     suffering among the people of Burundi and has resulted in the \n     deaths of over 150,000 people in the past two years, and;\n       The attempt to overthrow the government of Burundi makes \n     the possibility of an increase in the tension and the \n     continued slaughter of innocent civilians more likely, and;\n       The United States and the International Community have an \n     interest in ending the crisis in Burundi before it reaches \n     the level of violence that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 when \n     over 800,000 people died in the war between the Hutu and the \n     Tutsi tribes,\n       Now, therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       The United States Senate condemns any violent action \n     intended to overthrow the government of Burundi, and;\n       Calls on all parties to the conflict in Burundi to exercise \n     restraint in an effort to restore peace, and\n       Urges the Administration to continue diplomatic efforts at \n     the highest level to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis \n     in Burundi.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5081\n\n(Purpose: To provide for $15,000,000 earmarked for the American Schools \n  and Hospitals Abroad Program from the Development Assistant Account)\n\n       On page 107, line 25, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, not less than $15,000,000 \n     shall be available only for the American Schools and \n     Hospitals Abroad program under section 214 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5082\n\n (Purpose: To provide for $5,000,000 earmarked for a land and resource \n  management institute to identify nuclear contamination at Chernobyl)\n\n       On page 107, line 25, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, $5,000,000 shall be \n     available only for a land and resource management institute \n     to identify nuclear contamination at Chernobyl.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay those motions on the table.\n  The motions to lay on the table were agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5026, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to modify amendment No. 5026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 148, line 10 through line 13, strike the following \n     language, ``That comparable requirements of any similar \n     provision in any other Act shall be applicable only to the \n     extent that funds appropriated by this Act have been \n     previously authorized: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \ncomplete the debate on Senator Brown's NATO amendment, that we lay that \naside, and proceed to the debate on the Coverdell amendment, with 40 \nminutes equally divided, at which point we proceed to two rollcall \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly do not want to hold up the \nSenate. I would be happy to work out anything that is fair to the \nparties. I have a statement on an amendment that the managers accepted. \nI would be happy to do it tomorrow or after--I need about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could just indicate to the Senate, there is a \ngood chance that the two votes I just mentioned are the last two \nrollcall votes before final passage. So we are getting very close to \nthe end.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator from Colorado will be speaking to this. The Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Colorado and I have worked out the \nproblems that we had with the Brown amendment. I understood the \nunanimous consent to include that as a rollcall vote. It is not my \ndesire to have a rollcall required. The Senator from Colorado is \nplanning on modifying his amendment, so I believe it would be wise to \nwithhold any request for a unanimous consent for a rollcall vote until \nsuch time as the amendment is modified.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I know the leader has a lot \nof things to do. Everyone has places to go. I have been around here all \nday. As I indicated, if I could have some time tomorrow to do this, I \nwill do it, or some time at a reasonable hour of the night. But I am \nnot going to agree to final passage until I make a statement on \nsomething I think is extremely important.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object on two\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\npoints. The first, like the Senator from Nevada, I rise in part to \nthank the managers of the bill for accepting earlier in the day an \namendment I offered with several colleagues to draw attention to the \ncontinuing freedom of indicted war criminals in Bosnia, and to urge we \ncontinue to make their apprehension and movement to the Hague a \npriority for all signatories.\n  I appreciate if at some point, either before final passage or as the \nSenator from Nevada has indicated, on a date certain tomorrow, to be \nable to speak at greater length on that matter.\n  Reserving the right to object, if I may ask the Senator from \nKentucky, through the Chair, along with several colleagues I filed an \namendment to reallocate funds for the Korean Peninsula Energy \nDevelopment Organization. These two colleagues I believe were \nconsidering a second-degree amendment, and I wanted to state to the \nSenator from Kentucky with respect to that, I intend and hope to raise \nthat matter before final passage.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let my say I am aware that is not quite \ntied up yet. My understanding was those discussions were underway.\n  With regard to the Senator from Nevada, there will be an opportunity \nfor him to speak tonight, but I would like to move ahead on the votes. \nThere will be plenty of opportunity to speak tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Further reserving the right to object, I am willing to come \nin early some time tomorrow for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator from Kentucky add to his \nrequest that before we start the Coverdell and the other matters, that \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, would have 2 minutes to \nspeak on an amendment that has already been accepted.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman be allowed to proceed for 2 minutes on an amendment we just \npassed, prior to the time running on the Brown NATO amendment and the \nCoverdell amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again, am I going to be allowed to speak, \nthen, before final passage?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We do not have a time set for final passage. It should \nbe no problem.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5080\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to just speak very briefly \nabout the amendment that was earlier agreed to here in the Senate. It \nis an amendment cosponsored by Senator Kassebaum, Senator Simon, and \nSenator Feingold. The purpose of it was to express the sense of the \nSenate in opposition to the military overthrow of the Government of \nBurundi, to encourage the swift and prompt end of the current crisis, \nand for other purposes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the current situation in \nBurundi and the growing evidence that the international community may \nsoon face a disaster similar to that which occurred in Rwanda in 1994 \nand to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution condemning the reported \ncoup that is occurring today in Burundi.\n  Just this past Saturday, 300 people, the majority of whom were women \nand children, were slaughtered as part of the continuing violence \nbetween the Hutu and Tutsi in Burundi. Survivor accounts revealed that \nmany of those killed had their hands and feet tied before being shot in \nthe back of the head. The rest were hacked to death with machetes.\n  Mr. President, those 300 join the estimated 150,000 who have been \nmurdered over the 2\\1/2\\ years in this small African nation. Those \n150,000 join the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 who died in the horrible \nkilling between Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda in less than 2 months in 1994. \nTogether, almost the equivalent of the population of my home State of \nNew Mexico have died in this troubled part of the world.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the apathy we see regarding the \ncurrent situation. I am also concerned about the lack of a concerted \ninternational effort to prevent another situation like that which \noccurred in Rwanda in this region.\n  On Tuesday, the headline in the Washington Post read, Killings Elicit \nShock, but No U.N. Action. The article noted that this weekend's \nmassacre of 300 women and children elicited expressions of horror from \nthe members of the Security Council but that none of the member \nnations, including the United States, gave any sign that the United \nNations might take action to halt the killing. Yesterday it was \nreported that the President of Burundi had taken refuge in the U.S. \nAmbassador's residence. This take place amid reports of the massive \ndeportation of Hutu refugees from northern Burundi. Just this morning, \nReuters is reporting that the army has seized power, outlawed political \nparties and closed the airport and land borders.\n  To even a casual viewer it seems clear that Burundi is now on a fast \nslide down the precipice that its neighbor, Rwanda, slid down in 1994. \nAs Pope John Paul said yesterday, ``Burundi continues to sink into an \nabyss of violence whose victims are drawn from among the weakest in \nsociety--children, women and the old. I cannot but state my horror.''\n  Mr. President, in 1994, after the plane carrying the Presidents of \nRwanda and Burundi was shot down, the world stood silent while Rwanda \nexploded in almost unspeakable violence.\n  While I commend the administration for the diplomatic initiatives it \nhas undertaken prior to this week's events, in particular the \nappointment of former Congressman Howard Wolpe to the position of \nspecial negotiator for Burundi and Rwanda, those efforts have not been \nenough. The administration's attention must now be refocused on this \ncrisis. And while there have been those in Congress like my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Kassebaum, Feingold, and Simon, who have spoken \nabout Burundi and Rwanda, it is now crucial that others begin to stand, \nand speak, with them as well.\n  Mr. President, some of the steps we should be supporting include:\n  Denouncing any extra constitutional seizure of power and making clear \nthat the United States condemns any attempt to take power by illegal \nmeans and will not recognize or support any illegal government.\n  Clearly communicating to the President of Zaire that his support of \nHutu rebels who are using Zaire as a springboard into Burundi where \nthey commit unspeakable atrocities will not be tolerated by the United \nStates.\n  Immediately increasing our diplomatic efforts and conducting those at \na sufficiently high level to make clear that the United States is \nwilling to be engaged in any serious effort at halting the current \ncrisis.\n  Focusing our diplomatic efforts on moving the Organization of African \nUnity and the international community to begin assembling the regional \nrapid reaction force that the former President of Tanzania has \nnegotiated with the Government of Burundi.\n  If the OAU is unable to organize such a force we should be prepared \nto support other efforts by the U.N. to develop an appropriate response \nto this crisis.\n  While I do not believe we should send U.S. ground forces to Burundi, \nI do believe that the United States should be ready to provide support \nto a rapid reaction force in the form of logistical, organizational and \ncommunications resources.\n  Strongly urging President Clinton to speak out once again against the \nviolence in Burundi and make clear to the world that the United States \nhas an interest in preventing another genocide.\n  Mr. President, we need not undertake another Somalia type mission to \nmake a difference in Burundi. It does not require ground troops nor \nwill it require large expenditures. What America can and should \nprovide, however, is leadership and a strong, unwavering voice against \nthe current situation.\n  The Pope spoke yesterday about the evil that is the ethnic hatred in \nBurundi and Rwanda. Today, the U.N. Under Secretary General for \npeacekeeping missions, Kofi Annan, said:\n\n       We have to move very quickly before everything blows up in \n     our faces. As it is, history will judge us rather severely \n     for Rwanda. I don't think we can repeat that experience in \n     Burundi. What we need and what we are seeking now is the \n     political will to act.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree and I think passage of this resolution will \nput the\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nSenate on record as supporting peace in this troubled region.\n  This resolution puts the Senate on record urging action by our \nGovernment at the highest possible diplomatic levels to bring \ninternational attention to this problem, and try to bring peace to the \nsituation there before the situation in Burundi deteriorates into the \nvery kind of tragedy we saw in Rwanda in that same region this last \nyear.\n  Finally, I thank my colleagues for all agreeing to the resolution \nthat we earlier sent to the desk and had approved. I do think it is \nimportant that the Senate speak on this important issue as part of this \nforeign operations bill. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Kentucky in allowing me to speak at this \ntime. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5018\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there are now 40 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Coverdell amendment.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, haggling over this amendment now for \nquite some period of time, I will put this in perspective. This is an \namendment about an epidemic, a drug epidemic that is occurring in the \nUnited States.\n  In the last 36 months, Mr. President, 2 million children in our \ncountry have tragically been embroiled in this drug epidemic. That is 2 \nmillion sisters or brothers, next-door neighbors, because the drug war \nwas shut down. This is but one of many attempts to reenergize our \nbattle at home and abroad to deal with this drug epidemic.\n  In 1992, $462 million was invested in international narcotics law \nenforcement. In fiscal year 1996, it dropped to $135 million. I think \nthe President of the United States has recognized this is a serious \nproblem, both for our country and for his administration. So in the \n1997 budget, he requested that $213 million be invested in the \ninternational narcotics war. In other words, a turnaround. This bill, \nboth House and Senate, undercut that.\n  The effort of this amendment is very simple. It is to simply meet the \nPresident's request to get it up to $213 million. Mr. President, how do \nwe do that? Well, first, in this budget for international operations, \nit appropriates $31 million more than the President requested--more. So \nwe take $25 million of that surplus and move it back to help fill \nPresident Clinton's request for international narcotics law \nenforcement.\n  No. 2, in development assistance, we take a 2 percent across-the-\nboard reduction, $28 million, and move it over to international \nnarcotics, bringing the appropriation for international narcotics and \nlaw enforcement up to the President's request--not a dime more--up to \nthe President's request.\n  Mr. President, the drug war today, for the first time in history, is \nbeing waged against kids. The last drug epidemic involved people 17 to \n21 years of age; this epidemic begins at 8 years old, 8 to 13. They are \nthe target. For us not to meet the President's request for \ninternational narcotics in law enforcement does not meet the test of \nlogic, given what is happening to us in our own country. Millions of \nAmerican families are at risk. Does this solve all of it? No. Is this \nan important piece of it? Yes. I find it somewhat incredulous that we \nare arguing over meeting the President's request--not exceeding it, but \nmeeting it.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think it has been very clearly noted \nthat the essence of this amendment is: If you care about kids and the \nproblems that they are having with drugs, the best place to fight that \neffort is before drugs ever get into this country--keeping the drugs \nout.\n  I strongly support the amendment to restore funding to the \nInternational Narcotics Control budget. In the last several years, \nbeginning in 1993, that budget has been severely cut. Virtually without \ndiscussion the INL budget lost almost 30 percent of its funding in \n1993. Funding in the last several years has been below the levels in \nthe Bush administration. These cuts were in keeping with the \ndowngrading of drug efforts by the Clinton administration. At the time, \nthe administration did virtually nothing to support its own \ninternational counter-narcotics programs in Congress. Although Congress \nrestored some of that funding last year, we still need to close the gap \nto ensure our international programs are adequately supported. This \nyear I also note a surprising invisibility on the part of the \nadministration to promote funding for its own programs.\n  As the task force report on National Drug Strategy notes, our overall \ndrug effort needs to be sustained and it needs to be consistent. The \nadministration, however, has done little to sustain its own programs. \nAnd there has not been much consistency. We must try to change this.\n  I am also aware that some members here feel that international \nprograms do not do much to address the problem. To them I would say \nthat responding to the drug problem in this country is a team effort. \nNo single program is the magic solution to success. The problem is \nmulti-dimensional. Our solutions must also be broad and multi-\ndisciplinary. We cannot expect the small amounts of money, compared to \nthe total, that we spend on international efforts to be the sole star \nof the show. INL programs are a part of the team and we must ensure \nthat it is not the weakest member.\n  I hope that you will join me in voting for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nKansas on the floor. I ask how much time she may wish.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague from Georgia. I certainly would agree \nwith him, and I think we all share a concern about the scope of the \ndrug problem in this country. One cannot help but be disturbed by the \ngrowing use of life-destructive drugs.\n  As someone who cares deeply about the youth of this country, I \ncertainly stand second to none in my concern about the destructive \nimpact of drugs on children. I had worked long in community efforts in \nthis area before I even came to the U.S. Senate. I know something about \nthe different types of initiatives that have been undertaken. I also \nfully agree with the Senator from Georgia that this President has not \noffered the kind of moral leadership on this issue that we both need \nand expect. He has not spoken out forcefully against drugs. He has \ndevoted little time to this issue, and until the appointment of General \nMcCaffrey, he has not supported energetically those in his \nadministration working on this problem.\n  Yet, despite my serious concern about the drug problem in our \ncountry, as well as my dismay about the administration's weak response, \nI must reluctantly oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, as has been pointed out, this amendment would increase \nU.S. spending for antinarcotics by some $53 million over the Senate \nfunding level, a level which is already $45 million over last year's \nspending. If this amendment is approved, the Senate would nearly double \nwhat was spent last year on this program.\n  In a bill where every account has been straight-lined or decreased, \nthere is absolutely no reason to support a dramatic increase for this \nprogram. Let me say why. We all want to help slow the flow of drugs \ninto the United States. I have always been a believer, however, that \nwhere there is a demand, there will be a supply. There is a world of \nmoney to be made in drugs, and until we can address that in each and \nevery one of our communities, we are not going to be able to \neffectively stop the supply into this country.\n  The international antinarcotics program has simply not been an \neffective use of scarce Federal dollars. To date, we have invested \nhundreds of millions of dollars in this effort. Yet, worldwide \nproduction of illicit drugs has increased dramatically. Over the past \ndecade, just 10 years, opium and marijuana production has roughly \ndoubled, and coca production has tripled. For example, since 1990, the \nUnited States has spent over $500 million on\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\nantinarcotics programs in Colombia alone. Yet, drug production in \nColombia remains high, and the administration could not even certify \nColombia as cooperating on antinarcotics programs.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that world production and supply of \nnarcotics vastly exceeds world demand. Even under the best case \nscenario, global supply reductions are unlikely to have even a minimal \neffect on our domestic drug problem.\n  I fully appreciate the sentiments of my colleague from Georgia, and I \nagree with him. We all understand the destructive power of drugs, and \nwe all want to end the flow of narcotics into the United States. But \nthrowing more and more money at failed solutions simply does not make \nsense. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Coverdell amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been working very diligently with a \nnumber of Senators and the Democratic leader to reach some unanimous \nconsent agreements that are very important for the body. If the Members \nwill give me a few minutes, we can go through a number of these. The \ntime will not count against anyone's time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time not \nbe taken out of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8781-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8820-S8821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HEALTH COVERAGE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendments with respect to H.R. 3103, the health care \nreform bill, the Senate agree to the request for a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Roth, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Lott, \nMr. Kennedy, and Mr. Moynihan conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we go to the other unanimous-consent \nrequests, I again want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader for \nhis efforts in this. He has worked very hard to get a medical savings \naccount agreement. Senator Kennedy has been involved in that. Senator \nKassebaum has been very helpful in working to get a medical savings \naccount agreement. We did come to an understanding on medical savings \naccounts, today. Therefore, we now can go forward with appointing \nconferees to resolve the balance of the issues. I am prepared to give \nto the Democratic leader the language that we will be working on in \nconference as soon as we complete these unanimous-consent requests.\n  Would the Democratic leader like to comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have more to say about this later \non this evening. But let me just take a moment at this point to thank \nthe distinguished majority leader for the effort that he has put forth \nover the last couple of weeks in particular. Were it not for the \ncooperation that we were able to demonstrate on both sides, especially \nfrom the majority leader, I do not know that we would be here tonight.\n  Let me also compliment the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. \nNo one has been more relentless and more cooperative and more helpful \nin providing us with ways in which to resolve the many complicated \naspects to this negotiated settlement than has the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts. I thank him, as well as the chair of the \ncommittee, the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  This has been a very cooperative effort in the last several days. It \nhas taken a lot to get to this point. We are here, and I applaud all of \nthose who had a part to play in it, in particular the majority leader \nand the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join in commending both the \nmajority leader and the minority leader for giving such support and \nencouragement towards reaching this important agreement which hopefully \nwill free us to move forward on the underlying issue, which is \nportability and the elimination of the preexisting condition for \nmillions of Americans. This is legislation that reflected strong \nbipartisan support under the leadership of Senator Kassebaum and the \nRepublicans and Democrats on that committee.\n  I think this agreement, which includes a real, fair test of some \n750,000 policies and other consumer protections, will, I think, provide \nfor a test of this concept. But most importantly, what it will do is \nmove us closer to the day when we can provide for the 25 million \nAmericans that have preexisting conditions and for the millions of \nAmericans who want portability to achieve this goal.\n  This has been a time where there has been strong views on certain \nissues. But I think it is a real tribute to both of our leaders and the \npersistence of Senator Kassebaum, as well as the leadership of Mr. \nArcher over in the House of Representatives, that we have been able to \nmove this process forward.\n  I want to say how much I look forward to working with the majority \nleader and the other conferees to moving to the conclusion of the \nconference. But I join others in thanking Senator Lott and Senator \nKassebaum--and Senator Daschle, who has been such a strong supporter of \nmoving this process forward. I thank them for their very strong support \nfor this conclusion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on \nits amendments with respect to H.R. 3448, the small business tax relief \npackage, the Senate then agree to the request for a conference with the \nHouse, and the chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer (Mr. Bennett) \nappointed, from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Mrs. \nKassebaum, Mr. Jeffords, and Kennedy, and from the Committee \non Finance, Mr. Roth, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Simpson, \nMr. Pressler, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. \nRockefeller conferees on the part of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been working with \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee and Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, \nand Reid, with regard to an issue involved in this conference. And the \nchairman of the Finance Committee has assured me, Senator D'Amato, and \nSenator Moynihan that the language, under this legislation, with regard \nto electric and gas utilities that are eligible for the two-county \nlocal furnishing rule under current law, will not cause them to lose \ntheir ability to issue tax-exempt bonds, including their ability to \nexpand service within the counties and the cities they presently serve.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I indicated to both New York Senators my \ndesire to work with the majority leader to ensure that we are able to \naddress their concerns to their satisfaction. I am sure that we can do \nthat, and we will work with the two Senators from New York to make that \na part of whatever agreement we reach in conference.\n  Let me also say that with regard to both conferences, the \ndistinguished majority leader has indicated his desire to make these \ntruly bipartisan conferences. He has given me that assurance on the \nfloor on a number of occasions. He has related and reiterated his \ndetermination to make that happen privately to me on many occasions.\n  So, indeed, my expectation is that in both of these conferences we \nwill have true bipartisanship in an effort to involve every Member of \nthese delegations. That is the reason we appoint both Democrats and \nRepublicans. I am very hopeful that our work can proceed in a way that \nwill allow us to complete the work on these bills sometime in the very \nnear future. Working together, I am quite sure that can happen.\n  Again, I appreciate his assurances that we will see that \nbipartisanship through the deliberations of both of these conferences.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to that. First, the \nconferees on the welfare reform package did meet today--both parties--\nand I understand they are going to be meeting again in the morning, to \nwork through the differences between the two bodies.\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\n  In the case of health insurance reform, the small business tax relief \npackage, and the minimum wage issue, I do not see any way it could be \nconcluded without bipartisan cooperation. In fact, we would not have \nbeen able to appoint these conferees tonight without a lot of \ncooperation across the aisle in the Senate and the bicameral \ncooperation on the other side.\n  When the Congressman from Texas, Mr. Archer, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, can get together, I think we all can \nget together. These conferences will proceed in this bipartisan and \nbicameral manner.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to join in thanking both leaders in moving us \nforward, particularly on the minimum wage. I think all of us \nunderstand--there is virtually no difference--that we accept the House \nprovisions on the minimum wage. We will have to make sure that we have \na date for enactment in a timely way. I had hoped that we would be able \nto do that with a 30-day provision in there. We have done it in as \nshort as 23 days in other times when we have had the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  I want to join with Senator Daschle and others to say that these \nworkers have waited a long time. And I am very, very hopeful that we \ncan get to the conference and move ahead so that we complete the \nconference to at least try to make sure that the working families are \ngoing to get that raise hopefully by Labor Day or very shortly \nthereafter.\n  I thank the majority leader and Senator Daschle very much for moving \nahead on this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8820-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8821-S8829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year \n1997 District of Columbia appropriations bill to the Senate. This \nbudget is, I hope, one more step in the District's path to fiscal \nstability and financial health.\n  Our goal, in this bill and every one to follow, must be a city worthy \nin every respect to be the symbol of our Nation--from its streets, to \nits schools, to its safety. The District of Columbia is at a critical \njuncture. If we do not exercise great care over the next few years, we \nwill be left with a Potemkin Village on the Potomac--one with gleaming \nmonuments and grinding poverty.\n  The bill presented is within the subcommittee's allocation and \ncontains a Federal payment of $660 million. This is the authorized \nlevel and the same amount as was appropriated for 1995 and 1996.\n  The bill also contains $52 million in Federal contributions to the \npension funds for police officers, firefighters, judges, and teachers. \nThe Federal Government accepted this commitment when it transferred \nthese pension funds to the District over a decade ago. Finally, the \nbill contains some $5.7 million for reimbursement for expenses \nresulting from next January's Presidential inauguration.\n  As my colleagues will recall, the District's financial situation had \nso deteriorated that last year we established a control board for the \ncity. A little over a year ago the President appointed the five members \nof the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management \nAssistance Authority and its work began.\n  The budget before us is the first to fully benefit from the work of \nthe Financial Authority and the process established by its authorizing \nlegislation. The Mayor, the city council, the chief financial officer \nand the Financial Authority have worked together and produced a budget \nwhich each supports.\n  The committee's bill adopts the consensus budget without change. I \nthink we should respect the process we established in the control board \nlegislation and defer to the budget presented us.\n  I think this budget is a sound one. It restrains spending, which is \nup from about $5 billion this year to some $5.1 billion next year, and \nrelies on much more conservative assumptions than some past budget \nsubmissions.\n  The budget reduces spending in some areas, and increases it in \nothers, such as public safety. As we trim spending, I think it is vital \nthat we support spending in such core functions as public safety and \neducation.\n  To further insure fiscal integrity, this bill removes any ambiguity \nin the authority of the CFO. The committee intends that he shall \noversee all financial personnel in the executive branch, excluding the \nindependent agencies.\n  Section 148 of the bill contains an important provision authorizing \nthe director of the District of Columbia Energy Office to negotiate \nenergy performance contracts, the terms of which can extend up to 25 \nyears. Under current law, the District is limited to entering 1 year or \nshort term contracts which acts to discourage companies from entering \nsuch contracts.\n  The Department of Energy's [DOE] Federal Energy Management Program is \nan ambitious program to reduce energy consumption in all Federal \nbuildings and installations. Agencies and Departments invite energy \nservice companies to install energy efficient lighting, heating, and \ncooling systems. The companies provide the investment capital and their \npayback comes from a portion of the money saved when the Agency's \nenergy bills are lowered. A good example of the program's success is \nthe DOE's headquarters building recently relamped without any Federal \nappropriation. It lowered the cost of operating the Forestall Building, \nreduced energy costs and saved taxpayer money.\n  The District's public buildings and particularly its public schools \nare in desperate need of repair and rehabilitation. With energy \nperformance contracting authority, the city can attract capital \nimprovement investments from energy service companies prepared to \ninstall energy efficient equipment. Under this program, we can reduce \nthe District's $50 million annual energy bill without the need to \nappropriate funds. Many school districts across America have come to \nrely upon this contracting mechanism and it is time the District of \nColumbia has this authority. While this would provide the District with \ngreater flexibility, these contracts would be subject to the same \nreview by the Financial Authority for all other contracts.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues on the subcommittee, \nSenator Kohl and Senator Campbell. I also want to thank the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations, Senator Hatfield, and our \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their leadership and \nassistance on this bill.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly thank a former Senate staff member, \nMr. B. Timothy Leeth, for all of his work on this bill and so many \nappropriations bills before it.\n  As my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee know, Tim joined the \ncommittee staff in 1977 and has served during most of his tenure as the \nclerk of the District Subcommittee, Congress after Congress he would \ninherit new chairmen and committee members who probably, like me, know \nvery little about the details of the District's operations.\n  With extraordinary patience, intelligence, and good humor, he would \nsuffer the same questions from each one of us year after year. He \nworked hard and well for members on both sides of the aisle, of all \ndifferent political philosophies, in a thorough and professional \nmanner. He was, and remains, an outstanding public servant.\n  We will miss his efforts on behalf of the committee and the Senate, \nbut the District of Columbia is fortunate that it will continue to \nbenefit from his work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor,\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority [Mr. \nJeffords] and minority [Mr. Kohl] managers of the Fiscal Year 1997 \nDistrict of Columbia Appropriations Bill. I know, from 7 years of \npersonal experience as Chairman of the District of Columbia \nAppropriations Subcommittee, how much effort is required, and how much \nfrustration is involved, in dealing with the problems encountered in \nformulating this legislation. It is a thankless job.\n  The bill before the Senate recommends the $5.1 billion Fiscal Year \n1997 District of Columbia budget that was forwarded to Congress. That \nbudget represents a consensus agreed to by the District of Columbia \nCity Council, the Mayor, and the Control Board. The Administration \nsupports the consensus budget.\n  Mr. President, last year the Congress enacted the District of \nColumbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act, which \nwas designed to restore fiscal integrity of the District of Columbia. \nSection 201(c) of that legislation requires that progress for \nequalizing expenditures and revenues of the District Government must be \nmade with the balance being achieved in 1999. The Subcommittee Chairman \nand Ranking Member are keenly aware of this requirement and are working \nwith the Control Board, the City Council, and the Mayor, to achieve the \ndesired result.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n  I want to commend the staff of the Subcommittee. Tim Leeth, on the \nmajority, and Terry Sauvain, on the minority, are two experienced \ncommittee staffers. Mr. Leeth has worked for both the majority and \nminority and represents a proud tradition of non-partisanship on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee staff. Mr. Leeth is leaving the \nCommittee and will serve on the staff of the Control Board. He has done \na fine job as a member of the Committee staff and made many important \ncontributions. I thank him for his excellent service and wish him well \nin his new assignment. Mr. Sauvain continues to serve as my Deputy \nStaff Director of the Appropriations Committee, in addition to his work \nfor the Subcommittee.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Subcommittee \nChairman (Mr. Jeffords), in connection with the Fiscal Year 1997 \nDistrict of Columbia Appropriations Bill. He has done a good job and I \nsupport him in his efforts.\n  The bill before the Senate recommends the $5.1 billion Fiscal Year \n1997 District of Columbia budget that was forwarded to Congress. That \nbudget represents a consensus agreed to by the District of Columbia \nCity Council, the Mayor, and the Control Board. The Administration \nsupports the consensus budget.\n  Mr. President, last year the Congress enacted the District of \nColumbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act, which \nwas designed to restore fiscal integrity of the District of Columbia. \nSection 201(c) of that legislation requires that progress for \nequalizing expenditures and revenues of the District Government must be \nmade with the balance being achieved in 1999. The Subcommittee is \nkeenly aware of this requirement and is working with the Control Board, \nthe City Council, and the Mayor, to achieve the desired result.\n  I want to commend the staff of the Subcommittee. Tim Leeth, on the \nmajority, and Terry Sauvain, on the minority, are two able and \nexperienced staffers. After many years on the Committee staff, Mr. \nLeeth is leaving the Committee and will continue to be associated with \nthe District of Columbia as a senior staff member of the Control Board. \nTim is an excellent person and professional staff member. I have \nappreciated his wise counsel in matters relating to the District of \nColumbia. My colleagues and I will miss him here in the Senate. I am \npleased that his expertise in District matters and good humor will be \navailable to the members of the Control Board.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be deemed agreed to, the bill be advanced to third reading, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3845), as amended, was deemed read a third time, and \npassed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendments and request a conference with the House, and \nthat the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer (Mr. Bennett) \nappointed Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Inouye \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to go on record as being \nagainst this bill, which ignores the very grave problems of the \nDistrict of Columbia and only throws money at what can only be called a \ncomplete mess.\n  In the D.C. control board we have an organization that seems \nincapable of dealing decisively with the D.C. government, a government \nthat cannot provide such basic services as law enforcement, fire \nfighting, water, sewer and road maintenance, education, and the like. \nCompare this with, say, the State of North Dakota, which, with \napproximately the same population but with 70,636 more square miles to \nmanage, can fulfill all its basic governing duties.\n  For the State of North Dakota, total government spending--State and \nlocal--for 1995 was approximately $2.7 billion. Washington, DC, by \ncontrast, spent a total of $5.2 billion for 1995. In other words, the \nD.C. government spends twice as much as North Dakota and still comes up \nshort. Let's look at it another way: Per capita government spending in \nNorth Dakota is $3,857; in D.C., it's nearly $9,000.\n  Comparing Washington, DC, to the rest of the Nation, the picture \nlooks equally bleak. Looking at numbers from sworn testimony before the \nD.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, published studies and the Washington \nPost:\n\n       ``D.C. employs over 37,000 people to service a population \n     of 550,000 people. The city of Los Angeles has the same \n     number of employees but a population of three million \n     people--six times that of D.C.'' Even though Washington, \n     D.C.--unlike Los Angeles--has responsibilities of a state \n     government, these numbers are still striking.\n       ``Despite a 25 percent drop in the number of school-aged \n     children in the 1980s, D.C. public education expenditures \n     have grown to over $9,400 per student, the highest in the \n     nation.\n       ``The District spent so little on maintenance that a court \n     had to step in to correct fire code violations.''\n\n  What is the District's problem? Quite simply, there is no \naccountability in the D.C. control board. There is certainly no \naccountability in the city government. By simply continuing to write \nchecks, and not demanding a change in behavior, we perpetuate the \nproblem.\n  If it is going to improve--financially, service-wise, and in terms of \njust plain carrying out its day-to-day duties--if that is to happen, \nMr. President, then we are going to have to stop doing the things we've \nbeen doing. A change of course is in order. No more bailing out the \nDistrict; no more saving the District from itself. The city of \nWashington, DC, must take the initiative and make the changes necessary \nto bring itself out of its present miserable condition and begin to \nfunction more efficiently and affectively. Congress cannot continue to \nhold the District's hand, always standing by, ready to get the city out \nof a tight spot. Accountability and responsibility are in order.\n  On a related subject, I see no justification for supporting the \nproposal to cut taxes in the District. The city's current woes are due \nnot to tax rates but to an outrageously inefficient government. \nAttempting to cure those woes with tax incentives that are not \navailable to my hard-working constituents or to any other taxpayers \nacross the land, only serves to reward D.C. for its outlandish \nmismanagement. Again, the District must face the source of its \nproblems--a government virtually incapable of governing--and tackle \nthem head-on\n  Mr. President, I would offer the strongest possible suggestion to my \ncolleagues on the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee that they take a new \nlook at how they determine funding for the District of Columbia. Only \nby adapting a course of radical change can Washington, DC, hope to be a \nnormal, functioning city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8821-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8829-S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INTERSTATE STALKING PUNISHMENT AND PREVENTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I do want to note that this is to amend \ntitle 18 of the U.S. Code with regard to stalking, with an amendment by \nSenator Lautenberg. I want to recognize the great work and the \ndetermined effort by Senator Hutchison in getting this legislation \nthrough. It is something certainly we should support, and we obviously \ndo, and also there has been cooperation by Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Craig and Senator Lautenberg to get this language worked out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just briefly commend the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey for his hard work on this issue \nand for his patience and his cooperation in bringing it to this point.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Craig for working with us all day long \nin an effort to find a way to resolve the outstanding language \ndifferences, and I am very grateful to them as well.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to defer to Senator \nLautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to express my appreciation for the hard work that has gone \ninto resolving the problem that we had. There was an attempt, a serious \nattempt to work it out, and at times it looked like we just could not \ncome together. But through the persistence of the leaders, the help of \nSenator Craig and the agreement with Senator Hutchison, we were able to \ndo this.\n  It is an important piece of legislation. I will take time later on to \ntalk about it, but I want to express my thanks to all of those who \nenabled this piece of legislation to go through. It is going to be very \nmeaningful to women and families across this country. Two million cases \nof violence are reported within households each and every year, and \nthis will take the murder away from substantial numbers of them.\n\n  Again, I express my appreciation for the opportunity to get this bill \npassed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, who moved this legislation, the idea of getting some Federal \nability to deal with stalkers across State lines. It is an issue that \nobviously affects women and children to the greatest degree in this \ncountry. She has shown real compassion and a determination to get it \ndone, and I commend her for her efforts. I am pleased we have been able \nto get it worked out tonight.\n  I would be glad to yield for her comments on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader and the minority leader for \nhelping us work this out. This is a bill that has been pending since \nMemorial Day to try to get all of the equipment and the resources of \nthe FBI to go against the vicious people in this country who would \nharass and threaten women and children and would cross State lines to \ndo it.\n  In the old days, we did not even have stalking bills because people \ndid not know what the crime was, so people would be threatened and \nharassed and there was no way to prosecute these vicious actors. But \nnow we do have stalking bills in almost every State, and this will \nallow us to look them up, and if someone crosses State lines breaking a \nState law, we will be able to apprehend them. I hope we will be able to \nprevent the harm and even murders of women and children in this \ncountry.\n  Senator Lautenberg is to be commended for working with us to make his \namendment a good amendment, and it is a good amendment, and I applaud \nhim for it. I think it adds to the bill. He was willing to work with \nus, and I think we now have a very strong bill. Because of Senator \nLautenberg's amendment, we are also going to be able to keep people who \nbatter their wives or people with whom they live from having handguns. \nSo I think it is going to be a great bill that will give the women and \nchildren of this country some protection that they do not now have, and \nI am very pleased to be supportive of this compromise.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8829-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, as a result of having passed a piece \nof legislation, a bill tonight, that includes an antistalking measure \nand a domestic violence measure, I would like to take just a few \nminutes to comment on it.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, the domestic violence amendment, \nestablishes a policy of zero tolerance when it comes to guns and \ndomestic violence. The amendment would prohibit any person convicted of \ndomestic violence from possessing a firearm. In simple words, the \namendment says that wife beaters and child abusers should not have \nguns.\n  Mr. President, I want to explain for a moment why this amendment is \nneeded. Under current Federal law it is illegal for persons convicted \nof felonies to possess firearms. Yet many people who engage in serious \nspousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted \nwith felonies. At the end of the day, due to outdated thinking, or \nperhaps after a plea bargain, they are--at most--convicted of a \nmisdemeanor.\n  In fact, Mr. President, most of those who commit family violence are \nnever even prosecuted. When they are, one-third of the cases that would \nbe considered felonies if committed by strangers are, instead, filed as \nmisdemeanors. The fact is, in many places today, domestic violence is \nnot taken as seriously as other forms of criminal behavior. Often, acts \nof serious spouse abuse are not even considered felonies.\n\n  In just the past few years, some judges have demonstrated outrageous \ncallousness and disregard for women's lives. Right up the road from \nhere, Baltimore County, just 2 years ago, a State circuit court judge \nwas hearing a case involving a man who shot his wife and killed her. As \nhe handed down a sentence that was primarily served on weekends for a \nshort period of time, the judge said that the worst part of his job is \n``sentencing noncriminals as criminals.'' Can you imagine, as if \nshooting one's wife in the head was not criminal behavior.\n  Or the case of a man who tracked down his wife and shot her five \ntimes, killing her. The judge in that case gave the man a minimal \nsentence, to be served on weekends. In explaining why he was being so \nlenient, the judge said that the victim had provoked her husband by not \ntelling him that she was leaving their abusive marriage.\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n  These, Mr. President, are just two examples of the way our criminal \njustice system often refuses to treat domestic violence as a serious \ncrime. Yet the scope of the problem is enormous. Each year, using a \nvery conservative estimate, 1,500 women die because of domestic abuse \ninvolving a gun. Many believe that the number is closer to several \nthousand. Neither of these numbers include children.\n  Mr. President, when women are killed in domestic disputes, the \nmurderers are holding a gun about 65 percent of the time. It is not \njust beatings and other types of punishment. Put another way, two-\nthirds of domestic violence murders involve firearms. Many of these \nmurders would never have happened but for the presence of a gun.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in households with a \nhistory of battering, a gun in the home increases the likelihood that a \nwoman would be murdered by three times--threefold. In other words, when \nyou combine wife beaters and guns, the result is death.\n  Mr. President, I focused thus far mainly on wifebeaters, but domestic \nviolence also involves children. In at least one-half of wife-abusing \nfamilies, the children are battered as well. Mr. President, 2,000 \nAmerican children are killed each year from abuse inflicted by a parent \nor a caretaker. Yet, as I said before, many of these abusers and \nbatterers are prosecuted only for misdemeanors, and under Federal law \nthey are still free to possess firearms. This amendment closes this \ndangerous loophole and keeps guns away from violent individuals who \nthreaten their own families, people who show they cannot control \nthemselves and are prone to fits of violent rage, directed, \nunbelievably enough, against their own loved ones. The amendment says \nabuse your child and lose your gun. Beat your wife, and lose your gun. \nAssault your ex-wife, lose your gun, no ifs, ands or buts.\n  It is a tough policy, Mr. President. But when it comes to domestic \nviolence, we have to get tough. There is no margin of error when it \ncomes to domestic abuse and guns. A firearm in the hand of an abuser \nall too often means death.\n  If this bill had been law, maybe, just maybe, a person named Marilyn \nGarland of Barberton, OH, would be alive today. Her husband had \npreviously been convicted of domestic violence offenses for physically \nabusing her. But even though he had shown himself to be violent and \nprone to wifebeating, no law prevented him from owning a gun. \nEventually, as it often does, the cycle of violence spun out of control \nand Marilyn's husband used the gun to kill her. He then disposed of her \nbody. It was a horrible, brutal act that was committed. It did not have \nto happen.\n  By their nature, acts of domestic violence are especially dangerous \nand require special attention. These crimes involve people who have a \nhistory together and perhaps share a home or a child. These are not \nviolent acts between strangers, and they don't arise from a chance \nmeeting. Even after a separation, the individuals involved, often by \nnecessity, have a continuing relationship of some sort, either custody \nof children or common property ownership.\n  This amendment is based on legislation that I introduced earlier this \nyear which has been endorsed by over 30 prominent national \norganizations, including the National Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Family \nViolence Prevention Fund, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the \nYWCA of the U.S.A., just to name a few.\n  The people who commit these crimes often have a history of violent or \nthreatening behavior. Yet, frequently, they are permitted to possess \nfirearms with no legal restrictions. The statistics and the data are \nclear. Domestic violence, no matter how it is labeled, leads to more \ndomestic violence. Guns in the hands of convicted wifebeaters leads to \nmurder.\n  I made a change from the introduced version to respond to a \nsuggestion from some of my colleagues. Like my original bill, which \ncovered persons indicted for domestic violence offenses, this amendment \napplies only to those who have actually been convicted of domestic \nviolence. This amendment would save the lives of many innocent \nAmericans, but it would also send a message about our Nation's \ncommitment to ending domestic violence and about our determination to \nprotect millions of women and children who suffer from this abuse.\n  To put it directly, Mr. President, there are over 2 million cases of \nhousehold violence reported each and every year, and 150,000 of those \nshow a gun present, a firearm present, during a violent rage or an \nargument. We ought not to expose those people who are abused by a \nspouse or a father to further violence by enabling them to have a gun, \nwith the permission of our country.\n  So the amendment, which passed earlier, simply stands for the \nproposition that wifebeaters and child abusers should not have guns. I \nthink the overwhelming majority of Americans would agree.

The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5018\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 10 minutes and 38 \nseconds, and the Senator from Vermont has 15 minutes and 29 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume the time will not start until we \nhave order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware told me he wants \n2 minutes, and I yield that to him.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am not going to speak to the merits of \nthe legislation. I see my friend from Iowa is in the Chamber. I was \ngoing to remain silent on this, but because of the constant partisan \nreferences to the President not caring about it, I just want the Record \nto show one thing. This administration since it came into office has \nasked for $801 million for this very purpose, and my good friend from \nIowa knows the Republican Congress gave him $540 million.\n  Now, I find it fascinating the Senator from Iowa stands up and \nberates the administration for its lack of interest, and the Senator \nfrom Kansas stands up and says there is no reason we should give this \nmuch money because it is better used other places. There is some merit \nto her argument, but the irony, I just want the Record to show, is that \nfiscal year 1994 is the only year the President asked for less than the \nCongress gave him. He asked for 148; he got 170. In 1995, he asked for \n227; the Congress gave him 105. In 1996, he asked for 213; the Congress \ngave him 115. And in 1997, he asked for 213, and the Congress up to now \nhas given him, the proposal is 160, and now our friend from Georgia is \ngetting in line with the President of the United States and getting \ntheir act together in asking what the President asked for.\n  So, I cannot let it go. I am trying not to respond to everything that \noccurs here. But the fact is, $801 million asked by the President for \nthis function; $540 million thus far granted by the Congress. If this \nsucceeds, and I will support them to raise it up to the President's \nlevel of $213 million, from $160 million, that $540 million will move \nup in the commensurate amount. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware in support of full funding for the \ninternational drug program. I would remind him, however, that the cuts \nto the international program began in 1993 when the Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress cut the INL program by 30 percent. The President's \nrequests in 1993 and 1994 were also well below the Bush-era budgets. \nEven if we vote for the $213 million today, our international narcotics \nbudget will still be over $200 million below the 1992 level. I also \nremind the Senator that he has been one of the most outspoken critics \nof this administration drug programs. He has noted the failings. I hope \nhe and others here will join in voting to put this program back on \ntrack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think one thing should unite all of us, \nand I think it does. What unites the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell, myself, and everybody else in here is that we are opposed to \ninternational drug trafficking.\n  Back when I was a prosecutor we did not have the problem we have now, \nbut I used to throw people in jail for drug trafficking. None of us \nneeds to stand up and say that we declare our opposition to drug \ntraffic.\n  What bothers me about the Coverdell amendment is that it cuts funds \nin the bill for international environmental, humanitarian, and \ndevelopment programs. It is going to cut UNICEF by at least $5 million, \nprobably $10 million, potentially as much as $17 million.\n  I even heard about an organization called Olympic Aid Atlanta, an \ninitiative out of Atlanta, GA, to generate money to help children \naffected by conflict in 14 countries through UNICEF. They are going to \nget cut, in all likelihood, because we transfer the funds to counter \nnarcotics.\n  This amendment is virtually identical to one offered a couple of \nyears ago. That was defeated 57 to 38 in a bipartisan vote. Anybody who \ndoubts what we do, we have spent over $1 billion, that is $1,000 \nmillion, on the international narcotics program in the past 6 years. \nThat is only one set of many, many sources on funding to combat drugs \noverseas. The House version of this year's State, Justice, Commerce \nappropriation bill has $75 million more for the narcotics programs than \nthe President requested.\n  We should ask whether we have actually accomplished much since 1987. \nWe did have the predictions we would stop drugs at the source. The \namount of coca under cultivation has actually increased. It was 175,000 \nhectares in 1987; it is 214,000 in 1995. The amount of cocaine produced \nhas gone up. We spent $1 billion--actually a lot more than $1 billion, \nbut the flow of cocaine continues unabated. We destroy one coca field, \nanother gets planted. We arrest\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\none drug trafficker, another takes his place. We find one corrupt \nofficial in one of these countries, three more come in. And the market \ndrives it. We all know that.\n  We are not going to give up. But let us be realistic. Until we stop \nthe demand in this country, this is going to continue. This bill \nincreases--the bill that we have before us, without the amendment by \nthe distinguished Senator from Georgia--increases funding for \ncounternarcotics 39 percent above current levels, the largest increase \nof any program in this bill. This would increase it another 33 percent. \nThat is a 85 percent increase in 1 year.\n  Look what we are doing. At the same time our AID budget is going \ndown--AID had to fire 200 employees last week, people with 10, 20 years \nexperience dedicated to this country--the amount of money we know keeps \ngoing up. Look how the money has gone up, up, up, up, up--but narcotics \ndo not go down. That is why, yes, work at what we might do, but we are \nnot going to make any change in this by cutting $25 million from the \nU.N. Environment Program and UNICEF and the World Food Program, the \nConvention on Endangered Species, to name a few. Some of these programs \nwere cut 50 percent last year.\n\n  But, when we end up cutting $5 million to $17 million out of UNICEF \nto pay for this, or money out of AID's development programs that are \nalready cut 22 percent last year, to cut them another $28 million--I do \nnot agree with this.\n  The President has requested a lot. But the President requested $12.8 \nbillion for foreign assistance. Our allocation was $12.2 billion. We \nare already $600 million below what the President requested. If we had \nanother half-billion dollars we could afford this. Unless we want to \ncut UNICEF, unless we want to cut our contribution to KEDO by half, and \nour other international development programs, then we cannot afford it. \nThat is the argument we made 2 years ago and we cut it down.\n  I look at this bill. The first time in 22 years we are already \ncutting UNICEF. How much more do we want to cut it?\n  This bill underfunds our contributions to the Korea Economic \nDevelopment Organization by half. I know the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, along with Senators Nunn, Hatfield, \nThomas, Daschle, Lugar, Simon, and myself, are going to try to provide \nauthority for more. But assuming that authority passes, if the \nCoverdell amendment is agreed to the money is not there. If we do not \npay our share of KEDO, then the Secretary of Defense says the risk of \nthe North Koreans breaking the nuclear freeze would rise significantly.\n  As I said, I fought drug traffic for over 8 years as a prosecutor. I \nvoted for billions of dollars to fight drugs both here and overseas. I \nknow of no Member of this body on either side who does not abhor the \ndrug traffic in this country, what it is doing to our children and to \nso many others. But we provide a sharp increase for counternarcotics \nprograms in this bill, and if we cut out KEDO, and put North Korea back \nonto their nuclear program, is that increasing our security? I think, \nkeep the hundreds of millions of dollars we are spending on narcotics, \nbut do not cut these other things that also affect our security. We \nincrease amounts for drugs by cutting UNICEF or cutting international \nhealth programs, programs to clean up toxic waste? Let us remember, \nalso where some of this money goes. Some of these funds, unfortunately, \ngo to the Colombian Army or Bolivian police or Peruvian police. They \nare not going to fight drugs.\n  We are already giving them a 39 percent increase. Let us accept the \nfact we want to stop drugs. Let us accept the fact we will do \neverything possible. But let us not create other problems by cutting \nUNICEF and KEDO and everything else.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield up to 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment, offered by Senator \nCoverdell and other Senators including myself, would fully fund the \nPresident's International Narcotics Control Account request of $213 \nmillion for drug interdiction and eradication efforts. Funds would come \nfrom the International Organizations and Program accounts, which are \n$31 million over the President's request, and from Development \nAssistance.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Matthew Robinson, writing in Investors Business \nDaily, has brought out certain points which I think are very important. \nHe says:\n\n       The Drug Enforcement Agency has lost 227 agents from \n     September '92 to September '95.\n       Clinton issued an executive order reducing military \n     interdiction efforts, including the elimination of 1,000 \n     antidrug positions.\n       He shortened mandatory minimum sentences for drug \n     traffickers.\n       He tried to slash the staff of the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy by 80% to 25 from 146. Congress has restored \n     funding for some of those slots.\n       In his '95 budget, he proposed cutting funds for the U.S. \n     Customs Service, the DEA, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \n     the U.S. Coast Guard. The result would have meant 621 fewer \n     agents. Congress again restored some of this funding.\n       The drug effort has suffered on another level, critics say. \n     The first is in the actual fight against street drugs. \n     Interdiction efforts have suffered under Clinton, drug \n     warriors say.\n       The military's budget for drug enforcement grew from $4.9 \n     million in '82 to more than $1 billion in '92. It was cut \n     back under Clinton to $700 million in '95.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment should be agreed to. We need to do more \nin controlling this drug situation, and I urge the Senate to adopt this \namendment. I think it will be very helpful.\n  I thank the able Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, given the poor record of the Clinton \nadministration on drug enforcement it ought to be enough to simply note \nthat this amendment is needed to bring funding up to the level \nrequested by President Clinton. In an Investors Business Daily article \nrecently, they began by saying:\n\n       In the war on drugs, a bipartisan chorus of critics charges \n     that President Clinton has been AWOL--absent without \n     leadership.\n\n  They quote Representative Charles Rangel, a Democrat from New York, \nwho says:\n\n       I have never, never, never seen a President who cares less \n     about this issue.\n\n  Representative Maxine Waters a Democrat from California says, ``There \nis no war on drugs.''\n  The article goes on to note that President Clinton cut the Drug \nEnforcement Agency by 227 agents; that he issued an Executive order \nreducing military interdiction efforts, including the elimination of \n1,000 antidrug positions; that he shortened mandatory minimum sentences \nfor drug traffickers; that he tried to slash the staff of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy by 80 percent, to only 25 people down from \n146; and that in his 1995 budget he proposed cutting funds for the \nCustoms Service, the DEA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, INS, and \nCoast Guard, all of which would result in fewer agents for drug \ninterdiction.\n  The point here is if the administration has requested the additional \namount of money, surely the Congress ought to support it, given the \nfact that the administration has not exactly been a stalwart supporter \nof the drug interdiction efforts.\n  Certainly no one cares more about kids than the Senator from Kansas \ndoes. There is simply a difference of opinion of how to proceed here. \nShe makes the point this is significantly more funding than last year, \nand that's right and that's the point.\n  Under President Bush, the funding was going up. Under President \nClinton, the funding has gone down precipitously. We need to begin to \nrestore that funding so that we will have an adequate effort in regard \nto this interdiction effort. That is why we should support the \namendment of the Senator from Georgia. The funding in this effort needs \nto be increased. As Senator Grassley said, this is something we have to \ndo for the kids.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I share the concern of my friend, the \nSenator from Georgia, about the urgency of improving the effectiveness \nof our anti-narcotics efforts. The threat of international drug \ntrafficking is\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nvery real and our efforts to combat it must become more effective. I \nagree with many of the Senator from Georgia's criticisms of the current \nprogram and believe that significant improvements must be made in the \nresults of our anti-drug program.\n  The bill before us provides a 40 percent increase in funding for \nthese programs, reflecting the committee's concern that there must be a \nstrong response to the escalation of narcotics trafficking. This is a \nsignificant increase that will allow considerable expansion of U.S. \nefforts abroad.\n  Yet, the amendment before us would shift an additional $53 million to \nthe counter-drug account. These funds would come from a $25 million cut \nin the International Operations and Programs account and a $28 million \ncut in development assistance. Unlike the international narcotics \ncontrol programs, both the international organizations and programs \naccount and development assistance have sustained significant \nreductions in the past years. In particular, the international \norganizations account was sharply reduced for fiscal year 1996, forced \ncuts in our contributions to organizations such as the United Nations \nDevelopment Program, the World Food Program, the United Nations \nEnvironmental Program and many other worthwhile international \norganizations.\n  Development assistance has also been reduced in the past years. This \nincludes funds for Africa, for sustainable development programs to \nincrease world food production, to reduce environmental devastation. \nThis account also funds child survival and disease programs, \ninternational debt restructuring and micro enterprise programs--all \nvery worthwhile programs. The problems that these programs seek to \nsolve are equally deserving of our attention, and in many instances, \neventually would pose grave problems for the United States if they are \nignored.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed a difficult task to balance the competing \npriorities of this legislation, all of them very valid in their own \nright. However, I urge my colleagues to resist this temptation to alter \nthe careful balance that has been struck by the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time is \nremaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6 minutes 10 \nseconds. The Senator from Georgia has 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reiterate, none of us are in favor of \ndrug trafficking. I suspect none of us are in favor of the millions, \nmany millions, of dollars we spend on foreign interdiction that goes \ninto the pockets of corrupt officials either.\n  But I will say, with the huge increase in counternarcotics money that \nis in here already, let's not even go beyond that and do it by cutting \nUNICEF and cutting Korean economic development and other things that \nare also in our best interest.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the Senator from Delaware 1 minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I heard again, this time from our friend \nfrom Arizona, about the President's flagging effort on drugs and Bush \nup, Clinton down. Let's get the record straight.\n  There was over $300 million more requested by the President for this \nvery function than the Congress is willing to give him. The Republican \nCongress in the Senate last year cut the FBI by $112 million, cut the \ndrug task force by $19 million, cut the number of prosecutors by $19 \nmillion. Let's stop this.\n  I think it makes sense to do what the Senator from Georgia wants to \ndo. Let's do it and stop this partisan malarkey. The facts do not \nsustain the assertions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's face it, since this administration \nhas taken over, there has not been a war on drugs, not a real effort on \ndrugs. They cut the drug czar's office. They have cut interdiction. \nThey have cut facilities in the transit zones. They have not put the \nmoneys where the moneys should go. They are not effectively spending \nthem, and I have accused the President of being AWOL on drugs, or \nabsent without leadership on drugs.\n  I don't think many Democrats or Republicans disagree with that \nstatement. The fact is they have been AWOL on drugs, and there is a \ncavalier attitude down at the White House: ``So what. Don't all young \npeople use drugs?''\n\n  My gosh, all young people don't use drugs, and there are a lot of \npeople who have repented and are now fighting the battle side by side \nwith us. I commend them for having done it. I recommend the people in \nthe White House do the same thing.\n  I have been appalled by what has been happening. Our borders are a \nsieve. Now we have these drug lords coming in and buying up ranches at \nexorbitant prices. Ranchers are glad to get out of there because they \nfeel intimidated. They feel they are being mocked. They feel that they \nare being overrun. They feel that they are going to be murdered. So why \nnot sell out at exorbitant prices and get through it?\n  Let's be honest about it, Federal law enforcement has been under \nsevere strain, just as the technical sophistication of drug trafficking \nsyndicates is reaching new heights. A report prepared by the Judiciary \nCommittee finds that the administration supply reduction policy is in \nutter disarray, with a 53-percent drop in our ability to interdict and \npush back drug shipments in the transit zone. The report also finds \nincreases in the purity of drugs and the number of drug-related \nemergency room admissions of hardcore users.\n  If you look at it, it is a disgrace. I think what the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia is trying to do is right. He is trying to put \nmoney back in, put money where our mouths happen to be and start \nhelping to bolster this administration to do what it should do to begin \nwith.\n  I don't have faith in the administration doing what is right in the \ndrug war, and I don't think others do. By gosh, I think we ought to \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Georgia. I hope people will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the introduction of a report we did in \nthe Judiciary Committee, entitled ``Losing Ground Against Drugs,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Losing Ground Against Drugs (Excerpt)\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Through the 1980s and into the early 1990s, the United \n     States experienced dramatic and unprecedented reductions in \n     casual drug use.\n       The number of Americans using illicit drugs plunged from \n     24.7 million in 1979 to 11.4 million in 1992. The so-called \n     ``casual'' use of cocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and \n     1992, while montly cocaine use fell 55 percent between 1988 \n     and 1992 alone--from 2.9 million to 1.3 million users.\n       On the surface, little appears to have changed since 1992. \n     For the nation as a whole, drug use remains relatively flat. \n     The vast majority of Americans still do not use illegal \n     drugs.\n       Unfortunately, this appearance is dangerously misleading. \n     Drug use has in fact experienced a dramatic resurgence among \n     our youth, a disturbing trend that could quickly return the \n     United States to the epidemic of drug use that characterized \n     the decade of the 1970s.\n       Recent surveys, described in detail in this report, provide \n     overwhelming evidence of a sharp and growing increase in drug \n     use among young people:\n       The number of 12-17 year-olds using marijuana increased \n     from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994. The category \n     of ``recent marijuana use'' increased a staggering 200 \n     percent among 14-15 year-olds over the same period.\n       Since 1992, there has been a 52 percent jump in the number \n     of high-school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, even \n     as worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of drug \n     use.\n       One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana.\n       Young people are actually more likely to be aware of the \n     health dangers of cigarettes than of the dangers of \n     marijuana.\n       Nor have recent increases been confined to marijuana. At \n     least three surveys note increased use of inhalants and other \n     drugs such as cocaine and LSD.\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\n       Drug use by young people is alarming by any standard, but \n     especially so since teen drug use is at the root of hard-core \n     drug use by adults. According to surveys by the Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse, 12-17 year-olds who use \n     marijuana are ``85 times more likely to graduate to cocaine \n     than those who abstain from marijuana.'' Fully 60 percent of \n     adolescents who use marijuana before age 15 will later use \n     cocaine. Conversely, those who reach age 21 without ever \n     having used drugs almost never try them later in life.\n       Described any other way, perhaps 820,000 of the new crop of \n     youthful marijuana smokers will eventually try cocaine. Of \n     these 820,000 who try cocaine, some 58,000 may end up as \n     regular users and addicts.\n       The implications for public policy are clear. If such \n     increases are allowed to continue for just two more years, \n     America will be at risk of returning to the epidemic drug use \n     of the 1970s. Should that happen, our ability to control \n     health care costs, reform welfare, improve the academic \n     performance of our school-age children, and defuse the \n     projected ``crime bomb'' of youthful super-predator \n     criminals, will all be seriously compromised.\n       With these thoughts in mind, I am pleased to present \n     ``Losing Ground Against Drugs: A Report on Increasing Illicit \n     Drug Use and National Drug Policy'' prepared at my direction \n     by the majority staff of the United States Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary. This report examines trends in drug use and \n     the Clinton Administration's sometimes uneven response to \n     them, including the Administration's controversial policy of \n     targeting chronic, hardcore drug users. The report also \n     reviews the state of trends in use and availability. And, \n     finally, it evaluates the performance over the past three \n     years of our nation's criminal justice and interdiction \n     systems.\n       The report finds federal law enforcement under severe \n     strain just as the technical sophistication of drug \n     trafficking syndicates is reaching new heights. It finds that \n     the Administration's supply reduction policy is in utter \n     disarray, with a 53 percent drop in our ability to interdict \n     and push back drug shipments in the transit zone. The report \n     also finds increases in the purity of drugs and the number of \n     drug-related emergency room admissions of hard-core users.\n       Federal drug policy is at a crossroads. Ineffectual \n     leadership and failed federal policies have combined with \n     ambiguous cultural messages to generate changing attitudes \n     among our young people and sharp increases in youthful drug \n     use.\n       The American people recognize these problems and are \n     increasingly concerned: A Gallup poll released December 12, \n     1995 shows that 94 percent of Americans view illegal drug use \n     as either a ``crisis'' or a ``very serious problem.'' Their \n     concern, which I share, underscores the danger of \n     compromising our struggle against the drug trade. I look \n     forward to addressing the issues raised in this report in \n     future hearings of the United States Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself first 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I heard his ad hominem attack on the Clinton \nadministration. I have always found the best prosecutions are those \nthat don't become prosecutions but rise above partisanship.\n  I point out that the Clinton administration has appointed General \nMcCaffrey as drug czar. For the first time, certainly since I have been \nhere, I have seen somebody who really can be a drug czar.\n  Maybe people have different attitudes. I know the Speaker of the \nHouse, who is about my age, implies that all people during the time he \nwas growing up in his age category used drugs, himself included. Mr. \nPresident, I never did. I believe perhaps because at that age I was out \nprosecuting people using drugs. I have never had any desire to. I have \nnever used them.\n  Let's stop these ad hominem things. If Senators want to say whether \nthey prefer using them or not, fine, but this administration has \nfought, as other administrations have fought, Republican and Democrat, \nto stop drug usage.\n  But let us also acknowledge something, and this is the fact that \neverybody, Republican and Democrat, has to stand up and admit: simply \nthrowing the money at the drug problem does not make it go away. \nWhether it is the Speaker of the House saying everybody of that age \nused drugs or not, that does not make it go away. It is going to take a \nlot more than simply throwing money at this drug problem to make it go \naway.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know this is asking a lot, but let's just \nexamine the logic of what is being said here. My friend from Utah \nstands up and says, ``Restore what we need to restore. Make the \nPresident do what he should do.''\n  What are we doing? The Senator from Georgia is restoring the request \nof the President. What are these guys talking about? The President is \nthe one who asked for the money the Senator from Georgia says he should \nget. Now my friend from Utah says, ``Now what we must do is restore \nthis war on drugs.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So has the logic in this place.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I will be happy to \nyield the time back and go to a vote, so some people can go home and go \nto bed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will use some of my time. Mr. President, how much \ntime remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 3 minutes; the \nSenator from Vermont has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is an incongruity here between \nmyself and the Senator from Vermont. I just heard the Senator from \nVermont say, ``You don't throw money at the drug program,'' and then \nthe Senator from Delaware. So, you are suggesting the President is \nthrowing money away?\n  This is the President's request, and to the Senator from Delaware, \nwhen it is fulfilled, it is still only up to half what it was in 1992. \nIt is moving in the right direction. It is not a dollar more.\n  Now the Senator from Vermont has also suggested that, by moving this \nmoney to this international narcotics fund, it is cutting international \norganizations and programs. That is simply not so. The money we took \nfrom international organizations and programs is from the surplus that \nwas over the President's request. So all I have done is taken that \nadditional money over and above the President's request and moved it \nover to fulfill the President's request, which seems eminently logical \nto me given the condition of the drug epidemic in the United States, \ngiven the fact that this is a Presidential request, and given the fact \nthat we are simply removing money from a surplus that the President did \nnot request.\n  I have to say, given the condition of children in our country, I \nthink the President is right on this one. I am perplexed that the other \nside of the aisle would be trying to thwart the President's own \nobjectives here.\n  Mr. President, I do yield back whatever time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his remaining time. \nThe Senator from Vermont is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take the same amount of time as the \nSenator from Georgia just did.\n  There is no surplus. UNICEF has already been cut $10 million and will \nbe cut more under this. The Korean Economic Development Organization, \nKEDO, is not funded. We are going to try to have the authorization for \nit, but it will not be funded. Our own Secretary of Defense tells us, \nif it is not, we face very, very serious problems in North Korea.\n  The fact of the matter is, there is no surplus. This money has to \ncome from somewhere. It will come from further cuts in UNICEF. It will \ncome from the inability to fund KEDO. It will come from a number of \nthose other areas.\n  Mr. President, I understand that in an election year nobody wants to \nsomehow seem to be weak on drugs. I understand that even if we, no \nmatter how much we demonstrate so much of this money has, in all \nadministrations, gone into the pockets of corrupt individuals, no \nmatter how much we want to say we have other security interests, too, \nlike avoiding nuclear capabilities in North Korea, that somehow having \nalready raised substantially the amount of money in this budget for \nnarcotics way above anything else, we may even raise it more. Let us \njust go vote. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n10 minutes equally divided on the Brown amendment prior to the vote.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5058, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBrown be allowed to modify his amendment to reflect the compromise \nreached by the Senators from Georgia and Delaware.\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n         TITLE ____--NATO ENLARGEMENT FACILITATION ACT OF 1996\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, \n     purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any \n     nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as \n     full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security \n     in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures \n     which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. \n     Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. \n     America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to \n     the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic \n     transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the \n     Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing \n     the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in \n     creating the stable environment needed for those emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully \n     complete political and economic transformation.\n       (4) The United States continues to regard the political \n     independence and territorial integrity of all emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to \n     European peace and security.\n       (5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and \n     Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an \n     important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those \n     countries seeking NATO membership.\n       (6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new \n     members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and \n     has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new \n     members into NATO.\n       (8) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of \n     Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in \n     Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the \n     enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and \n     the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political \n     will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as \n     the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making \n     available the resources necessary to supplement efforts \n     prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\n       (9) New members will be full members of the Alliance, \n     enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under \n     the Washington Treaty.\n       (10) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives \n     involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n     that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the \n     Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint \n     Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping \n     Force, can make an important contribution to European peace \n     and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can \n     assist those countries preparing to assume the \n     responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly \n     should receive appropriate support from the United States.\n       (11) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-\n     Atlantic region.\n       (12) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a \n     positive role in defusing tensions between members of the \n     Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred \n     between two Alliance member states since the inception of \n     NATO in 1949.\n       (13) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance \n     the security of the region. Countries which have become \n     democracies and established market economies, which practice \n     good neighborly relations, and which have established \n     effective democratic civilian control over their defense \n     establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with \n     NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the \n     principles of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (14) A number of Central and Eastern European countries \n     have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken \n     concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including \n     their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.\n       (15) The Caucasus region remains important geographically \n     and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As \n     NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United \n     States and NATO should continue to examine means to \n     strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of U.N. \n     recognized countries in that region.\n       (16) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (17) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance \n     should include those emerging democracies most ready for \n     closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other \n     countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move \n     forward toward eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The Congress of the United States finds in particular \n     that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia have \n     made significant progress toward achieving the stated \n     criteria and should be eligible for the additional assistance \n     described in this bill.\n       (19) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be \n     based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria \n     for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's \n     security and the approval of all NATO members.\n       (20) The process of NATO enlargement entails the agreement \n     of the governments of all NATO members in accordance with \n     Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.\n       Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow \n     the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although \n     they are accorded the full collective security guarantees \n     provided by article V of the Washington Treaty. There is no \n     prior requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on \n     the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the \n     current security climate, however NATO retains the right to \n     alter its security posture at any time as circumstances \n     warrant.\n\n     SEC. ____03. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central \n     and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries \n     may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative \n     political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO \n     and the Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. ____04. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER \n                   ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote \n     economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine--\n       (1) the United States should continue and expand its \n     support for the full and active participation of these \n     countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO \n     membership;\n       (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic \n     means available to press the European Union to admit as soon \n     as possible any country which qualifies for membership;\n       (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support \n     for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between \n     and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, and Russia; and\n       (4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be \n     limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the \n     Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members to the NATO \n     Alliance.\n\n     SEC. ____05. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA, \n                   AND LITHUANIA.\n\n       In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-\n     Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and \n     other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 \n     years, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical \n     security concerns that must be taken into account by the \n     United States; and\n       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be \n     disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their \n     forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.\n\n     SEC. ____06.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me thank the Senator from Kentucky for his kindness. \nWe have worked out the concerns of the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Georgia as well as worked out the issue \nraised by the Senator from Illinois. This measure is an important and \nhistoric measure because it fulfills our commitment for a community of \nfreedom, a commitment for embracing freedom in central Europe. This is \none more step forward towards ensuring the security of northern Europe \nand a continuation, I think, of our effort to ensure that the blessings \nof democracy and freedom are not lost in central Europe. Madam \nPresident, I think the concerns of other Members have been worked out.\n  I might mention I think Senator Mikulski does have a concern she \nwants to articulate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to support the modifications \nto the amendment by the Senator from Colorado, the NATO Enlargement \nFacilitation Act of 1996. Mr. President, my principal modification is \nstraightforward: it adds the Republic of Slovenia to the current list \nof three countries that Congress finds as having made significant \nprogress toward achieving the stated NATO membership criteria and are \ntherefore eligible for additional assistance described in the bill.\n  Mr. President, Slovenia should join Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary on this list for the following reasons:\n  First, Slovenia's progress in meeting the NATO membership criteria \nhas been second to none, and probably the very best in Central Europe.\n  Second, Slovenia would provide the essential land-bridge linking \ncurrent NATO member Italy and likely future NATO member Hungary.\n  Third, Slovenia is the only country in the area that has recently \nproven its military tenacity and, hence, its ability to contribute to \nthe security of NATO, having successfully defeated the invasion attempt \nof the Yugoslav National Army in 1991.\n  Mr. President, in offering this amendment I want to underscore that I \nhave not yet made up my mind about how I will vote on the NATO \ncandidacy of any individual country. The answers to the questions posed \nby the senior Senator from Georgia in this amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1997 will help form my opinion on \nNATO enlargement in general. How well applicant countries fulfill \nAlliance membership criteria will, of course, be a determining factor \nin my ultimate vote on individual candidacies.\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\n  I do believe, however, that the amendment to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill currently offered by the Senator from Colorado is a \nprudent one, in that it seeks in a modest way to assist a small group \nof countries who have made the greatest progress toward meeting the \nNATO membership criteria. My amendment simply recognizes the fact that \nSlovenia indisputably belongs in that small group.\n  Mr. President, Slovenia is a small country of 2 million citizens in \nthe far northwestern corner of the former Yugoslavia. Without fanfare \nand without the publicity that has accompanied change elsewhere behind \nthe former Iron Curtain, Slovenia has rapidly created a solid democracy \nand a prosperous market economy. Its Western European-style coalition \ngovernment is a model of stability. Economically, Slovenia now can \nboast of a per capita GNP approaching ten-thousand U.S. dollars, by far \nthe highest of any country wishing to join NATO.\n  Moreover, Slovenia has put its nose to the grindstone, strenuously \nattempting to fulfill the membership criteria that the Alliance has \nannounced. What has been the result?\n  Mr. President, no less an authority than U.S. Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Perry flatly stated last year that of all the countries of \nCentral and Eastern Europe ``Slovenia has made perhaps the greatest \nprogress in the transition to democracy, the transition to a market \neconomy, and the smooth turnover of the military to civilian control.'' \nThat, I would submit, is no small praise.\n  Slovenia's geographical location also argues strongly for its \ninclusion in the likely first group of new NATO members. Wedged between \nthe northern Adriatic Sea and the Alps, it connects Italy, a charter \nmember of NATO, with Hungary, which appears in the bill's list of \npreferred applicants and, solely on the basis of its accomplishment, \nwould likely be in the first group admitted to the Alliance. Without \nSlovenia in the Alliance, however, Hungary would not be contiguous with \nNATO territory, a situation which could harm its chances for admission \nin the first group.\n\n  It must be added that this spring Italy and Slovenia settled a long-\nstanding dispute over property rights, thereby clearing the way for \nSlovenia to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union and \nfurther cementing its ties to Western Europe.\n  Finally, Mr. President, little Slovenia--alone among NATO \napplicants--has proven that it can defend itself and be a net \ncontributor to the security of the Western Alliance. After declaring \nits independence from the crumbling Yugoslavia in the spring of 1991, \nSlovenia had to face an invasion by the Serbian-led Yugoslav National \nArmy or J.N.A. For ten days Slovenia stunned the world by routing the \nbetter armed and numerically superior invaders, until they withdrew, \ntacitly acknowledging Slovene independence.\n  So, Mr. President, by any standard Slovenia deserves to be included \nwith Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary in the list of countries \nthat are eligible for targeted United States transition assistance.\n  I would close with two brief observations. First, including Slovenia \nin this group would not only constitute recognition of its remarkable \npolitical, economic, and military record over the past 5 years; it \nwould also serve to destroy the unfortunate stereotype emerging from \nthe dreadful Balkan warfare that all South Slavs are incorrigibly \nviolent people who cannot cooperate to improve their situation.\n  Finally, adding Slovenia to the bill's preferred list would lend more \ncredibility to Congress's response to the NATO enlargement process. It \nwould demonstrate that we are clearly focused on strengthening NATO and \nnot, as some assert, only responding to interest-group politics. There \nare, to be sure, Slovene-Americans who undoubtedly have a special \ndesire for Slovenia to join NATO, but they have not been especially \nactive on Capitol Hill. There are undoubtedly Delawareans of Slovene \ndescent, but to the best of my knowledge I have never been approached \nby any of them in regard to this issue.\n   Mr. President, because of its outstanding criteria-based \naccomplishments, its geostrategically important location, and its \nproven military record, Slovenia deserves to join Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary as eligible for additional transition assistance \nfor NATO membership. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Brown \nAmendment as modified.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise very briefly to thank the Senator from \nColorado, the distinguished occupant of the chair, for the \nextraordinary leadership he has shown in conceiving this proposal and \nshepherding it now to the point where it can be adopted by the Senate. \nIt has been my honor to work with him on this as a cosponsor.\n  History is a term that is used probably too often around the Capitol, \nbut to my way of thinking, this is a historic enactment that we are \nabout to make because, in enacting this amendment, we are essentially \nsaying more strongly than we ever have that the Congress of the United \nStates is prepared to welcome into NATO, but more broadly into the \ncommunity of democracies of market economies, those nations that \nsuffered under the yoke of Communist tyranny for so long during the \ncold war and are now free and working their way toward being eligible \nfor membership in NATO.\n  This measure, in concrete terms, not only expresses that policy, but \nputs some money behind that policy in offering to those nations that \nare most ready to enter NATO some wherewithal to help make that happen. \nTo my way of thinking, what we are doing here tonight is, in some \nmeasure, ratifying and hoping to make permanent the victory that \nfreedom won in the cold war.\n  For all that time in the cold war, we spoke often of those people who \nwere suffering in the ``captive nations.'' The people of those nations, \nincluding, may I say, the people of Russia, fought and dreamed and \nworked and finally achieved their freedom. Now these countries of \ncentral and Eastern Europe who want to get into NATO are really saying \nto us they want to cast their lot for the future, not just with the \nWest but with what the West means, which is freedom, the values of \ndemocracy.\n  They are also accepting an obligation therein, which is the great \ntask that NATO has achieved. NATO has not just been a defensive \nalliance; it has been an institution in which the countries of Europe \ncould work to reconcile their own conflicts, work to avoid the old \nbalance-of-power relationships that too often led to war.\n  As we reach out and embrace these new countries that have attained \ntheir freedom and want to enter NATO, I do not think we are doing \nanything here that should or would threaten Russia. What we are doing \nis creating stability among the nations of Europe, Western, Central, \nand Eastern, and guaranteeing as best we can for those millions of \npeople who live within those countries the basic human and economic \nrights with which we in our own formative documents have said each \nperson is endowed with by our Creator.\n  So it is a great step forward, and I thank all our colleagues who \nhave helped to make it happen. I thank the Chair particularly, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Colorado for \nhis leadership on this. The reality is this is a step forward for \nstability in central Europe. Two other provisions in here I think are \nsignificant. That is, we open the door to the possibility at some \nfuture time for Armenia and some of the other Newly Independent States \nthere. The second thing; in Russia and in Belarus and in a few of the \ncountries, there is a fear of nuclear weapons being established at \ntheir doorstep. The resolution points out that Spain and Norway, who \nare current members of NATO, do not have nuclear weapons and still are \nmembers of NATO.\n  My hope is that stations of nuclear weapons which have no military \nsignificance can be avoided. I think it will diminish fears, in Russia \nparticularly.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nsupporting and cosponsoring this amendment to enlarge NATO. I support \nNATO enlargement because I do believe it will make Europe more stable \nand secure. It will mean that the new democracies of central and \nEastern Europe will share the burden of European security. It could \nmean that future generations of Americans might not be sent to Europe \nto fight for Europe.\n  Mr. President, a word about Poland. As an American of Polish \nheritage, I know that the Polish people did not choose to live behind \nthe Iron Curtain. In 1939, when Poland was invaded by the Nazis, the \nWest was silent and talked about peace, but it was appeasement. After \nthe end of the war, they were forced by the Yalta agreement, by Potsdam \nand the very West itself, to put them behind the Iron Curtain.\n  During World War II, my great grandmother, who came to this country \nfrom Poland, had three pictures on her mantelpiece when I would go to \nher home. One of Pope Pius the XII, our spiritual leader, the other of \nmy Uncle Joe who was on the police force, and President Roosevelt, \nbecause she believed that President Roosevelt was good for America and \nthe world.\n  After Yalta and Potsdam, my great grandmother turned Roosevelt's \npicture down on the mantel. She would not take him down because she was \na Democrat, but she was pretty mad at Roosevelt, as were so many other \npeople.\n  I cannot forget the history of this region. But my support for this \namendment is not based on the past. It is based on the future, a future \nwhich these newly free and democratic countries will take their \nrightful place as members of Western Europe. That is where they want to \nbe, with Western Europe. NATO did play an important role in securing \nthe freedom of the world and ending the cold war. This has been an \nalliance that helped us win the cold war, a deterrent between the \nsuperpowers. It helped prevent confrontations between member states.\n  I know if NATO is to survive, it must adopt to the needs of the end \nof the cold war. NATO has evolved since 1949 and this is the next \nimportant step in NATO enlargement. How many times have we talked \nburden sharing in Europe? These countries are ready to do it. Thousands \nof troops from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Baltics, \nUkraine, and others are there to help secure peace. They are not asking \nfor a handout. They are asking for a chance to be part of NATO. This \namendment puts Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO where \nit runs them up where they belong.\n  Some people believe we will offend Russia by expanding NATO. Maybe we \nwill. And my response to that is, so what? So what if we offend Russia? \nWe must delink the future of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nfrom what Russia thinks.\n  I was offended when Russia invaded Hungary in 1956. I was offended \nwhen they forced Poland behind the Iron Curtain and made them an \ninvoluntary Communist nation. I was offended by what the Russians did \naround the world for over 50 years. So, now, I want to support this \namendment to enlarge NATO, to secure Europe in a better way, and I \nhope, after we take this vote tonight, that I can go back to my great \ngrandmother's home and put not only Roosevelt's picture back up, but \nHank Brown and so many other people here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] is an important step for the \ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe who seek to ensure their \nsecurity and sovereignty as full members of the NATO Alliance.\n  As an original cosponsor of this legislation when it was introduced \nin June--the last foreign policy initiative authored by Senator Dole \nbefore he left the Senate--I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator \nBrown's amendment.\n  This legislation serves to correct the terrible injustice perpetrated \nat Yalta half a century ago, when for reasons of political expediency \nartificial divisions were imposed on Europe, subjecting countries with \ndemocratic traditions similar to those in Western Europe to decades of \ncommunist domination. In the years since the Iron Curtain was lifted \nfrom the European continent, many countries in Central and Eastern \nEurope have made dramatic progress in resurrecting their democratic \nhistories and instituting reform measures that solidify their \ncommitment to the democratic ideals espoused by members of the NATO \nAlliance.\n  I firmly believe that enlarging NATO to include those countries which \nare capable of contributing to the Alliance is in the interests of the \nUnited States. Our country knows too well the danger of allowing a \nsecurity vacuum to persist in this region and should work actively to \nencourage closer ties between the countries in Central and Eastern \nEurope and the West. Since they regained their freedom, many countries \nin this region have worked diligently to implement the democratic and \nfree market reform measures which were essential to reversing years of \nill founded communist policies. The Brown amendment establishes a \nprogram that will assist these countries as they prepare for the rights \nand responsibilities of full NATO membership.\n  The Brown amendment recognizes that Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary and Slovenia have made the most progress in implementing \nimportant reform measures such as establishing a free market economy, \ninstituting civilian control over the military, and introducing the \nrule of law. These three countries are designated as eligible to \nreceive the NATO transition assistance already appropriated in this \nbill. Let us show our friends in Central and Eastern Europe that we \nwill never again abandon them to the forces of dictatorship and tyranny \nand that we will work side by side in partnership to create a lasting \nfree and democratic Europe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Brown amendment.\n\n\n             the nato enlargement facilitation act of 1996\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have long supported NATO, and the \nextension of membership in this transatlantic institution to the new \ndemocracies of Central and Eastern Europe. And today I wish to express \nmy support for the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996--extremely \nimportant legislation which I also cosponsor.\n  This bill is designed specifically to support and foster the careful, \ngradual extension of NATO membership to the nations of Central and \nEastern Europe. Once passed, this bill will direct tangible assistance \nto the efforts of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join the \nAlliance. These nations are the best prepared in their region for the \nresponsibilities and burdens of NATO membership.\n  Let me also emphasize that it is the intent of the authors of this \nbill to ensure that the entry of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic into the Alliance is part of an inclusive and on-going process \nof NATO enlargement.\n  NATO enlargement does not have to, and should not be allowed to, \ncreate any new divisions in Europe. Hence, our bill explicitly states \nthat the United States should continue and expand upon its support for \nfull and active participation of all Central and Eastern European \ncountries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO membership.\n  This legislation clearly outlines a vision of NATO enlargement, an \non-going process that will reach out to all the nations of Central and \nEastern Europe as they become capable of making a net contribution to \nthe Alliance's overall interests, capabilities, and security.\n  Extending the Alliance's membership to Poland, the Czech Republic and \nHungary, will help transform Central and Eastern Europe into a \ncornerstone of enduring peace and stability in post-cold war Europe. \nNATO enlargement is in America's interests for many reasons. Principal \namong these include the following:\n  First, it is absolutely necessary to consolidate and secure an \nenduring and stable peace in Europe. This is a continent where America \nhas vital interests and it is a continent that, historically speaking, \nhas been besieged by violent and brutal wars. NATO enlargement will \nproject security into a region that has long suffered as a security \nvacuum in European affairs. History has repeatedly shown us that the \nstrategic vulnerability of Central and Eastern Europe has produced \ncatastrophic consequences--consequences that drew the United States \ntwice this century into world war.\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\n  The most effective way to address this security vacuum in Central and \nEastern Europe is by integrating these nations into NATO and the other \ninstitutions that constitute the transatlantic community of nations.\n  Second, NATO enlargement will help facilitate this integration, both \npolitically and economically. NATO enlargement is a key step to \nextending to the entire continent of Europe the zone of peace, \ndemocracy, and prosperity that now includes North America and Western \nEurope. Passage of our NATO enlargement legislation will demonstrate \nAmerica's commitment to consolidating an enlarged Europe. This will \ngive more incentive to all the nations of the region to continue their \npolitical and economic reforms by demonstrating that these reforms do \nresult in tangible geo-political gains.\n  By projecting and reinforcing stability in Central and Eastern \nEurope, NATO enlargement will consolidate the context necessary for \nthis region's nations to focus on internal political and economic \nreform. Mr. President, security is not an alternative to reform, but it \nis essential for reform to occur.\n  Third, two great powers, Germany and Russia, are now undergoing very \ncomplex and sensitive transformations. Their futures will be \nsignificantly shaped by the future of Central and Eastern Europe. \nExtending NATO membership to nations of this region will reinforce the \npositive evolutions of these two great powers.\n  In the case of Germany, NATO enlargement will further lock German \ninterests into a transatlantic security structure and thereby further \nconsolidate the extremely positive role Bonn now plays in European \naffairs.\n  The extension of NATO membership to Central and East European nations \nwill also be of great benefit to Russia. By enhancing and reinforcing \nstability and peace in Central and Eastern Europe, NATO enlargement \nwill make unrealistic the calls by Russia's extremists for the \nrevitalization of the former Soviet Union or the Westward expansion of \nRussian hegemony. Greater stability along Russia frontiers will also \nenable Moscow to direct more of its energy toward the internal \nchallenges of political and economic reform.\n  This point is too often forgotten in this debate. There has been too \nstrong a tendency in US policy to overreact to outdated Russian \nsensitivities. This overreaction comes at the expense of strategic \nrealities and objectives central to the interests of the Alliance, as \nwell as to the United States.\n  Let me add, Mr. President, that Russian opposition to NATO \nenlargement is withering and appears to be in the process of being \nreplaced by a more enlightened understanding of the motivations behind \nNATO enlargement. I would like my colleagues to note an interview in \ntoday's Financial Times with General Alexander Lebed, who declared that \nRussia does not oppose NATO enlargement. Lebed was recently appointed \nby Russian President Yeltsin as Secretary of Russia's National Security \nCouncil. Lebed also finished third in the first round of the Russian \npresidential elections. Thus, his statement reflects positively on both \nthe attitudes of the Russian public and official Russian policy toward \nNATO enlargement.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note that this NATO enlargement \nlegislation reflects the attitudes of many of our parliamentary \ncounterparts in Europe. The North Atlantic Assembly, a gathering of \nlegislators from the sixteen nations of NATO, adopted at the end of \n1994, my resolution calling for the extension of membership in the \nAlliance to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.\n  Mr. President, America's defense and security must be structured to \nshape a strategic landscape that enhances economic, political, and \nmilitary stability all across Europe. Careful and gradual extension of \nNATO membership to nations of Central and Eastern Europe is a critical \nstep toward this end. This is in our national interest. It is action \nlong overdue, and it is the intent of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation \nAct of 1996.\n  For these reasons, I call upon my colleagues in the Senate, as well \nas President Clinton and his Administration, to embrace this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe conclusion of these two votes, the only remaining amendments in \norder to H.R. 3540 be a managers' amendment and an amendment to be \noffered by Senator Simpson, relative to refugees, on which there be 30 \nminutes to be equally divided in the usual form, with no second-degree \namendments in order or amendments to the language proposed to be \nstricken; and an amendment by Senator Lieberman with a second-degree \namendment in order by Senator Murkowski, and possibly one by Senator \nMcConnell; following the conclusion of the debate with respect to the \namendments listed above, the amendments be laid aside, the votes to \noccur at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, with 2 minutes for debate prior to each \nstacked vote on or in relation to the Simpson amendment, to be followed \nby votes with respect to the other amendments, to be followed \nimmediately by third reading and final passage of H.R. 3540.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, do I understand the floor \nleader, then, that we will have two more votes this evening, the \ndebate, and then stack the votes until 9:30 in the morning, and then \nfinal passage?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is right.\n  Mr. FORD. Two votes tonight?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In light of this agreement, there will be no further \nrollcall votes this evening after two back-to-back votes to shortly \nbegin, with the first votes tomorrow to begin at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 5018\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendments numbered 5084 through 5087, en bloc, and amendment \n     No. 5082, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5084 through 5087), en bloc, and Amendment (No. \n5082), as modified are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 5084\n\n       On page 107, line 11, strike ``up to $30,000,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``$17,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have proposed this amendment because I \nhave concluded this is the only way to ensure that the administration \nresponds to the will of Congress regarding the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development [IFAD].\n  Last year, the Congress authorized U.S. participation in the fourth \nreplenishment of IFAD resources. Since that time, Senators and \nRepresentatives have written to the Administrator of the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development encouraging him to exercise the authority \nwe provided and make a generous contribution to the fourth \nreplenishment. The Administrator of USAID has not complied with these \nrequests.\n  While other countries have agreed to the fourth replenishment, the \nUnited States has delayed, and this delay is threatening IFAD's \nmanagerial reforms and undermining U.S. leadership in the organization.\n  It is my objective to secure effective U.S. participation in the \nfourth replenishment. The United States has been the lead sponsor of \nIFAD, a tightly managed organization that focuses on rural poverty in \ndeveloping nations by making loans directly to poor farmers. These \nsmall retail loans help combat poverty, especially among women and \nchildren, create internal stability, and help build markets for U.S. \nexports.\n  Despite wide support and the earlier stated intention of the \nadministration to participate in the fourth replenishment, it has not \nyet announced its pledge. As the Nation that led in the creation and \nfunding of IFAD, part of the U.S. responsibility is to announce our \nlevel of financial support which, in turn, helps determine the pledge \namounts of other developed nations. In this way, our contribution is \nleveraged and brings additional resources from other developed \ncountries, funds that are spent, not on overhead or administration, but \non local projects where this money has substantial impact.\n  The funding in my amendment does not add to the total cost of the \nbill. It is a mandated transfer of bilateral assistance funds, either \nprovided in this bill or unspent from appropriations made in prior \nyears. The amounts to be transferred are to come from the funds the \nCongress provides for USAID, an agency well-suited for this task. \nIndeed, USAID has spoken eloquently in support on IFAD and has helped \nbuild it into a model of effective assistance. Unfortunately, however, \nUSAID has not spent one nickel on IFAD for fiscal year 1996.\n  Congress cannot allow indecisiveness to undo the achievements of two \ndecades of U.S. participation in IFAD. Senators and Representatives--on \nboth sides of the aisle--clearly support IFAD and have called on USAID \nto continue funding this respected agency. Our only recourse now is to \nmandate participation in the fourth replenishment.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5085\n\n     SEC.  .

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Environmental Impact Assessments as a national \n     instrument are undertaken for proposed activities that are \n     likely to have a significant adverse impact on the \n     environment and are subject to a decision of a competent \n     national authority;\n       (2) in 1978 the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 49, \n     calling on the United States Government to seek the agreement \n     of other governments to a proposed global treaty requiring \n     the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments for any \n     major project, action, or continuing activity that may be \n     reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on \n     the physical environment or environmental interests of \n     another nation or a global commons area;\n       (3) subsequent to the adoption of Senate Resolution 49 in \n     1978, the United Nations Environment Programme Governing \n     Council adopted Goals and Principles on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment calling on governments to undertake comprehensive \n     Environmental Impact Assessments in cases in which the \n     extent, nature, or location of a proposed activity is such \n     that the activity is likely to significantly affect the \n     environment; and\n       (4) on October 7, 1992, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the \n     Antarctic Treaty, which obligates parties to the Antarctic \n     Treaty to require Environmental Impact Assessment procedures \n     for proposed activities in Antarctica.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Government should encourage the \n     governments of other nations to engage in analysis of \n     activities that may cause adverse impacts on the environment \n     of other nations or a global commons area; and\n       (2) such addition analysis can recommend alternatives that \n     will permit such activities to be carried out in \n     environmentally sound ways to avoid or minimize any adverse \n     environmental effects, through requirements for Environmental \n     Impact Assessments where appropriate.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate adopted my \namendment on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary \ncontext. I want to thank the bill's managers, in particular, for their \nassistance in making Senate action possible. I also want to thank \nSenator Murkowski for his willingness to work with me on this issue.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the U.S. Government should encourage other nations to carry \nout environmental impact assessments for activities that will have \ntransboundary impacts. In other words, if countries are going to carry \nout activities with significant cross-border environmental impacts, the \ncountry undertaking the activity should, at a bare minimum, be aware of \nthe consequences of its activities.\n  The amendment is an extension of my long interest in the protection \nof the global commons. In 1977, I introduced a resolution which called \non the U.S. Government to seek the agreement of other governments to a \nproposed global treaty requiring the preparation of an international \nenvironmental assessment for any major project, action, or continuing \nactivity which may be reasonably expected to have a significant adverse \neffect on the physical environment or environmental interest of another \nnation or a global commons area. That resolution was adopted by the \nSenate in 1978. While my 1978 resolution initially called for a global \ntreaty applying to activities worldwide, regional approaches may also \nbe called for in some instances. We have seen such an approach used in \nthe Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary \nContext. The Convention was signed by the United States and members of \nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\n  Mr. President, this amendment simply underscores the point that \nenvironmental impact assessments should be carried out when activities \nin one country are likely to affect adversely the environment of \nanother country or the global commons.\n  What the United States and its allies have achieved, both in domestic \nlaw and in treaties, must now be duplicated\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\nby other states, so that the use of environmental impact assessment \ntruly becomes a standard precautionary measure.\n  Mr. President, this amendment acknowledges the efforts that have \nalready been made and encourages the U.S. Government to continue \nefforts to promote environmental impact assessments as a tool in \nenvironmental protection. I thank my colleagues for their support of \nthis amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5082, as modified\n\n       On page 120, line 21, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, $5,000,000 shall be \n     available only for a land and resource management institute \n     to identify nuclear contamination at Chernobyl.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments, \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5084 through 5087), en bloc, and amendment (No. \n5082), as modified, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay those motions on the table.\n  The motions to lay on the table were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Simpson is on the floor and \nready to proceed.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the manager, indeed, for his patience and \ncourtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5088\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the provision which extends reduced refugee \n                     standards for certain groups)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5088.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 196, strike lines 14 through 26.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment will strike a very ill-\ndefined section of this bill on page 196, which would give no one any \nindication as to what it is because it leaves us simply in the section \nnumbers and subsection numbers.\n  The amendment would strike that provision in this bill, one whose \ntitle is Section 576, ``Extension Of Certain Adjudication Provisions.'' \nIt does not accurately capture its full importance in any way.\n  My colleagues may be unaware of this provision's significance. And \nthe committee report provides precious little guidance. The report says \nonly that this provision ``amends current law to extend for another \nyear the authority to adjust the status of certain aliens.''\n  This provision, Mr. President, has far more serious consequences than \nits title indicates. It is the continuation of what was known \noriginally as the Lautenberg amendment, a very well-founded amendment \nin 1989. I commended my friend then, and I have always enjoyed working \nwith Senator Lautenberg. It is now a provision which has distorted, in \nthese times in 1996, has distorted our refugee system and permitted the \nentry of frauds and criminals into the United States.\n  This provision is an abuse in its present form, an abuse of the \nrefugee act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in sweeping away this cold war \nprovision, this relic, in restoring credibility to U.S. refugee \nadmissions. Let me review it with you very briefly. Under the Refugee \nAct of 1980--I know this amendment will probably get trashed by a vote \nof 80-20, but it will be in the Record--we know that we cannot continue \nto make presumptive status of ``refugeeness'' when we should be doing \nit on a case-by-case basis. That is what the law provided, the 1980 \nlaw.\n  You have a situation today where if you are presumed to be a refugee, \nyou are taking a precious number from someone who is a real refugee, \nsomeone fleeing persecution based upon race, religion, or national \norigin. Under the Refugee Act of 1980 and under the U.N. Convention and \nProtocol, a ``refugee'' is someone with a well-founded fear of \npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group or political opinion. This is the international \ndefinition, and the U.S. adopted it in 1980 under the able leadership \nof Senator Ted Kennedy. Determination of whether an individual is a \nrefugee is to be made on a case-by-case basis. It is the law.\n  Under the so-called Lautenberg amendment, with the best of intentions \nand the sincerest of motives, persons in the former Soviet Union \nqualify as a refugee just by being a member of a particular group. For \nJews and Evangelical Christians in the former Soviet Union, and others, \nUkrainian, Orthodox, a refugee applicant need only ``assert'' the fear \nof persecution and ``assert\" a credible basis for concern about the \n``possibility'' of such persecution.\n  Mr. President, 50,000 Americans receive refugee status under this \nstandard each year, and the total number of refugees as set by the \nUnited States is 92,000. In other words, admission to the United States \nas a refugee, and all of the protection and the financial assistance \nwhich accompanies such a status, is made on the basis of two assertions \nthat do not in themselves involve any test of credibility at all. Every \nother refugee applicant is required to establish his or her identity \nfor eligibility to establish that. Those who benefit from this special \ntreatment need only to assert their eligibility.\n  About 80 percent of these special refugee admissions go to Jewish \napplicants, with the balance to Evangelicals. Not surprisingly, there \nhas been a wave of dubious conversions reported in the latter group, \nEvangelicals especially, among Pentecostals. There are church members \nwho say they did not know this person was a Pentecostal, but they were \nnear enough to the church and they learned what to say at the \ninterview. In fact, a leader of a Pentecostal group in Russia told the \nINS that many who claim to be so are not Pentecostals at all.\n  According to this church leader, most of the applicants simply have \nfamily members who are Pentecostal, and these applicants use their \nfamiliarity with the religion to pass themselves off as category \nmembers.\n  According to interim cables which I will have printed in the Record \nfrom the Immigration and Naturalization Service, less than--I hope you \nhear this in this debate--less than one-half of 1 percent of those who \napply under the Lautenberg standards would meet the worldwide \ndefinition of refugee. Nevertheless, 91 percent of these applicants \nwere approved under the reduced guidelines.\n  In the most recent human rights reports from the State Department to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, the U.S. State Department found in \nRussia ``the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the \nGovernment respects this right in practice.'' The report continues that \n``although Jews and Muslims continue to encounter prejudice,'' and \nindeed they do, ``they have not been inhibited by the Government in the \nfree practice of their religion.''\n\n  Does anyone here doubt that there is no prejudice in the former \nSoviet Union? Of course not. There is tremendous prejudice in the \nformer Soviet Union, please hear that. It is also a fact that there is \nprejudice in this country. I do not dispute that fact either, and no \none else can, but simple prejudice does not make a person here or in \nthe former Soviet Union a refugee. Refugees are persons fleeing \nofficial political persecution. They are not fleeing discrimination.\n  Now my colleagues should know that the categories under the \nLautenberg amendment, which receive a special lower adjudication \nstandard, was established in 1989 when there was a clear history of \nreligious persecution by the Communist Soviet State apparatus. This is \nno longer the case. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia is an ally. This \nforeign aid bill we are debating tonight provides $640 million in aid \nto this country. How can we possibly decide that up to 50,000 of the \nprecious numbers of 90,000-plus are refugees? This program does great \nviolence to the Refugee Act of 1980.\n  The inspector general of the State Department just completed a \nthorough audit of the refugee admissions program. I want to share some \nof the findings in the January 1996 report.\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\n  INS officers told State Department investigators that the so-called \nLautenberg designations have changed the U.S. refugee admissions \nprogram into a ``side-door immigration program.'' You see, if you bring \na refugee to this country, the United States of America pays the bill, \npays the transportation, pays for the support system after they come \nhere. But if you immigrate, you pay it. Hear that--if you bring a \nsponsored immigrant to the United States, you pay; you, personally, pay \nfor their transportation; you, personally, say they will not become a \npublic charge, and people obviously would prefer to come in under \nrefugee status.\n  Evidence is mounting, mounting, and this has been echoed by Moscow-\nbased groups working with the former Soviet refugees, that this is a \n``side-door immigration program.'' Undoubtedly, most of these people, \nthe evidence is mounting, showing that most of these people are not \nrefugees. The State Department reports that there more than 42,000 \npeople--at least it will be in the Record; if nobody is paying \nattention, it will not make that much difference--there are more than \n42,000 people who have received refugee status but who have not yet \nleft the former Soviet Union. More than half of those individuals have \nremained for more than a year.\n  How can you be a real refugee and not get out? The inspector general \nreports that many of these folks are holding refugee status as an \ninsurance policy against future upheaval in the former Soviet Union, or \nsimply waiting for an opportunity to leave.\n  I want to acknowledge that many fine immigrants enter under the \nLautenberg provisions. Many are well-educated and become productive \nmembers of the Nation and citizens, but these are not refugees, and \nindividuals who are not refugees should not receive special refugee \nbenefits. We should stop pretending these individuals are fleeing any \ntype of State-sponsored persecution. They may be fleeing prejudice. \nThat does not qualify you as a refugee.\n\n  Unfortunately, the program has also become rife with fraud, a direct \nresult of the lowered standards. Let me read an internal INS cable from \nMoscow:\n\n       Category fraud is relatively easy to perpetuate as the \n     Washington Processing Center requires no written \n     documentation to corroborate a category claim. Applicants who \n     claim they are Jewish by nationality arrive at their \n     interview with a passport showing Russian nationality and a \n     birth certificate showing both parents are Russian. The claim \n     is then made that one maternal grandmother was Jewish. Such \n     an assertion, while not very credible, is unverifiable. Blank \n     and fraudulent documents are readily accessible. Only blatant \n     cases of fraud can be denied outright, otherwise parole must \n     be offered.\n\n  The INS claim points out that not only are refugee claims of dubious \nquality--that is, few of the applicants have actually experienced \npersecution--but applicants do not even satisfy the category selected \nfor special treatment. In other words, the applicants are not even \nJewish or Evangelical Christians or Pentecostals or Orthodox Ukraine.\n  The program has become an international disgrace. A State Department \nreport mentions a satirical play performed in Moscow based on an \napplicant deceiving the INS adjudicators.\n  An INS cable from 1993 says, ``Many reliable sources have told us of \na cottage industry which has sprung up which gives refugee applicants \nclasses on how to successfully pass their INS interview.''\n  This amendment has the most pernicious effect--and I know there is \nnot a person in this Chamber that would want this to happen, but it \ndoes--this amendment denies real refugees the opportunity for a safe \nhaven in our country. This provision has established a multiyear \ncommitment on behalf of the special categories--in other words, the \npipeline is clogged--and has guaranteed that more than half of our \nfiscal year 1996 refugee numbers are going to people who are not really \nfleeing persecution. Our flexibility to respond to other refugee crises \n--in Liberia, in Burundi, in Bosnia--is sorely and cruelly limited by \nthis commitment. ``Cruelly'' is a word I intended to use. So the INS \nofficials go on to say, ``The irony is that there are plenty of cases \nfrom the former Soviet Union which could qualify [as a refugee] under \nworldwide standards, however these cases stand little chance of being \nscheduled [for an interview] as they do not fit into one of the \nLautenberg categories.''\n\n  I believe that we should keep an INS refugee team in Moscow. I will \nvote for that every time. Please hear that. I am not advocating that we \ncut back on admission of real refugees, but these adjudicators should \nbe considering the claims of all residents on a case-by-case basis. \nThat is the law.\n  These lowered standards and fraud also have another effect. This \nLautenberg provision has created an attractive avenue for Russian \norganized crime figures to secure entry into the United States.\n  Let me read from the FBI's white paper on Russian organized crime. \nThe FBI discusses the Lautenberg process and says:\n\n       Many of these immigrants claimed that their reason for \n     leaving the Soviet Union was predominantly to escape \n     religious persecution. Not all of these crimes can be \n     considered to be accurate. The ranks of these emigres \n     included intellectuals, professionals, and others from the \n     middle and lower classes of Soviet society, who only claimed \n     religious persecution, but had not actually experienced it. \n     It has been estimated by American law enforcement authorities \n     that roughly 2,000 of these immigrants were criminals who \n     continued their criminal occupations in the United States.\n\n  So the FBI has identified the Lautenberg program as a point of entry \nfor some members of the ``Russian Mafia'' into this country. But we do \nnot need to stop there. Try the Senate. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Senate Government Affairs Committee has just \ncompleted a 6-month inquiry into Russian organized crime in the United \nStates. At their hearing on May 15, the subcommittee heard testimony \nfrom a member of the Russian Mafia, who testified anonymously, behind \nthe screen, for his own protection. He is in the clink now.\n  During meetings with Investigations Subcommittee staff members, that \nindividual, a member of a Russian crime ring in the United States, said \nthe Lautenberg refugee program was used all the time by Russian Mafia \nmembers to enter our Nation. If we don't pay attention to our own \nSenate investigations, Mr. President, just who are we going to listen \nto?\n  The time has come to let this program end. We must not continue to \nlet domestic, selfish interests corrupt our refugee program, to the \ndetriment of real refugees. We will never have more refugees maybe than \nwe will this year. We don't have the numbers to produce, and we presume \nthen that we will give them to a country we are giving $640 million to \ntonight, and jeopardize the safety of our own citizens.\n  Let me share the recommendations of the State Department inspector \ngeneral's report:\n\n       We recommend . . . that Congress allow the Lautenberg \n     amendment to expire in 1996.\n\n  It cannot be stated any more clearly than that, Mr. President. The \nindependent auditor of the Department of State believes this must be \ndone in order to bring our refugee programs out of the cold war and \ninto today's reality. I agree with her. I hope my colleagues will agree \nalso. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from Wyoming has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is there a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time agreement. The time of the \nSenator from Wyoming has expired, and the Senator from New Jersey has \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that happens around here when people \ndecide, like the distinguished occupant of the chair or the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, to retire is that we are going to \nmiss some of the aspects of the relationships that exist. Nothing is \nmore awakening or stimulating than a good, solid disagreement and \ndiscussion with my friend from Wyoming.\n  He just happens to be wrong. The fact of the matter is that in this \nblanket criticism, he ignores several facts. Mr. President, I think it \nis important to understand my supporting a 1-year extension of the law \nwhich facilitates the granting of refugee status for certain \nhistorically persecuted groups in the former Soviet Union and \nIndochina.\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\n The law expires at the end of fiscal year 1996 and is extended for 1 \nyear in this bill. It has been renewed several times. As a matter of \nfact, the last time was in 1994, and that vote was decided by an 85-15 \noutcome. So we are looking at the same situation, very frankly.\n  Existing law formally recognizes that historic experiences of certain \npersecuted religious minorities in the former Soviet Union and \nIndochina and a pattern of arbitrary denials of refugee status to \nmembers of these minorities entitles them to a relaxed standard of \nproof in determinations about whether they are refugees.\n  The law lowers the evidentiary standard required to qualify for \nrefugee status for Jews and Evangelical Christians from the former \nSoviet Union, certain Ukrainians, and certain categories of \nIndochinese. Once a refugee applicant proves that he or she is a member \nof one of those groups, he or she has to demonstrate a ``credible basis \nfor concern'' about the possibility of persecution. Refugee applicants \nnormally must prove a ``well-founded'' fear of persecution.\n  Why is the extension necessary? my friend from Wyoming challenges. \nBecause the popularity, as we see it now, of ultranationalists and the \nresurgence of the Communists in the former Soviet Union has created a \nclimate of tension, fear, and even violence against Jews, despite the \nfact that anti-Semitism is no longer formally state-sponsored.\n  In this climate, the law has provided a useful escape valve for \nhistorically persecuted individuals in the former Soviet Union where \nthe situation for Jews remains tenuous. Allowing the law to lapse under \nthese conditions would be a mistake.\n  How pervasive is anti-Semitism? According to Sergei Sirotkin, former \nDeputy Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights under the President \nof the Russian Federation, ``Xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Russia are \nnot just a reality but a growing and spreading reality.''\n  In testimony before the House Subcommittee on International \nOperations and Human Rights of the Committee on International \nRelations, Sirotkin claimed that approximately 150 periodicals that \npropagate ideas of fascism, extreme nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-\nSemitism exist and that between 1992 and 1995 the number of these \npublications tripled.\n  In his testimony, Sirotkin cited a newspaper with national \ncirculation called the Day which wrote: ``The Jews are not a nation but \na sect of degenerates.'' Even worse was the response from Moscow's \nDeputy Public Prosecutor who, according to Sirotkin, said the statement \ndid not contain anything insulting to Jews.\n  It's not only publications that espouse anti-Semitism. Political \nleaders in Russia contribute to the climate of fear as well.\n  Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party candidate for President, left \nlittle to the imagination about his view of Jews when he wrote in his \nbook ``Beyond the Horizon'': ``The Jewish diaspora holds the \ncontrolling interest in the entire economic life of Western \ncivilization.''\n  Jews find no comfort in the sentiment espoused by Liberal Democratic \nParty of Russia leader, Zhirinovsky, who has said ``for anti-Semitism \nto disappear, all Jews must move to Israel.''\n  Nor do they have faith that Alexander Lebed, President Yeltsin's new \nNational Security Adviser, will play a constructive role in working to \nstem the tide of anti-Semitism in Russia.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, Mr. Lebed recently stated that \nRussia has only three established, traditional religions--Orthodox \nChristianity, Islam, and Buddhism, obviously excluding the religion of \nthe country's large Jewish population. He denigrated the Mormon Church \nin the worst and the ugliest terms.\n  Mr. President, the fears of Russian Jews are evident in the stories \nrefugees tell me and others after they arrive in this country.\n  They say the government is unwilling and unable to protect Jews from \nhumiliation and persecution. They say they are in danger of being \nexposed to violence or persecution simply because they are Jews.\n  One Russian refugee who testified before the House International \nRelations Committee said:\n\n       Even now, in Russia, Jews must have ``nationality--JEW'' \n     written on their passports, job applications, birth \n     certificates, and school documents.\n\n  This refugee went on to say:\n\n       But worst of all is that the Government in Russia is \n     absolutely incapable of protecting Jews from the never-ending \n     persecution and violence. They do not possess the mechanism \n     for enforcing the laws which they already have, the laws \n     which formally protect human rights. The laws are not \n     functioning.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, anti-Semitism is pervasive outside of \nRussia as well.\n  According to Paul Goble, a well-respected expert on Soviet \nminorities:\n\n       The threat of anti-Semitism in the post-Soviet States is \n     greater today than it has been at any time in the last \n     decade. The inability of governments to enforce their own \n     laws or follow up on their own promises, the worsening \n     economic situation throughout the region that is leading to a \n     search for scapegoats, and an increasing number of \n     politicians and officials who see anti-Semitism as a useful \n     tool to advance their causes all contribute to this threat.\n\n  Leaders in some of these States recognize that a problem exists, In \nfact, during a radio interview last year, Lithuania's President \nacknowledged that popular ant-Semitism still exists in Lithuania.\n  Unfortunately, however, sometimes it is the leaders who are part of \nthe problem. Belarus' President Lukashenko recently said, ``Not all of \nHitler's actions were bad; one can learn from him methods of governing \na country * * *''\n  That is a pretty friendly environment to exist in. If that does not \nfrighten the pants off somebody, then nothing will.\n  If these statements are not persuasive, listen to the words of a \nrefugee from Uzbekistan. Her pseudonym is Raisa Kagan, and she also \ntestified before the Congress in February:\n\n       For more than two years, me and my family were subjected to \n     anti-Semitic harassment and persecution which escalated into \n     violence that put our lives at risk.\n\n  Ms. Kagan tells a harrowing tale of persecution beginning with verbal \nattacks:\n\n     They called me ``dirty Jew'' and said such things as, ``It \n     was a good time when Hitler burned Jews and hung them on the \n     trees.''\n\n  After being threatened on many occasions, Ms. Kagan reports:\n\n       She repeatedly requested protection for myself and my \n     family from these attacks, but no official investigation was \n     made and no steps were taken to safeguard my family.\n\n  In the months that followed, two members of her family were attacked \nand beaten by Uzbeks; her barn, garage, and house were set on fire by \narsonists; and she was eventually fired from her job as a department \nhead of a company for which she had worked for 20 years, with the \nexplanation that ``only Uzbek nationals may head a department.''\n  Her conclusion is poignant:\n\n       Thousands of Jewish families in Uzbekistan can report the \n     same shameless, severe and terrible violations of their civil \n     rights. If you are unfortunate enough to be Jew you often \n     feel that your dignity is trampled with cynicism. To be \n     Jewish in Uzbekistan today means to be unprotected, \n     rightless, and robbed. But the most terrible is to be \n     humiliated until you feel like a nonentity.\n\n  Clearly, Mr. President, now is not the time to allow the law to \nexpire. The conditions which led to the change in the law in 1989 have \nintensified, anti-Semitism is pervasive, and the protections the law \nprovides to historically persecuted individuals in the former Soviet \nUnion are needed more than ever before.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, the law is important to implement a new \nprogram of Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Refugees. In April \n1996, the administration announced a program of Resettlement \nOpportunities for Vietnam Refugees [ROVR] to provide INS status \nadjudications for qualified Vietnamese boat people returning from the \ncamps of Southeast Asia to Vietnam.\n  The program will provide resettlement for those Vietnamese with close \nties to the United States or who have suffered significant persecution \nunder the Communist regime. The program is also intended to minimize \nviolence in the camps as the Vietnamese refugee program comes to an end \nand to help to bring this long and successful humanitarian program to \nan appropriate and honorable conclusion.\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\n  INS adjudication standards for ROVR are based on the criteria found \nin this law and will play a critical role in the implementation of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, to respond to a couple of the assertions made by my \nfriend from Wyoming, first of all, he uses the inspector general's \nreference as a determination of whether or not the policy is right. \nThat is not the inspector general's area. The program has to be \ndetermined or reviewed by them.\n  Mr. President, we heard all of the criticisms about the weaknesses of \nthe system for permitting those who were not supposed to be coming to \nenter the country. Then, Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming has \nlong been involved with immigration programs, and he ought to insist \nthat INS do its job and make sure that those criminals do not get in \nhere. There is no presumption here that permits criminals to come in \nunder this refugee status. It is very clearly demarcated in the law. It \nsays that those who may be excluded are on the basis of criminal and \nrelated grounds, and describes what they are--as refugees under the \nImmigration and Naturalization Act. It is very clear. They are not \nsupposed to permit them.\n  If INS is doing a bad job then they ought to do a better job, and the \nsame thing is true of the quality of the citizens who come here. Yes. \nWe are going to make mistakes and some are going to sneak through the \napparatus, and there will be some of those who are engaged in illicit \nactivities. We do not want them here. But I know scientists and \nphysicians and even attorneys who have come to this country who make \nit. I say even attorneys because it is quite a transition from Russia--\nI am not talking about my attorney friends--from the language there to \nour language here. They make important contributions to establish \nthemselves. I have been with cab drivers. I have seen them buy their \ncabs, get to work, and make a contribution.\n  So we can point out those furors that have been made, and they have \nbeen made. We ought to tighten up the process, and not thereby \ndenigrate the whole class of refugees who are coming here.\n  Negotiations with the Vietnamese on the program have been slow and \nmany details remain unclear. Many believe that persons, otherwise well \nqualified, will not have been able to apply under the program by the \ntime the law is set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1996.\n  It is important that the program deadline and the law be extended so \nthat all persons eligible to apply under the program's criteria will be \ngiven equal access to this initiative and can be adjudicated uniformly.\n  Mr. President, this 1 year extension has the support of the \nadministration.\n  In a hearing in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Secretary Christopher said the following in response to \nmy question about the administration's position on the provision: \n``Senator we think that the law has served an important purpose, \nparticularly permitting immigration from Russia and the other nations \nof the former Soviet Union, to ensure that they have an opportunity to \nleave.\n  There has been some sense that perhaps that law had served its \npurpose or run its course, but we are supporting another year's \nextension of that law to ensure that it completes its purpose. So we \nare supportive of that and we admire you for what you did in leading \nthe way in earlier years to a much needed provision.''\n  Mr. President, in addition to making sure that people are treated \nhumanely and democratically in societies with which we have close \nconnections, it is a confirmation of the belief that in the United \nStates we uphold the status of the individuals to practice their \nreligions, and to be able to conduct themselves as they see fit without \nfear of harassment or persecution.\n  Once again, I think that we are going to vote on this, I understand, \ntomorrow.\n  The 1 year extension also has the support of the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the American Jewish \nCommittee, the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, \nthe Union of Councils, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, and the \nCouncil of Jewish Federations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from these organizations in \nsupport of an extension be included in the Record at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will close.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this extension will not \nincrease the annual refugee ceiling for admissions to the United \nStates. Those numbers are determined through a consultation process \nbetween the administration and the Congress.\n  My friend from Wyoming said that we absorb refugees, and he describes \nthem as legitimate refugees. If someone has to worry about their kids \nbeing picked on and beaten up in the streets and not be allowed to \nconduct their education as they see fit, to me that constitutes someone \nwho ought to have a chance to conduct their lives in another place.\n  I think that when all is said and done that we will see that this \nbill has served the United States very well, that we have gotten \nproductive citizens--citizens who make a contribution. And if we have \nsome errors in the way we conduct the programs, then let us fix the \nerrors in our own house, and I hope that my colleagues will support the \ncontinuation of this law for the next year.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this extension will not \nincrease the annual refugee ceiling for admissions to the United \nStates. Those numbers are determined through a consultation process \nbetween the administration and the Congress. The provision simply \nfacilitates refugee designation.\n  Mr. President, this law was originally approved by the Senate by a \nvote of 97 to 0 in 1989 and became law as part of the fiscal year 1990 \nForeign Operations Appropriations Acts. It was extended in the fiscal \nyear 1991 and fiscal year 1992 Foreign Operations Appropriations Acts, \nand the fiscal year 1994-1995 Foreign Relations Authorization Act. I \nurge my colleagues to support this extension.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         U.S. Catholic Conference,\n\n\n                               Migration and Refugee Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing to express the deep \n     appreciation of the U.S. Catholic Conference for the \n     initiative which you took many years ago to author a \n     provision of refugee law which recognizes that the historic \n     experiences of certain persecuted religious minorities in the \n     former Soviet Union and other groups in Indochina, and a \n     pattern of arbitrary denials of refugee status to members of \n     these groups, entitles them to a relaxed standard of proof in \n     determinations about their refugee status. We strongly \n     support the extension of this provision for one additional \n     year.\n       While it is a fact that the former Soviet Union has \n     collapsed and the persecution of Jews and other religious \n     minorities is no longer official policy, the situation in \n     Russia continues to present major problems for these \n     minorities and, given the fact that democratic society is \n     still only tenuously established in the countries of the \n     former Soviet Union, it would be much too early to draw back \n     from this important program. Indeed, recent developments \n     which appear to make the departure of such persons from \n     Russia more difficult is a sign of the importance of giving \n     priority attention to this group for the time being.\n       This provision is also of importance in the implementation \n     of a new program of Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese \n     Refugees (ROVR). This program will provide INS status \n     adjudication for persons returning to Vietnam from the camps \n     of Southeast Asia, who have close ties with the United States \n     or who can otherwise demonstrate persecution by the \n     Vietnamese government. This program will offer both a final \n     opportunity for some of those boat people in groups long \n     given priority in the U.S. Refugee Program (USRP) and help to \n     minimize violence during this final phase of the Indochinese \n     refugee program, which has been so successful over the years, \n     and help to bring it to an honorable end.\n       The INS adjudication standards for this final effort are \n     based on the criteria in this provision of law and, thus, \n     will be critical in an appropriate implementation of ROVR. \n     Negotiations with the Vietnamese on ROVR have been very slow \n     and many details remain unclear. For example, no agreement \n     has yet been reached on how to process those boat people who \n     return to Vietnam without having seen a caseworker in the \n     first asylum country before departing in order to fill out \n     their ROVR applications. Several thousand persons already \n     have been returned without having had an opportunity to apply \n     for ROVR and undoubtedly there will be more. Thus, it seems \n     certain that many persons, otherwise well qualified, will not \n     have been able to apply for ROVR by the time of the\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n     expiration of this provision of law at the end of FY 1996, \n     and it will be extremely important that the ROVR deadline and \n     this provision of law be extended so that all persons \n     eligible to apply under the ROVR criteria are given equal \n     access to this initiative and can be adjudicated uniformly.\n       We understand that the FY 1997 Foreign Operations \n     appropriations bill in the House of Representatives did not \n     contain an extension of this provision of refugee law, but \n     that the report language in that bill did contain a reference \n     to the possibility that such an extension might be contained \n     in the Senate bill and instructed House conferees to recede \n     to the Senate on this issue if that were the case. We urge \n     that such a one-year extension be included in the Senate \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n       Thank you again for your assistance in bringing this \n     important program to a peaceful and fitting end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Swenson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The Hebrew Immigrant\n\n\n                                                  Aid Society,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 14, 1996.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: Thank you very much for your \n     efforts to include a one-year extension of the Lautenberg \n     Amendment in the FY1997 Foreign Operations Bill. HIAS fully \n     supports extending the Amendment because of the threats \n     currently faced by Jewry in the former Soviet Union (FSU).\n       As you know, the Lautenberg Amendment requires that the INS \n     take into account the history of persecution of certain \n     minorities, including Jews in the FSU and Vietnamese \n     political refugees, when adjudicating refugee applications \n     from such groups.\n       On February 27, 1996, the House Subcommittee on \n     International Operations and Human Rights held a hearing on \n     the persecution of Jews worldwide. This hearing illustrated \n     that those conditions in the FSU which necessitated the \n     passage of the Lautenberg Amendment in 1989 have intensified \n     in recent months.\n       The testimony of former Parliament member Alla Gerber and \n     expert on Soviet nationalities Paul Goble described anti-\n     Semitism in the FSU as being ``privatized'' after the \n     dissolution of the USSR. Recent emigres from the FSU \n     testified that they fled the land of their birth because the \n     authorities there were unwilling and unable to protect them \n     from rising anti-Semitism. Indeed, many politicians, \n     including leading Russian Presidential candidates Zyugonov \n     and Zhirinovsky, and Belarus President Lukashenko, exploit \n     such popular sentiment by blaming ``the Jew'' for all that \n     ails their respective nations. The attached news accounts of \n     recent events in the FSU re-enforce the concerns raised at \n     the hearing.\n       The hearing made it clear that now is not the time to allow \n     the Lautenberg Amendment to expire.\n       Once again, HIAS greatly appreciates your efforts to \n     include a one-year extension of the Lautenberg Amendment on \n     the FY 1997 Foreign Operations Authorization bill.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Martin A. Wemick,\n     Executive Vice-President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         The American Jewish Committee, Office of Government and \n           International Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Lautenberg Amendment has \n     provided refugee status for hundreds of thousands of Jews, \n     Pentecostals, Catholics, and others fleeing persecution in \n     the former Soviet Union and Indochina. The provision will \n     expire on September 30, 1996. The American Jewish Committee \n     urges you to support the reauthorizing language included in \n     the FY 1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\n       The Lautenberg Amendment offers fair and crucial protection \n     to the numerous groups facing continuing persecution in these \n     countries. The law provides that the INS consider the \n     historical context of persecution when reviewing refugee \n     applications. No special privileges or increased admissions \n     ceilings are created.\n       The fall of the Soviet Union has neither ended Russian \n     anti-Semitism nor diminished the need for the Lautenberg \n     Amendment. Troubling statements by prominent Russian \n     politicians, the closing of Jewish Agency offices in Russia, \n     and the recent disturbing remarks by General Alexander Lebed \n     on the status of religious minorities continued to \n     demonstrate the precarious place of Jews in the former Soviet \n     Union. Another indication of this uncertainty was the Russian \n     government's refusal to issue a visa to David A. Harris, \n     Executive Director of AJC, to attend a conference cosponsored \n     by AJC in St. Petersburg earlier this month on the future of \n     Jews in the former Soviet Union.\n       The threat of violence and persecution remains a present \n     danger for the Jews of the former Soviet Union. Currently, \n     100,000 Jewish men, women, and children are seeking asylum \n     under the Lautenberg Amendment. It is imperative that these \n     individuals remain able to receive refugee status in the \n     United States.\n       On behalf of the officers and members of the American \n     Jewish Committee, we hope that you will act to keep the doors \n     of refuge open in America for those fleeing persecution in \n     the former Soviet Union and Indochina. We urge your support \n     for the reauthorization of the Lautenberg Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jason F. Isaacson,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         National Jewish Community\n\n\n                                   Relations Advisory Council,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 18, 1996.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the National Jewish \n     Community Relations Advisory Council (NJCRAC), I am writing \n     to thank you for your continuing efforts to extend the \n     Lautenberg Amendment for an additional year by including it \n     in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY 1997. \n     The NJCRAC is the American Jewish community's network of 13 \n     national and 117 local public affairs organizations. Our \n     member agencies work with government representatives, the \n     media, and a wide array of religious, ethnic and civic \n     organizations to address a broad range of public policy \n     concerns.\n       Over the years, we have devoted significant energy to work \n     on behalf of refugees from the former Soviet Union. We are \n     well aware of how critical the Lautenberg Amendment has been \n     in that rescue effort. Moreover, the Lautenberg law has not \n     only enabled thousands of applicants from the former Soviet \n     Union to obtain refugee status but has also played a key role \n     in allowing refugees from Indochina to come to the United \n     States to begin new lives free of persecution and fear.\n       As you know, the situation for Jews in the former Soviet \n     Union is tenuous. The popularity of Vladimir Zhirinovsky and \n     other ultra-nationalists, along with the Communist \n     resurgence, has created a climate of tension, fear and, at \n     times even violence against Jews, despite the fact that there \n     is no longer an official government sponsored anti-Semitic \n     campaign. These modern circumstances, combined with the \n     historic persecution of Jews and other religious minorities \n     in the FSU, constitute for many a ``credible basis for \n     concern'' which qualifies them for refugee status under the \n     Lautenberg law. It is critically important that we retain \n     this law and, with it, the ability to move people out of \n     potentially dangerous circumstances.\n       Further, the continuation of the Lautenberg law remains \n     crucial for Vietnamese applicants, who are to be adjudicated \n     under the Administration's Resettlement Opportunities for \n     Vietnam Refugees (ROVR) program. It seems highly unlikely \n     that all refugees who are eligible to apply for consideration \n     under ROVR will be able to register in time to be adjudicated \n     under Lautenberg standards if the law expires at the end of \n     this fiscal year. An additional year's extension will be \n     critical to carrying out the intended purpose of the ROVR \n     program and sustaining our commitment to refugees in Vietnam.\n       The Administration is supporting a one year extension of \n     the Lautenberg law. The Congress approved such an extension \n     within the State Department Authorization bill that was \n     vetoed. It is our hope that the Congress will again pass an \n     extension by including in it the Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations bill. As you know, the House Foreign \n     Operations Committee has included in its report language \n     indicating that they would accede to the Senate if the \n     Lautenberg provision were to be included in the Senate \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n       Thousands of refugees, Jews and non-Jews, owe their freedom \n     to you for your leadership on this issue and the law that \n     bears your name. We have been pleased to work with you and \n     your staff to support your efforts each time the amendment \n     has come before the Senate and the House for renewal or \n     extension. We want you to know that you have our support and \n     assistance this time as well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael N. Newmark,\n     Chair, NJCRAC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            Union of Councils,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Union of Councils for Soviet \n     Jews (UCSJ) has long valued the leadership you have provided \n     in the struggle to protect refugees in the former Soviet \n     Union (FSU), and to promote human rights world-wide. We write \n     today to enthusiastically endorse a one year extension of the \n     Lautenberg Amendment; the central piece of United States \n     legislation dedicated to saving Jews and other refugees from \n     the FSU and Indochina.\n       The UCSJ, comprised of Soviet Jewry action councils in \n     thirty American cities, 100,000 members, and human rights \n     bureaus in five cities in the FSU, has for more than twenty-\n     five years been the largest independent grass-roots human \n     rights and Soviet Jewry organization in the world. The UCSJ \n     is a leading authority on antisemitism and the general threat \n     to Jews on the ground inside the FSU.\n       Since the Lautenberg Amendment was introduced in the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 1990, the UCSJ has \n     strongly supported the law as a bold statement of the United \n     States' foreign policy commitment to\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\n     human rights and democracy, and its humanitarian mission to \n     provide safe-haven to endangered refugees. The Lautenberg \n     Amendment declares that persecution of minorities is \n     unacceptable as part of the transition towards democracy in \n     the region. Additionally, the amendment has assisted tens of \n     thousands of refugees from historically persecuted \n     communities to find safety in the United States.\n       Today, conditions for Jews in the FSU are extremely \n     precarious. A significant majority of members of the Russian \n     Duma are from strongly antisemitic parties. The leading \n     contender in the upcoming presidential election, Gennady \n     Zyuganov, represents a coalition of nationalist, patriotic \n     and communist parties. This coalition has a serious chance of \n     winning the presidency, and poses a grave threat to the \n     Jewish community.\n       Based on the UCSJ's monitoring of conditions in the FSU, we \n     see antisemitism throughout the region, and an inability or \n     unwillingness on the part of the authorities to protect Jews. \n     The Jewish community faces a vibrant antisemitic publishing \n     industry, vilification in street demonstrations, and \n     vandalism of private and communal property. As Paul Gobel of \n     Radio Liberty stated at a recent hearing before a House \n     International Affairs subcommittee, ``The threat of \n     antisemitism in the post-Soviet states is greater today than \n     it has been at any time in the last decade.''\n       The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews firmly believes that \n     it would not only be a human rights catastrophe if the \n     Lautenberg Amendment was allowed to expire this year, but a \n     serious foreign policy blunder. At a time when Russia is in \n     danger of returning to communist or fascist rule, the United \n     States should not signal that it believes that all is well \n     for historically persecuted minorities.\n       The United States Congress has long been an ally of human \n     rights and democracy activists and persecuted minority groups \n     in the former Soviet Union. This noble tradition would be \n     honored by an extension of the Lautenberg Amendment through \n     the end of fiscal year 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Pamela B. Cohen,\n                                               National President.\n                                                Micah H. Naftalin,\n     National Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        National Conference on\n\n                                                 Soviet Jewry,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the National \n     Conference on Soviet Jewry, thank you for your successful \n     effort to include a one-year extension of the Lautenberg \n     Amendment in the FY1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations \n     Bill. Given the volatile and dangerous environment \n     confronting the Jewish minority in the former Soviet Union, \n     the NCSJ continues to support the extension of the Amendment.\n       The rise of popular ant-Semitism throughout the former \n     Soviet Union is a serious threat to the future well-being of \n     Jews in these countries. Government authorities are unable \n     and/or unwilling to adequately address this threat which \n     causes many Jews to continue to suffer.\n       The NCSJ, in conjunction with other members of the \n     organized American Jewish community, stands ready to assist \n     you to ensure passage of this vital legislation.\n       Once again, our sincere thanks for everything you have done \n     on behalf of the Jews of the former Soviet Union.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark B.

This critical law has assisted thousands of \n     refugee applicants from the Former Soviet Union and Indochina \n     to obtain refugee status and come to the U.S. to start a new \n     life free of persecution, fear and constant harassment.\n       As you know, the situation for Jews in the FSU is tenuous \n     at best. The popularity of Zhirinovsky and other ultra \n     nationalists as well as the resurgence of the Communists \n     creates a climate of tension, fear and often violence against \n     Jews even if there is no longer an official government \n     sponsored anti-Semitic campaign. These modern circumstances, \n     combined with the historic persecution of Jews and other \n     religious minorities in the FSU, constitute for many a \n     ``credible basis for concern'' which qualifies them for \n     refugee status under the Lautenberg law. The importance of \n     retaining this law and the ability to move people out of a \n     dangerous environment can not be overstated.\n       In addition, the continuation of the Lautenberg law remains \n     crucial for Vietnamese who are to be adjudicated under the \n     Administration's Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnam \n     Refugees (ROVR) program. It seems highly unlikely that all \n     refugees who are eligible to apply for consideration under \n     ROVR will be able to register in time to be adjudicated under \n     Lautenberg standards if the law expires at the end of this \n     fiscal year.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I intend to support the second-degree amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, speaking about the underlying amendment and the \nsecond-degree amendment, this deals with the underlying bill, the \nforeign operations appropriations bill, which proposed a relatively \nsmall contribution that the United States has agreed to make which is \npart of a very large agreement that holds great promise of stabilizing \nrelations between North Korea and South Korea, North Korea and its \nother neighbors in Asia, The so-called agreed framework which was \nagreed to in October of 1994 has had extraordinary effect on what was \nbeginning to be--sometimes our memories are short--a very threatening \nsituation in which we had conclusive evidence that the North Koreans \nwere building reactors that were capable of being used to build atomic \nweapons which, together with their massive ground forces, would \nthreaten security in that region of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, let us remember as we begin this discussion that in \n1993 the Defense Department issued the Bottom-Up Review, which set a \nstandard for the American military that we had to be strong enough to \ndeal with two major regional conflicts in the world at the same time. \nOne potential MRC was clearly in the gulf region, the Middle East, and \nthe other, in most people's contemplation, was on the Korean peninsula.\n  When we think about the fact that we sent a half million of our \nsoldiers to the gulf region to deal with that conflict--and carry out \nso brilliantly Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm--and that the \npotential for conflict on the Korean peninsula is in most people's \nminds of an equivalent size, we are talking about a very serious \nexposure for the United States in terms of our military personnel and \nalso in costs to our Treasury.\n  After rising international concern about the potential diversion of \nNorth Korea's nuclear power to develop atomic weapons, a series of \nnegotiations ensued which ended in the so-called agreed framework in \nOctober of 1994. The North Koreans took on certain obligations in \nreturn for which the United States and neighbors in that region, \nparticularly South Korea and Japan, took on other obligations, which \nthus far all parties have proceeded in what would have to be called \ngood faith to the great benefit of that region and the world, resulting \nin a de-escalation of tension and the potential for armed conflict \nthere.\n  This agreement required, for instance, North Korea to freeze \noperation of its 5-megawatt reactor and halt construction at its 50-\nmegawatt and 200-megawatt reactors. If the agreement were not in place, \nwithin a few short years these facilities would have been able to \nproduce enough plutonium for the North Koreans to build dozens of \nweapons each year. The agreed framework also required North Korea to \ncease operations at its reprocessing facility and laboratory which \nreprocesses plutonium out of spent nuclear fuel, and to seal that \nfacility.\n  I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency has confirmed that North Korea has taken all these steps \nto freeze their program. The IAEA is now working with North Korea to \nsettle on specific measures needed to continue to monitor that freeze. \nThe fact is that IAEA inspectors are maintaining a continuous \npresence--this is not just somebody's word and our best hopes, it is \nthe continuing presence of international inspectors at the Yongbyon \nnuclear facility in North Korea. The framework was deliberately \nstructured so the North Koreans would take the first steps, and we were \nable to verify compliance every step of the way.\n  Mr. President, over time, all of the facilities that are frozen will \nbe dismantled. In addition, 8,000 spent fuel rods that now sit in a \ncooling pond at the Yongbyon nuclear facility will eventually be \nshipped out of North Korea. These rods alone contain enough plutonium \nto make five to six bombs. This is truly a remarkable agreement.\n  No one says that North Korea has become a Jeffersonian democracy. Far \nfrom it. It is a country which faces all sorts of instability, \nparticularly the terrible condition of its economy, the inability \nactually to feed all its people. But in the midst of all that \ninstability which could have caused literally conflagration on the \nKorean peninsula, this agreement has been concluded.\n  What is their return for this? The return for this is that we have \nagreed to provide a certain amount of money every year for the North \nKoreans to purchase heavy fuel oil to help to operate other power \nplants within their country, and we have agreed to assist them in \nbuilding light water reactors which are much more nuclear-proliferation \nresistant, much less likely to be used to develop nuclear weapons than \nthe other reactors that the North Koreans have.\n\n  The cost of the light water reactors will amount to more than $4 \nbillion. The Republic of Korea, that is, South Korea, and Japan have \naccepted the lion's share of the financial burden for those light water \nreactors. The United States direct funding to the Korean Peninsula \nEnergy Development Organization, known as KEDO, which was set up under \nthe agreed framework to provide heavy fuel oil for the North Koreans \nand for other projects, is really a matter of us just assuming a fair \nshare of our burden. We pledged to commit $25 million, which is less \nthan half the total amount required for the heavy fuel oil purchases \nannually and which represents a very modest commitment when one \nconsiders the $4 billion cost for light water reactors that will be \nassumed primarily by the Republic of Korea and Japan.\n  Nonetheless, the foreign ops bill that is before us now cuts that \namount of money down to $13 million, threatening the stability of the \noverall agreed framework, and leading to concern in Japan and South \nKorea about the steadfastness of the United States in fulfilling its \nobligations under this agreement--leading to some concern in those \ncountries about whether they would fulfill their much larger \nresponsibilities under these agreements, and holding the potential to \nagain destabilize the Korean peninsula with great risk to those who \nlive there and those of us who have a security interest there.\n  Mr. President, I want to simply quote here from a letter Secretary \nPerry wrote to Senator Robert C. Byrd on this question dated July 15, \n1995. The Secretary says that without the full amount of U.S. support, \n$25 million--a lot of money as you look at it separately but a very \nsmall amount of money when you think of the amount of money we would \nhave to spend if the\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nKoreas become destabilized and a conflict ensued. Secretary Perry said:\n\n       Without U.S. support for KEDO, the organization will face a \n     significant funding shortfall for HFO. Should KEDO be unable \n     to fulfill its obligation to deliver oil, the risk of the \n     North breaking the nuclear freeze would rise significantly. \n     Such a scenario greatly increases the risk of a direct \n     confrontation with North Korea, with costs measured in lives \n     and billions of dollars.\n\n  Mr. President, my underlying amendment would restore the amount of \nmoney in the bill from the $13 million up to $25 million, which is the \namount the United States pledged to give annually to fund these \npurchases of heavy fuel oil and other expenses. It also makes clear--\nand Senator Levin, had he been here was going to ask this question--\nthat the $25 million can be used not just for the heavy fuel oil and \nadministrative expenses, but other expenses pursuant to the agreed \nframework between the parties in this matter.\n  The second-degree amendment which was worked on this evening by the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] and the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain] and myself, sets some standards for the \ndistribution of that $25 million. I will yield to the Senator from \nAlaska in a minute to describe that. It basically requires a \ncertification procedure by the President and grants the President a \nwaiver if he feels it is in the national security interest to do so \nbefore the $25 million is expended to KEDO.\n  I am pleased we have made such progress on this. I am honored that I \nhave a distinguished group of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle \nfor this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Lieberman amendment \nof which I am an original cosponsor.\n  I believe it is useful to recall that in June 1994 North Korea \ndecided to defuel its five megawatt research reactor, precipitating a \ncrisis on the Korean Peninsula. Spent fuel contains essential fissile \nmaterial for a nuclear arsenal and North Korea could have extracted \nenough plutonium to build five or six nuclear weapons.\n  As a result of the negotiation of the October 1994 Framework \nAgreement, North Korea agreed, among other things, to freeze and \neventually dismantle its graphite moderated nuclear reactors and \nrelated facilities and to safely store and ultimately ship out of its \nterritory the spent fuel from its five megawatt nuclear research \nreactor. The United States agreed to lead an international consortium \nto oversee the finance and construction of two 100-megawatt light water \nreactors and to provide 500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil annually \nuntil completion of the first light water reactor.\n  I am advised that North Korea has maintained the freeze on its \nnuclear facilities, that the IAEA has maintained a continuous presence \nin North Korea to verify and monitor the freeze, the canning of the \nmore than 8,000 spent fuel rods is proceeding at a steady pace and \nNorth Korea has concluded a number of agreements with KEDO to \nfacilitate the furnishing of the light water reactors, including a \nProtocol on Privileges and Immunities for KEDO personnel.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is in our national security interest to \nfreeze and eventually dismantle North Korea's graphite-moderated \nreactors and related facilities. The United States has approximately \n37,000 troops in and is committed by treaty to defend the Republic of \nKorea. As Secretary Perry has noted\n\n       Should KEDO be unable to fulfill its obligation to deliver \n     oil, the risk of the North breaking the nuclear freeze would \n     rise significantly. Such a scenario greatly increases the \n     risk of direct confrontation with North Korea, with costs \n     measured in lives and billions of dollars.\n\n  Under the arrangements worked out with our allies, South Korea and \nJapan have agreed to bear the financial burden for the provision of the \nlight water nuclear reactors for North Korea. The cost will be more \nthan $4 billion and by some estimates will approach $6 billion. The \nUnited States has agreed to fund less than one-half of the cost of \nproviding heavy fuel oil annually to make up for the loss of \nelectricity.\n  I am also advised that a number of countries have pledged monetary \ncontributions and the European Union is on the verge of making a multi-\nyear financial contribution commitment but that this commitment could \nbe endangered if the United States didn't provide the $25 million this \nyear.\n  Insummary, Mr. President, I believe that a $25 million contribution \nto KEDO for fiscal year 1997 is in our national security interest and I \nencouraged my colleagues to support the Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Lieberman amendment to \nprovide full funding for the Korean Peninsula Energy Organization, or \nKEDO. This amendment would provide the funding requested by the \nAdministration needed to meet our obligations under an important \nagreement this country has with North Korea.\n  This agreement, known as the ``Agreed Framework'' has effectively \nfrozen the North Korean nuclear weapon program. That is why we have \nsuch a strong stake in meeting our obligations under this agreement. If \nwe want to continue to freeze and eventually dismantle the North Korean \nnuclear weapons program, we must uphold our end of the agreement. That \nmeans paying our small portion of the cost of the agreement.\n   Mr. President, the underlying bill would reduce the funds for \nimplementing the Agreed Framework with North Korea from $25 million to \n$13 million. This level of funding--half the amount requested--would \nnot permit the United States to meet its obligation under the Agreed \nFramework. If that were to happen, North Korea could renege on its \ncommitments under that agreement and resume its nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  This is a remarkable fact, Mr. President. For want of $12 million, we \nare apparently willing to risk North Korea's return to a nuclear \nweapons program that we all agree would be exceedingly dangerous for \nour security and for the security of the Asia-Pacific region, including \nSouth Korea and Japan.\n  In almost every debate on defense and security issues, we hear the \nlist of so-called ``rogue'' nations, always including North Korea, that \npost a threat because of their work on ballistic missiless, on weapons \nof mass destruction, or as sponsors of terrorism. Why would we \nwillingly undo a success story--the Agreed Framework that has frozen \nthe Korean nuclear weapons program--and risk the grave dangers of North \nKorean nuclear weapons?\n  Indeed, it was the very threat of the North Korean nuclear weapons \nprogram that required us to negotiate the Agreed Framework. And had \nthat negotiation not worked, the alternative appeared to be the \nlikelihood of a military confrontation with North Korea, meaning war on \nthe Korean Peninsula that would involve massive casualties to our \nforces stationed there and to the Korean population.\n  The agreement that is now in place is a great benefit to our \nsecurity. Here is how the Diretor of Central Intelligence, John Deutch, \ndescribed the results of the agreement in March of this year:\n\n       Under the terms of the 21 October 1994 Agreed Framework \n     with the United States, North Korea agreed to freeze its \n     plutonium production capability. Currently, P'yongyang has \n     halted operation of the 5MW [Megawatt] reactor, ceased \n     construction of two larger reactors, frozen activity at the \n     plutonium recovery plant, and agreed to dismantle these \n     facilities.\n\n  When I asked our senior military leaders if they believe the Agreed \nFramework is in our security interests, they have all answered with a \nresounding yes. Here is the discussion I had with General \nShalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff in February \n1995:\n\n       Senator Levin. In your personal view, do you believe that \n     this agreement is in our national security interest and that \n     if implemented it would be a positive outcome for us?\n       General Shalikashvili. I very much believe so, particularly \n     when I consider the alternatives that we were faced with back \n     in the June timeframe or so when we were marching toward a \n     potential confrontation.\n\n  In March of this year, I had the following exchange with General Gary \nLuck, then our commander in chief of U.S. Forces in Korea, and with \nAdmiral Joseph Prueher, our commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific \nCommand concerning the Agreed Framework:\n\n       Senator Levin. [Has] the nuclear weapons program of North \n     Korea, in your judgment,\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\n     remained frozen since that agreement was reached?\n       General Luck. Yes sir.\n       Admiral Prueher. Yes sir.\n       Senator Levin. And in your judgment, does that make a \n     significant contribution to the security of that peninsula \n     and to our security? [In other words], the fact that their \n     nuclear program is frozen, is that important?\n       General Luck. Oh, yes sir. Yes sir.\n       Admiral Prueher. Yes, sir, it is important.\n       Senator Levin. Now, if we had not reached that agreement \n     and frozen the North Korean nuclear program, is it true that \n     North Korea today would have enough plutonium to make several \n     nuclear weapons, and could have several nuclear warheads \n     already and more warheads in the pipeline?\n       General Luck. [Sir, I am not an expert in that area, but \n     certainly] that was the prediction before we entered into \n     this agreement.\n       Senator Levin. As far as you know, is that an accurate \n     statement?\n       General Luck. As far as I know, it is, sir.\n       Admiral Prueher. And likewise, as far as I know.\n\n  Mr. President, Those are the typical comments of our senior military \ncommanders on the importance of the Agreed Framework, and the fact that \nNorth Korea is complying with its terms.\n  The civilian leadership in the Defense Department also agrees with \nthis assessment. I refer to an exchange between myself and Defense \nSecretary Bill Perry from March 5 of this year, and I ask that an \nexcerpt of the transcript from a hearing of the Armed Services \nCommittee be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the bill's restrictions on funding \nfor KEDO, and I urge my colleagues to support the Lieberman amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Levin--Perry on North Korea Nuclear Agreed Framework (Excerpt)\n\n       Senator Levin. First I want to ask you about Korea. Last \n     year you described the situation in North Korea with the so-\n     called agreed framework that froze North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons program, and explained that by freezing the program \n     that we prevented North Korea from producing plutonium for \n     weapons and from producing the weapons themselves. Has North \n     Korea kept its nuclear weapons program frozen?\n       Secretary Perry. Yes.\n       Senator Levin. And if we had not entered into that agreed \n     framework, where would North Korea's nuclear program be \n     today, and where could it be, say, in 3 years?\n       Secretary Perry. Had we not entered that program, we \n     believe that they would have, first of all, taken the \n     material from their reactor, the spent fuel from their \n     reactor, and reprocess it to get enough plutonium to make \n     perhaps four or five or six bombs, and quite possibly they \n     would have those bombs now; and that, secondly, they were \n     constructing other reactors which, when they were completed, \n     would give them the ability to get reactor fuel capable of \n     making perhaps 10 to 12 bombs a year. All of those programs \n     have been stopped. There is no such fuel being processed or \n     generated today.\n       Senator Levin. And I take it that that clearly is in our \n     security interest in a very major way?\n       Secretary Perry. This was, to me, a fundamental issue. We \n     were prepared to take very substantial actions that actually \n     raised the risk of conflict in order to stop that program. We \n     are able to do it through diplomacy, and we did not have to \n     take those other actions, and this has been a matter of great \n     significance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me yield to the Senator from Wyoming who has a \nunanimous consent request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5088\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment when it is processed tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it will be in order to order \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be sufficient second. \nThe yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5078\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first let me acknowledge the statement \nby my friend from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, relative to his \nwillingness to cosponsor my second-degree amendment and for the \nstatement in support of the Lieberman amendment which specifically \nrestores the administration's request for $25 million to support the \nKorea Peninsula Economic Development Organization. The significance of \nthis is that, if the job is going to be done and done right, it is \ngoing to take a commitment. To suggest it is going to be done with half \nthe amount of money is simply unrealistic. We might as well address \nreality. The administration is prepared to suggest, with the $25 \nmillion, it will be able to implement the agreed framework with North \nKorea.\n  I also want to recognize Senator McCain, who joins with me, as well \nas Senator Lieberman, in the second degree to the Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have asked for the yeas and nays. I will \nbe very brief in my remarks, assuming I am correct, that we have \nrequested the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested only on \nthe Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It would be my intention to ask for a voice vote on my \nsecond-degree amendment to the underlying amendment, to the Lieberman \namendment. Perhaps it would be in order to do that now. Then I can \nproceed with my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5089) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee proposed a \ncut of funding to $13 million. I do not think we are involved, here, in \na bean-counting debate. The question is, what does it take to do the \njob?\n  If we go back to the initiation of the framework agreement, I think \nmany of us were under the assumption that this would be an obligation \npretty much underwritten by South Korea and Japan. That has not been \nthe case. We have been involved and we continue to be involved. But my \nconcern, in real terms, is that what we are talking about is a major \nforeign policy initiative, and that is how we deal with North Korea.\n  I said on previous occasions I do not think the agreed framework was \nthe best way we could have negotiated it, but I am not going to judge \nthe administration necessarily in hindsight. My objection to the \nagreement was that, in negotiating, we agreed basically not to inspect \nthe two sites, the two storage sites, until after the first nuclear \nplant was about to be fueled. I think that was a mistake, but I am not \ngoing to go on at great length.\n  I am concerned the North Koreans live up to their commitments before \nthe money starts flowing. The Murkowski-Lieberman-McCain amendments \nwould condition the $25 million on the following. The first is \nPresidential certification that progress is really being made on the \nNorth-South relations. This is a condition of the agreed framework, but \none that is obeyed in the breach, if you will. There have been \nsignificant exceptions to that. North Korea has flouted, in some \ninstances, the armistice agreement and taken several actions in the \npast few months to increase tensions on the DMZ, by violating borders. \nThe question is how does this decrease tensions? It clearly does not.\n  Cooperating fully on safe storage of all spent fuel--this is a \nrequirement. Again, it is a condition of the agreed framework. Thus \nfar, I think the cooperation has been relatively reassuring on that \none.\n  No significant diversion of financial or other assistance--Senator \nMcConnell's provision deals with the important matter of the diversion \nof fuel oil. But I think it must go further. We have spent $8.2 million \nin food aid, even though there are conflicting reports about what North \nKorea does with the money. In fact, in the last 2 years we have spent \nover $50 million for North Korea in food value and other assistance.\n  So what we are talking about is full compliance with all the \nprovisions of the agreed framework and the confidential part, which \nincludes the timetable for compliance. This should be a no-brainer. If \nthere are violations, the money should simply stop. They should \nunderstand that.\n  If, as the administration assures me, North Korea is fully \ncooperating with\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\nthe agreed framework and is moving towards advancement on other issues, \nthese should be very, very easy certifications. It should not be any \nproblem at all. Further, before any money is spent, the administration \nwill report on whether North Korea is cooperating fully on activities \nto account for the MIA's, those missing in action, including the joint \nfield activities.\n\n  A lot of Americans forget, because the emphasis has been on Vietnam \nwhere currently we have unidentified less than 2,300 MIA's, but that is \nnot the case in North Korea. Mr. President, 8,177 service personnel are \nunaccounted for in the Korean conflict and at least 5,433 were lost \nnorth of the 38th Parallel. These are the forgotten men of the Korean \nwar.\n  I am pleased that the first joint operation started on July 10. \nAnother operation is scheduled for September. That is good news. It is \na start. But it is absolutely crucial to my support for the KEDO \nfunding. It is an issue I have spoken out on time and time again, and \nit is an issue I am glad to see the administration and negotiators have \nfinally brought into the discussion process. When KEDO started, when \nthe first negotiations were taking place, there was no mention, no \ncondition of our support and assistance and their cooperation on the \nMIA's. It is through the efforts of Senator McCain and a number of \nother Members of this body and Members of the House, to insert this \nmandate, that I think has brought an awakening to the administration.\n  The highest calling of Government is full accounting for those who \nhave given so much. We can never properly repay that. We simply have to \ndemand it. We know where those battle sites were. We know where those \nprison camps were, in the north. We know there are 5,433 that are \nunaccounted for and this is an opportunity to give that accounting to \ntheir relatives and loved ones.\n  Further, this would require a report on all instances of \nnoncompliance with the agreed framework, including diversion of fuel \noil. It is fair to say we have seen evidence of that in the past. So I \nthink what we have here, thanks to my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and others, is a message to the \nadministration that is responsible, is forthright, that meets their \nmonetary requirement, but, if you will, puts behind the agreement the \nfaith and credit of the Congress in an accountability that is \noftentimes difficult to find in a Government process such as we have \nbefore us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \nwith my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, to impose additional \nconditions on U.S. funding for the implementation of the North Korean \nNuclear Framework Agreement of 1994.\n  The bill before the Senate requires the President to certify that \nNorth Korea is using heavy fuel oil provided by the U.S. and other \ncountries under the Framework Agreement only for purposes permitted \nunder that agreement. I support that restriction.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Murkowski and myself would add \nadditional Presidential certification requirements to the existing \nlanguage. These additional certifications are:\n  Progress is being made to establish a meaningful dialogue between \nNorth and South Korea;\n  North Korea is cooperating fully with the canning and safe storage of \nspent fuel from its nuclear reactors at Yongbyon;\n  North Korea is in compliance with all other provisions of the nuclear \nframework agreement, including maintaining a complete freeze on its \nnuclear program; and\n  None of the assistance provided to North Korea by the U.S. has been \ndiverted to other than the intended purposes.\n  In addition, our amendment requires the President to provide a report \nto Congress on three important matters related to peace and stability \non the Korean Peninsula. These are: Cooperation of North Korea with \nefforts to return the remains of those missing in action since the \nKorean conflict; violations of the military armistice agreement; and \nthe Administration's plan for encouraging North-South dialogue.\n  The bill before the Senate provides $13 million to the Korean \nPeninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, which is the \norganization charged with implementing the nuclear framework agreement \nof 1994 between the U.S. and North Korea. My colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, is proposing an amendment to increase \nthat amount to $25-million. The amendment offered by Senator Murkowski \nand myself would ensure that this $25 million is not misused by the \nCommunist regime in North Korea.\n  I continue to have serious reservations about the Nuclear Framework \nAgreement with North Korea. Under this deal, the North Koreans get free \noil, the benefits of trade and diplomatic relations, two new nuclear \nreactors, and untold additional benefits, including tacit forgiveness \nof their blatant violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. \nMost of these benefits accrue before North Korea incurs any real damage \nto its existing nuclear program. In short, the most charitable \nappraisal I can give this agreement is that it represents a tendered \nbribe to North Korea in exchange for a limit on its nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  I continue to believe that the only part of the Framework Agreement \nthat serves our national security interest is ensuring that the spent \nnuclear fuel rods in the cooling pond at Yongbyon are safely stored and \nsafeguarded. We must ensure that North Korea cannot quickly and easily \nbegin reprocessing this fuel, and we must also ensure against further \ndegradation of their condition in the storage pond. The Department of \nEnergy has taken the lead in this effort, and estimates that all the \nspent fuel will be safely canned and stored in North Korea by March of \nnext year.\n  In support of this effort, the U.S. has already contributed about $25 \nmillion. Maintaining the nuclear fuel rods in safe storage will require \nabout $2.5 to $5 million per year until it is removed from North Korea. \nIn my view, these funds are well spent to take this dangerous material \nout of North Korean hands.\n  The U.S. has also contributed $5 million for heavy fuel oil for North \nKorea and another $22 million to the operations of KEDO. This bill, \nwith the Lieberman amendment, would give another $25 million to KEDO \nfor heavy fuel oil and administrative costs of implementing the \nagreement. These expenditures can be expected to continue at least at \nthe level of $20-30 million per year for the next seven to ten years, \nwhile the provisions of the agreement are carried out. That is a cost \nto the U.S. taxpayer of somewhere between $200 and $300 million.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to ensure that the U.S. taxpayer \nknows where his money is going. That is why Senator Murkowski and I are \nproposing an amendment to restrict the use of the $25 million provided \nin this bill. Our amendment would ensure that the taxpayers' dollars \nwill not be spent to prop up the failing economy and Communist regime \nin North Korea.\n  As I have often said, I believe the Framework Agreement will fail in \ntime. I believe North Korea will renege on this agreement, just as they \nreneged on their freely accepted obligations under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, and as they did 9 times during the 2 years of \nnegotiations leading up to this deal. North Korea is currently in \ncompliance with the framework agreement, and therefore, I do not \nbelieve the United States should kill the deal by failing to provide a \nminimal level of funding to implement its more positive aspects.\n  Mr. President, I will not oppose the Lieberman amendment to restore \nfunding for KEDO to the requested level. However, I believe the \nAmerican taxpayers should be assured that these millions will not be \nmisused by North Korea. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nMurkowski and me in ensuring these funds are expended only if certain \nreasonable conditions are met. I urge the adoption of the Murkowski-\nMcCain amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5028\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted against the Helms amendment \nbecause it would prohibit the United States government from making \ncertain payments to the United Nations if the United Nations ``borrows \nfunds from any international financial institution.'' It may be \nnecessary for the United Nations to borrow such funds to keep operating \nfor a wide variety of contingencies.\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\n  The amendment also prohibits the U.S. Government from making certain \npayments to the United Nations if the United Nations attempts to \n``impose any taxation or fee on any United States persons.'' I would \ncertainly support an amendment which only prohibited an attempt by the \nUnited Nations to impose a tax or fee on any United States persons \nbecause that would violate fundamental U.S. sovereignty.\n  Since this amendment goes beyond the tax or fee issue and prohibits \nborrowing, I opposed the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5059\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the managers of the \nbill, Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for accepting the Inouye-\nD'Amato amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate that the German \nGovernment expand the criteria by which Holocaust survivors may qualify \nfor compensation.\n  Time is of the essence. Most of the survivors are in their mid-to-\nlate seventies. Each day of delay causes the survivors of one of the \nmost gruesome atrocities mankind has ever witnessed to move a day \ncloser to never recovering the compensation, albeit symbolic, they \ncertainly deserve.\n  The German Government and the United States Conference on Jewish \nMaterial Claims Against Germany are about to engage in the yearly \nprocess of negotiating new categories by which survivors of the \nHolocaust are entitled to receive compensation.\n  I recognize that there is absolutely no amount of financial \nremuneration that can adequately compensate these survivors for the \nunimaginable suffering they experienced. However, in many cases, \npensions of approximately $300 to $500 a month will make a significant \ndifference in the lifestyle these survivors will experience in their \ngolden years.\n  I would like to take a moment to share with my colleagues the type of \nhardship my constituent Mr. Armin Nagel experienced while interned at \nthe Vapniarka camp in Romania.\n  Mr. Nagel was interned during World War II in Transnistria, in the \nVapniarka concentration camp and in the Grosulovo ghetto just inside \nthe Romanian border.\n  Vapniarka was a camp used primarily for Jews. In mid-September of \n1942 over 1,000 Jews, of which about 400 were from the Tirgu Jiu camp, \nwere transferred to Vapniarka by train through Tiraspol. They joined \nthe 630 Jews from Bessarabia and Bucovina and about 50 to 60 Ukrainian \ninmates already interned there. In mid-October of 1943, 700 Jewish \nsurvivors were transferred from Vapniarka to the Grosulovo Ghetto and \nthe Vapniarka camp was closed. While in Vapniarka, the inmates were \nseverely beaten by their guards and by fellow Ukrainian inmates.\n  Based on survivors' testimonies, Raul Hilberg, in his book ``The \nDestruction of the European Jews,'' describes the food that the inmates \nreceived as follows:\n\n       Vapniarka was the site of a unique Romanian nutritional \n     policy. The inmates were regularly fed 400 grams of a kind of \n     chick pea (tathyrus savitus) which Soviet agriculturists had \n     been giving to hogs, cooked in water and salt and mixed with \n     200 grams of barley to which was added a 20-percent filler of \n     straw. No other diet was allowed. The result of this diet \n     manifested itself in muscular cramps, uncertain gait, \n     arterial spasms in the legs, paralysis and incapacitation.\n\n  This is just one example of the type of terrible treatment the \nprisoners experienced at Vapniarka.\n  Mr. Nagel has been denied a pension by the German authorities because \nVapniarka has been categorized as a labor camp. Today, Mr. Nagel is 76 \nyears old and survives on a moderate income supplemented by Social \nSecurity. This enables him to meet his basic necessities of food, \nshelter and clothing. A pension of $300 to $500 a month will make the \ndifference between making ends meet and being able to live a decent \nlifestyle during his golden years.\n  Through this resolution the Senate encourages the German Government \nto negotiate expediently and in good faith with the United States \nConference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.\n\n\n             clarification of the ban on aid to azerbaijan\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, in 1992, war in the Caucasus led Congress \nto approve a ban on direct U.S. aid to the Government of Azerbaijan \nunder what is known as ``section 907.'' Although section 907 was not \nintended to deny humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged population of \nAzerbaijan, it has done just that.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the effort today to clarify section \n907, making humanitarian aid to nearly 1 million in Azerbaijan easier \nto deliver.\n  This effort represents a true humanitarian action, while at the same \ntime aiding the stabilization of the Caucasus, one of the hotspots of \nthe former Soviet Union.\n  Section 907 currently prevent non-governmental organizations [NGOs] \nreceiving U.S. funding from dealing with the Government of Azerbaijan \nin carrying out humanitarian missions in the country.\n  In formerly Soviet Azerbaijan, the Government controls a large \nportion of the economy, so this restriction makes it very difficult for \naid organizations to efficiently deliver much-needed help to the \n900,000 refugees from the war with Armenia.\n  Some examples of the problems section 907 has created for the \nInternational Rescue Committee [IRC], Rescue International [RI] and \nCARE, independent relief agencies, are as follows:\n  International Rescue Committee [IRC] initially stored medical \nsupplies in Azerbaijan under tarps on the street, because section 907 \nprecluded renting Azerbaijan Government-owned warehouse space. When the \nGovernment allowed IRC to use the space rent free, IRC still had to \nstore the supplies under tarps inside the warehouse because IRC was not \npermitted to pay to repair a leaking roof, since that would have been \ncontact with the Government of Azerbaijan.\n  Relief International [RI] was unable to cooperate with a 1994 UNICEF \nchild immunization program in Azerbaijan, despite major need for such a \nprogram, because UNICEF was working with Azerbaijan's Ministry of \nHealth on the project.\n  This year, CARE withdrew a proposal to USAID to rehabilitate \nbuildings and railroad cars as shelters for displaced Azerbaijanis, \nbecause the structures were government owned.\n  RI has been unable to do equal-value exchanges of pharmaceuticals \nwith other non-American, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] in \nAzerbaijan, a common practice in areas with scarce medical resources, \nbecause these other NGO's cooperate with the government.\n  Two thousand IRC-built latrines to prevent water-borne diseases among \nthe refugee population cost twice what they should have, because a \nmiddleman had to be retained for purchasing supplies so as not to \nconduct business with the Government.\n  The extreme gravity of the humanitarian situation in the country was \nbest illustrated in a recent cable to the State Department from the \ncurrent United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Richard Kauzlarich. In \nthe cable, the ambassador cited the horrifying preliminary results of a \nmedical survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, UNICEF and \nthe World Health Organization in Azerbaijan earlier this year:\n\n  Seventy percent of displaced children in Azerbaijan between the ages \nof 12 and 23 months suffer from anemia. This can cause irreversible \nproblems in their mental development. Anemia is also widespread in the \nadult population.\n  Thirty percent of displaced children in Azerbaijan between the ages \nof 6 and 11 months suffer stunted growth caused by malnutrition; 11 \npercent of the elderly also suffer malnutrition.\n  Twenty-four percent of Azerbaijani displaced children suffer from \ndiarrhea.\n  Seventeen percent of the displaced population suffer from iodine \ndeficiency disorders (goiter).\n  The message in the ambassador's cable is clear--The United States \nmust act now to clarify section 907 and try to stem the growing \nhumanitarian crisis in Azerbaijan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ambassador's cable and a \n1994 report by USAID on the effects of the section 907 ban on \nAzerbaijan be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COHEN. Finally, Mr. President, action to clarify section 907 is \nin the U.S. national security interest. On a\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nstrategic level, section 907 may force Azerbaijan back under the \nRussian yoke. A number of other ex-Soviet republics have been coerced \ninto compromised relationships with Moscow, because they have been \nunable to build strong national institutions.\n  Azerbaijan has so far resisted Russian and Iranian pressure and is \nstriving to maintain its sovereignty by developing its large oil \nreserves.\n  The suffering and privation aggravated by section 907, however, make \nthe Azerbaijan's quest for sovereignty more difficult.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Azeri-Armenian conflict evokes deep \npassion in many of my colleagues, but the easing of the suffering of \ndisplaced civilians, children and refugees is not a political \nstatement, it is a moral imperative.\n  The war in the Caucasus is now winding to a close on terms favorable \nto Armenia and the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. While a \npeace treaty has not yet been signed, both sides in the war have shown \na desire to negotiate and turn their embattled countries to the task of \nrebuilding and recovery. Clarifying section 907 is essential to speed \nthat process.\n  Mr. President, this issue presents us with a simple question: Does \nthe United States want to act now to speed the process of recovery, \nrebuilding, and democratization, or do we want to stand by and allow \nwant and isolation to doom Azerbaijan and the Caucasus as a whole to a \nfuture of instability, authoritarianism, conflict and subjugation to \nreactionaries in Moscow?\n  I commend Senator Byrd for his initiative in seeking to clarify the \nsection 907 ban.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Subject: A Generation Lost: Alarming News About The Health of IDP \n                                Children\n\n       First, summary: The 900,000 refugees and internally \n     displaced persons [IDPS] remain the world's forgotten \n     tradegy. The tragedy must end now. According to the \n     preliminary results of a CDC/UN health survey on the IDPS--\n     they have health problems that are significantly worse than \n     CDC anticipated. That the IDPS suffer from poor nutrition, \n     lack of access to health care and chronic diarrhea among \n     children was predictable. However, much more shocking were \n     the CDC's findings of stunted growth in children, a high \n     incidence of goiter and widespread anemia. Some of this could \n     result in mental retardation for the worst affected children \n     in the camps. This is not 1992. The authors of FSA 907 did \n     not intend that the U.S. Government not respond to such \n     suffering of little kids. On humanitarian grounds, the United \n     States must act--even if it means some contact with the \n     government public health service--to meet this long-ignored \n     crisis. End summary.\n       Second, Ibrahim Parvanta of the Centers for Disease Control \n     [CDC] met with the Ambassador on April 19 to discuss the \n     preliminary results of CDC's aid-funded medical survey of \n     IDPS in Azerbaijan. From March 27 through April 19, the World \n     Health Organization [WHO], the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention [CDC] and UNICEF, in collaboration with Relief \n     International [RI] and Medicines Sans Frontieres/Holland \n     [MSF/H] conducted a nation-wide health and nutrition survey \n     in Azerbaijan. The survey covered 55 districts with an \n     estimated population of 620,000 IDPS and the non-IDP \n     population of the country for comparison purposes. Because of \n     section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, CDC's part of the \n     survey could only focus on the IDP population, using PVO \n     support. WHO/UNICEF focused on the general population with \n     government of Azerbiajan support. Parvanta highlighted the \n     following preliminary findings of the survey.\n\n\n                            food insecurity\n\n       Forty-nine percent of all IDP families and 29 percent of \n     resident families surveyed, skipped meals during the week \n     before the survey.\n       Members of 46 percent of IDP households and of 31 percent \n     of resident households had not eaten meat during the \n     preceding 2 weeks.\n\n\n                       stunted growth in children\n\n       Children in Azerbaijan suffer fromn chronic health and \n     nutrition problems that lead to stunted growth. The long term \n     functional implications on physical work capacity, \n     intellectual development and overall health may be \n     significant. Recurrent clinical and sub-clinical infections, \n     as well as nutritional deficiencies (particularly \n     micronutrients) may be responsible for this condition. \n     Parvanta stressed that stunted growth was higher among IDP \n     children aged 6-11 months (30.7%) than the same age group in \n     resident population (21.3%).\n\n\n                       health care: out of reach\n\n       Poor access to health care is currently a serious problem, \n     particularly for IDPS in Azerbaijan. Most often, ill people \n     who want treatment cannot afford it. (Despite a public health \n     system which supposedly provides free medical care, Azeris \n     must pay to obtain medical treatment.) Thirty-seven percent \n     of people surveyed said that they did not seek medical \n     treatment the last time someone in their family was sick. The \n     main reason, specified in 68 percent of cases, was an \n     inability to pay.\n       Twenty-four percent of IDP children and 16 percent of the \n     resident children (ages 0 to 59 months) were reported to \n     suffer from diarrhea.\n       Seventeen percent of the surveyed population were \n     discovered to have iodine deficiency disorders (goiter). The \n     prevalence of goiter varies considerably by region.\n       Seventy percent of IDP children 12 to 23 months old were \n     reported to suffer from anemia. Parvanta said that this \n     figure is far higher than they expected to find here. If iron \n     deficiency is the main cause of anemia in Azerbaijan, then \n     many children risk significant and potentially irreversible \n     consequences to their mental development. Anemia is also a \n     wide-spread problem for adults.\n       Third, Parvanta cautioned that CDC would have to further \n     analyze the data before reaching final conclusions. The \n     Ambassador asked whether the survey work had uncovered \n     evidence of the WHO-reported malaria among IDPS. He said that \n     they had not although this was yet not mosquito season. \n     Noting that he has previously worked in Armenia, Parvanta \n     added that living conditions are considerably worse for the \n     IDPS in Azerbaijan than refugees in Armenia.\n\n\n                                COMMENT\n\n       Fourth, we commend CDC for this evaluation of the state of \n     health and nutrition of IDPs in Azerbaijan. The CDC's \n     unexpected findings that young IDP children suffer from \n     stunted growth, anemia and goiter are alarming. As previously \n     reported, there are reports from WHO and others that malaria \n     is a growing problem in southern Azerbaijan at the southern \n     camps near Sabirabad and Imishli where 46,000 IDPs live in \n     wretched conditions. We believe that the IDPs--especially \n     children--are more susceptible to malaria due to their high \n     levels of anemia and general poor health.\n       Fifth, we will not prejudge CDC's final conclusions. \n     Nonetheless, we believe that malnutrition and miserable \n     living conditions in camps, rail cars and decrepit public \n     buildings have severely damaged an entire generation of IDP \n     children. We need to rethink the possibility of targeting \n     medical assistance to these IDP children. It will involve \n     some contact with the government but the assistance would be \n     provided through PVOs. The humanitarian need is there. The \n     administration should go to the Congress and describe the \n     suffering of Azerbaijan's IDPs and the importance of the \n     United States doing something about this on humanitarian \n     grounds. The authors of FSA 907 did not intend to prevent \n     refugee children from receiving medical care and food \n     supplements necessary to lead normal lives. There is a crying \n     need for more help from western donors--including the United \n     States--to provide basic health care for Azerbaijan's IDPs, \n     the neediest people in the region.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  The Impact of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act on Delivery of \n        Humanitarian Assistance to Azerbaijan--October 21, 1994\n\n\n                           PURPOSE OF REPORT\n\n       The purpose of this report is to respond to language of the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee report on the Fiscal Year \n     1995 foreign operations appropriations bill (Report No. 103-\n     287, page 77) stating that:\n       ``Within 60 days of enactment of this bill into law, the \n     President shall report to the Congress of [sic] the impact of \n     section 907 of the Freedom Support Act (Public Law, 102-511) \n     on efforts by private voluntary organizations to provide \n     humanitarian, refugee, and disaster assistance.''\n       This report provides background on humanitarian relief \n     needs in Azerbaijan, a description of United States \n     Government-funded PVO humanitarian assistance operations in \n     Azerbaijan, and an assessment of the impact of Section 907 on \n     these activities.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       As a result of the conflict over the status of the Nagorno-\n     Karabakh region, Azerbaijan has one of the world's worst \n     refugee/internally displaced person (IDP) situations. The \n     current estimated numbers in these two categories are:\n\nRefugees (mostly from Armenia)..................................250,000\nInternally Displaced Persons (IDP)..............................658,000\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n    Total.......................................................908,000\n       Of the IDPs, 10% are currently living in organized camps, \n     and the rest are either living with host families, in public \n     buildings, government-provided shelters (sanatoria), hostels, \n     unused railway wagons, or crude earth pits.\n       Some key facts regarding the condition of Azerbaijan's IDPs \n     and refugees: hepatitis cases increased by 144% since January \n     1993; water-borne diseases among children are up 18% and \n     salmonellosis is up 70% in the first eight months of 1994 \n     compared to all of 1993; the leading cause of infant \n     mortality and main reason for hospitalization is acute \n     respiratory infections; drugs previously supplied by the \n     former Soviet central system have decreased from 75% of \n     the country's needs to 5%.\n       A substantial portion of Azerbaijan's territory, including \n     most of the best agricultural land, is occupied by Nagorno-\n     Karabakh Armenian forces, and there has been substantial \n     damage to the infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\n       Budgetary insolvency has severely strained the ability of \n     the social welfare system to continue to support over one \n     million beneficiaries. Some 200 schools country-wide are \n     occupied by refugees and IDPs (58,500 children are unable to \n     attend school on a regular basis).\n       Of the total IDP/refugee population, those most in need--\n     i.e. those who have few or no alternative sources of income--\n     are estimated to number 430,000. Some of the families hosting \n     the displaced, pensioners, orphans, handicapped and disabled \n     people bring the total vulnerable population in need of \n     assistance to 450,000.\n\n\n       united states government-funded pvo programs in azerbaijan\n\n       USG-funded humanitarian assistance programs in Azerbaijan \n     are being implemented by several US PVOs. USAID-funded PVO \n     activities are managed by Save the Children Federation (SCF) \n     under an umbrella grant. SCF-managed programs are principally \n     in the areas of food, health care, and shelter for refugees \n     and IDPs. USDA is implementing several food assistance \n     programs for refugees and IDPs through US PVOs under the Food \n     for Progress program. USAID provides funds and food \n     commodities for international organizations delivering relief \n     in Azerbaijan. These resources are delivered to beneficiaries \n     through PVOs.\n\n\n                         impact of section 907\n\n       The principal impact of Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support \n     Act on delivery of humanitarian assistance by private \n     voluntary organizations (PVOs) to those in need in Azerbaijan \n     has been to complicate or preclude activities involving \n     unavoidable contact or interaction with government-controlled \n     enterprises, institutions, and facilities. In many cases \n     where relief activities can be conducted in compliance \n     with Section 907, the restrictions of that legislation \n     have increased costs of operations and thereby reduced the \n     scope and impact of the activities.\n       As the state domination of the entire economy inherited \n     from the Soviet era has barely changed in Azerbaijan, Section \n     907 has had a substantial impact on delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance. Following are examples of the impact of Section \n     907 to date.\n\n\n                            medical services\n\n       Section 907 has blocked or complicated delivery of medical \n     assistance to those in need by USG-funded PVOs. As \n     Azerbaijan's public health system is entirely state-\n     controlled, it is very difficult to implement some medical \n     assistance projects without providing assistance through \n     government instrumentalities.\n       To ensure that it was not violating Section 907, one PVO \n     developed a limited, parallel health care program for the \n     displaced alongside the government program, which is wasteful \n     and contrary to good public health practice. This same PVO \n     has also refrained from utilizing locally available medical \n     personnel in its programs because they are all government \n     employees, an obstacle that has severely limited the PVO's \n     ability to reach those in need. Finally, many public health \n     activities such as child immunization are by their very \n     nature best conducted via the state health system, but \n     because of Section 907 PVOs have felt they are unable to \n     assist in these basic preventative programs.\n\n\n              use of state-owned infrastructure/facilities\n\n       As virtually all facilities and transportation equipment in \n     Azerbaijan are state-owned, compliance with Section 907 has \n     made use of basic infrastructure (warehouses, truck fleets, \n     and other transportation and storage equipment) difficult.\n       One USG-funded PVO operating in Azerbaijan has, in an \n     attempt to reduce contact with the state sector, invested \n     great time and effort in trying to secure privately-owned \n     warehouse space for storage of relief commodities. In the end \n     there was no alternative to the state-owned facility. Once \n     use of the state-owned facility was chosen, the issue of rent \n     payment continued to complicate relations with the facility \n     management, as the PVO believed Section 907 precluded \n     compensation of any state-owned facilities for services.\n       Another issue has arisen in connection with one of the \n     warehouses being used by this PVO--repairs to state-owned \n     facilities. One of the warehouses in question has developed a \n     leaky roof. Believing that Section 907 precluded use of PVO \n     funds to make essential warehouse repairs to protect relief \n     commodities in the warehouse, the PVO has covered the \n     supplies with tarpaulins but fears that some damage to the \n     commodities will result when seasonal rains arrive. In this \n     case, the PVO's efforts to comply strictly with Section 907 \n     resulted in wasted time, energy, and probably damaged relief \n     commodities.\n\n\n           Relief-related rehabilitation of public buildings\n\n       The rehabilitation of public buildings being used as \n     shelter by displaced persons in Azerbaijan was a priority \n     need identified by one implementing USG-funded PVO. However, \n     as the PVO believed that Section 907 precluded repairs (in \n     this case winterization and sanitation upgrades) to state-\n     owned buildings, the project was not implemented. As a large \n     number of displaced persons and refugees are necessarily \n     accommodated in public buildings not designed as residential \n     structures, this aspect of Section 907 has had a major impact \n     on delivery of assistance to those in need in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n                Local procurement of goods and services\n\n       In some cases PVOs have interpreted Section 907 in a manner \n     that precluded local procurement of essential goods and \n     services, or made such procurement more difficult and more \n     costly. For example, one POV project involved improving \n     access to safe water supplies by drilling wells. However, the \n     only available company that could preform the work was state-\n     owned, so the project was not implemented.\n       Because of the way they have interpreted Section 907, USG-\n     funded PVOs trying to procure goods locally have made \n     prolonged efforts to find privately owned vendors or \n     suppliers. In many cases the privately owned suppliers are \n     merely intermediaries who pass on state-produced goods at a \n     higher price. In addition, exclusion of state-owned sources \n     has made competitive bidding impractical, and probably \n     resulted in higher costs.\n\n\n                      aid to turkey and azerbaijan\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to engage the subcommittee \nleadership in a colloquy regarding our policy toward Turkey and the \nCaucasus in this bill. The importance of this strategic region for U.S. \npolicy can hardly be overstated, and the bill as passed by the House \nhas a number of very troublesome provisions.\n  Senator McConnell, as I understand it, the House bill as it passed \nhas several provisions that have the probability of damaging our \nrelations with Turkey, our ally, and Azerbaijan, our friend to the east \nof Turkey in the Caucasus. The Turkey provision would link our aid to \nforced admissions by the Turkish government on historic events, \nadmissions that are strongly repugnant to and rejected by Turkey. This \nis really a bilateral matter between Turkey and Armenia which should be \nworked out between those two states. As a result of that House \nprovision, the ambassador from Turkey has asked us to retract our \nprovision of economic aid. That is a sorry state of affairs. They would \nrather not have the aid if it is tied up in conditions that are onerous \nto the Turkish government and people. I do not blame the Turkish \ngovernment for its reaction to this provision. I understand that the \nCommittee has struck that House provision and I congratulate Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy for that. That is the responsible thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. On the matter of Azerbaijan, I understand that the House \nincluded a provision which would imply separate legal status to \nNagorno-Karabagh, a region of Azerbaijan. The international community, \nthrough the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has \nalready recognized the current borders of Azerbaijan as constituting \nits territorial integrity. Thus, a separate legal status for Nagorno-\nKarabagh is opposed by the international community and is against the \npolicy of the United States. I understand, again, that the subcommittee \nstruck the provision.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Further, humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan has been \ninterrupted because of a policy adopted in 1992 to cut off U.S. aid to \nthat nation as a result of its conflict with Armenia. In 1992, a war \nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan led Congress to ban direct U.S. aid to \nAzerbaijan. This was included as Section 907 of the 1992 law called the \nFreedom Support Act, which was intended to provide economic and other \naid to former Soviet republics to assist their transition to free and \nindependent states with solid ties to the West and open markets for \nAmerican business. As currently interpreted, Section 907 prevents U.S.-\nfunded non-governmental organizations from dealing with Azerbaijan's \ngovernment in carrying out humanitarian missions. In formerly-Soviet \nAzerbaijan, the government still controls a large portion of the \neconomy, making it difficult, under Section 907, for aid organizations \nto deliver much-needed help to Azerbaijan's population, nearly a \nmillion of whom are displaced persons and refugees.\n  The findings of a recently released report on the refugee health \ncrisis in Azerbaijan, by the U.S. Center for Disease Control, UNICEF \nand the World Health Organization cites serious difficulties in \ndelivering vital medical supplies and other aid because Section 907's \nban on direct U.S. aid has been broadly interpreted and used to \nrestrict the delivery of such aid. This was never the intent of Section \n907. Am I correct in this statement?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is entirely correct, the section was never \nintended to restrict the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The House has included a provision which would set up an \nartificial ratio of humanitarian aid relative to Azerbaijan and its \nregion of Nagorno-Karabagh. Such ratios have no precedent in the \ndelivery of humanitarian aid and are clearly unworkable. I understand \nthe subcommittee has struck that provision.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is, again, correct. Such an artificial mechanism \nin directing humanitarian aid has never been used and I do not know how \nit could be administered.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is in our interest to ensure that humanitarian aid get \nthrough to all needy people who are suffering as a result of the war. \nThe chairman, in the action of the full committee, included language \nsuggested by the ranking member and myself which clarified our intent \nthat humanitarian aid be effectively delivered using the facilities of \nthe government of Azerbaijan. If the facilities of that government are \nnot used, much of the aid would not be able to be delivered, as I \nunderstand it. Further, I have a letter from the Department of State \nindicating the Administration agrees entirely with this policy and \nstating the intent of the Administration to revise its State Department \nguidelines in regard to that region in order to ensure there is no \nfurther ambiguity as to the delivery of food, medicines and the like \ninto Azerbaijan with the assistance of government personnel and \nfacilities there such as warehouses, clinics and other logistical \nsupport.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes I understand the guidelines will be issued \npromptly after the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is still some concern on the part of the \norganizations that deliver the aid that a statutory provision \nrecognizing this policy might be needed to ensure the aid can in fact \nbe delivered as we intend. I have prepared such an amendment and it is \nco-sponsored by Senators Leahy, Reid, Johnston, Jeffords, Inouye, \nCohen, Lugar, and Murkowski. The language would directly reflect the \nreport language already agreed to. However, I am willing to withhold \nthat amendment if the chairman can assure me that he will defend the \nSenate position in conference and continue to resist the onerous House \nprovisions I have referred to regarding Turkey and Azerbaijan. Lastly, \nI would ask that the language regarding the delivery of humanitarian \naid that we included in the Senate committee report be included in the \nStatement of Managers of the Conference Report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the Senator's position. I fully intend to \nresist the House provisions he referred to and we are in complete \nagreement on what should be the nature of sound U.S. policy toward this \nregion. I will support the Senate position in conference, and I am sure \nthat I will have the support of the ranking member and all of our \nconferees on this matter. I thank the Senator for his interest in this \nimportant matter and in the fate of that region and U.S. interests \nthere, which are vital.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe letter which I referred to dated July 11, 1996 to me from Ms. \nBarbara Larkin, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative \nAffairs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This letter is in response to your \n     request for our views on language on assistance to Azerbaijan \n     included in the report accompanying the FY 97 Senate Foreign \n     Operations bill. You are aware of our long-standing position \n     regarding aid to Azerbaijan.\n       As written, this language, as well as similar report \n     language accompanying the House bill, is useful in clarifying \n     congressional intent on interpretation of Section 907 of the \n     FREEDOM Support Act insofar as the delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance is concerned, and is consistent with our views in \n     this regard. We understand this language to express the \n     congressional view that Section 907 should not be interpreted \n     to preclude nongovernmental and international organizations \n     from using and repairing Government of Azerbaijan facilities \n     or services to deliver humanitarian assistance to needy \n     civilians, and that humanitarian supplies may be transferred \n     to Government personnel for the purpose of distribution. \n     Further, we understand that the Committee intends that needy \n     civilians be permitted to receive assistance in growing their \n     own food for sustenance, and are not precluded from selling \n     the excess in the private sector. We understand that the \n     Committee expects, as do we, private voluntary and \n     international organizations to maintain effective monitoring \n     procedures to assure appropriate supervision over supplies \n     and recipients.\n       Consistent with current law and the FY 97 Appropriations \n     process, we intend to revise the State Department and USAID \n     guidelines regarding the provision of assistance to \n     Azerbaijan to reflect this mutual understanding of Section \n     907's scope.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n                           aid to azerbaijan\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nSenator Byrd's comments regarding aid to Azerbaijan in his colloquy \nwith Senator McConnell. I understand that Senator Byrd had intended to \noffer an amendment, which I cosponsored, to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill on this issue.\n  Mr. President, Azerbaijan is the only one of the fifteen former \nSoviet Republics to be denied assistance in the Freedom Support Act. \nHumanitarian aid to Azerbaijan has been denied as a result of its \nconflict with Armenia. Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, as \ncurrently interpreted, prevents U.S.-funded nongovernmental \norganizations from dealing with Azerbaijan's government in carrying out \nhumanitarian missions. Section 907 states, ``U.S. Assistance * * * may \nnot be provided to the Government of Azerbaijan until the President \ndetermines, and so reports to Congress, that the Government of \nAzerbaijan is taking demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and \nother offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.''\n  The need for humanitarian aid in Azerbaijan is great, and Section 907 \nmakes it difficult for aid organizations to deliver the much-needed \nassistance to the people of Azerbaijan, nearly a million of whom are \ndisplaced persons and refugees. The U.S. Center for Disease Control, \nUNICEF and the World Health Organization have all cited serious \ndifficulties in delivering vital medical supplies and other aid to \nAzerbaijan because of Section 907's ban on direct U.S. aid. However, \nthis was never the real intent of Section 907. Report language which \nclarified the intent that humanitarian aid be delivered using the \nfacilities of the government of Azerbaijan has been added to this bill. \nI understand that Senator Byrd agreed to withhold his amendment, which \nI co-sponsored, with the understanding that the chairman will defend \nthe Senate position in conference and continue to resist the House \nprovisions.\n  It is important to recognize the economic and strategic potential of \nAzerbaijan. The country, known as ``the Kuwait of the Caspian'' has \nproven oil reserves of three billion barrels. Experts has put the \nultimate potential of the country as high as forty billion barrels of \noil. Gas reserves of the country are 184 billion cubic meters on the \ndiscovered fields. In 1994, a consortium of Western oil companies \nsigned an eight billion dollar production sharing agreement with the \ngovernment of Azerbaijan. They have a thirty year contract to work on \nthe Guneshli-Chirag-Azeri offshore fields. U.S. companies have a good \nopportunity now to establish a commercial relationships with \nAzerbaijan.\n  The strategic potential of Azerbaijan is also very important, and \nshould be brought to the attention of policymakers. Russia, the United \nStates, the European Union, Turkey and Iran all have a great interest \nin the geo-political and economic state of affairs in Caspian Sea Rim \nRegion. Whether the pipeline from Baku to Novorossiisk will be able to \nbe used, presents a stability question, since it passes through war-\ntorn Chechnya. In addition, while U.S. oil company's have forty percent \nof the shares in one project and growing financial participation in \nother projects in the Caspian Rim, they have accepted Russia's leading \nrole. Finally, Azerbaijan how has a secular muslim government, however, \nthere is a Islamic fundamentalist influence that Azerbaijan has so far \nresisted, that is cause for concern. But Azerbaijan will not be able to \ndevelop, and reach its full potential if it is not able to receive the \nhumanitarian assistance that it now needs from U.S. nongovernmental \nhumanitarian organizations.\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\n                           amendment no. 5047\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Dominici offered an amendment this \nevening to condition International Military Education and Training \n[IMET] assistance to Mexico on Mexican authorities apprehending and \nbeginning prosecution of, or extraditing to the United States, drug \ntraffickers.\n  I fully agree with the sentiment of the amendment. Stemming the flow \nof drugs into the United States is absolutely vital to the quality of \nlife and future of our Nation. I believe that we should encourage \nMexican authorities to do everything in their power to take action \nagainst drug traffickers. However, I also believe that denying them \nIMET assistance is not the proper way of going about it.\n  There are certainly other more beneficial ways to improve the level \nof cooperation between our two nations. We should not be in the \nbusiness of threatening and coercing our friends.\n  The continuation of IMET assistance is important in its own right, \nunconnected to the level of cooperation we receive on the issue of drug \ntrafficking. Exposing foreign militaries to U.S. military procedure and \nethics promotes our values. It helps create among these militaries a \nrespect for the democratic rule of law and civilian leadership. Over \ntime, this assistance will foster a far more productive United States-\nMexico relationship in the areas addressed by the amendment than will \nthreatening sanctions\n\n\n                                 Turkey\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I had intended today to offer a series \nof amendments regarding economic assistance to Turkey. These amendments \nwould have been similar to the provisions included in the version of \nH.R. 3540 that was approved by the House of Representatives on May 22. \nSpecifically, these provisions would cap economic support funds [ESF] \nat $25 million, and would lower that amount to $22 million if the \nGovernment of Turkey failed to acknowledge the tragic Armenian genocide \nthat occurred from 1915 to 1923. The House also approved a provision \nthat would restrict the President's authority to waive aid restrictions \nagainst those countries found violating the Humanitarian Aid Corridor \nAct.\n  I support all these provisions. I know a number of my colleagues in \nthe Senate support them as well. However, the bill before us on the \nfloor does not contain any restrictions on economic aid to Turkey. I \nwould note that the bill would make the Humanitarian Corridor Act \npermanent, and I commend the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for doing so.\n  As my colleagues well know, what we have before us today is a replay \nof last year's appropriations process. Last year, the House capped \neconomic aid to Turkey at $21 million, and the Senate bill did not \nrestrict economic assistance. The final bill capped economic aid to \nTurkey at $33.5 million. I believe that was a fair compromise.\n  Mr. President, the reasons why Congress felt compelled to cap aid to \none of our allies are several. I will not go into detail on these \nreasons because the record, most recently updated in the rigorous House \ndebate on these issues, is quite substantive. There are four key \nconcerns: Repeated human rights violations, its refusal to comply with \nthe Humanitarian Corridor Act and allow aid shipments to Armenia, its \ncontinued military occupation of Cyprus, and its abuse of the Kurdish \nminority. On the last point, I am concerned particularly with the use \nof American military equipment against the Kurds.\n  It's common practice for Congress to use foreign aid as leverage to \nachieve foreign policy and human rights goals. I have long advocated \ntougher restrictions on aid to Turkey to achieve a peaceful, free and \nunited Cyprus. I have called on the President to suspend military sales \nto Turkey until it improves its human rights record. And I was a \ncosponsor of the Humanitarian Corridor Act.\n  I believe we sent a very strong signal to Turkey last year when we \nagreed to cap economic assistance and passed the Humanitarian Corridor \nAct. To retreat from that strong stand would send the wrong signal and \nremove a vital piece of leverage we need to make progress on the key \nissues I have raised.\n  As I said, I had intended to offer amendments to restrict economic \nassistance to Turkey. However, I believe that, if past is prologue, the \nbest course of action to pursue is to work with the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, and their counterparts in the House.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee on the floor. I would just urge that he take my concerns, \nthe concerns of my colleagues and clearly, the concerns of the strong \nmajority of our counterparts in the House into consideration as he \nmoves to conference on this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from South Dakota. I appreciate his \nwillingness to work with me to achieve an appropriate solution to the \ncontroversies surrounding economic assistance to Turkey. This is a very \ncontroversial issue. I know he has been an outspoken advocate of a \nfree, united Cyprus for many years now. He can be assured that I will \ntake his views into consideration as we go to conference on this bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n\n\n                      Development Fund For Africa\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the foreign \noperations appropriations bill for fiscal 1997, I would like to share \nwith my colleagues once again my thoughts on the importance of our \nforeign assistance program in Africa.\n  I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Simon-Kassebaum \namendment which restores the designation of the Development Fund for \nAfrica.\n  Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat of the Africa Subcommittee, I \nhave become increasingly aware of how the 48 countries of sub-Saharan \nAfrica represent important security concerns for the United States. As \nwe head toward the 21st century--an era that will no doubt be marked by \ntransnational concerns--Africa is becoming even more relevant to United \nStates interests, our economic, political, humanitarian, and security \nconcerns.\n  Long-term development assistance to African nations--whether through \nbi-lateral or multilateral channels--directly complements U.S. foreign \npolicy goals and national security interests.\n  There are several examples of this complementarity.\n  First, we have an interest in a safe and healthy environment. The \nrapid spread of the Ebola virus demonstrated some of the \nvulnerabilities on the continent. Now, unfortunately, the rates of HIV \nand AIDS infections in Africa are the highest in the world, and they \nare continuing to rise rapidly. As we have seen, viruses do not need \nvisas.\n  Second, we have an interest in expanding trade and investment ties \nwith the African continent. U.S. exports to Africa expanded by 22.7 \npercent in 1995--this is nearly twice the growth rate of total U.S. \nexports worldwide. Already U.S. exports to Africa equal 54 percent more \nthan our exports to the former Soviet Union. We export more to South \nAfrica alone than to all of Eastern Europe combined.\n  Third, we have an interest in democracy. Well over half of African \nnations now can be considered democratic or have made substantial \nprogress toward democracy. Many of these nations also are moving toward \nfree-market economies.\n  Fourth, we have an interest in human resource development. Sub-\nSaharan Africa has the fastest growing and poorest population in the \nworld. A substantial percentage of Africa's population is under 18 \nyears of age. These children will soon grow to adulthood and I would \nhope there will be opportunities for them to engage in productive \nactivities.\n  At the same time, Africa's infant and child mortality rates are 2 to \n3 times higher than those in Latin America or Asia.\n  Finally, we have an interest in security. It is unfortunate, but \nAfrica also is home to terrorist activity and to drug and arms \ntrafficking.\n  Mr. President, a stable African continent serves American interests.\n  The Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was established nearly 10 years \nago specifically to ensure a steady source of long-term development \nfunds for Africa.\n  In the past 8 years, the DFA has contributed to substantial gains in \nhealth\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\ncare, education, small business development, democracy, and stability.\n  The DFA is about investing in development and not in crises. The \ntypes of challenges we face in Africa today are very complex and \nrequire long-term solutions. And this requires long-term investment.\n  By restoring the DFA account, we give the administration the \nopportunity to capitalize on that investment.\n  I will make a budgetary argument as well. My colleagues know that \nsince my election to the Senate, I have been a consistent deficit hawk. \nSo, I always look for areas where we can cut wasteful Government \nspending.\n  Mr. President, the Development Fund for Africa is not one of these \nareas. On the contrary, it is one of the most effective programs in our \nforeign assistance package. In fact, the Agency for International \nDevelopment has based many of its reform initiatives on lessons learned \nthrough DFA programs.\n  As a result of DFA assistance, African farmers are growing more food, \nmore children are attending primary school, and more informal sector \nentrepreneurs have access to credit than was possible 10 years ago.\n  And the United States has played a key role in helping several \nAfrican countries experience dramatic drops in fertility through \neffective family planning and health care programs.\n  In sum, Mr. President, restoring DFA through the Simon-Kassebaum \namendment represents a sound investment in our relationship with the \ncontinent of Africa. It does not call for any new money. It does not \ntake funds away from any other region. But it does signal our continued \ninterest in remaining engaged with Africa.\n  I would also note that passage of this amendment would be a fitting \ntribute for the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Illinois. \nThese two Senators, who long ago recognized the importance of remaining \nengaged with Africa, were instrumental in getting the DFA established \nin the first place. And both have demonstrated leadership on this issue \nthroughout the years.\n  In honor of their hard work on this and other issues of concern to \nAfrica, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment.\n\n\n                      Military Sales to Indonesia\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, I would like to once again raise the \nissue of the human rights situation in Indonesia.\n  As my colleagues may remember, in 1994, the Senate adopted an \namendment which I cosponsored with Senator Leahy to the fiscal year \n1995 foreign operations legislation. A similar amendment was adopted by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee in the 1995 authorization bill. These \nprovisions restricted the sale of light arms to Indonesia in light of \nconcerns related to East Timor.\n  Last year, however, the State Department sent a letter to Senator \nLeahy and myself outlining the Administration's policy toward arms \ntransfers to Indonesia. The letter said--and I quote--``our current \narms sales policy . . . prohibits the sale or licensing for export of \nsmall or light arms and crowd control items until the Secretary has \ndetermined that there has been significant progress on human rights in \nIndonesia, including in East Timor.'' In light of the Administration's \nwillingness to continue voluntarily this prohibition on the sale of \nsuch items, we withheld offering statutory language on last year's \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, we are now debating our foreign assistance program for \na new fiscal year, and the situation in the East Timor continues to \nworsen. As every member of this body knows, Indonesia has sustained a \nbrutal military occupation of East Timor since 1975. Every human rights \norganization in the world has criticized Indonesia's human rights \nrecord, particularly in East Timor. The State Department has \nconsistently reported human rights violations by Indonesia's military, \nincluding in its most recent report.\n  Since the Indonesians invaded East Timor 20 years ago, more than \n200,000 East Timorese--about a third of the population--have died. But \nthe Indonesian strategy of trying to control East Timor through a \ncombination of infrastructural development and tight internal security \nhas failed to win acceptance of Indonesian rule. Many Timorese are \nstill marginalized and oppressed in their own homeland. Last year the \nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur reported that he saw ``an atmosphere \nof fear and suspicion'' in East Timor and that people were afraid to \ntalk to him about the human rights abuses they and their families had \nsuffered.\n  Mr. President, East Timor made international headlines in 1991 when \nthe military massacred, by conservative estimates, at least 100 East \nTimorese who were attending a funeral. The National Human Rights \nCommission in Jakarta now says it has evidence that the massacre was \n``not a spontaneous reaction to a riotous mob, but rather a planned \nmilitary operation designed to deal with a public expression of \npolitical dissent.''\n  And the tension in East Timor continues to intensify, influenced in \npart by the ongoing power struggles in Jakarta, the increased \nresentment of the presence of Indonesian military officers and \nvigilante groups, and the immigrant settlers brought in by Indonesia to \nconsolidate their occupation of the island.\n  In sum, I want to make it clear that Indonesia did virtually nothing \nin 1995 to improve its human rights record. A change in United States \npolicy regarding the sale of military equipment is therefore \nunwarranted.\n  The State Department and independent human rights organizations all \nreport continued abuse of basic human rights in the East Timor \nincluding arbitrary arrests and detentions, curbs on freedom of \nexpression and association, and the use of torture and summary killings \nof civilians.\n  Early last year, several riots and demonstrations in East Timor were \nbroken up violently by the Indonesian military. On January 12, 1995, \noutside of Dili, the capital, six East Timorese civilians were shot and \nkilled by Indonesian troops. In September, riots broke out in Maliana \nand in Dili that were motivated by intense religious and ethnic \ntensions.\n  The situation has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Just last \nmonth--on June 10, 1996--graffiti drawn on a picture of the Virgin Mary \nin the town of Baucau provoked riots during which Indonesian security \nforces opened fire and at least 150 people were arrested.\n  This incident reflects what Human Rights Watch/Asia describes as ``an \nemerging pattern of provocative acts of religious desecrations or \ninsult, followed by mass protests, followed by a crackdown by security \nforces.'' In fact, the Baucau riots represent the third such incident \nin East Timor in less than one year.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that--despite the fact that the \nGovernment of Indonesia allowed for a visit to East Timor of the U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, in December 1995, \nand despite the fact that the Government opened an office of the \nNational Commission on Human Rights in Dili . . . despite some of these \npositive developments--the Government of Indonesia continues to engage \nin extrajudicial executions and killings and the systematic use of \ntorture.\n  And the Indonesians have engaged in these activities despite the \ncountry's great economic success of the past few years. Mr. President, \nI would like to dispel any myths among my colleagues that Indonesia's \nprogress on the economic front has led to any progress in its human \nrights record.\n  So, we have seen no progress in human rights in Indonesia. I had \nintended to propose an amendment which codifies the U.S. position on \nhuman rights and arms sales to Indonesia. In the past, I have advocated \na much more comprehensive arms ban, which I wish we could pass. But a \nban on small arms and crowd control weapons emphasizes a very important \npolicy goal--that the United States is stepping away from \nresponsibility for human rights abuses in Indonesia, and particularly \nin East Timor. As I have said before in this body, it is especially \nimportant that we establish this linkage between arms sales and human \nrights.\n  In the meantime, however, the administration has once again provided \nus with written assurances that the existing ban on light arms sales to \nIndonesia will remain in effect. With that understanding, I will \nrefrain, again, from efforts to codify this provision.\n  Mr. President, the administration's policy sends a clear message to \nthe\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\nleaders of Indonesia that the United States will not be associated with \nnor will it tolerate their campaign of repression against the people of \nEast Timor.\n  We do not want to support human rights abuses in East Timor. We do \nnot want weapons manufactured in the United States involved in \nmassacres of peaceful protestors or in interrogations of activists that \noppose the Indonesian armed forces. We do not want U.S. arms used to \nkill and torture the people of East Timor.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the administration is continuing \nthis policy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Feingold: The Administration shares your concern \n     about reports of human rights abuses in Indonesia. We \n     continue to raise our concerns in meetings with Indonesian \n     officials, and Secretary Christopher made a point of meeting \n     with human rights activists during his visit to Jakarta this \n     week.\n       We understand you may be considering an amendment to the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that would further \n     restrict the types of defense items that can be sold or \n     licensed for export to Indonesia. While we support your \n     objective, we believe this amendment is unnecessary. The \n     Administration's policy already prohibits the sale of small \n     arms, crowd control equipment, and armored personnel \n     carriers, which we all agree should not be sold or \n     transferred to Indonesia until there is significant \n     improvement in the human rights situation there. This policy \n     has been effective, and the Administration will continue to \n     abide by the policy.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your concerns. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n              RUSSIAN FAR EAST AND AMERICAN-RUSSIAN CENTER\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of language in \nthe Senate report for the foreign operations appropriations bill \nunderlining the importance of the work of the United States West Coast-\nRussian Far East Ad Hoc Working Group, and of the American-Russian \nCenter in Anchorage, AK.\n  Mr. President, the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission's United States West \nCoast-Russian Far East Ad Hoc Working Group, under the leadership of \nJan Kalicki, the Counselor to the Department of Commerce, is doing an \noutstanding job of developing a bilateral framework that will lead to \nincreased trade and investment between the Russian Far East and west \ncoast States. The first meeting of the working group was held in \nSeattle, WA, in June 1995. In an example of the importance of Alaska's \nrelationship with the Russian Far East, the second meeting of the \nworking group was held in Anchorage, AK, in March 1996. It was a very \nproductive and successful event. I encourage all Senators from west \ncoast States to become involved in the work of the group and to \nencourage businesses in their states to do so as well. The next meeting \nof the working group will take place in Khabarovsk, in the Russian Far \nEast, from September 22 to 24, 1996.\n  I have seen first-hand the growth in business activity between the \nStates of the west coast and the Russian Far East. The economic reform \nefforts taking place in the Russian Far East, in such cities as \nVladivostok and Khabarovsk are significant. For example, Vladivostok, \nonce a closed city, now has a stock exchange. Economic reform will also \nprogress as development of the oil and natural gas fields on the \ncontinental shelf north and northeast of Sakhalin Island. The oil \ndevelopment is being led by two major international oil consortiums \nwith U.S. partners. They have already announced that they will start \ndesigning projects on Sakhalin Island worth $30 billion. Alaskans and \ncitizens of other west coast States will be involved in that \ndevelopment. There are also gold, diamond, timber, and fisheries \nindustries in the region. The Russian Far East's resources could \nprovide the engine for growth, through its export revenues, for the \neconomic restructuring of all of Russia.\n  I have promoted ties between Alaska and the Russian Far East. In 1989 \nI helped make possible, and traveled on the groundbreaking first flight \nfrom Nome to Providenya. From that initial step, relations between \nAlaska and the Russian Far East have gone very far, very fast. The \nworking group is doing an outstanding job of setting priorities and \ncoordinating joint efforts to move forward on projects and programs \nthat will benefit both Russians and west coast States by building and \nincreasing business ties between the two regions. The projects of the \nworking group will bring about greater private sector development in \nthe Russian Far East. The group has already proven to be an essential \nand integral part of the economic reform effort currently underway in \nRussia.\n  In addition to my support for the working group, I would also like to \ntake this opportunity to express my support for the American-Russian \nCenter in Anchorage, AK. The Senate has wisely funded it in the foreign \noperations appropriations bill at the amount of $2,500,000 for its \noperation and training programs. The center has played an important \nrole in the growth of business and exchanges between Alaska and the \nRussian Far East. The purpose of the center is to provide business \ntraining and technical assistance to the Russian Far East. It has \ntraining facilities in Yakutsk, Khabarovsk, Magadan, and Sakhalin \nIsland. They have provided these communities with communications \nfacilities, small business training, advanced interships with American \nbusiness, and technical assistance since 1993.\n  Continued funding of the American-Russian Center is ultimately cost-\nsaving to the American taxpayer. The center is seeking to become self-\nsufficient by 1998. At present, local Russian industries and \ngovernments are supporting 70 percent of the cost for training Russian \npersonnel in the United States, and they have pledged 100 percent \nsupport by 1997. The operation of these centers by the American-Russian \nCenter will play an important role in the future of market development \nand democracy building in the Russian Far East.\n\n\n                              MICRO CREDIT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, micro enterprise loans help people become \nself-sufficient and lift themselves out of poverty. Micro credit \nprograms extend small loans to the poor for self-employment projects \nthat generate income. These programs generally offer various services \nand resources as well as credit for self-employment. Micro credit has \nshown its ability to fight poverty and its importance to poor people \naround the world. Approximately 8 million needy people who live in \ndeveloping countries are helped by Micro credit programs.\n  Micro credit programs have also been useful in developed countries, \nwhere many thousands of people receive targeted loan funds and \nspecialized counseling that help them with preparing for self-\nemployment. According to a recent Catholic Relief Service evaluation, \n``97% of the members from two established banks in Thailand found their \nincome had increased by between $40 and $200 per year.''\n  As Results, a non-governmental organization concerned with issues of \nworld poverty, points out in a recent draft of its Micro credit Summit \nDeceleration: ``Increasingly, Micro credit it being linked \nprogrammatically to savings plans that either require or strongly \nencourage savings by borrowers. Practitioners have found that the \nability to save funds * * * is an important self-help tool for very \npoor people, allowing them to build assets essential to long-term \nfinancial security and self-sufficiency.''\n  This is an important testament to how an individual, ultimately \nresponsible for his own well being, can prosper with a little push, \nwhere none existed before.\n  We can observe the benefits of Micro credit in many countries, where \nindividuals, with help, have become self-sufficient enough to make \ngreat economic strides. Micro enterprise lending is a worthwhile \nventure that I am glad to support. I also want to commend the \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations for expressing its support of micro \nenterprise funding, specifically its intent\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\nthat at a majority of all micro enterprise resources be focused on the \npoorest people. Perhaps the primary conduit for micro enterprise \nlending by this Government is AID's program with nongovernmental \norganizations. AID should continue its efforts in this regard, and \nshould maintain an aggressive approach to the micro enterprise issue.\n\n\n               A.I.D. Funding of Microenterprise Program\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the consideration of the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, I want to address the issue of \nmicroenterprise finance as a tool for sustainable development in \ndeveloping countries.\n  I realize that Third World development efforts have received much \ncriticism in this body, but here is an emerging theory and technique \nfor offering financial services to the poor that is similar to those \nfound in any financial system.\n  I understand that the microenterprise program is based on the concept \nthat giving poor people access to financial services can allow them to \nparticipate in the private sector, rely on their entrepreneurial \nspirit, and be given a chance to rise out of poverty.\n  The microenterprise program has gained increasing recognition as a \ncreative and successful way to provide foreign aid to developing \ncountries.\n  Traditionally, most Western aid programs emphasize increasing credit \nto the poor at subsidized interest rates. But Mr. President, creating \nand maintaining such distortions in Third World economies does not \nbenefit the poor; in fact, most of such subsidized credit serves those \nalready established in the private and public sectors. Instead, if you \ncan reach the poorest of the poor and enable them to become self-\nemployed or create micro-business, then at least they face the \npossibility of emerging from poverty.\n  In addition, poor people and especially women, face barriers to \ncredit that are often based on a set of constraints including a lack of \ncollateral and being perceived as a bad credit risk.\n  There are many examples where these misperceptions have been proven \nwrong.\n  The Grameen Bank, for example, has become an international success \nstory when talking about microenterprise finance. It is an organization \nfor the poor and has accessed 2 million poor in the past 15 years. It \nhas 1,050 offices and serves 35,000 villages, 94 percent being women. \nThe customers, who are also part owners, obtain small loans for self-\nemployment from which they generate income to repay the loans and \nsupport their families. Grameen extends credit without collateral but \nonly has a 2 percent default rate, equivalent to that of any Western \nbank.\n  To qualify for a loan, a client must join a 5-member group and a 40-\nmember center and attend weekly meetings. The client must assume \nresponsibility for the loan of the group's members because it is the \ngroup and not the bank that evaluates loan proposals. If all five in \nthe group repay their loan promptly, they are guaranteed credit for the \nrest of their lives.\n  But the bank also follows borrowers to save money and never forgives \na loan, although they may restructure. Grameen helps their clients \nattain their entrepreneurial potentials and encourages a culture of \nself-help and self-reliance.\n  The Grameen model is now being followed by many established \nnongovernmental organizations. In fact, many are developing new and \ninnovative approaches that are showing enormous ingenuity and success.\n  I strongly support this more creative and productive approach to \nproviding foreign aid to developing countries, and am appreciative of \nthe efforts of the committee chairman and ranking member, Senators \nMcConnell and Leahy, for the report language of the foreign operations \nappropriation bill that A.I.D. maintain last year's level of funding \nmicroenterprise programs.\n  Microenterprise loans average less than $140, but the impact this \nsmall amount of money has on the loan recipients is enormous. At least \nhalf of the microenterprise resources are identified to make loans of \nless than $300 to those in the poorest half of the poverty line. This \nguarantees that microenterprise funds are directed toward those who \nneed it the most. The funds go to individuals, not to governments.\n  Microenterprise loans give people a way to transform their lives. \nThese funds provide a way to become self-sufficient, and allows people \nto begin to meet their own needs in the areas of health, educating \ntheir children, and improving their living environment. Most important, \nthe microenterprise program gives people hope for the future.\n  Microenterprise foreign aid money is recycled. As money is paid back \nit is used for new loans to others. Eventually the microenterprise \nprograms get linked into the formal financial system, and the effect is \nexpanded even more. The microenterprise program will help millions of \nfamilies.\n  My colleagues in this Chamber have given strong and sustained support \nto the microenterprise program. I commend them for recognizing this \nproject's utility and worth. This program effectively promotes economic \nhealth in poor countries, and should receive the highest possible \ncommitment from A.I.D.\n\n\n                                Zimbabwe\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this committee was prepared to deal \nwith a current trade dispute and nationalization of foreign assets in \nZimbabwe, but has withdrawn action relying upon the good faith \nrepresentations of Ambassador Midzi of the Republic of Zimbabwe that \nthe problems involving United States companies have been mediated \nsuccessfully. We congratulate the leadership of the Republic of \nZimbabwe for its constructive actions and hope there will be no further \nneed for this committee to review this matter nor contemplate action to \nremedy complaints by United States citizens.\n\n\n                         the export-import bank\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about the \nforeign operations legislation for fiscal year 1997. Let me begin by \ncomplementing both Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for bringing \nthis bill to the floor today. As a member of the subcommittee, I \nappreciate the lengths to which both of these Senators have gone to \naccommodate me and the citizens of Washington State.\n  This is important legislation; issues including the Middle East peace \nprocess, the growth of democracy in the former Soviet Union, efforts to \ncombat disease and starvation around the globe, international family \nplanning and job-creating export assistance financing are all part of \nthis bill. Few pieces of legislation address so many issues of \nimportance to this country--economic issues, national security issues \nand others associated with our role as the world's lone superpower. \nImportantly, this is all accomplished for an investment that represents \nless than 1 percent of the Federal budget.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Appropriations Committee fully \nfunded our assistance program to Russia to foster the growth of \ndemocracy and build important new markets for United States goods and \nservices. My home State of Washington is actively involved in Russia, \nparticularly the Russian Far East. Educational, cultural, health and \nathletic exchanges, numerous sister city relationships, the West Coast \nWorking group of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, and of course, \ninternational trade and commerce with Russia have all captivated the \ncitizens of Washington State. Washington State has demonstrated a \ncommitment to developing and expanding ties with the Russian Far East \nby locating a state office in Vladivostock.\n  I have already mentioned that this bill addresses many national \ninterests of concern to the United States. Any of which could be \nexplored in greater detail today here on the floor of the Senate. I \nwant to take a few moments to focus on the provisions of this bill that \npromote exports from the United States--the job creators of this \nlegislation--and specifically, the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates.\n  This legislation provides nearly $770 million to the Export-Import \nBank of the United States for fiscal year 1997. Ex-Im is the great \nequalizer for U.S. firms seeking to export abroad in a competitive \nglobal marketplace. A marketplace where our international competitors \nare spending vastly greater sums of money in support of their \nexporters. For example, in 1994, Japan provided export financing to \nnearly 40 percent of all that nation's trade deals. In the same time \nperiod, Canada financed almost 20 percent of its exports.\n\n[[Page S8862]]\n\nU.S. export financing through the Ex-Im bank equaled 3.3 percent--a \nfigure significantly below virtually all of our trade partners.\n\n  It is estimated that the fiscal year 1997 appropriation will support \nbetween $15 and $18 billion in exports. Think about it, the Export-\nImport Bank will leverage its $770 million appropriation to generate \n$15-$18 billion in economic activity--job creating economic activity--\nright here in the United States in the next year. For several pennies, \nthe American taxpayer, through Ex-Im, will support nearly 500,000 \nAmerican jobs. And export-related jobs have shown to pay approximately \n13-percent more than nonexport jobs. The Ex-Im Bank is sustaining and \ncreating family wage jobs all across this country.\n  In my own State of Washington, the Ex-Im Bank is having a significant \nimpact on trade promotion and job creation. Many identify the Boeing \nCo. with the Export-Import Bank. While the relationship between the \nbank and the aerospace industry is often overstated, it is important to \nnote that approximately 2,000 small businesses in Washington State do \ncontracting work for the Boeing Co. So when Ex-Im helps the United \nStates commercial aircraft industry develop new markets for aircraft in \nPoland and Lithuania, Ex-Im supports jobs at small businesses across my \nState.\n  There are numerous examples of the Export-Import Bank aiding \nWashington State businesses seeking to export abroad. With Ex-Im \nassistance, Pacific Propeller, a propeller manufacturer and overhauler, \nlocated in Kent, WA secured $7.5 million of important work in \nIndonesia. Connelly Skis exported its recreational equipment including \nthe new ``Big Easy'' water ski to Belgium, Columbia, South Africa, and \nJamaica. And the Lamb Weston Corp. shipped Washington State french \nfries to Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, and Aruba. This was all done with \nassistance from Ex-Im--all of these export deals may not have occurred \nwithout Ex-Im assistance. Clearly, the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates is a major contributor to my State's efforts to compete and \nsucceed in international trade. Few recognize the benefits of this \nsmall appropriation to the Export-Import Bank, many work and prosper \ndue to this agencies important work.\n  Ex-Im is the lender of last resort; meaning the bank finances only \ndeals that will not go through without assistance. The bank supports \nU.S. exporters when foreign governments offer subsidized financing to \ncompetitors, when private financing is unavailable or when small \nbusinesses are unable to locate commercial banks willing to provide \nfinancing. Importantly, the Ex-Im bank is a vital tool for small \nbusinesses seeking to export. Support for small businesses represented \nalmost 80 percent of all Export-Import Bank transactions during fiscal \nyear 1995.\n\n  I do have several reservations about the language in the bill which \naddresses an outstanding controversy regarding the Bank's provision of \nso-called retention bonuses. The bill restricts funding for the salary \nand expenses of the chairman and president of the Bank until Mr. \nKamarck is confirmed by the regular process of the Senate. A full \nSenate hearing is, after all, the best forum to question Mr. Kamarck's \nactions and his nomination to lead the Bank. I urge the Senate to \nproceed immediately with a hearing for Mr. Kamarck.\n  Additionally, this legislation cuts administrative expenses for the \nExport-Import Bank by nearly $7 million. This punitive action is \nanother expression of congressional frustration over the retention \nbonus issue. My concern is that in our zeal to protest previous Bank \nactions, we will actually be harming the Bank's ability to help \nAmerica's exporters. I hope my colleagues in the Congress and the \nadministration will come together to address outstanding Bank issues \nprior to this bill becoming law.\n  This legislation also provides important funding for the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation [OPIC] and the Trade and Development \nAgency [TDA]. Both of these entities are also important components in \nthe U.S. Government's trade promotion arsenal.\n  Mr. President, in my mind, the trade and export promotion provisions \nof this legislation represent a partnership with states across the \ncountry. In Washington State, by virtue of our location and history, we \nenjoy important cultural and economic ties with virtually every corner \nof the world. Despite an activist statewide commitment to international \ntrade, Washington State needs the backing of the Federal Government to \ncounter the resources of the Japanese and German Governments and those \nof our other international trade partners. For a minuscule investment, \nagencies like the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation and the Trade and Development Agency all provide needed \nsupport--financial and consultative--to U.S. exporters.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished \nranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Leahy in a colloquy regarding the use of Agency for \nInternational Development funds designated for Assistance for Eastern \nEurope and the Baltics.\n  This legislation provides funds for Assistance for Eastern Europe and \nthe Baltics. One of the more successful programs we have established in \nthe region are the joint research programs we have with Poland, the \nCzech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. In addition to funding high-\nquality, competitively awarded joint research grants, these programs \nstrengthen ties between our countries, and expose foreign researchers \nto the American research system. This program also enables American \nresearchers to form partnerships with Eastern European researchers. \nProjects are chosen to mutually benefit both the United States and the \ncollaborating partner. The benefits of these research programs don't \nflow one way, but flow in both directions.\n  Finally, unlike most United States collaborative research programs, \nor assistance programs in general, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, \nand Slovakia, match dollar for dollar the United States contribution to \nthe joint research funds for their countries. This shows the importance \nthey attach to this collaboration. In fact, I have just received a \njoint letter from the Ambassadors of these four countries stressing \ntheir governments' support and financial commitment to the programs. I \nhave also received letters from American researchers stating the \nbenefits of this program. I want to stress that every dollar of funding \nsupports research projects--there are no overhead costs associated with \nthese joint research funds.\n  I believe that these cooperative research and development programs \nexemplify the type of programs we should support with these countries \nand are in line with the goals of our assistance programs in Eastern \nEurope and the Baltics.\n  I would ask the distinguished ranking member if he agrees with my \nassessment of these collaborative research programs and that guidance \nprovided to the Agency for International Development should encourage \nAID to make a contribution to these four programs in fiscal year 1997 \nat the level these programs received in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Maryland \nthat I will urge the conferees to include in the statement of manager's \nlanguage to provide sufficient guidance to the Administrator of AID to \nallow funding for these important agreements.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nthis important clarification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering H.R. 3540, \nthe Foreign Operations and Export Financing appropriations bill for \nFiscal Year 1997.\n  The final bill provides $12.2 billion in budget authority and $5.2 \nbillion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral \neconomic assistance, and related agencies for Fiscal Year 1997.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $12.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.4 billion in outlays for Fiscal Year 1997.\n  Although the subcommittee is over its section 602(B) allocation for \noutlays, with enactment of section 579, the bill will be $76 million in \nbudget authority and $7 million in outlays under the subcommittee's \n602(B) allocation.\n  I commend the committee for supporting full funding for the North\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\nAmerican Development Bank in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  FOREIGN OPERATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Budget              \n                                                   authority    Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed....................................          72       8,253\n  H.R. 3540, as reported to the Senate..........      12,174       5,123\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.........      12,246      13,376\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed....................................  ..........  ..........\n  H.R. 3540, as reported to the Senate..........          44          44\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory........................          44          44\n                                                 =======================\n        Adjusted Bill Total.....................      12,290      13,420\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary.........................  ..........  ..........\n  Nondefense discretionary......................      12,250      13,311\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund............  ..........  ..........\n  Mandatory.....................................          44          44\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total allocation..........................      12,294      13,355\n                                                 =======================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary.........................  ..........  ..........\n  Nondefense discretionary......................          -4          65\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund............  ..........  ..........\n  Mandatory.....................................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total allocation..........................          -4          65\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

The foreign operations appropriations bill is generally a \nbill that does not have a problem with earmarks designed to benefit the \nStates of individual members. This is the case again this year. Having \nsaid this, I do have some concerns about the bill and report in this \nregard and would like to briefly outline them.\n  There is a specific appropriation for $2.5 million in the bill for \nthe American-Russian Center to provide business training and technical \nassistance to the Russian Far East. I have no reason to doubt the \nutility of this program. It may offer valuable assistance to the NIS, \nand I have long been a supporter of such assistance. However, if, as I \nam informed, AID would have spent roughly the same amount of funds on \nthis program without the earmark, it is not clear to me why it required \nan earmark. Why cannot AID simply fund the program out of a larger \naccount, as it apparently has in the past?\n  I accept AID's support of the program and I do not object to the \nprovision. But as with any appropriations bill, a specific request for \nfunding, which AID did not make in this case, is very helpful in \nevaluating the need for it when it appears in the bill as an earmark. \nThe cause of a useful program is only helpful by AID listing such \nthings as priorities.\n  There are assurances in the report that Russian industries and \ngovernments support 70 percent of the center's costs and that they have \npledged 100 percent support by 1997. For purely budgetary reasons--$2.5 \nmillion in any bill is not insignificant--I hope they will follow \nthrough on their pledges. I will be following the program carefully to \nsee that this is the case.\n  Unlike the bill, the committee report contains several comments on \nthe advisability of funding particular programs that cause me some \nconcern and would appear to have specific members' interest at heart.\n  First, the report ``directs'' AID to make at least $2 million \navailable for the core grant of the International Fertilizer \nDevelopment Center based in Alabama.\n  Second, it ``strongly encourages'' support for programs conducted by \nthe University of Hawaii in Pacific regional development. It ``strongly \nsupports'' the university's efforts to develop a United States-Russian \npartnership to educate young voters. and it ``encourages'' AID to \ncollaborate with the university in health and human services training.\n  Third, it ``supports'' $750,000 for Florida International \nUniversity's Latin American Journalism Program.\n  Fourth, it ``urges'' AID to support the research activity on pests of \nMontana State University.\n  Fifth, it ``encourages'' AID to support the education program of the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa in Slovakia.\n  Last, it ``urges'' the International Fund for Ireland to support the \nwork of Montana State University, Virginia Commonwealth, and Portland \nState.\n  Again, all of these matters are listed in the report, not the bill, \nand I would remind the agencies concerned that they are under no legal \nobligation to spend the funds as directed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding the rollcall \nvote will be tomorrow on the Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Outside of the windup, which I understand I have been \nentrusted with, I have no further comments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, briefly, let me thank my friend and \ncolleague from Alaska for his excellent statement and, of course, for \nthe spirit of partnership with which we have gone forward on this.\n  If I read this right, the foreign operations bill that is before us \nwould appropriate over $12,217,000,000. This amendment concerns $25 \nmillion of that--a speck. For anybody individually, $25 million is a \nlot of money. As part of this bill, it is a very, very small \npercentage.\n  I can tell you personally, I don't believe that there is any part of \nthis bill that is a better investment, in terms of preserving \ninternational security, saving American soldiers from having to go into \nbattle--which would truly cost us a lot of money--than this $25 \nmillion. I know that the administration right up to the President feels \nthat very, very strongly.\n  I believe that we have achieved two very significant accomplishments \nwith the addition of the Murkowski-McCain second-degree amendment. This \nis all about keeping promises. The Agreed Framework of October 1994 was \na very significant agreement between the United States, South Korea, \nJapan, and North Korea, the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea.\n  We are saying, by overriding the committee's recommendation to cut \nthe funding down to $13 million, that we promise $25 million a year to \nfund this agreement. The Congress says we are going to keep that \nagreement. We are going to fund up to the $25 million. But we expect \nthe North Koreans to keep their end of the bargain as well. We are \ncounting on the administration to effectively monitor the agreement and \nreport to Congress if there is any indication that the North Koreans \nare not keeping their end of the bargain.\n  So far, I say, so good. I think the second-degree amendment greatly \nimproves my underlying amendment. I am grateful, again, to my two \ncolleagues, Senators Murkowski and McCain, for the way in which we have \ngone at this.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8833-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, a report released last week by the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] concludes that the reformulated \ngasoline [RFG] program is a cost-effective means of reducing ozone \npollution and easing our Nation's vulnerability to oil supply \ndisruptions and related price shocks. Congress ought to pay close \nattention to the conclusions of this study as it seeks to wean the \nnation off imported petroleum and further improve air quality \nthroughout the Nation.\n  This independent analysis confirms that the reformulated gasoline \nprogram is good for the economy and good for the environment. RFG, \nwhich reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds and toxic air \npollutants by 15 percent, displaces significant amounts of petroleum, \nmuch of which is imported. Given the gasoline price shocks that this \ncountry recently experienced and the petroleum displacement goals \nestablished by Congress in\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\nthe 1992 Energy Policy Act, it is time to consider nationwide use of \nRFG.\n  According to the GAO report, the potential for RFG with oxygenates to \ndisplace petroleum consumption is significant. GAO expects that by the \nyear 2000 about 305,000 barrels per day of petroleum will be displaced \nby oxygenates. This amounts to about 37 percent of the 10 percent \npetroleum displacement goal established by Congress in the 1992 Energy \nPolicy Act.\n  GAO noted in its report that if all gasoline in the country were \nreformulated, the Nation could displace 762,000 barrels of petroleum \nper day by 2000, and thus meet nearly all of the 10 percent petroleum \ndisplacement goal. Moreover, despite predictions by the oil industry \nthat RFG would cost consumers over 13 cents per gallon more than \nconventional gasoline, GAO found that the actual cost to consumers has \nbeen negligible.\n  The environmental potential of an expanded RFG program is \nextraordinary. In the future, RFG will be even cleaner. In the year \n2000, the Environmental Protection Agency will implement RFG Phase II, \nwhich will require further reductions in emissions of volatile organic \ncompounds and toxic pollutants, as well as reductions of nitrous \noxides.\n  Expanding RFG nationwide will bring these clean air benefits to new \nareas of the country. Moreover, since air pollution is transported over \nvast distances, adopting a nationwide RFG program will help further \nreduce pollution in areas already using RFG to lower ozone levels.\n  A nationwide program would achieve these air quality benefits at low \ncost. GAO concluded that Phase II RFG will be one of the most cost-\neffective measures available to control low-level ozone pollution. With \nthe additional petroleum displacement benefits associated with \nnationwide use of RFG, there seems to be no reason why we should not \nmove in that direction.\n  Finally, the GAO report demonstrates that continuing research into \nethanol, an oxygenate used in RFG, is critical. GAO confirmed that \nsubstantial progress has been made in reducing the cost to produce \nethanol. Since 1980, the cost to produce corn-based ethanol has dropped \nfrom $2.50 per gallon to about $1.34 per gallon. I hope that my \ncolleagues in Congress will review the findings of the General \nAccounting Office and continue to support the research and incentives \nthat have proven so successful in lowering the cost of ethanol \nproduction and encouraging the development of a strong domestic \nindustry. As GAO has shown, these investments provide important \ndividends in terms of cleaner air and greater energy independence for \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8863-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago, in 1972, when the television networks reported that I had \nbeen elected as a U.S. Senator from North Carolina. I remember well the \nexact time that the announcement was made and how stunned I was.\n  It had never really occurred to me that I would be the first \nRepublican in history to be elected by the people of North Carolina to \nthe U.S. Senate. When I got over my astonishment, I thought about a lot \nof things. And I made some commitments to myself one of which was that \nI would never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, \nwho wanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 66,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which back in February exceeded $5 trillion for the first \ntime in history. Congress created this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always like \nto discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no President can \nspend a dime of Federal money that has not first been authorized and \nappropriated by both the House and Senate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Wednesday, July 24, stood at $5,173,226,283,802.71. \nOn a per capita basis, the existing Federal debt amounts to $19,494.49 \nfor every man, woman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday shows an increase of more than one billion dollars \n($1,562,134,965.80, to be exact). That one-day Federal debt increase \ninvolves enough money to pay the college tuitions for 231,633 students \nfor 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8864-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8864-S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHIAPAS--A TEST FOR MEXICO'S FUTURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, a group of armed rebels in the \nstate of Guerrero, Mexico marched down from the mountains and into the \ncity of Coyuca de Benitez, not far from the resort town of Acapulco. \nThen, last week, several armed men attacked a Mexican army vehicle, \nkilling one civilian in the crossfire. They were arrested, and the \nMexican army is scouring Guerrero's countryside looking for other \nmembers of the insurgent group, known as the ``Popular Revolutionary \nArmy,'' in an attempt to prevent future outbreaks of violence in the \nregion.\n  These are just the most recent of several demonstrations of civil \nunrest in Mexico since the 1994 uprising of the ``Zapatista National \nLiberation Army'' in Chiapas. In states like Tabasco, Puebla, and San \nLuis Potosi, indigenous people are increasingly staging protests, and \nresorting to violence, to expose the inequity and racism of which they \nhave been victims for generations.\n  Unfortunately, while the Mexican Government has reportedly tripled \nits assistance to Chiapas in the 2 years since the Zapatista uprising, \nthose efforts have produced little in the way of real economic and \nsocial change. The disparities that exist between Chiapas and the rest \nof Mexico are still as appalling as they were 2 years ago. While \nPresident Zedillo has recognized that poverty and the lack of access to \njustice among indigenous populations are matters which must be \naddressed, his administration has taken few effective steps to do so.\n  Chiapas is one of Mexico's richest states, contributing oil, electric \nenergy, cattle, coffee, cocoa, sugar, and various fruits and vegetables \nto domestic and international markets. Yet the majority of the people \nthere lack adequate food and shelter, or access to education and basic \nmedical care.\n  Where the government built roads in Chiapas, the roads were often of \npoor quality. Health clinics lack beds and experienced doctors. Schools \nlack materials and trained teachers. The uneven distribution of wealth \nand the unjust distribution of land are at the root of the civil unrest \nthat has captured the world's attention.\n  Over 50 percent of Mexico's hydroelectric power is generated in \nChiapas, yet less than one-third of all houses there have electricity.\n  Coffee producers, with the help of over 80,000 Chiapanecos, almost \nall of whom are Mayan Indians, produce 35 percent of Mexico's coffee \neach year. While over 50 percent of the coffee is exported to markets \nin the United States and Europe for over three times it's value in \nChiapas, indigenous laborers, paid as little as $2 per day, rarely see \nany of that profit.\n  Cattle has become an increasingly profitable industry, but while \nnearly 3 million head are exported each year, few of the people in \nindigenous communities can afford to buy meat. There are reports that \nhalf of Chiapanecos are malnourished, and in the highlands and jungle \nareas the percentage is even higher.\n  Half of the homes in Chiapas do not have potable water and two-thirds \nlack sewage systems. There is one doctor for every 2,000 people. \nChiapas has the highest number of deaths per 100,000 people than any \nother state in Mexico. Infant mortality, is close to double the \nnational average.\n  The illiteracy rate is five times the national average, and the \npercentage of students not attending school is more than three times \nthe national average.\n  The situation in Chiapas stems in part from a government that has \ndeliberately excluded the indigenous people\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\nof Mexico from the political process. While the Zapatista uprising may \nhave given them a voice in the national and international press, they \nstill lack a real voice in their own government.\n  Politics in Chiapas has been dominated by corrupt local and state \nofficials influenced by the Civil Defense Committee. The Committee is \ncomprised of the few families that own virtually all that is worth \nowning in the state. Human rights groups including Amnesty \nInternational and Americas' Watch have documented accounts of torture \nand political violence by Chiapas authorities since the mid-1980's.\n  The majority of the adult population in Chiapas is illiterate. \nPeasants there have reported that they don't vote, but the ruling PRI \nparty picks up their voting cards and votes for them. In the 1988 \nelections which former President Salinas won by a narrow margin, no \nstate gave the PRI a greater percentage of the vote than Chiapas.\n  What Chiapas needs is increased democratization of the Mexican \npolitical system, and greater representation for indigenous people. \nUntil that occurs, political instability will discourage the investment \nthat is necessary to provide jobs for the people there.\n  The United States loaned Mexico billions of dollars during the \neconomic crisis of 1994. That decision was controversial in the United \nStates, and had it been put to a vote in the Congress it might have \nbeen defeated. If the Mexican Government does not act aggressively to \nstrengthen the institutions of democracy and reform its economy, \npolitical and economic instability will increase. If the peso collapses \nagain, would the United States bail out Mexico a second time? I would \nnot want to bet my house on it.\n  While the Mexican Government needs to do more to provide the people \nof Chiapas with basic services like potable water and roads that are \npassable in the rainy season, what they need most, and what will \nultimately bring about the kind of fundamental changes that are needed \nin order to avoid further violence and instability, is economic \ninvestment and a meaningful say in the political process.\n  Despite widespread poverty in states like Chiapas, the Mexican elite \nhave prospered, from Mexico's enormous oil wealth and the growth in \nmanufacturing during the past two decades. The beneficiaries of this \nwealth need to recognize that the future stability and prosperity of \ntheir country depends on them. Not the United States. Not anyone else. \nThey alone can provide the financial investment and jobs that are \nneeded to overcome the desperation and inequities that have led to \nviolence in places like Chiapas and Guerrero.\n  Mr. President, in addition to our geographical linkage, the United \nStates and Mexico are closely linked both economically and culturally. \nThere is a large population of Mexican-Americans living in the United \nStates, and we are taking unprecedented measures to stem the flow of \nillegal immigrants from Mexico who risk arrest and even death in search \nof a better life in the north. There is no escaping the fact that \nevents in Mexico, even in seemingly distant states like Chiapas, have \nenormous implications for our own country.\n  So we must encourage the Mexican Government, and representatives of \nMexico's private sector, to address these problems with the utmost \nurgency. Benito Juarez, Emiliano Zapata, and Mexico's other great \npolitical visionaries and revolutionaries, gave their people hope for a \nbetter life. But for many, that hope has faded, and for some, who have \nresorted to violence, it has died. They have nothing left to lose.\n  With Mexico's population continuing to grow, putting increasing \npressure on government services and the country's resources, the \nsituation in places like Chiapas has reached a crisis point. But with \ncreative thinking and the recognition that those who have prospered \nhave a responsibility to help those who have been left out, Mexico's \nbusiness elite has an opportunity to play a key role in finally turning \nthe goals of the Mexico revolution into a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8864-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO JOHN DAVIS AND HIS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CITY \n                             OF BURLINGTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in every community there is someone who has \nchanged the direction of events, who has shaped the future of its \nresidents. Burlington, VT has John Davis. This month John is saying \ngoodbye to the City of Burlington's Community and Economic Development \nOffice CEDO where he has spent the last 10 years making Burlington a \nbetter place to live and work. As Housing Director for most of that \nperiod John has worked to make affordable housing a reality for \ncountless low and moderate income people living in Vermont's most \nexpensive housing market. Since 1994 John has also been the driving \nforce behind the effort to revitalize Burlington's Old North End \nthrough its designation as Vermont's only Enterprise Community.\n  When President Clinton first announced the Empowerment Zone and \nEnterprise Community Initiative, John was quick to see the opportunity \nto turn around the decline of Burlington's Old North End. There was no \nshortage of roadblocks on that long road to winning the designation of \nEnterprise Community. I think that only John's unique mix of grass-\nroots organizing skills, MIT professor's intelligence, and every day \nVermonter common sense could have brought together all of the disparate \ngroups involved to develop a plan for building a ``New'' North End \nwhere the ``Old\" one stood before.\n  There was little doubt in my mind that the project, under John's \nleadership, would succeed when I walked with HUD Secretary Cisneros \ndown Archibald Street in the fall of 1994. Already there were signs of \nthe changes to come, in particular the block long mural depicting \nneighborhood residents supporting the initiative, a mural John's family \nand many area residents worked on. One year later Secretary Cisneros \nwalked down a very different Archibald Street in a very different \nneighborhood and pronounced Burlington's ``New'' North End the most \nadvanced Enterprise Community he had visited.\n  In December of 1994 when I was honored to announce that the Old North \nEnd in Burlington had been selected as an ``Enterprise Community'', \nJohn Davis was quick to attribute that success to the people of the Old \nNorth End saying ``The reason we won was not because of the problems. . \n. We won because of our assets.'' Well, John was most definitely one of \nthose assets, as was the community enthusiasm, cooperative spirit, and \nsense of hope he helped to bring out in a part of the city that many \nhad written off. That renewed spirit has continued to grow and will \nsustain the renewal of the New North End when John has moved on.\n  I wish John the best of luck in whatever challenge he takes on next. \nI know his wife Bonnie Acker and his daughter Dia are looking forward \nto seeing more of him in the weeks ahead, but he will certainly be \nmissed by those of us (and there are many) who have been lucky enough \nto work with John during his 10 years of service to the city and people \nof Burlington, VT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8865-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR--H.R. 3603\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

A bill to authorize the construction and operation of the \nFort Peck Reservation rural water system in the State of Montana, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System Act of 1996\n\n   Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today, I introduce a bill that \nwill ensure the Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck \nReservation in Montana a safe and reliable water supply system. The \nFort Peck Reservation is located in northeastern Montana. It is one of \nthe largest reservations in the United States, and has a population of \nmore than 10,000. The Fort Peck Reservation faces problems similar to \nall reservations in the country, that of remote rural areas. This \nreservation also suffers from a very high unemployment rate, 75 \npercent. Added to all this, the populations on the reservation suffer \nfrom high incident of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. \nA safe and reliable source of water is needed to both improve the \nhealth status of the residents and to encourage economic development \nand thereby self-sufficiency for this area.\n  This legislation would authorize a reservation-wide municipal, rural \nand industrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation. It would \nprovide a much needed boost to the future of the region and for \neconomic development, and ultimately economic self-sufficiency for the \nentire area. My bill has the support of the residents of the \nreservation and the endorsement of the Tribal Council of the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes.\n  The residents of the Fort Peck Reservation are now plagued with major \ndrinking water problems. In one of the communities, the sulfate levels \nin the water are four times the standard for safe drinking water. In \nfour of the communities the iron levels are five times the standard. \nSadly, some families were forced to abandon their homes as a result of \nsubstandard water quality. Basically, the present water supply system \nis inadequate and unreliable to supply a safe water supply to those \npeople that live on the reservation.\n  Several of the local water systems have had occurrences of biological \ncontamination in recent years. As a result, the Indian Health Service \nhas been forced to issue several health alerts for drinking water. In \nmany cases, residents of reservation communities are forced to purchase \nbottled water. Not a big deal to those who can afford it, but difficult \nto a population that has the unemployment rate found on the \nreservation. All this, despite the fact that within spitting distance \nis one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the United States, built \non the Missouri River.\n  Agriculture continues to maintain the No. 1 position in terms of \neconomic impact in Montana. In a rural area like the Fort Peck \nReservation agriculture plays the key role in the economy, more so than \nin many areas of the State. The water system authorized by the \nlegislation will not only provide a good source of drinking water, but \nalso a water supply necessary to protect and preserve the livestock \noperations on the reservation. A major constraint on the growth of the \nlivestock industry around Fort Peck has been the lack of adequate \nwatering sites for cattle. This water supply system would provide the \nnecessary water taps to fill watering tanks for livestock, which in \nnormal times would boost the local economy of the region and the State. \nAn additional benefit of this system would be more effective use of \nwater for both water and soil conservation and rangeland management.\n  The future water needs of the reservation are expanding. Data show \nthat the reservation population is growing, as many tribal members are \nreturning to the reservation. It is clear that the people that live on \nthe reservation, both tribal and nontribal members, are in desperate \nneed of a safe and reliable source of drinking water.\n  The solution to this need for an adequate and safe water supply is a \nreservation-wide water pipeline that will deliver a safe and reliable \nsource of water to the residents. In addition this water project will \nbe constructed in size to allow communities off the reservation the \nfuture ability to tap into the system. A similar system for water \ndistribution is currently in use on a reservation in South Dakota.\n  The people of the Fort Peck Reservation the State of Montana are only \nasking for one basic life necessity. Good, clean, safe drinking water. \nThis is something that the more developed regions of the Nation take \nfor granted,\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\nbut in rural America we still seek to develop.\n  I realize that this bill will be assigned a number and will not go \nmuch further than being referred to a committee. However, this issue \nneeds to be placed upon the radar screens of Congress, so that in the \ncoming years we can get this accomplished for the Fort Peck Reservation \nand the people of the State of Montana.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. BIDEN (by request):\n  S. 1991. A bill entitled the ``Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control \nAct of 1996''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Gang and Youth \nViolence Control Act of 1996. This is the President's juvenile justice \nbill, and I am introducing it at his request.\n  Over the last several years, a consensus has been building in our \nNation, and we are now in the unusual position of having the public and \nthe experts in agreement that juvenile crime and violence is the most \npressing problem facing America.\n  Moreover, we now have the statistics to back up the consensus: This \npast February, the U.S. Department of Justice released an update to its \nfirst national report on juvenile offenders and victims.\n  The numbers in this report, as well as those in the FBI's most recent \nuniform crime report, demonstrate what many have been warning of for \nthe last several years--we are facing a devastating rise in juvenile \nviolence and crime.\n  Between 1988 and 1994 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has \nincreased by more than 50 percent.\n  In 1994, there were more than 125,000 juvenile arrests for violent \ncrime offenses and another 131,000 juvenile arrests for drug abuse \nviolations.\n  A total of more than 2.2 million juveniles were arrested for crimes \nin 1994.\n  Between 1993 and 1994, while adult arrest rates remained virtually \nstable, the total number of juvenile arrests increased 11 percent.\n  Over this same period, the number of juvenile arrests for violent \ncrime increased 6.5 percent.\n  Most frightening, the Justice Department study also forecast that, \neven if the overall crime rate stops growing, the rising number of \njuveniles will nonetheless produce a 22-percent rise in violent crime \narrests.\n  And, should the violent crime rate continue to grow as it has between \n1983 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will \ndouble by the year 2010 to more than 260,000 arrests.\n  The President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act includes \nimportant provisions to address these increases in chronic, violent \noffenders, including transferring the most serious offenders to adult \ncourt for prosecution, increasing the range of sanctions available to \nthe courts in sentencing a juvenile, increasing the length of time a \njuvenile can be incarcerated, and increasing the access courts have to \na juvenile offender's prior record.\n  In my view, these provisions take an important first step toward \nbeginning a needed dialog about a problem that is complicated and must \nbe addressed over the long term. I hope that we can build on what the \nPresident has proposed, because we face a three-tiered challenge in \nreforming the juvenile justice system.\n  As juvenile violence grows, both in rate and intensity, it is, of \ncourse, important to reform the juvenile justice system to address the \nmost violent young criminals. The current system was never designed to \nhandle either the number of juveniles or the level of violence being \nperpetrated by a small number of juveniles. The President's bill \nfocuses on this aspect of juvenile justice reform.\n  Just as critical--if not more so--if we are to effectively end the \nrise of juvenile crime rates is to focus on where this new breed of \ncriminals is coming from and work to prevent future increases like the \nones we have seen over the past decade.\n  Allow me to put some of the aforementioned statistics in context.\n  First, even with the increases in juvenile crime and violence, \njuveniles accounted for just 14 percent of all violent crimes and 25 \npercent of all property crimes in 1994.\n  Second, a small proportion of all children commit most of the violent \njuvenile crimes--less than one-half of 1 percent of all juveniles were \narrested for a violent crime, and approximately 7 percent of youth who \ncommit crime are violent offenders.\n  This last number is both heartening and frightening. On the one hand, \nit indicates that there is a small target population which demands our \nimmediate attention, and that targeting this population could have \nsignificant results in lowering juvenile crime rates. As I noted, the \nPresident's bill addresses this need to crack down on this group.\n  On the other hand, the President's bill does not address the very \nreal need to address the 95 percent of kids who are not yet committing \nserious crimes, but are on the crime path and will become part of this \n5 percent if left unchecked.\n  In other words, we must do more to identify those offenders who will \nend up a part of that dangerous 5 percent and turn them around before \nthey are too far down the road to violence.\n  Focusing attention only on the violent 5 percent misses the essential \npoint that most kids in the juvenile justice system--95 percent of all \njuveniles arrested--are not violent. They are also often first-time \noffenders. These are the juveniles the system was originally designed \nto handle, and rightfully so, because these are the children who can \nstill be deterred from becoming life-long criminals if we provide \njuvenile courts with the appropriate prevention and intervention \nresources at this critical stage.\n  Today, in most States, a juvenile can commit multiple, nonviolent \noffenses before they get any real attention from the juvenile justice \nsystem. This must change. We must help these 95 percent of juvenile \noffenders at the time of their first misbehavior and keep them from \nbecoming repeat or serious offenders. This means giving juvenile court \njudges the ability to impose a range of graduated sanctions designed to \nprevent additional criminal behavior.\n  Finally, we must realize that most children are not delinquent--94 \npercent of children in 1994 did not come before a judge--but these \nchildren are in danger of becoming delinquent due to the risk factors \nmany of them face.\n  Any truly comprehensive juvenile justice plan must address not only \nthose children already in the system, but it must also focus on those \nchildren who may enter the system if their needs are not addressed.\n  This task may sound like an impossible task, but it is not. We know \nwhat works and we can implement it. For example, we know that nearly 50 \npercent of all youth crime occurs during the hours after-school and \nbefore dinnertime, as these are the hours that 80 percent of America's \nchildren during these hours return to homes where no adults are present \nto provide supervision.\n\n  By providing ``safe-havens'' such as boys and girls clubs and police \nathletic leagues where children can go after school, we can remove \nchildren from the streets and keep them out of trouble.\n  In addition, we know that most juvenile offenders target other \njuveniles as their victims. By providing safe, supervised activities \nfor children, we also achieve the goal of ``target-hardening''--that \nis, we can reduce juvenile crime by removing potential victims from \noffender's paths.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated, although I generally support the \nefforts and initiatives of the President's Anti-gang and Youth Violence \nControl Act, it can only be one component of an overall juvenile \njustice initiative if it is to be successful. The President's bill does \ncontain some important initiatives to deal with the most violent youth \noffenders. Among others, these provisions--which incorporate proposals \nmade by me and other Members of Congress, include programs to initiate \ndrug and gun courts in the juvenile system, to increase penalties for \nengaging children in drug trafficking, and for increasing controls on \ndangerous drugs such as Rohypnol and methamphetamine which are becoming \nincreasingly popular among youth.\n  I commend the President on his efforts, and I urge the President and \nmy colleagues to continue to address the\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nissues of juvenile justice by working with me to develop a \ncomprehensive youth violence control and delinquency prevention plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1992. A bill to recognize the significance of the AIDS Memorial \nGrove, located in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California, and to \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to designate the AIDS Memorial \nGrove as a national memorial; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                  the aids memorial grove act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the AIDS \nMemorial Grove Act of 1966.\n  This bill is identical to H.R. 3193 sponsored by Congresswoman Pelosi \nin the House.\n  The legislation recognizes the significance of the 15-acre AIDS \nMemorial Grove in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and directs the \nSecretary of Interior to designate the AIDS Memorial Grove as a \nnational memorial.\n  The AIDS Memorial Grove is a place where people come together to \ngrieve, find solace, support and hope. Since 1991, volunteers have been \nplanting trees and maintaining this woodland area. Visitors come not \nonly from San Francisco, but also from all across the United States.\n  In giving national recognition to the area, the legislation makes the \nAIDS Memorial Grove the Nation's first living memorial dedicated to the \nthousands of Americans who have died of AIDS and in support of \nindividuals who are living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and \ntheir families and friends.\n  No Federal funds would be required.\n  The AIDS Memorial Grove is, and will continue to be, a public/private \npartnership totally supported by private donations. The AIDS Memorial \nGrove board of directors already has signed a 99-year agreement with \nthe City of San Francisco and the San Francisco Recreation and Park \nDepartment to maintain the grove in perpetuity.\n  The legislation is consistent with other bills creating areas \naffiliated with the National Park System. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in working for its enactment.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1992\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``AIDS Memorial Grove Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RECOGNITION AND DESIGNATION OF THE AIDS MEMORIAL \n                   GROVE AS NATIONAL MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) Recognition of Significance of the AIDS Memorial \n     Grove.--The Congress hereby recognizes the significance of \n     the AIDS Memorial Grove, located in Golden Gate Park in San \n     Francisco, California, as a memorial--\n       (1) dedicated to individuals who have died as a result of \n     acquired immune deficiency syndrome; and\n       (2) in support of individuals who are living with acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome and their loved ones and \n     caregivers.\n       (b) Designation as National Memorial.--Not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall designate the AIDS Memorial Grove as a \n     national memorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8866-4",

and\n       (2) failing satisfactory resolution of this matter on or \n     before July 31, 1996, the United States Government should use \n     any and all resources at its disposal to bring about full and \n     complete compliance with the Agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 5030\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Helms) proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. \n3540, supra;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, \n     purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any \n     nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as \n     full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security \n     in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures \n     which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. \n     Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. \n     America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to \n     the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic \n     transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the \n     Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing \n     the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in \n     creating the stable environment needed for those emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully \n     complete political and economic transformation.\n       (4) The United States continues to regard the political \n     independence and territorial integrity of all emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to \n     European peace and security.\n       (5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and \n     Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an \n     important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those \n     countries seeking NATO membership.\n       (6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (7) Congress supports the admission of new members to NATO \n     at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission \n     of new members into NATO.\n       (8) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of \n     Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in \n     Europe will be shared more widely. Facilitation of the \n     enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and \n     the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political \n     will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as \n     the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making \n     available the resources necessary to supplement efforts \n     prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\n       (9) New members will be full members of the Alliance, \n     enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under \n     the Washington Treaty.\n       (10) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives \n     involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n     that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the \n     Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint \n     Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping \n     Force, can make an important contribution to European peace \n     and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can \n     assist those countries preparing to assume the \n     responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly \n     should receive appropriate support from the United States.\n       (11) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-\n     Atlantic region.\n       (12) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a \n     positive role in defusing tensions between members of the \n     Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred \n     between two Alliance member states since the inception of \n     NATO in 1949.\n       (13) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance \n     the security of the region. Countries which have become \n     democracies and established market economies, which practice \n     good neighborly relations, and which have established \n     effective democratic civilian control over their defense \n     establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with \n     NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the \n     principles of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (14) A number of Central and Eastern European countries \n     have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken \n     concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including \n     their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.\n       (15) The Caucasus region remains important geographically \n     and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As \n     NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United \n     States and NATO should continue to examine all appropriate \n     means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security \n     of U.N.-recognized countries in that region.\n       (16) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (17) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance \n     should include those emerging democracies most ready for \n     closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other \n     countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move \n     forward toward eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The Congress of the United States finds in particular \n     that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made \n     significant progress toward achieving the stated criteria and \n     should be eligible for the additional assistance described in \n     this bill.\n       (19) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be \n     based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria \n     for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's \n     security and the approval of all NATO members.\n       (20) The process of NATO enlargement entails the agreement \n     of the governments of all NATO members in accordance with \n     Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.\n\n     SEC. ____03. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central \n     and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries \n     may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative \n     political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO \n     and the Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. ____04. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER \n                   ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote \n     economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and \n     Ukraine--\n       (1) the United States should continue and expand its \n     support for the full and active participation of these \n     countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO \n     membership;\n       (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic \n     means available to press the European Union to admit as soon \n     as possible any country which qualifies for membership;\n       (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support \n     for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between \n     and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, and Russia; and\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\n       (4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not stop \n     with the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \n     as full members of the NATO Alliance.\n\n     SEC. ____05. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA, \n                   AND LITHUANIA.\n\n       In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-\n     Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and \n     other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 \n     years, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical \n     security concerns that must be taken into account by the \n     United States; and\n       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be \n     disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their \n     forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.\n\n     SEC. ____06.

The United Nations, recognizing the need for \n     justice in the former Yugoslavia, established the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``International Criminal Tribunal'');\n       United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 of May 25, \n     1993 requires states to cooperate fully with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal;\n       The parties to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina and associated Annexes (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Peace Agreement'') negotiated \n     in Dayton, Ohio and signed in Paris, France, on December 14, \n     1995, accepted, in Article IX, the obligation ``to cooperate \n     in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other \n     violations of international humanitarian law'';\n       The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed to as \n     Annex 4 of the Peace Agreement, provides, in Article IX, that \n     ``No person who is serving a sentence imposed by the \n     International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and no \n     person who is under indictment by the Tribunal and who has \n     failed to comply with an order to appear before the Tribunal, \n     may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or \n     other public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina'';\n       The International Criminal Tribunal has issued 57 \n     indictments against individuals from all parties to the \n     conflicts in the former Yugoslavia;\n       The International Criminal Tribunal continues to \n     investigate gross violations of international law in the \n     former Yugoslavia with a view to further indictments against \n     the perpetrators;\n       On July 25, 1995, the International Criminal Tribunal \n     issued an indictment for Radovan Karadzic, president of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration of Pale, and Ratko Mladic, \n     commander of the Bosnian Serb administration and charged them \n     with genocide and crimes against humanity, violations of the \n     law or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949, arising from atrocities perpetrated \n     against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in \n     Sarajevo, and for the taking of United Nations peacekeepers \n     as hostages and for their use as human shields;\n       On November 16, 1995, Karadzic and Mladic were indicted a \n     second time by the International Criminal Tribunal, charged \n     with genocide for the killing of up to 6,000 Muslims in \n     Srebrenica, Bosnia, in July 1995;\n       The United Nations Security Council, in adopting Resolution \n     1022 on November 22, 1995, decided that economic sanctions on \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Scrbia and Montenegro) \n     and the so-called Republika Srpska would be reimposed if, at \n     any time, the High Representative or the IFOR commander \n     informs the Security Council that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serb authorities are failing \n     significantly to meet their obligations under the Peace \n     Agreement;\n       The so-called Republika Srpska and the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have failed to arrest and \n     turn over for prosecution indicted war criminals, including \n     Karadzic and Mladic;\n       Efforts to politically isolate Karadzic and Mladic have \n     failed thus far and would in any case be insufficient to \n     comply with the Peace Agreement and bring peace with justice \n     to Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       The International Criminal Tribunal issued International \n     warrants for the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic on July 11, \n     1996.\n       In the so-called Republika Srpska freedom of the press and \n     freedom of assembly are severely limited and violence against \n     ethnic and religious minorities and opposition figures is on \n     the rise;\n       It will be difficult for national elections in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina to take place meaningfully so long as key was \n     criminals, including Karadzic and Mladic, remain at large \n     and able to influence political and military developments;\n       On June 6, 1996, the President of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal, declaring that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia's failure to extradite indicted war criminals is a \n     blatant violation of the Peace Agreement and of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions, called on the High \n     Representative to reimpose economic sanctions on the so-\n     called Republika Srpska and on the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); and\n       The apprehension and prosecution of indicted war criminals \n     is essential for peace and reconciliation to be achieved and \n     democracy to be established throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       It is the sense of the Senate finds that the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia merits continued \n     and increased United States support for its efforts to \n     investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of gross \n     violations of international law in the former Yugoslavia.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the President of the \n     United States should support the request of the President of \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     for the High Representative to reimpose full economic \n     sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) and the so-called Republika Srpska, in accordance \n     with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1022 (1995), \n     until the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb authorities have complied with \n     their obligations under the Peace Agreement and United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions to cooperate fully with \n     the International Criminal Tribunal.\n       (c) It is further the sense of the Senate that the NATO-led \n     Implementation Force (IFOR), in carrying out its mandate, \n     should make it an urgent priority to detain and bring to \n     justice persons indicted by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal.\n       (d) It is further the sense of the Senate that states in \n     the former Yugoslavia should not be admitted to international \n     organizations and fora until and unless they have complied \n     with their obligations under the Peace Agreement and United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions to cooperate fully with \n     the International Criminal Tribunal.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            PRESSLER (AND D'AMATO) AMENDMENTS NOS. 5062-5063\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Pressler, for himself and Mr. D'Amato) \nproposed two amendments to the bill, H.R. 3540, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 5062\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n    SENSE OF SENATE ON DELIVERY BY CHINA OF CRUISE MISSILES TO IRAN\n\n       Sec. 580.

Mr. President, on July 16, 1996, I filed Report \n104-322 to accompany S. 901, to amend the Reclamation Projects \nAuthorization and Adjustment Act of 1992, that had been ordered \nfavorably reported on June 19, 1996. At the time the Report was filed, \nthe estimates by Congressional Budget Office were not available. The \nestimate is now available and concludes that enactment of S. 901 would \n``not affect direct spending or receipts''. I ask that a copy of the \nCBO estimate be printed in the Record.\n  The estimate follows:\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 901.\n       2. Bill title: A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects \n     Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Interior to participate in the design, \n     planning, and construction of certain water reclamation and \n     reuse projects and desalination research and development \n     projects, and for other purposes.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources on July 16, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 901 would authorize the Secretary of \n     the Interior to participate in the design, planning, and \n     construction of\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\n     eleven water reclamation and reuse projects and two \n     desalination research and development projects. The projects \n     would be subject to the following conditions:\n       No funds could be appropriated until a feasibility study is \n     completed and the Secretary has determined that the \n     nonfederal project sponsor is financially capable of funding \n     the nonfederal share of the project's costs;\n       The federal government could not pay more than 25 percent \n     of the total cost of constructing the water reclamation and \n     reuse projects or more than 50 percent of the cost of the \n     desalinization and research and development projects; and\n       The Secretary would not be authorized to provide funds for \n     the operation and maintenance of any project.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming the \n     necessary appropriations, CBO estimates that enacting S. 901 \n     would result in new discretionary spending totaling $112 \n     million for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. Additional \n     spending of $20 million would occur after 2002. \n     Appropriations in fiscal year 1996 for water reclamation and \n     reuse projects totaled $20 million. Assuming appropriations \n     of the needed amounts, the Bureau of Reclamation anticipates \n     spending an average of $30 million a year over the 1997-2007 \n     period on projects that have already been authorized.\n\n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  1996   1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION                                       \n                                                                                                                \nSpending Under Current Law:                                                                                     \n    Estimated Authorization Level a............................     20     30     30     30     30     30     30\n    Estimated Outlays..........................................     20     28     30     30     30     30     30\nProposed Changes:                                                                                               \n    Estimated Authorization Level..............................  .....     12     31     22     27     13     10\n    Estimated Outlays..........................................  .....      9     25     22     27     16     13\nSpending Under S. 901:                                                                                          \n    Estimated Authorization Level a............................     20     42     61     52     57     43     40\n    Estimated Outlays..........................................     20     37     55     52     57     46     43\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na The 1996 level is the amount appropriated for that year.                                                      \n\n       The costs of this bill fall within budget function 300.\n       6. Basis of estimate: For the purpose of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that funds will be appropriated for all projects \n     authorized by this bill and that spending will occur at \n     historical rates for similar water projects. Some of the \n     projects authorized in this bill are still in the study or \n     design phase and will not be ready to begin construction for \n     a number of years. Estimates of annual budget authority \n     needed to meet design and construction schedules were \n     provided by the Bureau of Reclamation. In all cases, CBO \n     adjusted the estimates to reflect the impact of inflation \n     during the time between authorization, appropriation, and the \n     beginning of construction.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       8. Estimated impact of State, local, and tribal \n     governments: S. 901 contains no intergovernmental mandates ad \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public \n     Law 104-4). CBO estimates that state and local governments, \n     as nonfederal project sponsors, would incur costs totaling \n     about $370 million over fiscal years 1997 through 2006 if \n     they choose to participate in these projects. Further, \n     nonfederal project sponsors would probably incur some \n     additional costs for feasibility studies and would pay for \n     the operation and maintenance of these projects. \n     Participation in these projects would be voluntary on the \n     part of these nonfederal entities.\n       This estimate is based on information provided by the \n     Bureau of Reclamation. We assumed that nonfederal project \n     sponsors would contribute 75 percent of the cost of water \n     reclamation and reuse projects and 50 percent of the cost of \n     desalinization projects, as required by the bill.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This act would \n     impose no new federal private-sector mandates as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On July 22, 1996, CBO prepared a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 3660, a similar bill ordered reported \n     by the House Committee on Resources. Differences in the \n     estimated costs of the two bills reflect differences in the \n     projects authorized and in the federal shares.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Gary \n     Brown; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marjorie Miller; Impact on the Private Sector: Amy Downs.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine (for Paul N. \n     Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8924-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8925-S8926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TOWARD A MORE LITERATE SOCIETY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, five years ago today, the National \nLiteracy Act of 1991 became law. In each chamber, legislation in \nsupport of literacy had received strong support from both sides of the \naisle. In the Senate, our original measure passed in 1990 by a vote of \n99-0. Literacy legislation was passed three times by the House. No \nissue is more important than basic literacy. No issue is less partisan. \nNo issue is more compelling to our nation's ability to survive and \nflourish. The ability to read, write and speak in English, compute and \nsolve problems is fundamental to functioning at home, on the job and in \nsociety. Literacy is an essential ingredient to ensure that each person \nrealizes his or her full potential as a parent, a worker and a member \nof the community. A United States where every adult is literate is \nessential if our nation is to continue to compete in the global economy \nand be a responsible citizen of the world.\n  As important as literacy is for the nation, possessing basic literacy \nskills is also critical for the individual. The ability to read, do \nbasic computations and think critically opens the door to endless \npossibilities and unleashes human potential. The lack of basic \neducational skills robs people of the opportunity to realize personal \nhappiness and economic security. According to the National Institute \nfor Literacy, which was established by the National Literacy Act, about \nhalf of the American workforce has reading and writing problems. This \nlimits an individual's earnings and American productivity. Secretary of \nEducation Richard Riley said it well: ``Illiteracy is the ball and \nchain that ties people to poverty.''\n  The images of illiteracy are powerful, the consequences are severe. \nHow dangerous it is when someone cannot read instructions on a medicine \nbottle or a household appliance. How threatening it is when you cannot \nunderstand legal rights and responsibilities. How intimidating it must \nbe when computing, measuring or estimating is a mystery. How sad it is \nwhen a child's bedtime story must remain unread because a parent cannot \ndecipher the symbols on the page. We have the power to change these \ndisturbing situations. Literacy could be a part of the solution to many \nof our social problems.\n  It was in recognition of the significance and importance of literate \ncitizenry, that the National Literacy Act became law. This legislation \nwas designed to assist state and local programs to provide literacy \nskills to adult. It was the first national step toward reaching the \ngoal that all Americans obtain the fundamental skills necessary to \nfunction effectively in their work and daily lives, and to strengthen \nand coordinate adult literacy programs across the nation.\n  The National Institute for Literacy (NIL) has already had many \nachievements including the establishment of the National Literacy \nHotline and the National Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities \nCenter. The National Institute for Literacy manages the Literacy \nAmeriCorps program which has assisted families to improve their basic \neducation skills. NIL has funded innovative state and local activities \nnationwide. The Institute also produces and disseminates timely \ninformation on adult education and family literacy practices.\n  Across the country, State Literacy Resource Centers (SLRC), \nauthorized by the Act, meet a great need by fostering collaboration \namong literacy agencies and increasing local capacity to deliver \nliteracy services. SLRCs have created linkages within the literacy \ncommunity, but these linkages are threatened because of a lock of \nfederal funds.\n  As our world becomes more complex, the need for literacy becomes \ngreater and the skills needed continue to expand. Thanks to the \nNational Literacy Act, our understanding of the magnitude of illiteracy \nhas increased, and it is clear that sadly, there is still more to be \ndone.\n  An immense need still exists. The most recent statistics available \nindicate that 80 percent of adults cannot synthesize information from \ncomplex material. More than 53 million Americans are unable to locate a \nsingle piece of information in a short text. More than 56 million \nAmericans cannot do simple arithmetic. Millions of Americans are unable \nto locate, understand or use information from written materials; \nmillions of Americans lack quantitative skills. That means they cannot \ncomplete a job application, or use a bus schedule, or complete a bank \ndeposit slip.\n  Action is needed now if we are to achieve the national education \ngoal: that by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and \nwill possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in global \neconomy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. I \nurge my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\nsupport literacy programs through the appropriations process and \nthrough efforts to promote the achievement of literacy in their \ncommunities. Advancing literacy initiatives is a crucial investment in \nour future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8925-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ALEX MANOOGIAN, 1901-96\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on July 10, Michigan lost one of its \ngreatest citizens, a very humble man of great wealth, an immigrant who \nembodied all that is good about America, a man of 95 years who still \nhad plans to make life better for people.\n  Alex Manoogian came to this country in 1920 to escape the oppression \nof the Armenian people. A few years after his arrival, he founded what \nis today one of Michigan's most successful business firms, Masco \nCorporation. But it is the rest of the story that made Alex Manoogian a \ngiant, not only in Michigan but in the United States and in the world, \nas well.\n  He touched the lives of young people with educational facilities here \nand abroad. Cultural and educational institutions in Detroit, Ann \nArbor, Armenia and Jerusalem welcomed his generous endowments. If \nArmenians suffered in America, his adopted land, or in his homeland of \nArmenia, he was there to help. He founded the Armenian General \nBenevolent Union to address the catastrophes that befell his people.\n  The Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians came from \nYerevan to preside at the funeral of Alex Manoogian. He described him \nas a Christian, an Armenian and an American. A Christian, whose deep \nfaith kept him involved in the church for 80 of his 95 years--and he \nbuilt St. John's Armenian Church in Southfield, MI, one of the most \nglorious edifices in our community with its golden dome that glows in \nthe sunlight. An Armenian, who never forgot the persecution of his \npeople and the need to continue to touch their lives. An American, who \nloved this country passionately and who gave back much, much more than \nhe ever took.\n  I loved meeting with Alex Manoogian. He spoke simply, eloquently and \nwith great intensity about those things that mattered to him. I will \nalways cherish our many discussions. We will all miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8926-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BOONDOGGLE FOR THE NRA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Senate recently approved a \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997 that includes an \nindefensible allotment of tax dollars to a slightly camouflaged version \nof the earlier Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n  I have written on this subject in a column that is sent to newspapers \nin Illinois, and I ask that it be reprinted here to call the attention \nof my colleagues to this questionable line item.\n  The column follows:\n\n  An Incomprehensible, Irresponsible, Baffling Boondoggle For the NRA\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Buried in the annual Defense Department authorization bill \n     is an outrageous gift of $77 million that will benefit \n     something called the Corporation for the Promotion Rifle \n     Practice and Firearms Safety.\n       This corporation is the new ``private'' incarnation of the \n     old National Rifle Association-backed Civilian Marksmanship \n     Program. This program was intended to make sure people could \n     shoot straight in case they entered the military. In recent \n     years, however, it has simply funneled cash, weapons and \n     ammunition to private gun clubs, thanks to the power of the \n     NRA. Until a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in 1979, \n     gun clubs which participated in this program were required to \n     be NRA members.\n       Under public pressure to eliminate this useless and \n     wasteful program, Congress ``privatized'' the program last \n     year.\n       In fact, the corporation is private in name only. When the \n     corporation becomes fully operational in October of this year \n     it will be given by the Army:\n        176,218 rifles the Army views as outmoded, but valued at \n     $53,271,002.\n        Computers, vehicles, office equipment and other related \n     items valued by the Army at $8,800,000.\n        146 million rounds of ammunition valued by the Army at \n     $9,682,656.\n        $5,332,000 in cash.\n       That totals $77,085,658.\n       Our friends in the National Rifle Association strongly back \n     this measure and it appears to be a boondoggle for them.\n       What the Army should do with outmoded weapons is to destroy \n     them. Our government has a theoretical policy that it does \n     not sell federally owned weapons to the public. The Civilian \n     Marksmanship Program violates this policy, and the new \n     corporation would continue to violate it.\n       Why we should be subsidizing rifle practice--which is the \n     theory behind this--baffles me. Hardly any of those who will \n     use the weapons will enter into the armed forces. The Defense \n     Department did not request this.\n       I had never fired a rifle or handgun before entering the \n     Army, and with minimal training I became a fair-to-good \n     marksman.\n       Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and I tried to \n     eliminate this incomprehensible expenditure from the bill and \n     we got only 29 votes for our amendment. The NRA still has \n     power.\n       We should be reducing the numbers of weapons in our \n     society, not increasing them.\n       A government policy of destroying weapons and not selling \n     outmoded guns to the public is sound.\n       While rifles are not the primary weapons for crime--pistols \n     are--some of those 176,000 weapons will get into the hands of \n     people who should not have them. If 1 percent reach someone \n     who is irresponsible, that is 1,760 weapons.\n       Let me in advance extend my sympathy to the families of the \n     people who will be killed by these weapons. The will be \n     needless victims of this folly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8926-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MEMORIALIZING MICHIGAN VICTIMS OF TWA FLIGHT 800\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of Michigan I would like \nto express my deep regret at the loss of several Michigan residents who \nlost their lives in the explosion of TWA Flight 800 near New York. We \nstill do not know what happened to flight 800, and therefore do not yet \nknow if there are culprits behind it who must be brought to justice. \nBut we do know that the lives of fine people have been lost before \ntheir time.\n  Mr. President, six people with close ties to Michigan died in this \ncrash. They were Courtney Johns, an 18-year-old Bloomfield Hills Marian \nHigh School graduate, headed for Paris on an exchange program. Dr. \nGhassan and Mrs. Nina Haurani, citizens and parents in Grosse Pointe \nShores, starting a brief European vacation. Celine Rio, an 11-year-old \nFrench girl returning to her home after a 3-week visit as part of a \nnational cultural exchange program. Tracy Anne Hammer, a doctoral \nstudent in veterinary science and microbiology at Michigan State \nUniversity, who was to give a speech on cardiac disease in doberman \npinschers before a professional audience. And Elaine Loffredo, a \nMichigan native who gave up a career in nursing for the excitement of \nair travel.\n  Mr. President, these people touched the hearts of many around them, \nin Michigan and elsewhere. Courtney Johns was a class leader in high \nschool who was headed to Villanova University in the fall. She leaves \nbehind grieving friends and a family devastated by the loss of this \nyoung, promising life. Ghassan and Nina Haurani were known in their \ncommunity as loving parents and good neighbors. Termed ``joyous, giving \npeople,'' they, too, leave behind them grieving friends and a family \nthat will miss them terribly. Tracy Anne Hammer, traveling with her \nmother, was well on her way to a promising career, was, indeed to \nlaunch that career in France, when she was taken from us, her family \nand friends. Celine Rio, a young girl on the edge of adolescence, had \nlearned about America and had gained a second family in the Winters, \nher exchange program hosts. Now the Winters and her many other friends \nin America must join family and friends in France in lamenting the loss \nof this young spirit. And Elaine Loffredo, who found such joy in air \ntravel and in the people she met--I am told that meeting Mother Theresa \nwas a highlight of her career--was taken from her husband and other \nfamily and friends, by this explosion.\n  Mr. President, these were fine people, leading fine lives until they \nwere taken from us. I know I speak for my entire State of Michigan when \nI tell families and friends of those we have lost that we share their \nloss, and that our thoughts and prayers are with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8926-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8926-S8927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION WAS A COSTLY PARTISAN GAME\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Special Committee To Investigate \nWhitewater Development Corporation And Related Matters recently \ntransmitted its final report.\n  I have written about this costly, partisan game in a column that is \nsent to newspapers in Illinois, and I submit it\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\nhere to call the attention of my colleagues to this political exercise \nthat contributed nothing.\n  The column follows:\n\n          Whitewater Investigation Was a Costly Partisan Game\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       The Senate Whitewater investigation resulted in a political \n     exercise that contributed nothing, except to add to public \n     cynicism and confirming the already widespread belief that in \n     Congress we are playing partisan games rather than tending to \n     the nation's and the public's real needs.\n       Obviously some people broke the law in the Whitewater \n     events, but the evidence indicated neither a violation of the \n     law nor of ethical standards by Bill Clinton or Hillary \n     Clinton while he served either as President or as Governor of \n     Arkansas.\n       But the misuse of the FBI files is another matter. Both the \n     White House and the FBI are at fault. The President probably \n     is not personally involved, but it happened in his White \n     House and administration and it should not be treated as a \n     minor mess-up by the President or his staff. The misuse of \n     police powers by governments is as old as governments \n     themselves, and something that must be constantly guarded \n     against.\n       The abuse of the FBI files comes at a time when there are \n     two other abuses.\n       One is the Senate investigation which spent almost $2 \n     million, received testimony from 139 witnesses, and took more \n     time than any investigation of a sitting President in our \n     history--longer than the Watergate or Iran-Contra hearings. \n     ``Where there is smoke there must be fire'' is an old saying, \n     but those hearing were designed to create smoke. Not only is \n     there a product of questionable worth, we took testimony from \n     many individuals who never in their lives thought they would \n     testify before a Senate Committee, such as secretaries. Some \n     were terrified by the combination of coming before a \n     committee and being on national television.\n       A second abuse is the multiplying like rabbits of special \n     counsels--really special prosecutors--with no limits on their \n     expenses and their ability to use huge resources from the FBI \n     and other agencies. I voted for the law creating the special \n     counsel, but now I sense we need a better answer.\n       Since the FBI and the work of U.S. attorneys fall under the \n     jurisdiction of the Attorney General, my sense is that we \n     should review the possibility of a change in how we structure \n     that office. It differs from other cabinet posts in its broad \n     police and prosecutorial responsibilities, and the recent FBI \n     debacle and the runaway habits of the special prosecutors, \n     might provide an incentive to the next Congress and President \n     to look at this question.\n       For example, we might have an Attorney General appointed \n     for a 10-year term, with a small bipartisan group giving the \n     President a list of five names to choose from, and also \n     giving him the ability to request a new list of names if he \n     found them unsatisfactory, but still requiring confirmation \n     by the Senate. And then have no special prosecutors.\n       This is not a criticism of Janet Reno, who is a much-above-\n     average Attorney General. Another example of a good \n     appointment is President Gerald Ford's naming of Ed Levi, \n     then president of the University of Chicago. No one felt that \n     at any time Gerald Ford could get Ed Levi to do anything but \n     what he believed was in the best interests of the nation. \n     That is the way it should be.\n       My hope is that out of the present mini-storms something \n     constructive can happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8926-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8927-S8928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks \nregarding the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies \nprograms, which the Senate passed nearly unanimously yesterday.\n  This appropriations bill is arguably the most important for my State \nof North Dakota. Agriculture is my State's No. 1 industry, accounting \nfor over one third of our annual economic activity. This bill provides \nimportant funding for many USDA activities important to my State, \nincluding valuable research, rural development, and, of course, \ncommodity programs. I want to express my appreciation to the chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee for the excellent work they have \nperformed putting this bill together.\n  Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers have an extremely difficult task \nbalancing the needs of many important programs funded by this bill with \nthe very difficult budget situation we are facing as we strive to \nbalance the budget. I know the committee received a great number of \nrequests to provide funding for programs and activities that are \nimportant to the agricultural sector of our economy, and I realize they \ncould not possibly fund every program or activity at the levels \nrequested. I do want to express my appreciation for the support the \ncommittee has provided for the programs in this bill, especially in \nlight of their overall allocation.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for the help of the staff of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Becky Davies, Hunt Shipman, Galen \nFountain, and Jimmie Reynolds, for their excellent work on behalf of \nthe chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to comment briefly on two \nimportant programs, and express my desire that the House-Senate \nconference committee will support the programs at the funding level \nprovided in the Senate bill.\n  First, I want to express my strong support for the funding provided \nin the Senate version of this bill for the State mediation grants \nprogram within the Department of Agriculture. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has provided $2 million for this important program, and I \ncommend subcommittee Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers for including \nfunding for this program. Regretfully, the House of Representatives did \nnot provide any funding for the State mediation grants program. It is \nmy hope that Senate and House conferees will realize the benefits of \nthis program and fund the State mediation grants program at $2 million.\n  The State mediation program was created in response to the \nagricultural crisis of the late 1980's, and the program continues to be \nvaluable to farmers and ranchers today. Mediation programs enable \nfarmers and ranchers to meet with their creditors or the local Farmers \nHome Administration office in a confidential atmosphere which promoted \ncivil discussion, mutual understanding, and it most cases, a fair \nsettlement.\n  The scope of the State mediation grants program was expanded when the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture's [USDA] Reorganization Act of \n1994 became law. Now, farmers and ranchers in States which have \ncertified State mediation programs may choose mediation in a variety of \ndisputes with USDA, such as conservation compliance, wetland \ndeterminations, and grazing rights.\n  The demand for this mediation program continues to exist. Nineteen \nStates have certified State mediation programs, and USDA is working \nwith more States to establish certified programs. Mediation is a proven \nmethod of sensible and economical dispute resolution. In producers' \ndisputes with USDA, mediators provide the voice of reason and help all \nparties take a realistic approach to the administration of Federal \nprograms and the requirements of compliance.\n  A group of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, joined me \nin a letter to Chairman Cochran earlier this year, requesting full \nfunding for the State mediation grants program. It is my hope that \nSenate and House conferees will realize the benefits of this program \nand fund the State mediation grants program at the Senate-passed level \nof $2 million.\n  Mr. President, I also want to indicate my support for the funding \nprovided in the Senate version of this appropriations bill for the \nAlternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization [AARC] \nCorporation, and express my hope that the conferees on this legislation \nwill be able to fund AARC at the Senate-passed level.\n  This level of funding is justified by the major opportunities for \ndeveloping markets for alternative agricultural products, and by \nevidence that the AARC program is providing the necessary bridge from \nprivate sector research to commercialization for these products. AARC \nis a venture capital fund designed to boost farm income by \ncommercializing new uses for agricultural products. Recipients of AARC \nfunds repay AARC's investment, plus a risk charge. AARC's system is \nrevolutionary because it provides actual business financing and hands-\non business and technical assistance, as well as competitive research \ngrants and links with the public and private sectors.\n  In my view, AARC has only begun to tap the potential for \ncommercializing new products in the domestic market. AARC promotes new \nindustrial uses of our farmers' commodities like fiber board from wheat \nstraw, windshield wiper fluid from ethanol, cat litter from waste \npeanut hulls, and many others. Finding new uses for our commodities and \npromoting value-added\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nenterprises in our rural communities are important ways AARC can help \npromote more jobs, higher incomes, and fresh opportunities in rural \nAmerica. In AARC's first 3 years in operation, the Center invested \n$22.3 million in 54 projects in 28 states, matched by more than $75 \nmillion from private partners--a 3 to 1 match.\n  It is my hope that conferees will realize the benefits of the AARC \nCorporation, and provide funding at the Senate-passed level of $10 \nmillion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8927-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A MISSTEP BY THE UNITED STATES\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the United States unfortunately has \nopenly opposed a second term for United Nations Secretary-General \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali.\n  I have written about this hard-working, effective leader in a column \nthat is sent to newspapers in Illinois, and I submit it here to call to \nthe attention of my colleagues this policy that has not made us any \nfriends.\n  The column follows:\n\n                     A Misstep by the United States\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Suppose a local Rotary Club had the community's most \n     wealthy and powerful citizen, Sam Smith, as a member. Imagine \n     that the Rotarians had a dues system that reflected the \n     ability to pay, so that wealthy Sam Smith paid more in dues \n     than any other Rotarian.\n       To complicate the story, Sam Smith is far back in the \n     payment of his dues, so far back that the money he owes \n     amounts to almost the total budget of the club for a year.\n       The president of the Rotary Club is up for reelection, and \n     most of the members want him reelected, but Mr. Big, Sam \n     Smith, says no.\n       How popular do you think Sam Smith would be with the other \n     Rotarians? Would his influence rise or fall? And what will \n     the other Rotarians do in their election of a president?\n       The story is true.\n       Only the ``club'' is called the United Nations.The wealthy \n     deadbeat member is called Sam, Uncle Sam. Most of the UN \n     members believe that Secretary General Boutros-Ghali is doing \n     a good job, despite being hampered by approximately $1.4 \n     billion that the United States owes but has not paid.\n       But the United States has made clear that we want to veto \n     his reelection as Secretary-General.\n       The other nations, already too often unimpressed by our \n     uncertain leadership in foreign policy, are not pleased with \n     what we are doing, believing it is dictated by domestic \n     political considerations.\n       In 1978, President Jimmy Carter designated me as one of the \n     delegates to a two-month session of the Untied Nations, and I \n     have followed the UN and its work with more than casual \n     interest.\n       My impression is that overall the United Nations performs a \n     vital service and a good job, not perfect, and that Boutros-\n     Ghali has been a hard-working, effective leader--hampered in \n     part by the United States talking to a great game, but not \n     paying our dues.\n       Egypt is the home of the Secretary-General, and as an \n     Egyptian he is also an African. Africa sometimes is called \n     ``the dark continent.'' It is more accurately described as \n     the ignored continent.\n       One little-known fact is the gradual spread of democracy in \n     Africa, some of them fledgling democracies that deserve more \n     encouragement from the United States and other nations.\n       African countries take pride in having Boutros-Ghali as the \n     Secretary-General.\n       Our opposition to him is coupled with other realities that \n     they see: President Clinton has never visited Africa. \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher has not visited any \n     sub-Saharan country since he has been Secretary, compared to \n     24 visits to Syria.\n       Our inattention, coupled with our unfortunate open \n     opposition to the reelection of the Secretary-General, has \n     not made us any friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8928-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8928-S8929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOOD QUALITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

The effort to achieve food \n     safety reform, which assures an abundant, affordable, and \n     safe food and fiber supply has been difficult, and we applaud \n     all those who worked to help reach an acceptable compromise.\n       It is important that farmers continue to have the greatest \n     availability of crop production products which are safe, \n     affordable and effective to ensure that they are able to meet \n     the nation's demand for food and fiber. While we had concerns \n     initially with some provisions in the bill, the diligent work \n     by the Committee and assurances from EPA and USDA that the \n     new higher standard of protection will be interpreted with \n     common sense and reason have reassured us that this is \n     meaningful change.\n       The Delaney Clause is outdated and could possibly cause the \n     loss of many crop protection products which pose no \n     significant health or safety risk. This legislation \n     represents the best opportunity in a decade to modernize the \n     Delaney Clause and strengthen federal food safety protection. \n     We will continue to work with you to see that the new \n     legislation accomplishes these goals and urge prompt Senate \n     action.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Soybean Association, National Association of \n           Wheat Growers, National Cotton Council of America, \n           National Corn Growers Association, National Barley \n           Growers Association.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                         Food Chain Coalition,\n\n                                                    July 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Last week, representatives of the \n     Administration, industry and the environmental community \n     reached compromise agreement on H.R. 1627, ``The Food Quality \n     Protection Act,'' after several weeks of negotiations. This \n     bill represents the best opportunity in a decade to modernize \n     the Delaney Clause and strengthen our nation's food laws.\n       As Americans working to produce, process and market our \n     nation's food supply, we urge the Senate to act promptly to \n     pass this compromise agreement. We applaud the announcement \n     by the Senate Agriculture Committee that it will markup the \n     legislation on Wednesday, July 24.\n       There is virtually unanimous agreement that an overhaul of \n     the outdated Delaney clause for pesticide residues is long \n     overdue. With the very limited number of legislative days \n     remaining this year, the need for action to accomplish that \n     objective is now more urgent than ever.\n       EPA recently proposed disallowing the use of five \n     pesticides on a number of crops under the Delaney Clause, \n     even though the agency has repeatedly stated its belief that \n     those pesticides pose no significant health risk to \n     consumers. By April 1997, EPA is due to determine whether to \n     disallow up to 40 additional uses; without corrective action, \n     farmers could lose the use of a number of safe and effective \n     crop protection tools that keep the American food supply \n     abundant and affordable.\n       The compromise version of ``The Food Quality Protection \n     Act'' has received bipartisan praise from both the House and \n     Senate, including Senate Agriculture Chairman Lugar, as well \n     as from EPA Administrator Carol Browner and Vice President \n     Albert Gore. Key Republican and Democratic leaders have \n     stated that it is their goal to see this legislation passed \n     and signed into law by the President this year. We urge its \n     prompt adoption by the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agricultural Council of California; Agri Bank; Agri-Mark, \n           Inc.; Agway, Inc.; American Bankers Association; \n           American Crystal Sugar Company; American Farm Bureau \n           Federation; American Meat Institute; American Feed \n           Industry Association; Apricot Producers of California; \n           Atlantic Dairy Cooperative; Biscuit & Cracker \n           Manufacturers Association; Blue Diamond Growers; \n           California Tomato Growers Association, Inc.; \n           Californian Pear Growers; Chemical Specialties \n           Manufacturers Association; Chocolate Manufacturers \n           Association; Gold Kist, Inc; Grocery Manufacturers of \n           America; GROWMARK; Harvest States; Independent Bakers \n           Association; International Apple Institute; \n           International Dairy Foods Association; Kansas Grain and \n           Feed Association; Kraft Foods, Incorporated; Land \n           O'Lakes; Michigan Agribusiness Association; Milk \n           Marketing Inc; National Agricultural Aviation \n           Association; National Cattlemen's Beef Association; \n           National Confectioners Association; National Council of \n           Farmer Cooperatives; National Farmers Union; National \n           Food Processors Association; National Grain and Feed \n           Association; National Grain Trade Council; National \n           Grange; National Grape Co-operative Association, Inc.; \n           National Pasta Association; Nebraska Cooperative \n           Council; North American Export Grain Association; \n           Oklahoma Grain and Feed Association; Produce Marketing \n           Association; Pro-Fac Cooperative; SF Services, Inc.; \n           Snack Food Association; South Dakota Association of \n           Cooperatives; Southern States Cooperative; Tortilla \n           Industry Association; USA Rice Federation; United Fresh \n           Fruit\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\n           and Vegetable Association; Upstate Milk Cooperatives, \n           Inc.; Utah Council of Farmer Cooperatives; Wisconsin \n           Agri-Service Association.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 23, 1996.\n       Dear Representative: Last week, the House Commerce \n     Committee reported by a vote of 45-0 compromise language on \n     H.R. 1627, ``The Food Quality Protection Act.'' We \n     congratulate Chairman Bliley, Chairman Bilirakis, Mr. \n     Dingell, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Waxman and many other members of \n     the House who have worked to resolve the ``Delaney paradox'' \n     and the problems it presents for farmers and consumers.\n       Although the agreement contains provisions we do not \n     support, it does address many issues which are of critical \n     importance to agriculture:\n       Safety Standard: The bill replaces the antiquated, ``zero \n     tolerance'' Delaney standard with a health-based ``safe'' \n     standard for food pesticide residues. ``Safe'' is defined as \n     ``reasonable certainly of no harm'' which is interpreted as a \n     one in a million additional lifetime risk. This is a standard \n     which is essentially the same as the ``negligible risk'' \n     standard in the original bill. This key provision removes the \n     threat of unjustified cancellation of more than 50 safe crop \n     protection products which are now jeopardized by the Delaney \n     Clause.\n       Benefits Consideration: Tolerances could be exceeded to \n     avoid a significant disruption in domestic production of an \n     adequate, wholesome and economical food supply or if the \n     pesticide protects consumers from a greater health risk. \n     Benefits consideration is broadened from current law in that \n     it is extended from raw agricultural products to include \n     processed food. However, benefits consideration is limited \n     under the agreement to 10 times a negligible risk for one \n     year or more than two times a negligible risk over a \n     lifetime. Although Farm Bureau does not support this new \n     limitation, we are pleased that the bill preserves benefits \n     consideration and extends it to processed food.\n       National Uniformity: The bill establishes national \n     uniformity for food pesticide residues. States could not \n     adopt tolerances which are more stringent than those set by \n     EPA, except with respect to tolerances established through \n     benefits consideration. In those circumstances, states would \n     be required to petition EPA and establish that there was an \n     imminent dietary risk to the public.\n       Minor Use Pesticides: It is our understanding that the \n     FIFRA provisions of H.R. 1627 which have been reported by the \n     House Agriculture Committee will be attached to the Commerce \n     Committee provisions. Included are new incentives and \n     streamlined procedures for so-called ``minor crop'' \n     chemicals--crop protection products whose relatively small \n     market does not justify the high cost of registration. This \n     provision is essential to fruit, vegetable and horticultural \n     growers in virtually every state.\n       Miscellaneous Provisions: Although we support the above \n     provisions, Farm Bureau has some concerns with certain \n     provisions of the Committee agreement. These include \n     provisions relating to estrogenic effects of agricultural \n     chemicals, infants and children, civil penalties for food \n     adulteration and a ``right to know'' provision for consumers.\n       At this time, no one can determine with certainty the long-\n     term, cumulative impact of these changes on specific \n     commodities and on the availability of crop protectants \n     necessary for farmers to produce the wide variety of safe, \n     affordable and abundant agricultural commodities that the \n     public demands. While we support many of the reforms in this \n     package, we also recognize that there will be unanticipated \n     problems stemming from regulatory and business implementation \n     of this legislation. On balance, however, we believe that \n     this legislation represents an improvement over current law \n     and we support moving the legislation to the Senate.\n                                               Richard W. Newpher,\n     Executive Director, Washington Office.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Rayburn House Office \n         Building, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The following environmental, education, \n     public health, and consumer advocacy organizations would like \n     to offer our support for the compromise substitute amendment \n     for H.R. 1627, ``The Food Quality Protection Act of 1995'' \n     that goes a long way towards better protecting the health of \n     consumers from toxic pesticides on their food.\n       The compromise addresses the deadlock between the industry \n     who oppose the Delaney clause and the organizations that \n     support better protection for children and the public health, \n     by establishing a comprehensive federal program to make \n     pesticide levels in food and the environment safe for infants \n     and children. The bill establishes a health-based standard \n     and a strict timetable for pesticide tolerance setting that \n     adheres tightly to the recommendations of the 1993 National \n     Academy of Sciences Committee on Pesticides in the Diets of \n     Infants and Children.\n       Although we are pleased with the extent to which the bill \n     was changed to better protect public health, we have \n     reservations with the sections that will allow benefits \n     consideration for cancer-causing pesticides and preemption of \n     states rights to set more protective tolerances than federal \n     limits for pesticides. We are hopeful that these provisions \n     will be revised upon further consideration of this \n     legislation.\n       Our support for this bill is contingent upon the \n     understanding that the bill will not be changed in any way \n     that would allow for a weakening of public health \n     protections.\n       Again we would like to extend our thanks and appreciation \n     to the members of Congress and their staff who played a part \n     in producing this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Preventative Medical Association; Center for \n           Science in the Public Interest; Citizen Action; \n           Environmental Working Group; National Audubon Society; \n           National Wildlife Federation; National Parent Teacher \n           Association; Natural Resources Defense Council; \n           Physicians for Social Responsibility; Public Voice; \n           World Wildlife Fund.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nAmerican Crop Protection Association Praises Comprehensive Food Safety \n                                 Action\n\n       Washington, DC, July 24, 1996.--The American Crop \n     Protection Association voiced its support of the ``Food \n     Quality Protection Act of 1996,'' a bi-partisan bill to \n     reform the nation's food safety laws that Tuesday was passed \n     by the House of Representatives 417-0.\n       Jay J. Vroom, ACPA president, said, ``The action is an \n     overwhelming affirmation of the value and benefits of modern \n     agricultural technology to the consumer, our children and the \n     American farmer. With our allies and friends across food and \n     agriculture, the crop protection industry is proud to have \n     helped lead the way for modern, science-based food safety \n     reform.''\n       The Senate is expected shortly to follow the House's lead \n     and vote to replace the 1958 Delaney clause with a single \n     safety standard for pesticide residues on both raw and \n     processed foods. Under the legislation, which was more than \n     10 years in the making, pesticides will be deemed safe when \n     they are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as \n     meeting a new, health-based safety standard, defined as a \n     ``reasonable certainty of no harm.''\n       The bill mandates implementation by the EPA of the 1993 \n     recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences for \n     providing additional safeguards for infants and children. \n     ``The Academy's recommendations have been at the heart of \n     ACPA's fight for food safety reform,'' said Vroom. ``This is \n     particularly gratifying victory for us because it assures \n     that modern, sound science will undergird our food safety \n     laws and that farmers will continue to have the tools to \n     produce the most abundant and affordable supplies of food and \n     fiber in the world.''\n       Regarding industry's relationship with the EPA, Vroom said, \n     ``We want to continue the productive working dialogue we have \n     established with the Agency during the course of negotiations \n     for this legislation. For example, one of our hopes is to \n     successfully conclude work underway by EPA, ACPA and other \n     registrant groups to provide additional user fee resources to \n     the Agency for enhancing new product application decision \n     making.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8928-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8929-S8930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 2 days ago I voted against the so \ncalled welfare reform bill which passed the Senate. I wish to explain \nmy reasons for that vote.\n  The time has come to change the Nation's welfare system. We should \nenact much-needed, workable reforms, such as requiring all able-bodied \nrecipients to work, turning welfare offices into employment offices, \nproviding adequate child care and requiring strong child support \nenforcement. While the bill just passed by the Senate achieves some of \nthese goals, it does so in a way that I believe will ultimately end up \ndoing more harm than good. And the damage will be done not only to \ninnocent children but to State and local governments and to taxpayers, \nwho may end up bearing even more of the burden than they currently do.\n  Last fall, I voted for welfare reform legislation in the expectation \nthat we could develop a better bill. A good bill would encourage adults \nto work without threatening the well-being of children or unduly \nburdening the States that need welfare assistance most. It would enable \nflexible planning at the State and local levels, without dismantling \nthe social safety net.\n  Unfortunately, the highly political environment in which we find \nourselves has not permitted the development of such a bill. The forces \nof reaction in our country have persuaded many that the main cause of \nour problems is welfare cheats and the current election campaign has \nspawned a competition between politicians to prove their machismo by \ngetting tough.\n  The conference report that emerged on HR4 last fall was a worse bill \nthan what the Senate had previously passed.\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nI joined over a quarter of the Senate who voted for the Senate welfare \nreform bill but rejected the changes made in the conference report. I \nsaid then that we should not trade in an admittedly imperfect system \nfor one that is certainly not better, and perhaps may prove much worse. \nThe same is true today.\n  I have been persuaded by the process of debate and projections on the \nlikely impact of this bill on my State that this welfare bill will do \nfar more harm than good. It will cause hardship to State and local \ngovernments, throw more than a million more children into poverty and \nhurt rather than help the Nation's efforts at true welfare reform.\n  The bill will clearly increase the burden on States and local \ngovernments. Poor States will, as always, be particularly hard hit. For \nexample, the bill requires progressively more hours of work, from a \ngreater percent of each State's case load every year, with States \nlosing cumulatively more funding each year they fail to hit their \ntargets. While I am a strong proponent of work requirements as an \nintegral part of welfare reform, I am skeptical of this approach. And I \nam not alone. The National Governors' Association [NGA] feels it will \nbe very hard to meet these targets, especially because the bill allows \nfew exemptions for those who will have the hardest time finding work. \nAnd if a State fails to meet these difficult targets they lose funding \nfor the next year's program. The irony of this penalty is that the \npunishment assures that the violation will occur again and again, as a \nState has less and less Federal money each year to try and meet their \nemployment targets. This leaves states with two choices--use state and \nlocal funds for education, training, and child care, or throw more \npeople off the roles so it will be easier to hit their percentage \ntargets.\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that, over 6 \nyears, this bill falls $12 billion short of the funding needed to meet \nthe work requirements of this legislation, and about $2.4 billion short \nin child care resources. New Mexico is particularly at risk if this \nbill does not live up to its promise. It is one of the few States in \nwhich the welfare caseload is currently increasing, even though the \nbenefits paid are below the national average. Who will be forced to \npick up the shortfall? State and local governments will.\n  Further, last year in New Mexico, 239,000 recipients in 87,000 \nhouseholds relied on food stamps. About $28 billion in savings realized \nby this bill will be in food stamps. Such cuts to funding benefits \nerode the integrity of the safety net. I say again that we are trading \nin an imperfect system for one that may prove much worse.\n  Legal immigrants are clearly among those who will be hurt by passage \nof this bill. I support the immigration bill now in Congress and its \neffort to make immigrants and their sponsors responsible for \nimmigrants' welfare. But this bill goes far beyond those provisions. \nThere are over 3,000 aged or disabled legal immigrants receiving SSI \nbenefits in New Mexico who may abruptly be cut off if this bill becomes \nlaw, and thousands more immigrants who have no sponsor for any number \nof reasons who may also lose benefits under this bill.\n  In the course of this debate, the Senate rejected an amendment that \nwould have permitted States to use funds from their Federal block grant \nto offer vouchers to maintain basic non-cash benefits such as food, \nclothing, and shelter for children if their parents' benefits expire \nafter 5 years. The refusal of the Senate to allow States to provide \nsuch vouchers will hurt New Mexico, where one third of the children \nless than 6 years old--almost 50,000--live in families with incomes \nbelow the poverty level.\n  Ours is a great Nation, enjoying low unemployment and real \nprosperity. Our common goal is to ensure that all Americans willing to \nwork hard have the opportunity to share that prosperity. We all want to \neliminate public assistance as a way of life while preserving temporary \nprotections for those truly in need of help. But we must figure out a \nway to do this without denying the basic needs of innocent children for \nfood, clothing, and shelter, and without driving State and local \ngovernments further into debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8929-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       The President shall submit to the Congress, not later than \n     18 months after the date\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n     of the enactment of this Act, a report on the trade relations \n     between the United States and Cambodia pursuant to the trade \n     agreement described in section 2(b).\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the full Senate \nwill soon approve H.R. 1642, a bill to grant MFN to Cambodia. I would \nlike to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his help in \nseeing it through. He promised to do so last October and has been true \nto his word. My hope now is that the other body will quickly approve \nthe minor alterations in the findings and send the bill to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Traditionally, we have only restricted trade with Communist \ncountries, and since 1975, only select Communist countries which \nprevent the free emigration of their people. The only other countries \nwith restricted access to the American market are proven international \naggressors and terrorist nations such as Iran and Iraq. Cambodia is no \nlonger Communist and it does not restrict the free emigration of its \npeople. It is certainly not in the category of rogue nations. I think \nthe committee and the Senate has acted appropriately not to impose \nrestrictions on Cambodia more appropriate for other eras and other \nnations.\n  Although it did not change the real substance of the bill, the \ncommittee did alter the findings. I would not have done so--not because \nI do not share Senator Roth's concerns or the other concerns raised in \nthe findings already approved by the other body. I do share concerns \nabout the development of Cambodian democracy, government corruption, an \nhuman rights abuses. I encouraged the committee not to amend the bill \nprincipally because I thought it should be sent to the President as \nquickly as possible.\n  I should point out to my friends in Cambodia that they would do very \nwell to heed the concerns expressed in the findings of this bill and in \nthe accompanying report. They are the same concerns which led to the \nadoption in the other body of H. Res. 345. Those who pay close \nattention to Cambodia have been concerned about the direction of \nCambodian politics. It is true that the Cambodian people have a freely \nelected government, freedom of speech and freedom of association. It is \nalso true, however, that each of these democratic institutions has at \none time or another come under attack from the coalition government.\n  The Senate is today approving unconditional most-favored-nation \nstatus for Cambodia. It is only fair that it do so. But the Cambodia \nGovernment should be under no illusions. Granting MFN to Cambodia \nshould not be interpreted as disinterest in the course of Cambodian \ndemocracy. The United States Senate is committed to helping democracy \nand human rights to flourish in Cambodia. Our efforts will not end with \nthis vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1642), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8930-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8931-S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall become \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1784, The \nSmall Business Investment Company Improvement Act of 1996. This bill \nproposes numerous changes to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 \ndesigned to improve, strengthen, and expand the availability of \ninvestment capital under the Small Business Administrations's Small \nBusiness Investment Company (SBIC) program.\n  S. 1784 builds on the improvements of the SBIC program contained in \nthe law passed by Congress in 1992 by making the following changes to \nreduce the risk of SBIC defaults and losses to the Federal government:\n  1. Increases the level of private capital needed to obtain an SBIC \nlicense from SBA.\n  2. Requires experienced and qualified management for all SBICs.\n  3. Requires diversification between investors and the management \nteam.\n  In addition, S. 1784 makes these important changes to the Small \nBusiness Investment Act to increase the availability of investment \ncapital to small businesses:\n  1. Increases fees paid by SBICs which reduces the credit subsidy \nrate.\n  2. Eliminates the distinction between SBICs and SSBICs, while \ngrandfathering'' successful SSBICs into the new program.\n  3. Places a greater emphasis on SBIC investments in smaller \nenterprises or smaller small businesses.\n  In 1958, Congress first approved the Small Business Investment Act \ncreating Small Business Investment Companies, which are private \ninvestment companies licensed by SBA, whose sole activity is to make \ninvestments in small businesses. An SBIC raises private capital which \nis matched by additional funds guaranteed by SBA. The\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nprivate capital and SBA-guaranteed funds are invested by SBICs in small \nbusinesses.\n  SBICs fill a void that is not addressed by private venture capital \nfirms, most of which are so large they are usually unwilling to make \ninvestments in smaller firms, which generally seek investments in the \nrange of $500,000 to $2.5 million each. Since the beginning of the SBIC \nprogram, nearly $12 billion has been invested in approximately 77,000 \nsmall businesses. Some SBICs make equity investments in small \nbusinesses, while others make long-term loans, which are frequently \ncoupled with rights to purchase an equity interest in the company, \nsometimes called warrants''. The lending-type'' or debenture SBICs \nprovide long-term financing that is generally not available from banks \nor private venture capital firms.\n  Today, there are 185 active regular SBICs and 89 Specialized SBICs \n(SSBICs) in the SBIC program. SSBICs invest only in minority owned and \ncontrolled businesses. Together, these SBICs and SSBICs have raised \nnearly $4 billion in private capital and have received $1.02 billion in \nSBA-guaranteed funds.\n  Today's SBIC program has been shaped in large part by the Small \nBusiness Equity Enhancement Act of 1992. The genesis of this important \nlegislation resulted from the hard work of SBA's Investment Capital \nAdvisory Council, a public-private working group formed in 1991 to \naddress the problems confronting the SBIC program. The 1992 Act \nproduced the first major change in the SBIC program since it's \nformation in 1958. It created the Participating Security program, which \nincorporates some of the best practices of the private venture capital \nindustry. The 1992 act came about in response to the persistence of my \ngood friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, who as \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business held a series of hearings \nfocusing attention on the problems under the program. The result of the \nAct was to strengthen the SBIC program and to correct serious \nweaknesses that had been exposed by well publicized problems of the \npast.\n\n  Since the 1992 Act became law, more than 30 new participating \nsecurity SBICs with nearly $500 million in private capital have been \nlicensed by SBA, and 17 new SBICs with over $200 million of private \ncapital have been licensed as debenture SBICs.\n  There is a significant difference between the SBICs licensed before \nthe 1992 Act and the SBICs licensed under the more strict guidelines \nset forth under the 1992 Act. While the 1992 Act increased the minimum \nprivate capital threshold for licensing to $2.5 million for each \ndebenture SBIC and $5 million for each new participating security SBIC, \nSBA has imposed even more strict standards in its regulations. Under \nthe SBA rules, debenture SBICs must have a minimum of $5 million in \nprivate capital and participating security SBICs must have $10 million \nin private capital.\n  Since the 1992 Act has created two distinct types of SBICs, it allows \nfor investments to be tailored to meet the needs of small businesses. \nFor example, when a small business needs a loan and can meet projected \ninterest payments, the traditional lending-type or debenture SBICs are \navailable to make debt investments. For small businesses that need non-\ninterest bearing investment capital, the participating security SBICs \ncan offer an equity-type investment which anticipates an extended \nperiod of time, such as two to three years, before the small business \nis expected to begin repayment of this investment. In this latter case, \ninterest payments are deferred until the investments begin to generate \na positive return. Under the Participating Security program, the \nFederal government's return is not limited to repayment of principal \nand interest--it can also share in the profits of the SBIC.\n  During this Congress, I have chaired three hearings investigating the \nsuccess and problems associated with the SBIC program. Testimony before \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business has been supportive and \npositive. Numerous small business entrepreneurs have testified about \ntheir inability to obtain investment capital from banks and other \ntraditional investment sources, and SBICs are frequently their only \nsource of investment capital. Last year, Jerry Johnson, the Chief \nExecutive Officer of Williams Brothers Lumber Co. located near Atlanta, \ntestified that not one bank in the Atlanta area would speak with him \nabout asset-based lending. After a lengthy search, he and his partner \nturned to Allied Capital Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based SBIC. Within \n60 days of their first contact with Allied Capital Corp., Mr. Johnson \nwas able to conclude his financing arrangement. Being able to clear \nthis financing hurdle with the help of an SBIC, Mr. Johnson's company \nhas grown significantly, adding many new employees and increasing its \ntax base.\n  Often, we hear about major success stories like Federal Express and \nthe Callaway golf club co. that received SBIC funding at critical times \nin their early growth stages. It is, however, far more likely that \nbusinesses like the Williams Brothers Lumber Co. will be the typical \nbeneficiaries of the SBIC program. These are ``Main Street'' \nenterprises located across America who have looked to traditional money \nsources and been turned away. The SBIC program is filling this niche--a \nlarge niche to say the least--that picks up where banks fear to tread \nand Wall Street is not interested because the investment size is too \nsmall. There are thousands of companies like Williams Brothers Lumber \nCompany across the country that need investment financing to support \ngrowth and new jobs and have nowhere to turn but to the SBIC program to \nmeet their demand for capital.\n\n  During the past year, the Committee on Small Business has received a \ngreat deal of information about the need to strengthen the SBIC \nprogram. In July 1995, Patricia Cloherty, Chair of SBA's private sector \nSBIC Reinvention Council, testified on the Council's recommendations to \nstrengthen and expand the program. In addition, last summer the \nNational Association of Investment Companies forwarded to the Committee \non Small Business a copy of their recommendations to improve the SSBIC \nprogram, which was also submitted to SBA's SSBIC Advisory Council.\n  The involvement of the private sector in analyzing the performance of \nthe SBIC program and the insight provided by these recommendations are \ncommendable - and very helpful to this Committee. In 1995, the SBIC \nReinvention Council recommended that new fees be imposed to lower the \ncredit subsidy rate so that the program can provide a significant \nincrease in leverage to licensed SBICs. It also recommended certain \nadministrative changes to improve the management and operations of the \nSBIC program.\n  The National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), which \nrepresents SSBICs, also recommended in 1995 that all statutory and \nregulatory distinctions between SBICs and SSBICs be eliminated, \nincluding the deletion of all references to social or economic \ndisadvantage'' from the Small Business Investment Act. NAIC proposed \ncreating a single, combined SBIC program that would retain an important \nfocus on investments in small business at the smaller end of the \neligible size standards. They recommended sensible improvements to make \nmore investment capital available to more small businesses and proposed \nto remove the current restrictions that prohibit Specialized SBICs from \ninvesting in companies not owned by socially or economically \ndisadvantaged persons. S. 1784 includes many of their recommendations.\n\n\n                           NEW FEES FOR SBICs\n\n  The President's FY 1997 budget request included a recommendation that \nfees paid by SBICs be increased to finance a significant reduction in \nthe credit subsidy rate. The Office of Management and Budget, \nrecognizing the positive effect of some of the regulatory changes \nalready implemented by SBA, now is using a lower projected default \nrate, thereby reducing the credit subsidy rate for debenture and \nparticipating security licensees under the SBIC program.\n  The Administration's recommendation to lower the credit subsidy rate \nby increasing fees is similar to one made last year in their amended FY \n1996 budget request for the 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program. \nAccompanying their request for a fee increase were statements by SBA \nabout how well the 7(a) program was performing.\n  What happened following SBA's positive predictions for the 7(a) \nprogram\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nhas been alarming. Based in part on SBA's glowing report card on the \n7(a) program, Congress passed legislation to raise fees and lower the \nsubsidy rates of the program. The changes became law in October 1995, \nwhich is about the same time SBA and OMB were beginning to work on \ntheir most recent budget request which raises the 7(a) credit subsidy \nrate by 150% and the cost of the program by $180 million. This higher \ncost is the direct result of greater losses from loan defaults and \nlower recoveries from liquidations.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I believe it \nis prudent for Congress to take steps so that we do not allow a repeat \nof the 7(a) problem with the SBIC program. Based on our experience last \nyear, Congress should not approve any decrease in the credit subsidy \nrate through the increase of fees without taking some corresponding \nsteps to strengthen the safety and soundness of the SBIC program.\n\n\n                          SBICs IN LIQUIDATION\n\n  In addition, evidence before the Committee on Small Business about \nthe failure of SBA to maximize its recoveries from failed SBICs is \nalarming. SBA acknowledges there are assets with a value of \napproximately $500 million tied up with SBICs in liquidation. To make \nthis situation even more alarming, many of these failed SBICs have been \nin liquidation for over ten years, including one that was transferred \ninto liquidation on January 5, 1967.\n  S. 1784 directs SBA to submit to the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business, no later than October 15, 1996, a detailed plan to \nexpedite the orderly liquidation of all licensee assets in liquidation. \nThis plan should include a timetable for liquidating the liquidation \nportfolio of assets owned by SBA.\n  In addition, SBA needs to take a hard look at how it manages failed \nSBICs that are in receivership. It is not a sufficient explanation for \nSBA to claim it is at the mercy of the court system in winding up the \naffairs of SBICs in receivership. In each case, the court acts in \nresponse to SBA's petition, has named SBA the receiver, and SBA has \nretained independent contractors to act as principal agents for the \nreceivership. These principal agents are paid hourly and appear to have \nlittle or no incentive to wind up the affairs of an SBIC. In fact, the \nopposite is true, and the real incentive appears to be to drag out the \nreceivership as long as possible. Based on SBA replies to requests for \ninformation from the Committee on Small Business, we have learned that \nthese principal receivers agents bill significant hours each year. In \nFY 1995, one principal agent billed over 3,200 hours for one year, the \nequivalent of over 8 hours per day for 365 days. Other principal agents \nbilled over 2,500 hours each for FY 1995.\n  At the time of the Committee's inquiry into these billing practices, \nSBA gave no indication that it felt they were unusual. It is clear to \nme that without incentives to complete action on these SBICs in \nreceivership, the current system used by SBA will allow these abuses to \ncontinue. Although the Committee did not reach a consensus on my \nproposal to create an incentive based system to improve recoveries from \nSBICs in receivership, we will continue to monitor SBA's performance \nclosely in this area.\n  For several months starting late last year, the Committee worked on \ndraft legislation to strengthen and enhance the SBIC program. S. 1784, \nthe Small Business Investment Company Improvement Act of 1996, is the \nresult. It incorporates recommendations from SBA's SBIC Reinvention \nCouncil, the National Association of Investment Companies, the National \nAssociation of Small Business Investment Companies, and the President's \nFY 1997 budget request.\n  S. 1784 was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business by a \nunanimous 18-0 vote. It makes substantial progress toward our goal of \nstrengthening the SBIC program, while allowing the program to expand, \nproviding more investment capital to small businesses as the cost and \nrisk to the government declines. It was only after nearly 18 months of \nstudy and investigation that we were able to produce such a bill. S. \n1784 is sound legislation that improves the safety and soundness of the \nSBIC program and makes more investment capital available to small \nbusinesses. And it accomplishes all of these goals while reducing the \nrisk of loss to the government. It is for these reasons that I \nrecommend to my colleagues that they vote in favor of S. 1784.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-By-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Investment \n     Company Improvement Act of 1996''.\n\n\n                         section 2. definitions\n\n       The definition of ``small business concern'' is amended to \n     make clear that investments from venture capital firms or \n     pension plans in small businesses do not affect the small \n     business' size standard as set forth under the Small Business \n     Act.\n       A new term, ``smaller enterprise'' is included in the Act. \n     A smaller enterprise is a business with net financial worth \n     no greater than $6 million and an average net income of no \n     more than $2 million.\n       ``Qualified non-private funds'' are defined as funds \n     invested by state or local governments in SSBIC's. The bill \n     limits the amount of qualified private, non-private funds \n     that can be included in the private capital of an SBIC. No \n     more than 20% of private capital can be qualified non-private \n     funds invested on or after June 30, 1996. 33% of private \n     capital can be from these funds if invested prior to June 30, \n     1996.\n       For the first time, the Small Business Investment Act is \n     amended to include ``limited liability company'' as the one \n     of the business entities that can qualify to be an SBIC. \n     Current statute allows corporations and partnerships to be \n     SBICs. The ``limited liability company'' is a relatively new \n     business entity that is being organized for raising venture \n     capital.\n\n\n     section 3. organization of small business investment companies\n\n       This bill includes provisions to speed up the processing of \n     applications from business entities who want to be licensed \n     by SBA as an SBIC. It requires SBA to provide the applicant \n     with a written report detailing status of the application \n     within 90 days of receipt of the application. In addition it \n     states that no application can be denied because Congress has \n     not appropriated sufficient funds to meet leverage demands.\n       This bill also permits SBA to approve a new license \n     applicant which has not less than $3 million in private \n     capital so long as the applicant meets all other licensing \n     requirements. Once approved as a licensee, however, the SBIC \n     would not be eligible for leverage until its private capital \n     reaches $5 million.\n       Section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Company Act \n     of 1958 is repealed.\n\n\n                    section 4. capital requirements\n\n       Under this bill, the minimum capital requirements for new \n     license applicants is increased. To be a debenture licensee, \n     new applicants must have $5 million in private capital. To be \n     a participating security licensee, new applicants must have \n     $10 million in private capital; however, SBA is given the \n     discretion to approve a participating security applicant if \n     it has less than $10 million but more than $5 million so long \n     as SBA determines that approval of that applicant would not \n     create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of \n     default or loss to the federal government.\n       This bill also grandfathers existing licensees in the \n     program and includes provisions under which they will be \n     exempt from the increased capital requirement. Licensees with \n     a record of regulatory compliance and profitable operations \n     will continue to be eligible for leverage, based upon the \n     exercise of SBA discretion. Any licensee which continues to \n     receive leverage under this exemption must certify that 50% \n     of its aggregate dollar investments are going to smaller \n     enterprises.\n       The bill directs SBA to ensure that each licensee licensed \n     after enactment of this bill maintains diversification \n     between the management and ownership of the licensee. This is \n     a safety and soundness measure design to maintain \n     independence and objectivity in the financial management and \n     oversight of the investment and operations of the SBIC.\n\n\n                          section 5. borrowing\n\n       This provision requires SBA to regulate SBICs closely to \n     ensure that they do not incur excessive third party debt \n     which would create or contribute to an unreasonable risk of \n     default or loss to federal government. In addition, this \n     provision requires that each SBIC, regardless of its size, \n     invest at least 20% of its aggregate dollar investments in \n     smaller enterprises.\n       This section also requires SBA to ensure that no SBIC \n     receives leverage when it is under capital impairment. This \n     will be a judgment call by SBA which will take in to \n     consideration the nature of assets of the SBIC and the amount \n     and terms of any third party debt owed by the SBIC.\n       This section also includes two increases in fees to be paid \n     by SBICs to SBA. First, SBICs would pay an annual charge of \n     50 basis point on the value of all outstanding leverage \n     granted after the effective date. In addition, the non-\n     refundable up-front fee which is currently 2% would be \n     increased to 3% of new leverage amounts.\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\n               section 6. liability of the united states\n\n       This section restates and clarifies the limits of liability \n     on SBA under this program.\n\n\n                  section 7, examinations; valuations\n\n       This is a section designed to improve the examination and \n     oversight function of SBA to enhance the safety and soundness \n     of the program. It requires each SBIC to adopt \n     valuation criteria set forth by SBA to be used for \n     establishing the values of loans and investments of each \n     SBIC. This section requires that an independent certified \n     accountant approved by SBA review these valuations at \n     least once a year to ensure that these requirements are \n     being met.\n\n\n           section 8. trustee or receivership over licensees\n\n       This section states that it is the finding of the Congress \n     that increased recoveries of assets in liquidation under the \n     SBIC program are in the best interest of the Federal \n     Government. Not later than October 15, 1996, SBA is directed \n     to submit to the Senate and House Committees on Small \n     Business a detailed plan to expedite the orderly liquidation \n     of all licensee assets in liquidation. This plan in to \n     include a timetable for liquidating the liquidation portfolio \n     of assets owned by SBA.\n\n\n                   section 9. book entry registration\n\n       This section permits the use of electronic means for \n     registration of trust certificates.\n\n\n            section 10. technical and conforming amendments\n\n       An SBIC preferred stock buy back program was authorized by \n     Congress effective November 1, 1989. This bill directs that \n     any monies received by SBA under this repurchase program \n     shall be used solely to guarantee debenture leverage for \n     SBICs that maintain an investment protfolio with 50% of its \n     investments in smaller enterprises.\n\n\n              section 11. authorization of appropriations\n\n       This section increases the authorization for debenture \n     leverage from $200 million to $300 million for FY 1997.\n\n\n                       section 12. effective date\n\n       This Act and any amendments will become effective on the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n section 13. extension of small business competitiveness demonstration \n                                program\n\n       This section provides for a one year extension of the Small \n     Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act, which \n     would otherwise expire on September 30, 1996.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5090\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment at \nthe desk offered by Senators Bond and Bumpers. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for Mr. Bond, for \n     himself, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered \n     5090.\n       On page 49, line 4, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC 13, EXTENSION OF SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS \n                   DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM\n\n       Section 711(c) of the Small Business Competitiveness \n     Demonstration Program Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 644 note) is \n     amended by striking ``September 30, 1996'' and inserting \n     ``September 30, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nthe False Statements Penalty Restoration Act so quickly after the \nsubstitute was reported by the Judiciary Committee. This is important \nlegislation to safeguard the constitutional legislative and oversight \nroles of the Congress.\n  Last year, overturning a decision it had rendered in 1955, the \nSupreme Court of the United States held in Hubbard versus United States \nthat section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, the section of \nthe Federal criminal code prohibiting false statements, only covered \nfalse statements made to executive branch agencies. That decision put \nat grave risk the ability of Congress to collect correct information, \nas false statements to Congress could no longer be punished. \nCongressional oversight and investigations would clearly be threatened \nif those interviewed could lie with impunity. Simple requests for \ninformation by Congress, its committees and subcommittees, or its \noffices, could be met with lies. Investigations by the General \nAccounting Office could likewise be stonewalled by witnesses providing \nfalse information.\n  Within days of the Hubbard decision, I had introduced S. 830 to \noverturn that decision. Earlier this year, I introduced revised \nlegislation, S. 1734, joined by Senator Levin. Joining us in \nintroducing this important bill were Senators Stevens, Nunn, Cohen, \nLeahy, Jeffords, Inouye, and Kohl. Subsequently, both Senators Roth and \nGrassley became cosponsors. The broad bipartisan cosponsorship of this \nbill by some of the Senate's leading investigators and practitioners of \noversight is testimony to the threat posed by Hubbard to our ability to \nconduct our constitutional responsibilities.\n  This bill is needed not simply for the practical reasons I have \nbriefly outlined, but because it is important to make it clear that \nintentional false statements to Congress are just as pernicious as \nthose made to an agent of the executive branch. We are of equal \nstanding with the executive and the dignitary injury to the standing of \nCongress done by Hubbard must be overturned promptly.\n  Support for this bill comes not only from many of our colleagues. The \nJustice Department has been very supportive and quite helpful in \ncrafting several of the bill's provisions. The Judiciary Committee \nheard from Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt in support of \nextending the coverage of section 1001 to Congress and the courts. I am \ngrateful to the Criminal Division and the Office of Legal Counsel of \nthe Justice Department for their assistance and insight in crafting the \nprovisions of this bill, especially parts of section 2 and section 4.\n  The bill contains four substantive provisions, which I would like to \nsummarize and briefly explain to my colleagues, so that they may fully \nunderstand the impact of this bill.\n  First is the provision to amend section 1001 of title 18 of the \nUnited States Code to prohibit false statements to executive agencies \nand departments, Congress, and the Federal courts. This provision is \ncentral to this bill. It is intended to restore section 1001 to its \npre-Hubbard status. Any knowing and willful false statement that is \nmaterial which is made to Congress, including any committee or \nsubcommittee, staff of any member or committee or subcommittee acting \nin their official capacity, or any component or office of Congress \nshall be punishable under section 1001. For 40 years, this was the law \nof the land and there was no abuse. There is no evidence that between \n1955 and 1995, the rights of individuals to provide information to \nCongress, to petition Congress, or to testify before Congress were \nchilled because of the application of section 1001 to false statements \nmade to Congress. My research finds no prosecutions of any constituent, \nfor example, furnishing false information to a Member of Congress. \nThus, the bill does not contain any exceptions to the general rule that \nany knowing, willful, and material false statement to Congress will be \npunishable under section 1001.\n\n  The bill also prohibits false statements made to the Federal courts. \nPrior to Hubbard, the Federal courts had created a ``judicial \nfunction'' exception to section 1001 to carve out from the coverage of \nthe law false statements made in the course of advocacy before a court. \nIn order to capture the pre-Hubbard application of section 1001, this \nbill will codify for the first time a judicial function exception to \nsection 1001. The language of the exception was suggested by the \nJustice Department, although it contains an additional limitation on \nwhich I insisted, which was to limit the application of the exception \nto false statements made to a judge in the performance of an \nadjudicative function.\n  The bill will exempt from the coverage of section 1001, any statement \nmade by a party to litigation or anyone seeking to become a party, or \ntheir counsel, to a judge acting in an adjudicative capacity. In \ngeneral, the only individuals making statements in court are witnesses, \nwho are already under oath and thereby subject to prosecution for \nperjury, and parties and their counsel. Knowing, willful and material \nfalse statements made by parties or their counsel ought to be exempt \nfor several reasons. First, we do not want to chill committed advocacy \nin court on behalf of any party. Our adversary system requires \nunfettered advocacy, which application of section 1001 could chill. In \naddition, our adversary system means that there is an opponent who\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\ncan call a false statement to the court's attention, supplying a \nnecessary antidote. That is not the case in congressional hearings, \nduring which there may not be anyone to point out and correct false \nstatements. Thus, a similar exemption is not warranted for \ncongressional proceedings. Finally, courts retain adequate alternatives \nto punish and deter false statements, including the contempt power and \nlesser sanctions provided for in the Federal Rules of Civil and \nCriminal Procedure and in the courts' inherent power. Congress lacks \nthese alternative sanctions, which is yet another reason for not \nincluding a similar exemption for congressional proceedings.\n\n  The judicial function exception applies only to false statements made \nto a judge exercising its adjudicative authority, and not when it is \nexercising administrative authority. For example, the submission of a \nfalse bill to a judge by a lawyer for payment under the Criminal \nJustice Act would be punishable under the revised section 1001, because \nthe false statement would not be made to the court in its adjudicative \nfunction. Also punishable would be applications for membership in the \nbar of a particular Federal court. The reason for the distinction is \nthat many of the safeguards derived from the adversarial system that \nmight call the false statement to the judge's attention are not \npresent, warranting application of section 1001.\n  The next three sections of the bill are derived from legislation \nintroduced by Senators Levin, Nunn, and Inouye. Two of them passed the \nSenate in 1988 but were not enacted.\n  Section three of the bill will overturn a 1991 decision of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United \nStates versus Poindexter. In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that the \nstatute prohibiting obstruction of Congress applies only to persons who \nattempt to obstruct a congressional inquiry indirectly through another \nperson, and not to witnesses themselves. The bill would overturn this \ndecision and clarify that an individual acting alone could be liable \nfor obstructing Congress.\n  The next section of the bill is intended to clarify when the Senate \nmay enforce a subpoena against an officer or employee of the executive \nbranch who asserts a privilege in response to a Senate subpoena. The \nintent is to make it clear that judicial enforcement is available when \na person is asserting a privilege personal to him or her, but not when \nthe person is asserting a governmental privilege available only to the \nexecutive branch. When a private person asserts a privilege, section \n1365 of title 28 of the United States Code allows the Senate to go to \ncourt to seek to compel responses. The section does apply to any action \nto enforce a subpoena against an executive branch employee who declines \nto testify by asserting a governmental privilege. The purpose is to \nkeep disputes between the executive and legislative branches out of the \ncourtroom.\n  In order to clarify whether the privilege asserted does in fact \nbelong to the government, thus rendering section 1365 inapplicable, or \nis instead a personal privilege, the bill will revise section 1365 to \nrequire that any governmental privilege asserted must be authorized by \nthe executive branch. It is the sponsors' intention, worked out with \nthe Justice Department, to ensure the utmost flexibility in \nestablishing the valid assertion of a governmental privilege. No \nparticular form is required; it simply must be clear that the executive \nhas authorized the assertion of the privilege. In addition, the \nlanguage of the provision demonstrates our intention that the person \nasserting the privilege will bear the burden in a judicial proceeding \nunder section 1365 of proving that he or she was in fact authorized to \nassert a governmental privilege. This change will prevent rogue \nemployees from falsely asserting a privilege and escaping efforts to \ncompel responses.\n\n  Finally, the bill amends section 6005 of title 18 to authorize \nCongress to compel testimony under oath from an immunized witness in a \ndeposition. This change will enable Members and their staff to more \nreadily conduct preliminary investigations as part of congressional \ninquiries.\n  I want to thank the cosponsors of this bill for their assistance, \nparticularly Senator Levin and Elise Bean of his staff; the chairman \nand ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch  and \nBiden, and their staff, especially Paul Larkin and Michael Kennedy of \nthe majority and Peter Jaffe of the minority staff; the Department of \nJustice; and the Senate Legal Counsel, Thomas B. Griffith, and his \ndeputy, Morgan Frankel, for their assistance.\n  I look forward to resolving any differences with the House bill \npromptly so that this important bill can be enacted before the close of \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as a sponsor of S. 1734, the False \nStatements Penalty Restoration Act, I am pleased to join Senator \nSpecter in urging Senate passage of H.R. 3166, the House companion \nlegislation with a Specter-Levin substitute amendment which is the \nSenate text; this legislation is to restore criminal penalties for \nknowing, willful, material false statements made to a federal court or \nCongress.\n  Forty years ago, in 1955, the Supreme Court interpreted 18 U.S.C. \n1001 to prohibit knowing, willful, material false statements not only \nto the executive branch, but also to the judicial and legislative \nbranches. For 40 years, this government-wide prohibition was the law of \nthe land, and it served this country well. But last year, in Hubbard v. \nUnited States, the Supreme Court reversed these 40 years of precedent \nand held that Section 1001 prohibits false statements only to the \nexecutive branch, and not to any co-equal branch.\n  The Supreme Court based its decision on the wording of the statute \nwhich doesn't explicitly reference either the courts or Congress. The \nCourt noted in Hubbard that it had failed to find in the statute's \nlegislative history ``any indication that Congress even considered \nwhether [Section 1001] might apply outside the Executive Branch.'' \n[Emphasis in original.]\n  The obvious result of the Hubbard decision has been to reduce parity \namong the three branches. And the new interbranch distinctions are \ndifficult to justify, since there is no logical reason why the criminal \nstatus of a willful, material false statement should depend upon which \nbranch of the Federal Government received it.\n  Fortunately, this problem does not involve constitutional issues or \nrequire complex legislation. It is simply a matter of inserting a clear \nstatutory reference in Section 1001 to all three branches of \ngovernment.\n  Senator Specter and I each introduced bills last year to supply that \nmissing statutory reference. This year, we decided to join forces, \nalong with a number of our colleagues, and introduce a single bill to \nrestore parity among the branches. We also worked closely with the \nJustice Department to produce a bill that the administration would \nsupport. It is this bipartisan bill, which the Judiciary Committee has \napproved with unanimous support, that is before you today.\n\n  The bill contains four provisions, each of which would strengthen the \nability of Congress to conduct its legislative, investigative and \noversight functions, as well as to restore parity among the three \nbranches of Government.\n  The first provision would amend section 1001 to make it clear that \nits prohibition against willful, material false statements applies \ngovernment-wide to all three branches. The purpose of this provision is \nessentially to restore the status quo prior to Hubbard.\n  As part of that restorative effort, the bill includes a provision \ncodifying a long-standing judicial branch exception, developed in case \nlaw, to exempt from Section 1001 statements made during adjudicative \nproceedings in a courtroom, in order to ensure vigorous advocacy. The \nclassic example justifying this exception has been to ensure that a \ncriminal defendant pleading ``not guilty'' to an indictment does not \nrisk prosecution under Section 1001.\n  The wording of this exception includes suggestions from the Justice \nDepartment and Judiciary Committee to clarify its scope and provide \nadequate notice of the conduct covered. The exception is limited, for \nexample, to parties to a judicial proceeding, persons seeking to become \nparties, and their legal counsel. It is also limited to statements made \nto a judge performing an adjudicative function.\n  The second provision of S. 1734 would strengthen the 50-year-old \nstatute that prohibits obstruction of Congressional\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\ninvestigations, 18 U.S.C. 1505, which has also been weakened by a court \ncase. In 1991, in a dramatic departure from other circuits, the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals held in United States v. Poindexter that the \nstatute's prohibition against corruptly obstructing a Congressional \ninquiry was unconstitutionally vague and failed to provide clear notice \nthat it prohibited an individual's lying to Congress. The court held \nthat, at most, the statute prohibited one person from inducing another \nperson to lie or otherwise obstruct Congress.\n  The Senate bill would affirm instead the views held by the other \ncircuits and bring the Congressional statute back into line with other \nFederal obstruction statutes, by making it clear that Section 1505 \nprohibits obstructive acts by a person acting alone as well as when \ninducing another to act. The bill would also make it clear that the \nprohibition against obstructing Congress bars a person from making \nfalse or misleading statements and from withholding, concealing, \naltering or destroying documents requested by Congress. The bill would, \nin short, restore the strength and usefulness of the Congressional \nobstruction statute as well as restore its parity with other \nobstruction statutes protecting federal investigations.\n\n  The final two sections of the bill would clarify the ability of \nCongress to compel testimony and documents. Both provisions are taken \nfrom a 1988 bill, S. 2350, sponsored by then Senator Rudman and \ncosponsored by Senator Inouye, which passed the Senate unanimously but \nwas never enacted into law.\n  The first of these two provisions would clarify when Congress may \nobtain judicial enforcement of a Senate subpoena under 28 U.S.C. 1365. \nSection 1365 generally authorizes judicial enforcement of a Senate \nsubpoena, except when a subpoena has been issued to an executive branch \nofficial acting in his or her official capacity--an exception that \nseeks to keep interbranch disputes out of the courtroom. S. 1734 would \nnot eliminate or restrict this exception, but would make it clear that \nthe exception applies only to an executive branch official asserting a \ngovernmental privilege that he or she has been authorized to assert. \nThe bill would make it clear that an executive branch official \nasserting a personal privilege or asserting a governmental privilege \nwithout being authorized to do so could not automatically escape \njudicial enforcement of the Senate subpoena under Section 1365.\n  This provision, revised from the bill as introduced, includes \nsuggestions from the Justice Department to make it clear that an \nofficial can establish in several ways that he or she has been \nauthorized to assert a governmental privilege including, for example, \nby providing a letter or affidavit from an appropriate senior \ngovernment official. The provision is also intended to make it clear \nthat the person resisting compliance with the Senate subpoena has the \nburden of proving that his or her action had, in fact, been authorized \nby the executive branch.\n  The fourth and final provision involves individuals given immunity \nfrom criminal prosecution by Congress. The bill would re-word the \nCongressional immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. 6005, to parallel the wording \nof the judicial immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. 6003, and make it clear \nthat Congress can compel testimony from immunized individuals not only \nin committee hearings, but also in ``ancillary'' proceedings such as \ndepositions conducted by committee members or committee staff. This \nprovision, like the proceeding one, would improve the Senate's ability \nto compel testimony and obtain requested documents. It would also bring \ngreater consistency across the government in how immunized witnesses \nmay be questioned.\n  Provisions to bar false statements and compel testimony have been on \nthe Federal statute books for 40 years or more. Recent court decisions \nand events have eroded the usefulness of some of these provisions as \nthey apply to the courts and Congress. The bill before you is a \nbipartisan effort to redress some of the imbalances that have arisen \namong the branches in these areas. It rests on the premise that the \ncourts and Congress ought to be treated as co-equal to the executive \nbranch when it comes to prohibitions on false statements. I urge you to \njoin Senator Specter, myself and our cosponsors in supporting swift \npassage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read and agreed to, the bill be deemed read \na third time, passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and an amendment to the title which is at the desk be agreed \nto, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5091) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3166), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``To prohibit false statements \nto Congress, to clarify congressional authority to obtain truthful \ntestimony, and for other purposes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/25/senate-section/article/S8938-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FEDERAL EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
