Mr. President, let me take a minute or two of leader time \nto say I have just returned from Burlington, VT, where I was privileged \nto attend the National Governors' Association meeting and talk about \nwelfare reform.\n  I outlined what I felt could be an agreed-upon package on the \nRepublican side, pointing out there were still some differences among \nsome Republicans. We explained our program in detail to the Republican \nGovernors. There are now 30 Republican Governors out of 50. The 30 \nRepublican Governors represent about 70 percent of the American people \nin the United States; or 70 percent live in those 30 States.\n  I wanted to report that of the 30 Republican Governors, 26 were \npresent. Governor Wilson of California was not present, Governor James \nof Alabama was not present, Governor Racicot of Montana and the \nGovernor of South Dakota were not present, and one Governor had to \ndepart the meeting early, Governor Weld of Massachusetts. The other 25 \nGovernors, Governor Leavitt of Utah, Governor Engler of Michigan, \nGovernor Whitman of New Jersey, Governor Allen of Virginia, Governor \nRowland of Connecticut, Governor Fordice of Mississippi, Governor \nVoinovich of Ohio, Governor Bush of Texas, Governor Geringer of \nWyoming, Governor Keating of Oklahoma, Governor Almond of Rhode Island, \nGovernor Schafer of North Dakota, Governor Graves of Kansas, Governor \nSundquist of Tennessee, Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor \nSymington of Arizona, Governor Pataki of New York, Governor Branstad of \nIowa, Governor Merrill of New Hampshire, Governor Edgar of Illinois, \nGovernor Beasley of South Carolina, Governor Carlson of Minnesota, \nGovernor Johnson of New Mexico, Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania, \nGovernor Batt of Idaho, all endorse the Republican alternative.\n  I just passed around a little sheet of paper. They all signed it \nafter we had gone over it. I am certain the other five Republican \nGovernors will also endorse what we think would be a strong Republican \npackage. They like it. It returns power to the Governors, power to the \nStates, and does not contain a lot \n\n[[Page S 10912]]\nof strings. In their view, whether liberal or conservative strings, \nthey are still strings.\n  We know there may be some areas where we may not be able to \naccommodate the Governors. By and large, they are looking forward to \ndesigning their own plan when it comes to welfare. We also have a \nprovision where you can opt out of the Food Stamp Program. What the \nGovernors would like, of course, is more block grants. We are not able \nto do that because we do not have the votes.\n  I asked the Democratic Governors, when I spoke to the full session of \nthe National Governors' Association at 9:45, to take a look at this \nproposal. We believe it can be approached on a nonpartisan, bipartisan \nbasis. It is what the Governors have been telling us for years, in both \nparties, that they wanted--more power to the Governors, power to the \nStates, power to the people.\n  This is all sort of patterned after the 10th amendment to the \nConstitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights. It is only 28 words \nin length, which says, in effect, that unless the power is vested in \nthe Federal Government, it ought to be with the people and with the \nStates.\n  Most Governors, regardless of party, believe that should happen, \nwhether it is welfare reform, whether it is Medicaid, whatever it is. \nThey believe they can better implement and rate the programs at less \ncost, less redtape, less bureaucracy, and provide better service to the \npeople who must rely on Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, and AFDC--\nwhatever the welfare program might be.\n  I was very encouraged after the meeting with the Republican \nGovernors. They know there are some differences on the Republican side. \nThey will be weighing in very heavily on the proposal this week. We \nhope to take it up either Friday or Saturday of this week and finish it \nsometime next week or the following week. I hope that before we \nconclude, we will have broad bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10911-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRAISE FOR GIFT BAN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on another matter, I want to again thank my \ncolleagues, Senator Lott and Senator McConnell, as well as Senator \nLevin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Feingold, and many others on both \nsides of the aisle who worked together on the gift ban proposal.\n  As I said on the floor on Friday, I think we made a lot of progress. \nI read the editorial in the New York Times which indicated many fought \nit to the bitter end, which was not true. Editorial writers are \nentitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to lie. If they \nhad followed the debate, they would have known there was a lot of work \ngoing on all week long, in good faith, by Democrats and Republicans, by \nthe leader, by the Democratic leader.\n  What we finally did was say, ``OK, we agree on this. We cannot agree \non three things. We will agree on what we agree on and vote on what we \ncannot agree on.'' That is precisely what we did.\n  So, to the editor, whoever wrote that in the New York Times--I do not \nnormally read it, but Sunday was a slow day--I hope that they will try \nto at least stick with the facts, maybe once a year, twice a year. We \ndo not want to overdo it for the New York Times, but every little bit \nwould help. They are entitled to facts, they are entitled to opinions, \nbut understand what the facts are. And it is supposed to be the paper \nof ``all the news that is fit to print''--some say a 10th, but I say \nall the news fit to print. We hope for more responsibility from the \neditorial board of the New York Times.\n  The primary purpose was to thank my colleagues for all the work they \ndid and the good-faith effort. I think we made a giant step forward, \nand, hopefully, we will ease the concerns of many of our constituents \nwhen it comes to Members of Congress and gift rules.\n  Also, lobbying reform was another bipartisan effort on the floor. I \nthank my colleagues who were engaged in that.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10912-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, in November of last year, when I announced \nI would retire from the Senate after 1996, President Clinton suggested \nthat with the freedom from political restraint I now have, and with \nslightly more credibility because political opportunism would not be \nthe immediate cry of critics, I should, from time to time, make \nobservations about our Nation, where we are going, and where we should \ngo.\n  One of the marks of our civilization, virtually unnoticed as we \ndiscuss the Nation's problems, is our fastest-growing industry: \ngambling.\n  Local governments, Indian tribes, and States--all desperate for \nrevenue--increasingly are turning to what appears to be a quick and \neasy solution: legalized gambling. And, temporarily, it often works. \nPoverty-stricken Indian tribes suddenly have revenue. Cities like East \nSt. Louis, IL, with every possible urban malady, find themselves with \nenough revenue to at least take care of minimal services.\n  There are four basic questions:\n  First, how rapidly is this phenomenon growing?\n  Second, what are its advantages?\n  Third, what are its disadvantages?\n  Fourth, is there a role for the Federal Government to play, and \nshould it play a role?\n  Gambling is not a new phenomenon. The Bible and early historical \nrecords tell of its existence. Gambling surfaced early in U.S. history, \nthen largely disappeared as a legal form of revenue for State and local \ngovernments. It remained very much alive, however, even though illegal, \nin the back rooms of taverns and in not-so-hidden halls, often with \npayoffs to public officials to ``look the other way'' while it \ncontinued. I particularly remember traveling overseas and back while in \nthe U.S. Army. The troop ship became one huge gambling operation with \ndice or cards, activity slowed only by the occasional walking tour of a \nconscientious officer whose coming would be foretold by someone taking \nthe voluntary watch for his fellow enlisted men--and they were then all \nmen--who gambled. After the watchman's signal, suddenly that portion of \nthe ship's deck or hold could meet the highest puritanical standards. \nWithin seconds of the disappearance of the dreaded officer, the games \nwould begin again. Participation had no appeal to me, not primarily for \nmoral reasons, but I have always been too conservative with my money to \nenjoy risking it that way. What I remember about those shipboard \nactivities was the enormity of the stakes that could be built up--\nenormous for enlisted men on meager salaries in 1951-1953--and the \nability of some of my friends to continue their activity with almost no \nsleep.\n  Gambling's appeal, particularly for the idle--and a troop ship is \nloaded with them--is clear.\n  Early in our Nation's history, almost all States had some form of \nlottery, my State of Illinois being no exception. When Abraham Lincoln \nserved in our State legislature from 1834 to 1842, lotteries were \nauthorized, and there apparently was no moral question raised about \nhaving them. In 1839, for example, the Illinois House of \nRepresentatives voted unanimously to authorize a lottery to raise funds \n``for the purpose of draining the ponds of the American bottom'' in the \nvicinity of what is now East St. Louis, an area that to this day has a \nsevere drainage problem, and a city that today has a significant \ngambling presence.\n  In Illinois and other States the loose money quickly led to \ncorruption, and the States banned all forms of gambling. Illinois \nleaders felt so strongly about it, they put the ban into the State \nconstitution. For many years, Louisiana had the only lottery, and \n\n[[Page S 10913]]\nthen in 1893--after a major scandal there--the Federal Government \nprohibited all lottery sales. Even the results of tolerated but illegal \nlotteries could not be sent through the mail.\n  But the lottery crept back in, first in New Hampshire in 1963, and \nthen in 36 other States. Last year States sold $34 billion in lottery \ntickets. Forty-two States now have some form of legalized gambling. \nEven States that technically outlaw gambling frequently manage to have \nsome form of it. In one of the more peculiar decisions by Illinois \nSupreme Court justices--dependent for reelection at that time on \ncampaign contributions--they ruled that betting money on horses was not \ngambling, because the ability of the horse and the skill of the rider \nwere involved. Gambling is when everything is left to chance, they \nargued.\n  What we know as casino gambling was legal only in Nevada, then in New \nJersey and now in 23 states. From a small enterprise in a few States, \ngambling has matured. In 1974, $17 billion was legally wagered in the \nNation. By 1992, it reached $329 billion, and it is now over $500 \nbillion. Three-fourths of the Nation's citizens now live within 300 \nmiles of a casino. One article reports, ``Airlines are exploring the \ninstallation of back-of-seat slot machines on some flights.'' [``A Full \nHouse,'' by Rob Day, Hemisphere, October, 1994.] Other nations--\nparticularly poorer ones--are expanding gambling operations. Within our \ncountry, the magazine Gaming and Wagering Business reports, ``Old \nattitudes have been shattered. Barriers are crumbling, and doors have \nbeen flung open.'' [Dec. 15, 1991-Jan. 15, 1992.]\n  At this point, let me digress to express my gratitude to scholars who \nhave studied legalized gambling in the United States, with little \nattention and little gratitude from the community at large. \nParticularly helpful, as I prepared these remarks, was a book \nmanuscript I had the opportunity to read by Robert Goodman, a professor \nat Hampshire College in Massachusetts. In October, the Free Press will \npublish his thoughtful and well-crafted manuscript under the title, \n``The Luck Business.'' The subtitle is ``The Devastating Consequences \nand False Promises of America's Gambling Explosion.'' John Warren \nKindt, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana, wrote an \nexcellent article for the Drake Law Review last year, ``The Economic \nImpacts of Legalized Gambling Activities,'' and Henry Lesieur, who \nheads the criminal justice division at Illinois State University, edits \na magazine in this field, Journal of Gambling Studies. I am grateful to \nthem and to others who have pioneered research.\n  What are the advantages of legalized gambling?\n  It brings in new revenue, at least temporarily and, in some cases, \nover a longer period of time.\n  One of the great weaknesses of American politics today--and one of \nthe reasons for public cynicism toward those of us in politics--is our \neagerness to tell people only what they want to hear. Polling is a huge \nbusiness, and if a poll suggests some stand is unpopular, too many find \na convenient way of changing course, even if the public good is served \nby the unpopular action.\n  An area of high sensitivity is taxation. That problem is compounded \nby the fact that at the national level no other industrial nation--with \nthe exception of Israel--spends as much of its taxation on defense and \ninterest as does the United States. These bring no direct benefit to \npeople. Citizens of Germany, France, Great Britain and other nations \npay much higher taxes, but they see health care and other benefits that \nwe do not have. In addition, their parliamentary systems make it easier \nto make tough decisions than our system does.\n  So when someone comes along and says, ``I have a simple way to get \nmore revenue for you, and you do not have to raise anyone's taxes,'' \nthat has great appeal to policymakers who must seek reelection. Those \nsame people say to the policy makers, ``Not only will I provide revenue \nfor you without taxation, I will be very generous to you when campaign \ntime comes.'' And they are.\n  While the promises of what legalized gambling will do for a community \nor State almost always are greatly exaggerated, it is also true that \nmany communities who are desperate for revenue and feel they have no \nalternative are helped. I have already mentioned East St. Louis, IL.\n Bridgeport, CT, is another example. Small communities like Metropolis, \nIL, population 6,734, find that a riverboat casino brings in \nsignificant additional municipal revenue. And while other businesses in \nthese communities often do not benefit--and some, like restaurants, are \nhurt--a poll by the Better Government Association, a highly respected \nIllinois civic group, shows that in some communities, the initial \nreaction to the riverboat casinos is more positive than negative: Rock \nIsland/Moline, 83 percent positive, though this has changed; \nMetropolis, 76 percent positive; East St. Louis, 47 percent positive; \nand Peoria, 64 percent positive.\n\n  Some officials in Chicago, desperate for revenue, wish to bring in a \nlarge casino operation with a $2 billion price tag. They say it will \nbring 10,000 construction jobs. That alone is significant. The initial \npress release said 37,000 construction jobs. And officials in Chicago, \naware there are long-term dangers to the city from such an operation, \nalso know that unless they solve short-term problems--and that takes \nrevenue--the long-term picture for the city is not good. The State \ngovernment has shown itself largely insensitive to the needs of the \ncity, dominated as it is by suburban and rural leaders. Faced with a \nchoice of lectures from the State about long-term problems and what \nappears to be easy, significant, immediate revenue, it is not difficult \nto understand Chicago's choice. On top of that, they face editorial \nprodding. Under a heading, ``Casino A Great Bet For City,'' the Chicago \nSun-Times called a casino ``a cash cow'' and noted: ``The sooner state \nlaw changes to allow land-based casino gambling, the better. And the \nsooner Chicago finally gets in on the action, the better.'' [April 17, \n1995.] Almost unnoticed has been the report of the Chicago Crime \nCommission in response to a request by the Mayor: ``Organized crime \nwill infiltrate casino operations and unions, and will be involved in \nrelated loan-sharking, prostitution, drug activities * * * and public \ncorruption.'' [Chicago Crime Commission, 1990.]\n  State governments are no more loaded with courageous leaders than is \nthe Federal Government. They need revenue to solve their problems. In \nIllinois, for example, state support for public higher education has \ndropped from 70 percent of the costs in 1980, to 37 percent today, \nalmost a 50-percent cut. [Here, I digress to observe that States have \nbeen partially bailed out by Federal aid to students. We hear a great \ndeal from States about unfunded mandates. We hear much less from States \nabout sizable grants from the Federal Government.] Faced with needs in \neducation at all levels, with growing health care costs that afflict \nboth Federal and State governments, and with decaying cities and \ndecaying infrastructure, the States have two options: Tell people the \ntruth and ask for the taxes to pay for these needs, or combine the \ngrowing practice of issuing bonds, states don't call them deficits and \nfind some ``easy'' source of revenue, like legalized gambling. The \ncourageous path is too infrequently taken.\n  Revenue from lotteries, race horse gambling, and riverboat casinos \nbrings Illinois government approximately $820 million a year. That is \nState government revenue alone. I have made no attempt to calculate \nwhat revenue is lost because of money not being spent in other \nenterprises in the State. Most of those who wager in Illinois are from \nIllinois. When they spend on gambling, that is money that would \notherwise go to clothing stores, groceries, and other businesses. That \nmeans less revenue to the State from those businesses. Also not \ncalculated in the $820 million State revenue is the loss caused by the \nincreased problem of gambling addiction.\n  Early promises to use Illinois lottery money for education have been \ntechnically complied with, but State support for education has declined \nsubstantially as a percentage of income for local schools since the \nlottery became a reality.\n  Wisconsin, not a big gambling State, has 17 native American casinos. \nA study completed in April concluded: ``Overall, the state gains $326 \nmillion in net revenue from the presence of the casinos.'' They added \nthis caution: ``However, this figure is reduced substantially--to \n$166.25 million--when \n\n[[Page S 10914]]\neven the lowest estimated social costs of compulsive gambling are \nincluded in the calculations. With mid-range estimated social costs, \nthe overall impact becomes negligible, while with higher social-cost \nestimates, the impact becomes clearly negative.'' [The Economic Impact \nof Native American Gaming in Wisconsin, by William Thompson, Ricardo \nGazel and Dan Rickman, published by the Wisconsin Policy Research \nInstitute.]\n  Indian reservations have misery as their constant companion. \nUnemployment rates, alcoholism rates, suicide rates, and poverty \nindexes all combine to paint a grim picture that should be a matter of \nshame for our Nation. Not only has the Federal Government been weak in \nits response to these needs, but State governments, sometimes dominated \nby prejudice against native Americans, often have been even worse. \nListen to this Department of Health and Human Services report, given to \na Senate committee this year: ``In 15 of the 24 states with the largest \nnative American populations, eligible Tribes received nothing in 1993 \nfrom the more than $3 billion in Federal funds [Title XX and Title IV-E \nchild welfare services and protection programs] the States received. In \nthe other nine States, Indians received less than three percent.'' \n[George Grob, Deputy Inspector General, HHS, April 5, 1995, Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.]\n  It should not surprise anyone that tribal leaders who want to produce \nfor their people seize what some view as a legal loophole that our \ncourts and laws have created to get revenue for their citizens; 115 \ntribes now have some form of casino gambling. The gross revenue for the \n17 tribes in Wisconsin is $655 million. And about one-fifth of that \nrevenue comes from people who live outside of Wisconsin, higher than in \nmost States, much lower than Nevada or Atlantic City. Connecticut is \nthe prime example of a small tribe gaining big money. A casino operated \nby the Manshantucket Pequot Tribe in Ledyard, CT, brings in \napproximately $800 million in gross revenue annually. Native American \nleaders who see long-term harm to their tribes from the gambling \nenterprises are hard-pressed by those who see immediate benefits, and \nnot too much hope for sizable revenue outside of gambling.\n  What are the disadvantages of legalized gambling?\n  The distinguished Nobel Prize-winning economist, Paul Samuelson, has \nwarned us: ``There is a substantial economic case to be made against \ngambling. It involves simply sterile transfers of money or goods \nbetween individuals, creating no new money or goods. Although it \ncreates no output, gambling does nevertheless absorb time and \nresources. When pursued beyond the limits of recreation * * * gambling \nsubtracts from the national income.'' [Economics, McGraw-Hill, 1970.]\n  A high official in Nevada told me, ``If we could get rid of gambling \nin our State, it would be the best thing that could happen to us. I \ncannot say that publicly for political reasons. But major corporations \nthat might locate their principle offices here or build plants here \ndon't do it. They know that gambling brings with it serious personnel \nproblems.''\n  Personnel problems are but one disadvantage, but they are real. \nPeople can become addicted to gambling, as they can to drugs or alcohol \nor smoking.\n  My mother belongs to a church in Collinsville, IL, that had a fine \nsubstitute teacher at its Lutheran school. Unknown to the teacher's \nfamily, she had been visiting a gambling boat. Money the family thought \nhad gone to pay the rent and family bills had, instead, gone into \nwagers. One day, she left a message for her family, drove her car to a \nshopping center and killed herself.\n  In a relatively affluent Chicago suburb, a 41-year-old man committed \nsuicide after using more than $11,000 in credit card advances for \ngambling. He shot himself after leaving a gambling boat. Police found \n$13 in his pocket.\n  More typical is the experience of a friend, a professional man, who \nattended a statewide meeting of an association with which he is \naffiliated. While he went to the meetings, his wife went to a riverboat \ncasino and ``got hooked.'' She spent all the money she had and used all \nthe available money from her credit cards, close to $20,000. Her \nhusband knew nothing about it until he checked out of the hotel and \nfound his credit cards could not be used because they had already \nreached their maximum. In this family, the situation has worked out, \nbut that is not true for many.\n  A retired Air Force colonel has written me about the problem of \ncasino gambling near Keesler Air Force Base that offers part-time work \nto personnel stationed there, but also 24-hour-a-day gambling \navailability and has brought serious problems of addiction and the \nsocial and criminal problems that go with it for the men and women \nstationed there.\n  Gambling addiction is a serious problem. We know that men are more \nlikely to become addicted than women, that the appeal of gambling is \ngreater for low-income people than those of above average income, that \nthere are approximately 9 million adults and 1.3 million teenagers with \nsome form of gambling behavior problem and that the availability of \ngambling enterprises--their closeness to where a person lives--causes a \nsignificant increase in the addiction problem. Nationally, less than 1 \npercent 0.77 percent of the population are compulsive gamblers, but \nwhen enterprises are located near a population, that number increases \ntwo to seven times.\n  The greatest growth is among teenagers. University of Maryland \nfootball fans were stunned recently to read that their\n all-American quarterback had been suspended by the NCAA for four games \nbecause of betting on college games. The spread of gambling among \nteenagers has spilled over onto college campuses, and Maryland's \nfootball problem is evidencing itself on many campuses, a highly \npublicized tip of a much more serious iceberg.\n\n  Costs to society of the problem gambler vary from the most \nconservative estimate of $13,200 to $30,000 per year. I have no idea \nwhich figure may be correct, but we know there are costs. Arnold Wexler \nand his wife, Sheila Wexler, did a study for Rutgers University and \nnoted:\n\n       Compulsive gamblers will bet until nothing is left: \n     savings, family assets, personal belongings--anything of \n     value that may be pawned, sold or borrowed against. They will \n     borrow from co-workers, credit union, family and friends, but \n     will rarely admit it is for gambling. They may take personal \n     loans, write bad checks and ultimately reach and pass the \n     point of bankruptcy. . . . In desperation, compulsive \n     gamblers may panic and often will turn to illegal activities \n     to support their addiction. (1992)\n\n  Prosecuting attorney Jeffrey Bloomberg of Lawrence County, SD, \ntestified before a U.S. House committee on his experiences dealing with \nDeadwood, SD, a small community that became the first place outside of \nAtlantic City and Nevada to legalize casino gambling. He said they were \npromised ``economic development, new jobs and lower taxes.'' Instead, \ncasinos flourished, but other businesses did not. Businesses that \nprovide ``the necessities of life such as clothing are no longer \navailable * * * and customers of the town's only remaining grocery \nstore walk a gauntlet of slot-machines as they exit with their \npurchases. For the most part, the jobs which were created earn minimum \nwage or slightly better and are without benefits. As for the claim that \ngambling brings tax relief, this simply has not proven true. Real \nproperty taxes for both residential and commercial properties have \nrisen each and every year since gambling was legalized. Crimes of \ntheft, embezzlement, bad checks and other forms of larceny have \nincreased. Our office has also seen an increase in the number of child \nabuse and neglect cases as a result of gambling. These run the spectrum \nfrom the children left in their cars all night while their parents \ngamble, to the children left at home alone while their parents gamble, \nto the children left at home alone while single mothers work the casino \nlate shift, to the household without utilities or groceries because one \nor both parents have blown their paycheck gambling. Government is \nhooked on the money generated by gambling and in the long term the \nramifications of this governmental addiction will be just as dire as \nfor the individual who becomes addicted to gambling.'' (Sept. 21, \n1994--House Committee on Small Business.)\n  One study conducted for insurance companies suggests that 40 percent \nof white collar crime can be traced to \n\n[[Page S 10915]]\ngambling. Usually those involved have no prior criminal record.\n  The suicide rates for problem gamblers is significantly higher than \nit is for the general population. One out of five attempt suicide, a \nhigher rate than for alcoholism or drug addiction.\n  Pathological gamblers are much more likely to be violent with their \nspouses and abuse their children. Children of these gamblers generally \ndo worse in school and have a suicide rate twice that of their \nclassmates.\n  A survey of compulsive gamblers found 22 percent divorced because of \ngambling, 40 percent had lost or quit a job due to gambling, 49 percent \nstole from work to pay gambling debts, 23 percent alcoholic, 26 percent \ncompulsive overeaters, 63 percent had contemplated suicide and 79 \npercent said they wanted to die. (Henry Lesieur and Christopher \nAnderson.)\n  Treatment for gambling compulsion is rarely covered by health \ninsurance policies, though physicians often will simply list depression \nas the cause for needed therapy, and that may be covered. A national \nconference will be held in Puerto Rico in September to discuss the \ngrowing problem of gambling addiction.\n  State lotteries disproportionately receive money from--and target--\nthe poor. While it is true that the purchases are voluntary and provide \nsome entertainment, as a society we should be providing more \nsubstantial exits from poverty than the rare lottery victory. A bill \nbefore the Illinois legislature sponsored by Representative Jack Kubik \nto prohibit cashing welfare checks at race tracks, off-track betting \nparlors, and riverboat casinos died a quiet death.\n  Compounding all of this, State and local governments who receive \nrevenue from legalized gambling often are its promoters, both to bring \ngambling in and to sustain it. Governments get hooked. While States \nreceive revenue from alcohol and tobacco sales, no governmental unit--\nto my knowledge--promotes alcohol and tobacco. Generally governments \nappeal to our strengths, not our weaknesses. But gambling is different. \nBillboards are erected in poor areas to promote the Illinois Lottery. \n``This could be your ticket out,'' one proclaimed. If the State of \nIllinois had billboards promoting whiskey, beer or cigarettes, there \nwould be a public outcry. The Pennsylvania lottery unashamedly \nadvertises: ``Don't forget to play every day.'' And of course the poor \nare the ones who succumb to that lure.\n  Industries that want to bring in casinos are generous with their \npromises. The poverty of Atlantic City would be virtually eliminated, \nthe scenario read, but it did not happen. Poverty has not diminished, \nand problems with gambling addiction are up. Since the advent of the \ncasinos, 40 percent of the restaurants not associated with the gambling \nenterprises have closed, and one-third of the city's retail business \nhas closed. Unemployment in Atlantic City is now the State's highest. \nCrime is up significantly--almost tripled--and the population has \ndropped by one-fourth. Industrial consultant Nelson Rose told U.S. News \nand World Report: ``Atlantic City used to be a slum by the sea.\n Now it's a slum by the sea with casinos.'' (March 14, 1994.)\n\n  But not only Atlantic City has been affected. A study of crime \npatterns along non-toll roads between Atlantic City and New York City \nand Atlantic City and Philadelphia found a significant increase in \ncrime rates (Simon Hakim and Joseph Friedman.)\n  The Better Government Association of Illinois survey of 324 \nbusinesses in towns with riverboat casinos found that 51 percent of the \nfirms said riverboats had either no effect or a negative effect on \ntheir business. Of the 44 percent who gave a positive response, half \nsaid the lift their businesses got was minimal. Three percent said \ntheir business has been ``helped a lot.'' (1994 survey.) A Chicago \nTribune survey found a similar result. An Aurora, IL riverboat casino \ngets all but 1 to 2 percent of its business from within the State, and \nthe Tribune reported:\n\n       ``The casino is killing the small businesses in this area, \n     and they claimed it would help us,'' said Mario Marrero, \n     former owner of the Porto Coeli Cafe and Bakery, a block from \n     the casino.\n       As soon as the casino opened a year ago, Marrero saw his \n     business drop by half, from about $4,000 a month to $2,000 a \n     month, he said.\n       In May, he was forced to close after nearly five years in \n     business. (June 28, 1994.)\n\n  Gambling's effect on government is more than income from gamblers and \nexpenditures for dealing with problem gamblers and increased crime. \nGambling operators are major contributors to campaigns--in the \nmillions--and employ expensive lobbyists at both the State and Federal \nlevel. A few gambling enterprises have formed the American Gaming \nAssociation and employed a former chairman of the Republican National \nCommittee as its chief executive. Gaming is an influence to be reckoned \nwith in dozens of State capitals, and its influence will grow markedly \nin Washington. In Illinois, the lobbyists for gambling include a former \nGovernor, a former attorney general, two former U.S. attorneys, a \nformer director of the State police, a prominent former judge, a former \nmayor of Chicago and at least seven former State legislators. All of \nthis is legal.\n  But gambling in Illinois has also been associated with the illegal. \nBack in 1964, as a State legislator, I co-authored an article for \nHarper's magazine titled, ``The Illinois Legislature: A Study in \nCorruption.'' It did not enhance my popularity in that body, but it did \nsome good, and I am pleased to report that today the Illinois \nLegislature--in ethics, and in quality--is a much improved body over \nthat period. But whenever there is easy money floating around, the \ntemptation for corruption is present. We have had two Governors in our \nState's history go to prison, one because of payoffs from legalized \ngambling. I recall particularly the deal worked out in which--on the \nsame day--the sales tax in our State was increased from 2 cents to 3 \ncents, which then included food and medicine, and the tax on two \npolitically well-connected racetracks was reduced by one-third. Every \nState legislator knew what was going on.\n  Organized crime has frequently been a problem with gambling, whether \nlegal or illegal. Big money attracts them. And it is big money.\n  Last year, one riverboat casino in Illinois netted--not grossed--$203 \nmillion. The Chicago Tribune (March 28, 1995) reported that two \npolitically well-connected Illinois men were offered $20 million if \nthey landed a casino in our State for a Nevada firm. When contacted by \nthe Tribune, they said they had other offers that were higher.\n  The gambling elite are not only generous employers of lobbyists, they \nare multimillion dollar donors to political campaigns, and the \ncombination makes them politically potent. The unsavory and unhealthy \ninfluence of lobbyists and legislators as a protector of this rapidly \ngrowing industry means sensible restraint will not be easily achieved.\n  But there is another side to that story. Public opinion is not with \nthe gambling gentry. Even after well-financed campaigns, when there are \nreferenda on whether legalized gambling should be expanded in a State \nor community, rarely do those initiatives win. Every referendum on a \ngambling casino held last year lost, and in the big one, Florida, it \nlost decisively. Donald Trump may have helped when he told the Miami \nHerald a few weeks before the referendum: ``As someone who lives in \nPalm Beach, I'd prefer not to see casinos in Florida. But as someone in \nthe gambling business, I'm going to be the first one to open if \nFloridians vote for them.'' Florida Commerce Secretary Charles Dusseau \ndid an economic analysis of gambling possibilities in Florida and came \nto the conclusion it would hurt the State.\n  Opposition to legalized gambling also brings together an unlikely \ncoalition. For example, Ralph Reed, executive of the Christian \nCoalition, and the liberal State Senator Tom Hayden of California, \nagree on this issue.\n  To those who wish to go back to an earlier era in our nation's \nhistory when legalized gambling was abolished, my political assessment \nis that is not possible. But restraint is possible.\n  I have introduced legislation, cosponsored by Senator Lugar, to have \na commission, of limited duration and a small budget, look at this \nproblem. Congressmen Frank Wolf and John LaFalce have introduced \nsomewhat similar legislation in the House. My reason for suggesting the \nlimited time--18 months--and the small budget, $250,000, is that \ncommissions like \n\n[[Page S 10916]]\nthat often are the most productive. One of the finest commissions the \nNation has had, the Commission on Foreign Languages and International \nStudies, produced its report in a little more than 1 year on a small \nbudget and had significant influence.\n  Let a commission look at where we are and where we should go. My \ninstinct is that sensible limits can be established.\n  For example, what if any new gambling enterprise established after a \nspecific date had to pay a tax of 5 percent on its gross revenue. Those \nwho are already in the field who are not too greedy should support it \nbecause it prevents the saturation of the market. Financial wizard \nBernard Baruch said of those who invest in the stock market, ``The \nbears win and the bulls win, but the hogs lose.'' Gambling enterprises \nthat are willing to limit their expansion are more likely to be long-\nterm winners. And those who know the problems that gambling causes \nshould support this idea because of the limitations.\n  Or suppose we were to move to some form of supplement to local and \nState revenue again. States, Indian tribes, and local governments that \ndo not have any form of legalized gambling would be eligible for per \ncapita revenue-sharing assistance. It would require creating a source \nof revenue for such funding, but would bring some relief to non-Federal \ngovernments who do not want gambling but are desperate for additional \nrevenue. There is no way--let me underscore this--of reducing the \ngambling problem without facing the local revenue problem.\n  Congressman Jim McCrery, a Republican from Louisiana, has proposed \nthat lotteries--now exempt from Federal Trade Commission truth-in-\nadvertising standards--should be covered. Why should the New York \nlottery be able to advertise: ``We won't stop until everyone's a \nmillionaire.''\n  These are just three possible ideas. The commission could explore \nothers. The commission can look at how we deal with gambling \nopportunities that will surface later this year on an experimental \nbasis on cable television and the Internet. How significant could this \nbecome? None of us knows.\n  We do know that two-thirds of problem gamblers come from a home where \nat least one parent had a problem with alcoholism. Should we be dealing \nmore seriously with alcoholism, in part to deal with the gambling \nphenomenon?\n  These and other questions could be studied by a commission.\n  What should not be ignored by Congress and the American people is \nthat we have a problem on our hands. We need to find sensible and \nsensitive answers.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, do I have time reserved under a previous \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10912-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GAMBLING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from Illinois \nraises for this Senate the right questions and in a very sensitive way. \nI have said previously on this floor in discussing some other items \nthat one of the growth industries in America, regrettably now, is \ngambling. There is more spent, at least for the more recent year I have \nseen, there is more spent for gambling in America than is spent on \nAmerica's national defense. In a recent year, it was $400 billion-plus \njust on legal gambling. We spend less than $300 billion on America's \ndefense. I think all of the questions that relate to this issue of \ngambling need to be asked and need to be studied.\n  It was interesting to me one evening when I had the television set \non, though I was not really watching it much--and on one of the local \nstations in the Washington, DC, area they were doing their live drawing \nfor their lottery. They do that live with these little ping-pong balls \nwith numbers on them. It was on the screen. I never participated in \nthose things. This was on the screen, and then across the bottom of the \nscreen scrolled an urgent news bulletin. It was not so urgent that they \nwould take the lottery selection off, because they were doing that \nlive, they did not want to interrupt that.\n  So they kept on picking the lottery balls out and announcing the \nnumbers. The news scrolled across the bottom of the television screen \nthat Gorbachev had just resigned in the Soviet Union. I was thinking to \nmyself, this is incredibly bizarre. Here is something that will affect \nthe lives of virtually everyone in the world. The leaders of one of the \nmajor powers in the world resigns, but instead of cutting in with a \nnews report, they cannot interrupt the lottery, so they scroll it \nacross the bottom of the screen.\n  That is what we have come to, with respect to this issue of gambling \nin America today.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President if my colleague will yield for an \nobservation. I thank him. As usual, Senator Dorgan is right on target \non this issue.\n  Today, I regret to say, we have topped $500 billion now in total \ngross income. It is a fast-growing industry in the United States.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is probably legal wagers. There is substantial \nillegal wagering in America.\n  Mr. SIMON. That does not count what happens illegally. The second \nthing, the Senator mentioned in passing--as you saw them take these \nballs for the lottery--that you do not spend any money on it. Most \npeople of our income level do not. It is the poor that they try to \nappeal to.\n And it is very clear, both from studies and from the advertising, that \nthis is an attempt to extract money from the poor. We ought to be able \nto get revenue in a better way for our Government.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not come to the floor suggesting that gambling is \nalways wrong or ought to be made illegal. I think it is very useful to \nstudy, and I think that the commission approach makes a lot of sense. \nWe ought to be evaluating what does all of this mean for our country? \nWho is affected by it, and how? That is what I think the Senator from \nIllinois was saying. I think it is timely and important. I have \nindicated that to Congressman Wolf and others, as well.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10916-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10916-S10917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LINE-ITEM VETO: WHERE ARE THE HOUSE CONFEREES?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to visit about two \nother items. One is the line-item veto. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nwe passed a line-item veto here in the Senate in March. I voted for it, \nas I have on a dozen or 2 dozen occasions previously, because I think \nwe ought to have a line-item veto. I voted for the line-item veto when \nPresident Reagan and President Bush were Presidents because I, as a \nDemocrat, think that Presidents, whether Republican or Democrat, ought \nto have a line-item veto.\n  The House passed a line-item veto bill on February 6 of this year, \nand the Senate passed a line-item veto bill in March of this year. Now, \nthere has been no progress since then because there has been no \nconference between the House and Senate. Why has there not been a \nconference? Because the Speaker of the House, who always told us he \nwants a line-item veto, decided he is not going to appoint conferees. \nSo there will be no line-item veto until the Speaker decides he wants \nto appoint some conferees, and there is a conference and agreement, and \nthen it comes back to both the House and the Senate.\n  Now, some will probably say that this is because the new majority and \nthe Speaker may want to put their own spending projects in these bills \nand not have a Democratic President veto them.\n  This is a newspaper published on Capitol Hill. It says, ``Gingrich \nGets $200 Million in New Pork,'' describing what was written, \napparently, in appropriations bills that will benefit the Speaker. He \nmay not want the President to target that $200 million that was written \ninto a bill that the Pentagon does not ask to be spent. Maybe the \nPresident would use a line-item veto to say this is $200 million that \nthe taxpayers should not have to spend on things the Pentagon did not \nwant.\n  I noticed this morning in the Washington Post, ``Extra Pentagon Funds \nBenefits Senators' States.'' It describes in some detail the extra \nfunds put in for projects that the Pentagon has not asked for. These \nare things that will be built that the Pentagon says we do not want \nbuilt. But money is added to \n\n[[Page S 10917]]\nthose bills to benefit some. The question is, Why would the President \nnot have the line-item veto if all of us agree that he should?\n  Congressman Bob Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, said, ``We may not want to give it to this President''--\nspeaking of the line-item veto--``right at the outset, but let's give \nit to him eventually.'' Those are his words. We may not want to give \nthe line-item veto to this President at the outset.\n  Speaker Gingrich, on February 6, before the House passed the line-\nitem veto, said this:\n\n       We have a bipartisan majority that is going to vote for the \n     line-item veto. For those who think this city has to always \n     break down into partisanship, you have a Republican majority \n     giving this to a Democratic President this year without any \n     gimmicks, an increased power over spending which we think is \n     an important step for America, and therefore it is an \n     important step on a bipartisan basis to do it for the \n     President of the United States, without regard to party or \n     ideology.\n\n  More recently, he said, ``My sense is we won't get to it this year.''\n  There was a fervent debate by those who wanted the line-item veto. \nSomehow that ardor has cooled. Somehow the line-item veto is less \nimportant now.\n  The Speaker has been on a book tour. There is plenty of time to do \nthat all across America and, apparently, to write two books this year, \nand to earn a bunch of money. But, apparently, there is not enough time \nto get to the line-item veto--appoint conferees and get to a line-item \nveto.\n  Well, Mr. President, there is an old saying, ``You can put your boots \nin the oven, but that doesn't make them biscuits.''\n  The Speaker can talk about the Contract With America and the line-\nitem veto, but if he is not prepared to appoint conferees so that we \ncan pass a line-item veto, then he continues to stall. I suppose the \nreason for that is he wants his own spending to be written into these \nbills, or so you would think from this kind of report--``Gingrich Gets \n$200 Million in New Pork.''\n  Well, I hope that we can come to a bipartisan consensus that the \nHouse ought to appoint conferees, that the Senate and House should have \na conference this week, and that the conference should report back the \nconference report at the end of this week. That way we can pass the \nline-item veto.\n  Tomorrow, I intend to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the \nline-item veto to the State Department authorization bill. My amendment \nwould say: It is the sense of the Senate that the Speaker of the House \nshould move to appoint conferees on S. 4 immediately, so that the House \nand Senate may resolve their differences and we can pass a conference \nreport.\n  I do not understand what this is all about if it is not dragging your \nfeet to protect more Federal spending that you want for your district \nin this bill. I thought we had decided on a bipartisan basis that a \nline-item veto was good for this country. We voted for it, believed in \nit, and wanted to give it to this President. I voted for it with \nRepublican Presidents in office and I voted for it again. I would like \nthis President to have it. So I intend tomorrow to offer a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution and ask Senators to vote to send a message to the \nSpeaker that if you have plenty of time to run around the country on a \nbook tour, you have time, in my judgment, to appoint conferees.\n  How do you do it? Simple. Think of the names of a few of your friends \nand then pick some. That is not rocket science; that is just appointing \nconferees, which we do every day in the House and Senate.\n  There will be a bill coming to the floor in a few days that \nauthorizes Defense spending. That bill includes a type of spending that \nis especially, in my judgment, appropriate for a line-item veto. We \nhave something called star wars in this country. It has a better name \nnow; it is not star wars, or ABM, antiballistic missile defenses; now \nit is BMD, ballistic missile defense system. That is a new acronym for \nthe same old boondoggle. It is something that costs $30 or $40 billion, \nand it will protect against an adversary that no longer exists. But \neach one of these missile defense programs has a constituency that \nsomehow seems unable to shut the program down. The Soviet Union is \ngone. That was the antagonist for which the ABM system was designed. \nThe Soviet Union does not exist anymore. But the people who want to \nbuild a star wars program continue to plug away.\n  They added in the Senate Armed Services Committee $300 million extra \nfor national ballistic missile defense, and then they said let us \nessentially change the ABM treaty, abrogate the treaty, No. 1 and, No. \n2, let us go for accelerated interim deployment in the year 1999 and \nfinal deployment by 2002. Well, this $300 million is a perfect example \nof what the President ought to use a line-item veto on.\n  I intend to offer an amendment on the floor of the Senate to strip \nthis $300 million out of the Defense authorization bill. It does not \nmake any sense to spend $300 million we do not have on a project we do \nnot need. This is exactly why this President ought to have a line-item \nveto. The notion that we do not have enough money for an entitlement \nfor a poor kid to have a hot lunch in school, but we have enough money \nto stick $300 million extra in a bill for star wars--I do not know what \npeople are thinking about around here.\n  So I want to alert my colleagues that I am going to offer an \namendment to cut this national missile defense funding. But more \ngenerally, this provision is exactly why we need a line-item veto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10916-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10917-S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MERGERS AND TAKEOVERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I noticed this morning that there is a \nnews report out that Disney Corp. is intending, for some $19 billion, \naccording to the news reports, to purchase Capital Cities/ABC. Now, it \nwould be the second largest takeover in U.S. history if the Disney \nCorp. purchases Capital Cities/ABC. I am concerned when I hear, day \nafter day and week after week, new proposals--friendly or hostile \nproposals--to merge America's largest businesses into larger and larger \nenterprises. We have seen merger mania in this country before, a wave \nthat came and went, but it now seems to be coming again.\n  You only have to pick up a newspaper these days to see who is buying \nwhom, some with leveraged buyouts, some in hostile takeover proposals, \nand others simply friendly mergers. But it is inevitably true in this \ncountry that when two corporations become one larger corporation, \nespecially in multibillion-dollar deals, it impedes competition.\n  You have less competition in this country as you have more \nconcentration. Nobody seems to care very much about it. We have a \nthousand attorneys working in the Federal Government on antitrust \nissues. Under the leadership of Anne Bingaman down at Justice, they are \nmore active now, and I salute them for that.\n  We need to get more and more active to make sure that these mergers \nare in the public interest. We need to ensure that a decision by two \ncorporations to combine to make a larger corporation, and grab a larger \nmarket share, does not impede the competition that drives the free \nmarket system.\n  I have a list of the large proposals for mergers just in the last \nweek and months, large financial institutions, large manufacturing \ninstitutions. Frankly, I think we in the Congress ought to take a close \nlook at this practice. I intend to ask the committees of jurisdiction \nto do that.\n  If a person goes downtown and buys a shirt or a blouse at a \ndepartment store, you will be required to pay a sales tax, a tax for \nthe transaction. I, personally, think we ought to have a fee that is \nsupplied to those who want to buy corporations.\n  We had a $25 billion acquisition several years ago in which KKR \npurchased Philip Morris. I think they should have paid a fee. That fee \nought to be used as a resource bank of funds for investment capital for \nsmall businesses. When big businesses combine and provide less \ncompetition and more concentration, we ought to get a fee from that \nthat is used as seed money and seed capital for small businesses, which \nrepresent the development of more competition.\n  I hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to discuss this in \nrelevant committees. I do not have any notion about what the proposed \nmerger between Disney and Capital Cities/ABC is \n\n[[Page S 10918]]\nall about. I do not know whether it is good or bad. I say when we see, \nday after day, week after week, more and more megamerger proposals in \nthis country for large corporations to combine to become larger, \ninevitably it cuts away at this country's free enterprise system, \nbecause this system works based on competition. Concentration means \nless competition. It is something we ought to be concerned about and \nought to care about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10917-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ACTION NEEDED ON LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, an effort is underway to demand that \nCongress enact legislation to grant rights to homosexuals that other \nAmericans do not have. I cannot believe that such legislation will be \napproved by either the Senate or the House, but there's no way to be \ncertain that either or both \n\n[[Page S 10923]]\nbodies won't cave in to political pressures being exerted.\n  One thing appears certain: The liberal media will likely get behind \nsuch an effort.\n  In any event, Mr. President, the Kinston, NC, Daily Free Press \npublished an excellent article on July 16 written by a gentleman who \nknows whereof he speaks--Dr. Richard G. McDonald of Kinston who for \nmore than 50 years has been working with homosexuals. Dr. McDonald has \na clear understanding of what is going on even if the vast majority of \nU.S. Senators do not.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I want Dr. McDonald's observations to be \nmade available to Senators and others who may have concerns about the \nobvious powerplay going on among U.S. homosexuals. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the published comments of Dr. McDonald be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Kinston Free Press, July 16, 1995]\n\n             Homosexual Rights Need Clear and Direct Debate\n\n                      (By Dr. Richard G. McDonald)\n\n       There has been an ongoing debate about gay rights, but the \n     parameters of tolerance have not been addressed. This needs \n     to be discussed clearly and directly.\n       There are tolerated limits and moral bounds to all human \n     activity. There is a legal maxim that states, ``Your right to \n     swing your fist ends where my jaw begins.'' Self-explanatory. \n     This is a line beyond which you may not proceed without dire \n     consequence.\n       For over 50 years during and since WW II, I have been \n     associated with, observed, supervised and counseled \n     homosexuals; mostly male. Civil rights is something to which \n     all people are entitled, regardless any other factor, i.e. \n     jobs, housing, credit, etc., as a legal and moral right.\n       Most of us live our lives quietly and privately. Most \n     homosexuals do also and enjoy successful lives interacting \n     with society, in general, peaceably. There is a large number \n     who, recognizing the inherent difficulty of their state, are \n     involved in a serious effort to break away from what is \n     unarguably abnormal and unnatural. They work closely with \n     groups to this end; Exodus, nationally (with a N.C. unit) and \n     Homosexual Anonymous, as in Maine (one of the groups with \n     which I work).\n       These are troubled people who want to escape the clutches \n     of their condition, knowing that it is a one-way road to \n     nowhere; a nothingness to a tragic end and a sad death--if \n     AIDS infected, a death sentence.\n       The state of their general equanimity, emotionally and \n     psychologically, is disturbed, disordered, distressed, \n     disabled; regrettable but largely correctable. In 1970-71 at \n     two national conventions of the American Psychiatric Assoc. \n     in San Francisco and Washington, homosexuality as a mental \n     illness was removed from the Diagnostic Directory of Mental \n     Illness under circumstances of coercion and intimidation that \n     to this day are shameful and a professional disgrace. If you \n     wonder why it was removed as a defined illness, you have only \n     to read of the circumstances under which it was removed to \n     realize that it never should have been.\n       There is, however, a radical and vociferous element within \n     the homosexual community who want it their way in all \n     respects--such is their disturbed state, sadly. They press \n     this agenda with an ``in your face'' approach and with \n     scandalous public displays such as the parades and gay \n     parties at Clinton's inauguration in D.C. and the gay pride \n     parades nationally in general. (Pride in what?)\n       What this disturbed group wants is acceptance of their \n     ``lifestyle'' with federal government blessing and protection \n     as a ``civil right'' to promote their actions; to teach in \n     our public schools that homosexuality is both natural and \n     normal; to convince our youth that their lifestyle is merely \n     an ``alternative choice.'' To so convince and corrupt our \n     youth would inevitably lead to a major breakdown in our \n     social and moral order. Debauchery undermines the public \n     moral fiber and the strength of people as a community and \n     nation. this is precisely what led to the fall of great \n     nations of the past; e.g. ancient Greece and Rome.\n       The moral reason for its rejection we all know. Causation \n     is unknown to this day, scientifically. Predisposition to \n     homosexuality is, no matter the cause, and will still be \n     humanly abnormal and unnatural and should not be advanced to \n     a government protected right. From time immortal, it has been \n     rejected as unacceptable on the wisdom of thousands of years \n     of human experience from the knowledge of consequences.\n       Because of their small numbers, despite their attempts to \n     claim a large population, they are on a constant ``recruiting \n     campaign'' to have a replacement base for their own purposes \n     and to have available partners for their gratification. This \n     applies to both genders though lesbians tend to have more \n     personal, ``caring and committed'' relationship of longer \n     duration.\n       But for both, their general attitude as it relates to human \n     relations differs from that of the heterosexual majority \n     significantly, in that it is inwardly directed in a self-\n     centered matrix around gratification and the almost \n     hysterical fear of aloneness without ``partners.'' Sexual \n     gratification is the motivating drive without the \n     interconnectedness of ``person,'' with the male. Most of the \n     time, it is anonymous sex. The ``bath houses'' of San \n     Francisco in the Castro district are the national hotbed of \n     deviant gay sexuality and the center of the highest per \n     capita AIDS infection rate in the nation. This is another sad \n     consequence of homosexuality which is leading rapidly to a \n     national epidemic; a fact that the AMA is ignoring and the \n     Center for Disease Control does not want to admit; a serious \n     warning to the American public is overdue.\n       Homosexual Congressman Steve Gunderson and his Gay \n     Republican Caucus are solidly behind passage of the ``Gay \n     Bill of Rights'' (H.R. 382 and Senate S. 25); further, they \n     are busy lobbying for millions to fight for passage. To live \n     their lives quietly and privately is one thing; to have a \n     protected and special legal status is to give legitimacy to \n     one of mankind's scourges. It must not happen for reasons \n     that are indisputable; now you know what you must do.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10922-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, in addition to the Minneapolis Star Tribune \narticles regarding the Federal judiciary circulated to Senators on \nFriday, July 28, I would like to share with my colleagues the following \narticle, which was published on the op-ed page of the Star Tribune on \nSunday, March 12, 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                     Series Wronged West and Judges\n\n                          (By Ruth E. Stanoch)\n\n       What could explain the character assassination the Star \n     Tribune performed at the expense of the reputation of several \n     U.S. Supreme Court justices, other distinguished federal \n     jurists and the 6,000 employees of the West Publishing Co.? \n     This is a question many people are asking after the Star \n     Tribune wasted over eight pages of copy to prove a faulty \n     premise, and then ran an editorial condemning allegations \n     that the excruciatingly long articles never substantiated.\n       Cleverly linking unrelated events, the Star Tribune pulled \n     quotes out of context and employed provocative tabloid \n     language in lead headlines and paragraphs, only to suggest \n     wrongdoing that its own handpicked panel of experts could not \n     find.\n       The Star Tribune suggests as much in its own editorial. \n     ``All this might be just a minor eyebrow-raiser,'' state the \n     editors, ``if not for a question of timing.''\n       Timing indeed. How is it that some 13 years after the \n     creation of the Devitt Award--and after receiving press \n     releases from West explaining every detail and identifying \n     every recipient of this most distinguished award--that the \n     Star Tribune finally woke up and destroyed half a forest in \n     an effort to trash West and some highly respected federal \n     judges? As the newspaper would have found from its own clips, \n     the Devitt Award was started long before the West cases cited \n     by the paper came before the U.S. Supreme Court, and it \n     continues today, long after the cases have been resolved. If \n     the issue is timing, it is the Star Tribune's timing that \n     ought to be questioned.\n       The answer won't sell many newspapers, for there is no \n     murky conspiracy or unfounded allegation of improper \n     influence. In fact, the Star Tribune's effort to out-intrigue \n     Oliver Stone is merely the latest example of the bare-\n     knuckled tussling that has become the norm in the fiercely \n     competitive online information service sector.\n\n[[Page S 10924]]\n\n       According to a February news release from the Star \n     Tribune's partner, AT, the Star Tribune's parent company, \n     Cowles Media, has formed Cowles Business Media for the sole \n     purpose of creating an online news and information service \n     for business professionals. Furthermore, in a March 3 letter \n     to West, the Star Tribune admitted that ``if there is a major \n     court decision we will obviously report it on the online \n     service, and we might publish the decision if we had access \n     to it.'' WESTLAW, West Publishing's flagship online service, \n     is already the nation's leading source of legal and nonlegal \n     business and professional information. Make no mistake. The \n     Star Tribune and Cowles Business Media will compete directly \n     with WESTLAW. West welcomes competition. In fact, since 1992, \n     the number of competing providers of caselaw has increased \n     from 65 to more than 190. West's two largest competitors are \n     multibillion dollar, multinational conglomerates \n     headquartered in foreign countries. The Star Tribune lamely \n     states it has no intention of entering the legal publishing \n     business, hoping its readers don't know and will not find out \n     that West isn't just a caselaw publisher, but one of \n     America's leading online business and professional \n     information providers.\n       The Star Tribune must not forget that aside from its \n     competitive business ventures it remains a newspaper. It \n     could have added a dose of journalistic integrity to the \n     story by merely mentioning the AT venture somewhere in that \n     enormous story--just as it did whenever notions of accuracy \n     forced it to admit, however cryptically, that neither West \n     nor the judges had done anything wrong at all.\n       The Star Tribune also has a duty to pursue its tasks in \n     good faith. In correspondence with Star Tribune editors and \n     feature writers. West was told that the newspaper was \n     undertaking a broad examination of the entire legal \n     publishing industry. West was asked to cooperate with work on \n     an article that involved ``major contractors such as Mead \n     Data Central, West Publishing Co. and Lawyers' Cooperative \n     Publishing.''\n       West cooperated initially because any story entitled ``Who \n     Owns the Law'' ought to say--and we did--that among major \n     legal publishing companies, only West is American-owned. West \n     thought that in the wake of Dutch-owned Reed Elsevier's $1.5 \n     billion purchase of West's primary American competitor, Mead \n     Data Central, the Star Tribune would do a story on how a \n     relatively small Minnesota company was holding its own \n     against massive foreign competitors.\n       Wrong. While the Star Tribune's editors sent West placating \n     letters declaring their intention to write a balanced story, \n     the writers relentlessly focused on West. And now, given the \n     appearance of West's name in the sensational headline of the \n     story, and its single-minded focus on West and the conduct of \n     West executives, how can the Star Tribune state publicly, as \n     it has, that West was not even a focus in the report? West \n     was purposefully misled.\n       The Star Tribune story also did an enormous disservice to \n     the honorable people serving in America's federal judiciary. \n     The Devitt Award, according to the Star Tribune, was intended \n     to be the ``Nobel Prize for the federal judiciary.'' Indeed, \n     as the Star Tribune acknowledges, the Devitt Award has become \n     a ``prestigious'' award whose ``recipients chosen over the \n     years have been worthy of honor.'' Judges who have received \n     the award ``have shown courage in handling civil rights \n     matters and creativity in improving the administration of \n     justice.''\n       So how can the Star Tribune blithely infer that the same \n     distinguished judges who, through their integrity and \n     courage, are deserving of such a respected award, would \n     engage in misconduct to benefit West? Clearly the Star \n     Tribune cynically plays upon the public's mistrust of \n     government institutions, leaving the casual reader with the \n     impression that another great institution has fallen victim \n     to misplaced ethics.\n       Such allegations are doubly outrageous given the article's \n     unequivocal statements that ``West broke no laws in making \n     the gifts,'' and that ``the award complies with all laws and \n     ethics codes.'' Is the Star Tribune the brave new arbiter of \n     illusory judicial standards? Why, even the Star Tribune's own \n     handpicked ethics expert had to admit that ``it is perfectly \n     legitimate for a law book publisher to sponsor such an \n     award--I've nominated someone myself--and to enlist the aid \n     of judges in selecting the recipients and to pay their \n     reasonable expenses in fulfilling that selection \n     obligation.''\n       Finally, the Star Tribune established no link between the \n     Devitt Award and court cases resolved in West's favor because \n     no such link exists. With regard to the U.S. Supreme Court \n     cases cited by the Star Tribune, the court did not hear the \n     cases. Rather, the justices declined to review the rulings of \n     lower courts--something they do with 96 percent of the cases \n     that come their way. In the face of this overwhelming \n     percentage, what evidence did the Star Tribune uncover to \n     support its lurid reference that, but for West's influence, \n     any one of those cases were special enough to warrant review? \n     Absolutely none.\n       In fact, the petitions involving West were rejected by the \n     Supreme Court because they were simply without merit. Yet the \n     Star Tribune, finding no evidence to suggest otherwise, turns \n     instead to the predictable sour grapes of losing attorneys \n     for accusations of misdeeds. The article also quoted out of \n     context an unnamed federal appeals court judge who asks an \n     attorney challenging West, ``Did West do something to make \n     you mad?'' Placed in the proper context, the judge was asking \n     precisely the right question, since the issue before the \n     court was whether there was an actual controversy in the \n     first place. The quoted judge was frustrated over the other \n     party's failure to identify a dispute that the court could \n     resolve. It's all there in the transcripts and pleadings, but \n     the Star Tribune chose to ignore it.\n       In short, the Star Tribune expended enormous resources to \n     concoct a self-serving, long-winded and repetitive story that \n     trashed a fine, old Minnesota company, reached no \n     constructive conclusion, found no improper behavior and left \n     readers asking, ``So what?'' But most importantly, the story \n     took several poorly aimed and ill-advised shots at the \n     pinnacle of the American judiciary. It was all unnecessary \n     and unfortunate. The people of Minnesota and the readers of \n     the Star Tribune deserve better.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10923-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10924-S10929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            UNITED STATES-UNITED KINGDOM AVIATION RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \ngreat importance to U.S. passenger and cargo carriers. I refer to \naviation relations between the United States and the United Kingdom. \nThe strategic location of the United Kingdom makes it a key crossroad \nfor international traffic. It is a gateway to Europe and an important \nlink in the global aviation market.\n  A liberalized, balanced air service agreement between the United \nStates and the United Kingdom is in the best interest of both \ncountries. Of equal importance, the increased competition resulting \nfrom such an agreement would benefit consumers on both sides of the \nAtlantic. Unfortunately, our current bilateral aviation agreement--the \nBermuda II Agreement--is anticompetitive, nowhere near balanced, and \nharms consumers.\n  First, the agreement is terribly restrictive. For example, presently \nonly two U.S. carriers--American Airlines and United Airlines--can \nserve London Heathrow Airport and they can do so only from specific \ncities. This is particularly significant since Heathrow is the most \nimportant international gateway airport in the world. Also, the number \nof passengers carried to the United Kingdom by United States airlines \nis severely constrained by the Bermuda II Agreement. Without question, \nBermuda II is our most restrictive bilateral aviation agreement.\n  Second, the air service agreement is grossly imbalanced in favor of \nthe British. Currently, United Kingdom airlines carry approximately 60 \npercent of the transatlantic passengers between the United States and \nthe United Kingdom. In 1976, U.S. air carriers had around 60 percent of \nthe transatlantic passenger market share. The British found that state \nof affairs intolerable. In fact, the United Kingdom relied on this \ninequitable balance as the basis for renouncing the Bermuda I \nAgreement.\n  The British were right. A 60 percent-40 percent imbalance is \nintolerable. It must be corrected. U.S. carriers are highly competitive \nand, but for Bermuda II, the market would not be skewed in this manner. \nI am willing to put our highly efficient carriers up against any \nforeign carriers. Given the chance, I am confident they will \nsuccessfully compete in any market worldwide.\n  Finally, Bermuda II is undesirable for consumers because it limits \ncompetition. Consumers on both sides of the Atlantic would benefit \ngreatly from increased competition in the United States-United Kingdom \ntransatlantic market. Bermuda II does not discriminate, it harms \nBritish consumers as well as United States travelers.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year the United States began pressing for \na liberalized, market oriented aviation agreement with the United \nKingdom. This is not the first time we have tried to secure an air \nservice agreement on this basis. In fact, for more than 50 years the \nUnited States has repeatedly tried to get the United Kingdom to embrace \nan air service agreement based on free-market principles. Our current \nposition is not new, nor is it novel.\n  Unfortunately, for more than 50 years, these attempts have \nconsistently been rebuffed by the British who are very concerned about \nthe prospect of unrestrained head-to-head competition with United \nStates carriers. Many aspects of our trade relationship with \n\n[[Page S 10925]]\nthe United Kingdom are open and unrestricted. Aviation certainly is not \none of them.\n  The current round of negotiations that began earlier this year did, \nhowever, start a process which hopefully will ultimately result in a \nliberalized air service agreement. The phase 1 deal agreed to by the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom last month is a step in the right \ndirection, but we have a long, long way to go.\n  Hopefully, the momentum of the phase 1 deal will carry over into \nphase 2 negotiations which began recently in London. I hope we can \nsecure a phase 2 deal this fall that increases access to Heathrow and \nGatwick Airports, and liberalizes cargo services, pricing, and charter \nflights. Such an agreement would be another significant step. It would \nbe a welcome development. However, even if we reach consensus on a \nphase 2 agreement, we must not stop there. The United States and the \nUnited Kingdom must continue working together to fully liberalize our \naviation relations.\n  Mr. President, I wish to briefly discuss two important related \nissues. First, is the United States' request for additional Heathrow \naccess fair and realistic in light of current capacity limitations at \nthat airport? Second, does the United States have enough leverage in \nnegotiations to obtain a liberalized air service agreement?\n  Several weeks ago I met in London with key United Kingdom transport \nofficials and aviation executives to better evaluate each of these \nquestions. I believe the answer to both questions is ``yes.'' Let me \nexplain my conclusions.\n  Heathrow Airport, like four airports in the United States, is a slot-\ncontrolled facility. By this I mean it has a limited number of takeoff \nand landing slots. I was aware Heathrow handles a substantial amount of \npassenger and cargo traffic. However, I was surprised to discover \nHeathrow also is an airport with significant unused capacity.\n  In the short term, operational changes at Heathrow could immediately \ncreate much-needed additional runway capacity. For instance, presently \nHeathrow's two runways function on what is called segregated mode \noperations. What this means is one runway is used exclusively for \ntakeoffs while the other is used exclusively for landings. Operating \nrunways in this manner is quite inefficient.\n  In the United States, most of our major airports use mixed-mode \nrunway operations. This means landing and departing traffic is \nsequenced and mixed on the same runway. Mixed-mode operations are very \nefficient and very safe. They enable an airport to maximize runway \ncapacity.\n  What would result if Heathrow switched its runways to mixed-mode \noperations? It has been estimated hourly runway capacity would increase \nby about 18 percent. This would mean potentially an additional 7 \narrivals and 7 departures per hour, and more than 100 new arrivals and \n100 new departures daily. For an airport which purportedly has no \nadditional capacity, this is very significant indeed.\n  Some adjustments in airspace operations and ground movement \nmanagement would be needed to capture the full traffic benefits of this \nswitch in runway operations. Let me add that I understand the noise \nclimate around Heathrow has been improving for many years and, due to \nnewer and quieter jets, increased operations should not pose an \nenvironmental problem.\n  I wish I could take credit for this excellent idea. The credit, \nhowever, goes to British Government and industry projects which have \nstudied the Heathrow capacity problem. It was a conclusion of the \nBritish Civil Aviation Authority study on runway capacity that was \nreleased in 1993. The source of the statistics to which I refer is the \nAugust 1994 report of the Heathrow Airport Runway Capacity Enhancement \nStudy. On June 22, 1995, the House of Commons Transport Committee \ncommenced an inquiry into airport capacity issues in the United \nKingdom. Among the issues it will consider is underutilization of \nairport capacity and, in that regard, methods of runway operations.\n  In the longer term, there is a proposal to add a new terminal at \nHeathrow that will significantly increase airport capacity. According \nto a report by BAA plc, the dynamic private company that owns and \noperates Heathrow, the proposed new terminal 5 would allow Heathrow to \nhandle 30 million more passengers a year.\n  Time and time again United States negotiators are told by their very \nskilled British counterparts there is no additional capacity at \nHeathrow. I understand the British sang the same song in negotiations \nin London earlier this month. We should confront the British \nnegotiators with these facts and supporting studies.\n  Let me turn to the important question of whether we have enough \nleverage to get the British to agree to a fully liberalized aviation \nagreement. The Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee considered that issue during a hearing several \nmonths ago. Understandably, a number of Senators were concerned the \nUnited States has squandered its leverage by giving the British too \nmany aviation rights in the past without obtaining equal benefits. That \ncriticism of negotiations prior to 1995, particularly those which led \nto the Bermuda II Agreement in 1977, is warranted. We have given, so to \nspeak, with both hands.\n  I disagree, however, that the United States has nothing of value left \nwhich will enable us to obtain a liberalized aviation agreement with \nthe British. We still hold the ultimate leverage, the most important \nbargaining chip of all. We control the substantial economic benefit the \nUnited Kingdom presently enjoys as a result of United States carrier \nbusiness.\n  There was a time when geographic factors and technological \nlimitations made the United Kingdom the international gateway of \nnecessity for United States carriers serving Europe and beyond. The \nBritish skillfully played this bargaining chip for all that it was \nworth. In fact, they continue to operate on this outdated premise.\n  Times have changed. New generation, long-range aircraft have made the \noption of overflying the United Kingdom to gateway airports on the \nEuropean Continent an option that is viable from both an operational \nand economic standpoint. Moreover, open skies agreements with European \ncountries have made clear to the United States and to U.S. carriers \nthat these nations want our business. If the United Kingdom does not \npromptly revise its thinking, it may well see United States carriers \nlook beyond the United Kingdom to the European Continent for \ninternational gateway opportunities.\n  Recent developments in our aviation relations with countries on the \nEuropean Continent have quite understandably caused our carriers to \nseriously consider opportunities beyond the United Kingdom. Since the \nUnited States and The Netherlands signed an open skies accord in 1992, \nthe resulting growth of international traffic to Amsterdam's Schiphol \nInternational Airport has been quite significant. Our very recent open \nskies agreements with Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, \nNorway, Sweden, and Switzerland should also create new continental \nopportunities. An open skies agreement with Belgium that is expected \nsoon will have the same effect.\n  The greatest catalyst for this movement of United States air service \nbusiness to the European Continent, however, would be an open skies \nagreement with Germany. I welcome reports that aviation negotiations \nbetween the United States and Germany earlier this month went very \nwell. Also, I am pleased German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann \ncame to Washington last week to meet with Secretary Pena. United \nStates-German aviation relations are moving in the right direction.\n  An open skies agreement with Germany would make the airports in \nMunich and Frankfurt very attractive to United States carriers who are \nfrustrated they cannot obtain sufficient access to Heathrow and \nGatwick. I understand a new airport also is planned in Berlin. In \ncombination with international airports in European countries with \nwhich we have open skies agreements--particularly Amsterdam's Schiphol \nInternational Airport--German airports represent significant \ncompetition to United Kingdom airports.\n  BAA plc, which owns and operates Heathrow, makes my point very \nsuccinctly. In a recent publication, BAA \n\n[[Page S 10926]]\nperceptively observed: ``Airlines and passengers are free agents. If \nextra capacity is not developed at Heathrow, the airport will not be \nable to satisfy demand and airlines will expand their business at \ncontinental airports.'' BAA added, ``if airlines are denied the \nopportunity to grow at Heathrow, many will choose Paris, Frankfurt or \nAmsterdam.'' BAA is absolutely right.\n  Before it is too late, I hope the United Kingdom Department of \nTransport recognizes the United Kingdom no longer has a monopoly as an \ninternational air travel gateway for United States carriers. The \neconomic stakes for the United Kingdom are very high.\n  Mr. President, I remain hopeful the British will liberalize their air \nservice agreement with our country. It is in the best interest of both \ncountries to do so. As British negotiators again posture over Heathrow \naccess and other important elements of the phase 2 deal such as \nliberalization of cargo services, I hope they fully understand the \nimplications of new opportunities for United States carriers in \ncontinental Europe. An open skies agreement with Germany would really \ndrive home this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent article appearing in the \nFinancial Times describing my view of the impact an open skies \nagreement between the United States and Germany would have on United \nStates-United Kingdom aviation relations be printed in the Record.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a letter I recently sent to Sir \nGeorge Young, the new United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport, \nwhich describes my concern about the current state of United States-\nUnited Kingdom aviation relations also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Financial Times, July 6, 1995]\n\n                   Senator Piles on Heathrow Pressure\n\n                         (By Michael Skapinker)\n\n       Airlines in the US might look to Germany to provide a new \n     European gateway airport if London's Heathrow is not opened \n     to American carriers, Senator Larry Pressler, chairman of the \n     US Senate Commerce and Transportation Committee said \n     yesterday.\n       Senator Pressler, who was in London for talks with UK \n     officials, said: ``With longer-range new generation aircraft, \n     frustrated US carriers may well look beyond the UK for \n     another international gateway airport. An open skies \n     agreement with Germany, which may result from the US-Germany \n     bilateral air talks later this month, will add much fuel to \n     this fire.''\n       Senator Pressler said, however, that he favoured raising \n     the maximum stake that foreign airlines can hold in US \n     carriers to 49 per cent from the current ceiling of 25 per \n     cent.\n       Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, said this \n     week that if the US wanted greater access to Heathrow, it \n     would have to lift maximum ownership limits in its airlines \n     and allow greater co-operation between UK carriers and their \n     American partners.\n       Senator Pressler, whose committee is to hold hearings on US \n     aviation policy next week, said he recognized that Heathrow \n     was congested. He said, however, that there were several \n     operational changes which could be made to allow the airport \n     to accommodate more traffic. These included using the \n     airport's two runways for both landings and take-offs. \n     Heathrow currently has landings and take-offs on separate \n     runways.\n       Senator Pressler said that although he was a Republican, he \n     supported the way the US had negotiated with the UK under Mr. \n     Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary. Mr. Pena has \n     been criticised in Congress for taking too timid an approach \n     to the UK.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Committee on Commerce, Science,\n\n\n                                           and Transportation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1995.\n     Rt. Hon. Sir George Young MP,\n     Secretary of State for Transport, Department of Transport, 2 \n         Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB, United Kingdom.\n       Dear Sir George: Congratulations on your recent appointment \n     as Secretary of State for Transport. On July 3rd I met in \n     London with your predecessor, Dr. Mahwinney, in a very \n     informative session. I hope that we can continue the dialogue \n     Dr. Mawhinney and I started.\n       As I told Dr. Mahwinney, I am very hopeful the Phase 1 \n     agreement last month will be the first step in liberalization \n     of the U.S./U.K. bilateral aviation agreement. U.S. carriers \n     are understandably very concerned over recent statistics \n     indicating U.K. carriers now serve approximately 60 percent \n     of the transatlantic passenger traffic between our countries. \n     Historically, as you know, both countries have regarded a 60/\n     40 imbalance to be unacceptable.\n       I believe a balanced, liberalized air service agreement is \n     in the best interest of both countries. Of equal importance, \n     increased competition that would result from such an \n     agreement would be beneficial for consumers on both sides of \n     the Atlantic. If your travels bring you to Washington, D.C., \n     I would enjoy having the opportunity to discuss these issues \n     with you in person.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 1905.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry; am I correct that \nat 2 p.m. we will leave this energy and water appropriations bill and \nthen take up the State Department authorization bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the status of that bill? Is there a cloture \npetition pending on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture petition was filed on Friday and \nwill mature tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has a time been set for a vote on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry; in the event that \nthat State Department/foreign assistance bill is removed from the \ncalendar postcloture tomorrow, what would the pending business then be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question would occur on H.R. 1905.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes, then there will be 10 \nminutes for my friend, the ranking member, Senator Johnston. I do not \nbelieve we will be able to accomplish much business, but the energy and \nwater bill is pending.\n  I am pleased to bring H.R. 1905, the energy and water development \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 before the Senate for its \nconsideration. The bill was passed by the House on July 12, less than 3 \nweeks ago, with a vote of 400 to 27.\n  The Senate Energy and Water Development Subcommittee marked up the \nbill on July 25. The full committee reported it out 28 to 0 last \nThursday, July 27. The bill and report have been available to Senators \nand their staff since last Friday, July 28.\n  Although the Appropriations Committee has moved quickly to prepare \nthe bill, the quality of this legislation, in my opinion, has not \nsuffered.\n While we are under extreme budgetary pressures resulting from the \nbudget resolution's mandate of erasing the Federal deficit over the \nnext 7 years, and our desire to restrain Federal spending, the bill \nbefore the Senate is well balanced and equitable. The committee has \ndone the best job possible under very difficult circumstances.\n\n  I first want to thank the former chairman of the subcommittee, and \nnow ranking member, Senator Johnston, for his assistance in developing \nthis year's bill. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana has been the \nchairman or ranking member on this subcommittee for many years, and is \nintimately familiar with every aspect of the energy and water bill. He \nhas been helpful at every step of the way, and his guidance and insight \nhave been invaluable to me and the other members of the subcommittee.\n  I also thank the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, and \nformer chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, Senator Hatfield, for his help in bringing this bill \nbefore the Senate. Senator Hatfield has extensive knowledge of the \nprograms funded in this bill, and we relied on his expertise on several \noccasions during the past few weeks. As chairman of the full committee, \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon has the tremendous responsibility \nof ensuring that all 13 appropriations bills will be enacted prior to \nthe end of the fiscal year. At the rate the committee is reporting the \nbills to the Senate, it appears that we will reach that objective. What \nhappens after we have reported them out \n\n[[Page S 10927]]\nand gone to conference and reported them out of conference and through \nthe floors of both bodies, I do not know.\n  Mr. President, the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee funds \nprograms in both the defense and nondefense areas. Our total 602(b) \nallocation is divided between these two categories, and is consistent \nwith the budget resolution's firewalls separating defense and \nnondefense spending.\n  Although we are below our total 602(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays, we are constrained by our budget authority \nallocation for defense programs, and our outlay allocation for \nnondefense. There is no room left in our allocation to fund programs in \neither the defense or nondefense areas.\n  If we were to fund them, or fund them differently, we will have to \ntake away from funding in the bill. I remind Senators, if they choose \nto take money from the defense portion--and obviously you can ask which \nportion it is, but I think it is clearly understandable within the \nbudget--if they choose to move defense money to a nondefense program, \nit is subject to a point of order under the Budget Act and clearly \nwould violate the spirit of the budget resolution of this year. So it \nis not going to be easy for Senators to have amendments on the \nnondefense side because they are going to only look to that portion of \nthis bill that is nondefense to try to move money around. That is just \nthe way it is, and especially when you put a firewall up, which we have \nnow imposed for the next 3 years.\n  Let me give the Senate and those interested in appropriations a \nlittle bit of an overall picture.\n  Fifty-seven percent of the funds in the bill are dedicated to \nprograms in the atomic energy defense activities areas, including \nnuclear waste cleanup activities. A total of $11,445,981,000 in budget \nauthority and $10,906,895,000 in outlays is recommended. This is \nconsistent with the budget resolution crosswalk of $11,447,000,000 in \nbudget authority, and $10,944,000,000 in outlays, and the crosswalk is \nidentical to our 602(b) allocation.\n  The areas where we are recommending the largest reductions in \nspending are the nondefense programs--the Army Corps of Engineers, the \nBureau of Reclamation, nondefense programs in the Department of Energy, \nand the independent agencies--which comprise only 43 percent of the \nbill.\n  The total amount recommended for nondefense domestic discretionary \nspending is $8,716,112,000 in budget authority and $9,271,155,000 in \noutlays. This is right up against our nondefense outlay ceiling, as I \nhave heretofore described. The nondefense total for budget authority is \n$1,458,107,000 below the current year, $819,108,000 below the \nPresident's budget request, and $481,888,000 below the budget \nresolution crosswalk.\n  Due to this dramatic reduction in nondefense spending, the \nSubcommittee's ability to fund new initiatives is extremely limited, \nand many existing programs are cut significantly below both the current \nyear and the President's request. For example, we are proposing the \nfollowing major reductions to current year spending levels:\n  Army Corps of Engineers--Down $234.6 million;\n  Bureau of Reclamation--Reduced $64.7 million;\n  Solar and renewable energy--Reduced by $104.5 million;\n  Fusion energy--Cut $147.4 million;\n  Appalachian Regional Commission--Down $100 million; and\n  Tennessee Valley Authority--A $32.5 million cut.\n  We are proposing to terminate the following programs or new \ninitiatives within the Department of Energy:\n  Electric systems reliability research;\n  Russian replacement power initiative;\n  Civilian waste research and development;\n  University research instrumentation;\n  The technology partnership program; and\n  The in-house energy management program.\n  The subcommittee also had proposed to agree with the administration's \nbudget request to terminate the Department of Energy's nondefense \nadvanced reactor program. An amendment during the full committee \nmarkup, however, restored $12.5 million for the Gas Turbine--Modular \nHelium Reactor Program. The subcommittee had included $7.5 million in \nits mark for termination costs associated with the gas cooled reactor, \nand an additional $5 million was added to reach the $12.5 million level \nrecommended by the amendment.\n  Although we are proposing some significant changes in the nondefense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, we have done our best to \nprotect basic science research. It is true that we are proposing major \nreductions to such worthy programs as solar and renewables and fusion \nenergy, but we have held the line on biological and environmental \nresearch, basic energy sciences, and high energy and nuclear physics.\n  These are the fundamental, basic science missions of the Department \nof Energy, and are the core competencies we feel are most in need of \nprotection. These programs will have a direct influence on the ability \nof the Nation to keep pace in many technologically demanding areas, and \nwill support future missions in areas such as the human genome program, \none of the world's greatest wellness programs. If it succeeds, we may \nfind cures for thousands of ailments that beset humanity across the \nworld. Other medical research activities, global environmental \nresearch, materials and chemical sciences, the physical sciences, and \nothers are retained at high levels to keep us on the cutting edge.\n  Although we are recommending significant program reductions, we \nbelieve we have drafted a more balanced bill than the House. We have \nrestored funds above the House levels for the following programs:\n  Defense environmental restoration and waste management--$724.3 \nmillion;\n  Solar and renewable energy--$17.2 million;\n  Soviet designed reactor safety--$40 million;\n  Biological and environmental research--$48.9 million;\n  Nondefense laboratory technology transfer--$25 million; and\n  University science and education--$30 million.\n  Another topic deserving mention is the subject of authorizing bill \nlanguage. We have received numerous requests to include authorizing \nlanguage for the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. \nUnfortunately, due to conflicts with the authorizing committees, we \nhave not been able to accommodate these requests. We are hopeful the \nauthorizing committee will pass a bill this year, and relieve us of \nthese pressures.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I would like to briefly summarize the \nbill as reported by the committee.\n  Title I of the bill funds the water resource development activities \nof the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Civil Works Program. The total new \nbudget authority recommended is $3,174,512,000, a reduction of $234.4 \nmillion from the currently enacted level, and $132.9 million below the \nbudget request. The corps' water resources program provides lasting \nbenefits to the Nation in the areas of flood control, municipal and \nindustrial water supply, irrigation, commercial navigation, \nhydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement.\n  The committee has rejected the administration's proposals to \nradically change the civil works mission for the Corps of Engineers. \nWere these proposals to go into effect in fiscal year 1996, the corps \nwould be involved in only those projects and proposals deemed to be of \nnational scope and significance. While it may at first seem reasonable \nthat the Federal Government only be involved in programs of national \nsignificance, a closer look makes it apparent that they were ill-\nconceived and are counterproductive to the well-being of the Nation.\n  And the committee has rejected them by not affirming them and acting \non some projects in disregard of that new definition.\n  The most far-reaching of these proposals involves the Corps of \nEngineers' role in protecting our citizens from the devastating effects \nof floods. Under the administration's proposal, the corps would only \nparticipate in projects that meet the following three criteria: First, \nmore than one-half of the damaging flood water must come from outside \nthe boundaries of the State where the damage is occurring; second, the \nproject must have a benefit-to-cost \n\n[[Page S 10928]]\n\nratio of 2 or greater; and third, the non-Federal sponsor must be \nwilling and able to pay 75 percent of the first cost of the project. \nThe practical effect of applying those criteria against all proposed \nprojects would be to terminate the Federal Government's role in flood \ncontrol activities.\n  The first criterion alone would eliminate the corps' role in flood \ncontrol throughout much of the country, including three of our largest \nStates: California, Texas, and Florida. Terminating the Federal \nGovernment's role in flood control activities as a way to save money \nclearly is not one that this committee has decided is right nor is it \nnecessary under moneys we have available. We can continue with a lesser \nprogram without tying its hands that much.\n  The committee also has rejected the administration's proposals to \nterminate the Federal role in shore protection projects and smaller \nnavigation projects.\n  Title II of the bill funds activities associated with the Department \nof the Interiors' Bureau of Reclamation and the central Utah completion \nproject. Total funding recommended for these activities is \n$816,624,000. This is a reduction of $64.8 million from the current \nyear's level, and $16.4 million below the budget request.\n  Programs and activities of the Department of Energy comprise title \nIII of the bill, and a total of $16,235,359,000 in new budget authority \nis recommended. Programs funded under this title relate to: energy \nsupply, research and development activities, uranium supply and \nenrichment activities, the uranium enrichment decontamination and \ndecommissioning fund, general science and research activities, the \nnuclear waste disposal fund, atomic energy defense activities, \ndepartmental administration, the Office of the Inspector General, the \nPower Marketing Administrations, and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  For atomic energy defense activities, the committee recommends a \ntotal of $11.429 billion in new budget authority. The programs funded \nin this area include stockpile stewardship, stockpile management, \ndefense environmental restoration and waste management, verification \nand control technology, and others. Well over half of the total atomic \nenergy defense activities funds, almost $6 billion, is for the \nEnvironmental Restoration and Waste Management Program. The committee's \nrecommendation is $724 million above the House for this critical \nprogram focused on cleaning up and managing existing waste at various \natomic weapons production sites.\n  Under the energy supply, research and development account, the \ncommittee proposes an appropriation of $2,798,324,000 to fund such \nprograms as solar and renewable energy, nuclear energy, biological and \nenvironmental research, fusion energy, basic energy sciences, and other \nactivities.\n  One of the most difficult decisions made by the committee concerns \nthe Civilian High Level Radioactive Waste Management Program in the \nDepartment of Energy. Because the administration requested no \ndiscretionary appropriations for the program, the committee has been \nforced to recommend a course of action designed to put the Nation's \ncivilian nuclear waste program back on track.\n  Accordingly, the committee recommends a total funding level of $400 \nmillion--$151.6 million from the nuclear waste fund and $248.4 million \nfrom the defense nuclear waste disposal account--for nuclear waste \nactivities. Furthermore, due to the delay in site characterization \nactivities at Yucca Mountain, and the need for the Federal Government \nto begin accepting commercial spent nuclear fuel from the Nation's \nnuclear utilities in 1998, the committee recommends a provision in the \nbill to establish an interim storage facility at a site yet to be \ndetermined.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the committee proposes a total of \n$330,941,000 in new budget authority for a number of independent \nagencies funded under title IV of the bill. This includes such agencies \nas the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend, the ranking member, Senator \nBennett Johnston of Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind \nremarks about me. And I want to say, Mr. President, that this is \nSenator Domenici's first appropriations bill but he is a veteran of \ngreat leadership in many areas in the Senate, and he has taken to the \nappropriations process like a duck in water and has put together an \nexcellent bill.\n  The relationship that I have had over a period of, I think, 18 years \nwith Senator Hatfield, the Senator from Oregon, who is now the chairman \nof the full committee--but for those 18 years he and I have switched \noff as chairman and as ranking minority member of this committee--that \nrelationship is being continued, I am pleased to say, with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Domenici]. He is a long-time leader in the Senate \nand long-time friend, and it is a pleasure to work with him on this \nbill.\n  This bill is a very, very difficult one, the 602(b) allocation in \ndomestic programs having been cut substantially from what it was last \nyear. And that means that the needs and certainly the requests of our \ncolleagues could simply not be met, Mr. President, because the \nresources were so minimal in this bill. But the Senator from New \nMexico, as a magician, has done an excellent job in at least dealing \nwith the most important priorities in the bill, and I think putting \ntogether an excellent bill.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from new \nMexico [Mr. Domenici] in presenting to the Senate the energy and water \ndevelopment appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1996 beginning \nOctober 1, 1995. This bill, H.R. 1905, passed the House of \nRepresentatives on July 12, 1995, by a vote of 400 yeas to 27 nays. The \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development marked up this bill on \nJuly 25, 1995, and the full committee marked it up and reported the \nbill Thursday, July 27, 1995.\n  At the outset, I want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Domenici. This is the first time he has handled an \nappropriation bill as chairman, and he has done an excellent job in \nputting this bill together, under very difficult budgetary constraints \nand circumstances. He is an outstanding Member of the Senate and I am \npleased to work with him in connection with this bill and on other \nmatters.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator \nHatfield, the chairman of the full Committee on Appropriations. Senator \nHatfield and I had probably one of the longest running twosomes in the \nAppropriations Committee on the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, I having chaired on and off for a number of years, and \nSenator Hatfield having chaired on and off for a number of years, and \nhaving rotated as ranking minority member. Beginning this year, of \ncourse, Senator Hatfield is chairing a different subcommittee. We \nalways shared a productive, pleasant, bipartisan, and always, I think, \nthe kind of relationship that Senators seek and glory in when it is \npresent. I treasure his friendship and appreciate the cooperation and \nassistance given to me.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has presented the \ncommittee recommendations and explained the major appropriations items, \nas well as the amounts recommended, so I will not undertake to repeat \nand elaborate on the numerous recommendations. Instead I will just have \na few brief remarks summarizing the bill.\n\n\n                          purpose of the bill\n\n  The bill supplies funds for water resources development programs and \nrelated activities, of the Department of the Army, civil functions--\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works program in title I; for the \nDepartment of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation in title II; for the \nDepartment of Energy's energy research activities--except for fossil \nfuel programs and certain conservation and regulatory functions--\nincluding atomic energy defense activities in title III; and for \nrelated independent agencies and commissions, including the Appalachian \nRegional Commission and Appalachian regional development programs, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority in \ntitle V.\n\n\n                 section 602(b) allocation for the bill\n\n  The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee allocation under \nsection \n\n[[Page S 10929]]\n\n602(b)(1) of the Budget Act totals $20,180,000,000 in budget authority \nand $20,216,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 1996. Of these amounts \nthe defense discretionary allocation is $11,447,000,000 in budget \nauthority and $10,944,000,000 in outlays.\n  For domestic discretionary the budget authority allocation is \n$8,863,000,000 and the allocation for outlays is $9,272,000,000. The \ncommittee recommendation uses nearly all of the budget authority \nallocation in both categories, so there is no room for add-ons to the \nbill as there are no additional outlays available for spending. \nTherefore, any amendments to add will have to be offset by reductions \nfrom within the bill. The bill is approximately 57 percent in the \ndefense [050] function and about 43 percent for domestic discretionary \nprograms.\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1996 budget estimates for the bill \ntotal $20,681,648,000 in new budget obligations authority. The \nrecommendation of the committee provides $20,162,093,000. This amount \nis $520 million under the President's budget estimate and \n$1,464,636,000 more than the House-passed bill.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly summarize the major recommendations \nprovided in the bill. All the details and figures are, of course, \nincluded in the committee report number 104-102, accompanying the bill, \nwhich has been available since last Friday.\n                    title i, army corps of engineers\n\n  First, under title I of the bill which provides appropriations for \nthe Department of the Army civil works program, U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, the recommendation is for a total of new budget authority of \n$3,174,512,000, which is $45 million below the House and $133 million \nless than the budget estimate. it is $234 million less than the fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriation.\n  The committee received a large number of requests for various water \ndevelopment projects including many requests for new construction \nstarts. However, as the chairman has stated, due to the limited \nbudgetary resources, the committee could not provide funding for each \nand every project requested. The committee recommendation does include \na small number of new construction starts and has deferred without \nprejudice several of the largest of the projects eligible for \ninitiation of construction. Because of the importance of some of these \nprojects to the economic well-being of the Nation, the committee will \ncontinue to monitor each project's progress to ensure that it is ready \nto proceed to construction when resources become available. As the \ncommittee reports points out, the committee recommendation does not \nagree with the policies proposed by the administration in its budget.\n\n\n                  title ii, department of the interior\n\n  For title II, Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, the \nrecommendation provides new budget authority of $816,624,000 million, \nwhich is $16 million less than the budget estimate and $40 million \nunder the House bill.\n\n\n                    title iii, department of energy\n\n  Under title II, Department of Energy, the committee provides a total \nof $16.2 billion. This amount includes $2.8 billion for energy supply, \nresearch and development activities, a net appropriation of $29 million \nfor uranium supply and enrichment activities; $279 million for the \nuranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund, $971 \nmillion for general science and research activities, $151.6 million \nfrom the nuclear waste disposal fund, and $6.6 billion for \nenvironmental restoration and waste management--defense and nondefense.\n  For the atomic energy defense activities, there is a total of $11.429 \nbillion comprised of $3.752 billion for weapons activities; almost $6.0 \nbillion for defense environmental restoration and waste management; \n$1.440 billion for other defense programs and $248 million for defense \nnuclear waste disposal.\n  For departmental administration $377 million is recommended offset \nwith anticipated miscellaneous revenues of $137 million for a net \nappropriation of $240 million. A total of $312.5 million is recommended \nin the bill for the power marketing administrations and $131 million is \nfor the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] offset 100 percent \nby revenues.\n  A net appropriation of $197 million is provided for solar programs, \nincluding photovoltaics, wind, and biomass and for all solar and \nrenewable energy, $283.5 million, an increase of over $17 million over \nthe House bill.\n  For nuclear energy programs, $280 million is recommended, which is \nabout $13 million less than the current level. The major programs \nprovided for included funds to continue the advanced light water \nreactor program at $40 million and about $73 million in termination \ncosts. The sum of $12.5 million is included for the gas turbine-modular \nhelium reactor [GT-MHR], also known as the gas reactor which I strongly \nsupport.\n  For the magnetic fusion program, the committee is recommending $225 \nmillion, which is $141 million less than the budget. An amount of \n$428.6 million is included for biological and environmental research \nand $792 million for basic energy sciences.\n\n\n          title iv, regulatory and other independent agencies\n\n  A total of $331 million for various regulatory and independent \nagencies of the Federal Government is included in the bill. Major \nprograms include the Appalachian Regional Commission, $182 million; \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, $474.3 million offset by revenues of \n$457.3 million; and for the Tennessee Valley Authority, $110.4 million.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I wish there were additional \namounts for domestic discretionary programs in our allocation but that \nis not the case. A large number of good programs, projects, and \nactivities have been either eliminated or reduced severely, because of \nthe allocation, but such action is required under the budget \nconstraints we are facing. I hope the Senate will act favorably and \nexpeditiously in passing this bill so we can get to conference with the \nHouse and thereafter send the bill to the White House as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with just the parting comment that \nit is a pleasure to work with the Senator from New Mexico and with the \nchairman of the full committee, Mr. Hatfield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10924-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10929-S10937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOREIGN RELATIONS REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 908, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 908) to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State, for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 and \n     to abolish the United States Information Agency, the United \n     States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Agency \n     for International Development, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has finally \nproceeded to S. 908, the Foreign Relations Committee's Foreign \nRelations Revitalization Act of 1995.\n  This is hallmark legislation, and it represents the first proposal to \nrevamp U.S. foreign affairs agencies since the end of the cold war. It \nis forward looking legislation that puts our Nation's interests first \nand instructs the United States to organize and streamline its \noperations for the 21st century, which is just around the corner.\n  I wish I had the ability of Abraham Lincoln, who so ringingly \naffirmed the essence of what we are as a nation. And he did it on the \nback of an envelope. There are not many individuals who have Lincoln's \nwisdom, and certainly I do not, but I can say that in drafting this \nbill, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee relied heavily on the \nwisdom of many individuals and on numerous studies made by several \nadministrations of both parties. Those studies focused on how the \nUnited States could better organize its foreign affairs institutions. \nWe have received the counsel of five former U.S. Secretaries of State \nwhose services spanned the \n\n[[Page S 10930]]\npast two decades. And those five former Secretaries of State have \nendorsed this legislation wholeheartedly.\n  After careful review of our proposal, these five former Secretaries \nof State met with us, talked with us, and gave broad support to our \neffort. Of course, that pleased me very much, and I am grateful to \nthem. Let me just give a few examples of what they said.\n  Former Secretary of State James Baker III asserted that he considers \nour proposal ``breathtaking in its boldness and visionary in its \nsweep.'' Henry Kissinger described S. 908 as ``a bold step in the \ndirection of,'' as he put it, ``centralizing authority and \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs where it properly \nbelongs--in the President's senior foreign affairs adviser, the \nSecretary of State.''\n  Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig ``heartily'' endorsed the \ncommittee's reorganization proposal, and even Mr. Clinton's Secretary \nof State, Secretary Christopher, with whom I worked closely and whom I \nrespect greatly, concluded that a plan to abolish the U.S. Information \nAgency, the Agency for International Development, and the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency made sense.\n  In November 1994, just after the election, Secretary Christopher \npresented his own reorganization plan to the Vice President's office. \nNow, the Vice President, a former Senator with whom all of us have \nserved, or practically all of us, has had much proclamation and \nassertions, declarations that we are going to reinvent Government. That \nis Al Gore's press agent speaking for him.\n  Anyway, in November, when Secretary Christopher presented his own \nreorganization plan to Al Gore's office, there was intense interagency \nlobbying at the White House. Boy, they were running around like a bunch \nof road runners. After an intense period of this ferocious lobbying at \nthe White House, Secretary Christopher's plan lost out to those whose \ninterests appeared to care more about protecting their bureaucratic \nturfs than in the reinvention of Government for the post-cold-war \nworld.\n  So Mr. Christopher had a proposal, but it was knocked down by the \nvery office that was created to reinvent Government. Secretary \nChristopher is a good soldier. He swallowed hard and accepted what had \nhappened to him.\n  Meanwhile, in its place, Vice President Gore promised the American \npublic his own plan. He said it will be delivered--his own plan--to \nkeep all of the bureaucratic agencies and cut $5 billion, nonetheless, \nout of the foreign affairs budget for the next 5 years.\n  That is sort of like jumping off a 300-foot diving board into a wet \nwashcloth. He could not do it. But he said that is good news and I am \nglad to give it to you, and I guess a lot of people accepted it as good \nnews. But the bad news is that the Vice President has yet to this very \nminute to release even one detail of his proposal, despite constant \nappeals from Members of Congress, including your humble servant now \nspeaking. A lot of people of his own persuasion in the Congress, in \nboth the House and Senate, have said, ``Let us have it, let us have \nit.'' Silent in seven languages. There are no details. There are no \nplans from the Vice President's Office.\n  In fact, the United States State Department itself has yet to submit \na formal authorization request for fiscal year 1996.\n  So you see the pattern, Mr. President. They promise a lot, they talk \na lot, they brag on themselves a lot down on Pennsylvania Avenue and in \nFoggy Bottom, but when it comes to producing, nothing happens. It is \nall politics.\n  But in the absence of leadership from the executive branch, it was \nleft to those of us in Congress to take the lead. On March 15, Senator \nSnowe, the distinguished lady from Maine, and Chairman Ben Gilman of \nthe House committee, and I announced publicly a plan to restructure \nU.S. foreign affairs agencies. S. 908--now get that number, S. 908, \nbecause we are going to be talking about S. 908 a great deal in the \ncoming days and weeks. It is the pending business in the Senate and it \nis the legislative realities of the plan that we worked so long and \nhard on with not one bit of cooperation from the administration. Not \none iota of cooperation. They want to keep the bureaucracy intact. They \nare going to promise to cut spending, but they are not going to \neliminate any bureaucrats.\n  The administration has rejected any attempt to join in helping us \nshape this initiative. Silent in seven languages. ``Don't bother me,'' \nthey said. The administration's response has been a confrontational \none, and here I quote from some internal notes from one of the meetings \non this legislation conducted in the administration and by the \nadministration. Their plan to greet this legislation, and we will watch \nand see what happens, their plan is to ``delay this legislation, to \nderail this legislation, to obfuscate''--and I am quoting from their \nown memorandum, ``to kill the merger.''\n  So if we are even going to have an opportunity to vote on this bill, \nwe are going to have to have a cloture vote, meaning that we will have \nto get a constitutional three-fifths of the U.S. Senate to vote to let \nus have a vote. Now whether we are going to get any help from the other \nside remains to be seen. It is going to be interesting to watch what \nhappens on the other side\n  So what I am saying, Mr. President, is that the administration \nobviously, flagrantly has not wanted the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to produce any legislation that would reduce the bureaucracy \nwhich would cut down on foreign aid and all of the other things the \nAmerican people have been demanding for so long.\n  The administration has refused cooperation at every juncture--every \njuncture, without exception. It has refused even to talk about a \nconsolidation. It has refused to provide the Congressional Budget \nOffice with the information that the Congressional Budget Office has to \nhave in order to compute the billions of dollars the taxpayers will be \nsaving by the pending legislation.\n  Talk about stonewalling, this is stonewalling to the nth degree. The \nconcepts advocated in this bill have the force of history behind them \nand the support of the American people in making all of this become \nlaw. In other words, the polls show that the American people want this \nlegislation. They do not want to keep the fat bureaucracy in place. \nThey do not want to continue to spend billions upon billions of dollars \non foreign aid in corrupt countries.\n  The question of why reorganize almost answers itself. Why? Let us say \na few things about that. We must reorganize because eliminating the \nvast duplication, the incredible waste, the unnecessary bureaucracy \noffers the only--the only--opportunity to maintain U.S. presence \noverseas while out-of-control Federal spending is reined in at home.\n  Lacking any substance to their opposition, they began several months \nago to throw around epithets. One of the administration's officials \nwent down to the National Press Club, and he charged the committee, or \nthe majority on the committee, and Jesse Helms specifically, with being \nisolationists. This is puzzling, and I have to ask the question: Are \nSecretary Kissinger, Secretary Shultz, Secretary Haig, Secretary Baker, \nSecretary Eagleburger, are all five of them isolationists? Of course \nnot. But the epithet works with this administration.\n  You can watch on various other things that are front and center on \nthe agenda today. You can note what the President of the United States \nhimself is saying on these things. They may not be true, but if they \nmay persuade some voters, he is going to say it.\n  But I say this to the President of the United States, and to you, Mr. \nPresident, and to the American people: If Congress fails to seize this \nopportunity to consolidate, the international affairs budget will be \nlarge enough to cover the cost of the Federal employees and overhead \nthe mass of bureaucracy now entails. The international affairs budget \nwill be large enough to do all of that. There are only two choices--\ntwo, no more, no less:\n First, save smart through consolidation, or Second, eliminate Federal \nprograms. I am tempted to say, will the real ``isolationists\" please \nstand up. But we cannot see the State Department and Al Gore's office \nfrom here.\n\n  The administration and its legions of bureaucrats and AID contractors \nhave distorted the contents of this measure from the very beginning. I \nhave been astonished at some of the things that \n\n[[Page S 10931]]\nhave been said and fed to the newspapers, which gleefully publish it \nwithout checking on the accuracy. I must say that I am appalled by the \nadministration's lack of understanding as to the enormous flexibility \nprovided in this measure.\n  This consolidation plan provides greater flexibility to the executive \nbranch than exists in current law. The only hitch is to abolish three \noutdated agencies. That is where the protests have come.\n  This bill does not legislate every position and office in the \nDepartment of State, and anybody who says to the contrary has not even \nread the bill.\n  Now, the committee provides guidance for the organizational structure \nof consolidation. S. 908, the pending bill, mandates 5 Under Secretary \npositions--the exact number mandated under current law--and provides \nauthority for 20 Assistant Secretary positions, two of which are \nmandated. What do you know, current law mandates three. The bill before \nyou allows the President and Secretary of State unparalleled \nflexibility to organize under the five senior positions at State. The \ncommittee provides $225 million over 2 years for transitional funds \nwith extraordinary authorities. This is designed to ease and facilitate \ntransition to a reduced Federal bureaucracy.\n  Now, for the purpose of emphasis, Mr. President, let me remind the \nSenate that the pending bill, S. 908, is the very first authorization \nbill this Senate has considered since the House and Senate budget \nagreed to achieve a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002. I am \npleased and grateful that the Foreign Relations Committee has fulfilled \nits duty. We have done the best we can. If sheer, raw politics takes \nover and prevents the approval of this bill, or even a vote on it by \nthis Senate, that will not be our fault.\n  This bill, S. 908, meets the Budget Committee targets, and it puts \nour international affairs budget on a trajectory to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, who is pretty good at this thing, \nestimates that S. 908 will save more than $3.5 billion over 4 years--\n$3.66 billion to be exact. It will save almost $5 billion over the next \n5 years, and these savings do not result from dramatic cuts in \ninternational programs. They result in dramatic cuts in the bloated \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  Now then, Mr. President, consolidation is the only available option \nto maintain our overseas presence at the budget levels that have been \nagreed to for the next 7-year period. They have been voted on by this \nSenate. If the administration succeeds in its efforts to shoot down \nthis bill, the foreign affairs agencies will be in far worse shape than \never.\n  The House of Representatives, because they have different rules from \nthe Senate, passed the companion bill, H.R. 1561, several weeks ago, \nand the House is ready to go to conference with the Senate if, as and \nwhen we pass this bill.\n  The able Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kerry], who has so \nfaithfully supported his President, offered an amendment in the Foreign \nRelations Committee to consolidate these agencies. But the Senator's \namendment provided only half the cost savings of the committee bill \nand, of course, that does not qualify. We have to meet the budget that \nwe voted to approve in the U.S. Senate. Senator Kerry knows, \nnotwithstanding the administration, that consolidation is the right \nthing to do. I have known John Kerry for a long time, and I know that \nhe understands the situation.\n  Well, I guess we are in sort of the position that Mark Twain once \nremarked about. He said, Mr. President, ``Always do right. This will \ngratify some people and astonish all the rest.''\n  Maybe the administration does not want to astonish anybody. I will \ntell you one thing, the American people expect both the President and \nthe U.S. Senate to do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, consolidation is the only way to go, and it is the \nright thing to do. Of course, I urge Senators on both sides of the \naisle to lay politics aside and let us proceed with this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I now yield to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Pell.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now turns to S. 908, the Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act of 1995. In prior years this legislation has been \ncalled the Foreign Relations Authorization Act and has authorized \nfunding for the Department of State, the U.S. Information Agency \n[USIA], and international broadcasting activities.\n  I want to acknowledge at the outset, Mr. President, the earnestness \nwhich with the Foreign Relations Committee Republicans--under the \nleadership of Chairman Helms--have tackled this legislative effort. In \nthis bill, Senator Helms has made a serious--if controversial--effort \nto examine and adapt the U.S. foreign policy structure to the \nexigencies of the post-cold-war world. I think it is important to note \nthe contributions that the senior Senator from North Carolina has made \nin this regard. I also wish to underscore that in this era of budget \nstringency, I well understand the imperative of consolidation and the \nelimination of duplication in the foreign affairs bureaucracy. I \ntherefore can appreciate Senator Helms' intent in moving this \nlegislation.\n  During my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee, I always have \ntried to work cooperatively and in good faith with Senator Helms. I \nhave appreciated his unmistakable candor, as well as the courtesy he \nextended me when I was chairman. When we have disagreed, we both have \nattempted to do so in an agreeable manner. One of my main reasons for \ndoing so, above and beyond the regard I have for Senator Helms, is the \nimportance that I attach to bipartisanship in foreign policy. I regret \nto note that, for the first time in my memory, this bill was reported \nby the committee on a straight, party-line vote.\n  I also must point out the administration's strenuous opposition to \nthis bill. Secretary of State Warren Christopher outlined the \nadministration's views in a July 25, 1995 letter to me. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, and from which I now will quote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Christopher writes:\n\n       At a time when our nation's security and prosperity demand \n     sustained American engagement in the world, this bill \n     mandates drastic resource reductions for international \n     affairs and undermines the President's constitutional \n     authority to conduct our foreign policy. If S.908 is \n     presented to the President in its current form, I will have \n     no choice but to recommend a veto.\n\n  In a July 26 statement, the President said that S. 908 would attack \nhis constitutional authority to conduct America's foreign policy, and \nthat, ``if this legislation comes to my desk in its present form, I \nwill veto it.'' I ask unanimous consent that the President's veto \nstatement be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PELL. Why, Mr. President, has this bill has become so \ncontroversial that the Secretary would recommend and the President \nwould threaten a veto? The answer lies in the number of proposals that \ncollectively would restrict the President's ability to conduct foreign \npolicy. The most troublesome of these is the plan, outlined in title I \nof the bill, to reorganize entirely our country's foreign policy \nagencies. Specifically, the proposal mandates the elimination of the \nU.S. Agency for International Development [USAID], the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency [ACDA], and USIA, and transfers some of their \nresponsibilities to the State Department. I believe the plan is fraught \nwith problems, and I will address these shortly.\n  In addition to the reorganization plan, there are a number of other \ndisturbing provisions of this bill--particularly with regard to the \nUnited Nations. Having just returned from the 50th anniversary \ncelebration of the founding of the United Nations, I am freshly \nreminded that U.S. interests are well served by our active \nparticipation in the United Nations. I continue to support a vigorous \nand active U.S. involvement in the U.N. system.\n  Titles II and III of this bill, however, contain what might best be \ndescribed as an assault on the U.N. system. Not only does the bill \nauthorize drastic \n\n[[Page S 10932]]\ncuts in funding levels for U.S. assessed contributions to the United \nNations in section 201, it also places extreme new restrictions on U.S. \nparticipation in and involvement with the United Nations. As Secretary \nChristopher noted in his letter to me, ``the funding cuts this bill \nproposes in U.N. accounts and the onerous restrictions it would place \non our ability to support U.N. peacekeeping would reduce our ability to \nachieve meaningful reform.'' The President added further that, ``the \nlegislation would handcuff our ability to take part in and lead United \nNations operations, limiting our choice each time a crisis arose to \nacting alone--or not at all.''\n  Section 205, for instance, would withhold large percentages of the \nU.S. contributions to the United Nations until an annual certification \nis made regarding the Office of the U.N. Inspector General. The section \nlays out criteria that are arbitrary and impossible to certify, which \nwill mean substantial and unnecessary cuts in our contributions to the \nUnited Nations. This section will, as a result, do little to advance \nU.N. reform and will only undercut U.S. leadership at the United \nNations. I hope very much it can be modified.\n  Other sections pertaining to the United Nations in title II are \nequally problematic. In particular, I am concerned about various \nprovisions in sections 203, 217, and 220, as well as other sections, \nand I intend to address these during the course of debate on this bill.\n  Moving beyond the U.N. provisions, Mr. President, I want to focus for \na moment on the reorganization plan and its impact. As many of my \ncolleagues know, the plan is largely the result of the efforts of the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms. As I said \nearlier, Chairman Helms has taken a serious initiative, and already he \nhas made an important contribution to the debate over the conduct of \nforeign affairs in the post-cold-war era.\n  That being said, I am opposed to Congress deciding--on its own--how \nto restructure the way in which the President conducts American foreign \npolicy. Moreover, it is far from clear that this plan represents the \nbest way to adapt our foreign policy structure to our times. That being \nthe case, I do not think it would be prudent for Congress to insist \nthat this President--or any President, for that matter--implement the \nplan.\n  The proponents of this reorganization plan have emphasized cuts, \nconsolidation, and elimination, but in my opinion have not paid \nsufficient attention to the consequences. Nearly everything in this \nplan suggests that the United States should retrench from its global \ncommitments and responsibilities. If taken to its logical conclusion, \nthe plan could well lead the United States on the path toward \nisolationism and withdrawal.\n  As we proceed, I intend to support a Democratic alternative to the \nrestructuring plan. The alternative proposal mandates a reduction in \nthe number of foreign affairs agencies--USAID, ACDA, and USIA, and in \nfact would allow the elimination of all three of them. Where it differs \nfrom the Republican plan is in giving the President--in whom the \nConstitution vests primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign \nrelations--some flexibility to determine how best to organize the \nforeign affairs agencies. Our proposal leaves it to the President to \ndecide which agencies should be eliminated, and how their \nresponsibilities should be restructured.\n  I hope the Senate will give careful consideration to our proposal, as \nit embraces the goals Chairman Helms has set forth during the \ncommittee's consideration of the bill, but goes about achieving them in \nwhat I believe is a more reasonable and practical manner.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee markup of S. 908, a number of \nDemocratic amendments were offered to try to improve the reorganization \nplan and other portions of the bill. I offered an amendment to preserve \nan independent ACDA, which regrettably was defeated as were similar \namendments on USIA and USAID. That being the case, I expect there will \na great many amendments offered in order to improve this bill, \nincluding amendments to save each of the independent foreign affairs \nagencies. Senator Hatfield and I, for example, intend to offer an \namendment on ACDA similar to that offered in committee. In an era when \nthreats to U.S. security are becoming more diverse and challenging, it \ndefies reason that the Congress would want to dismantle the sole \nindependent voice for nonproliferation within the U.S. Government. I \nhope very much that the rest of the Senate will concur.\n  Mr. President, as we approach the onset of the 21st century, it is \nevident that the United States must redefine its place in global \naffairs. To do so, our Presidents must have at their disposal the \nproper tools to develop and implement foreign policies that reflect the \nchanging nature of American interests. If we adopt this bill in its \npresent form, I fear the Congress will--unnecessarily and unwisely--do \ngrave damage to our country's future ability to function as a world \npower. To quote once again the Secretary of State, this bill \n``deliberately gouges our resources and micromanages the funds that \nremain. * * * S. 908, as currently drafted, will have a destructive \neffect on the conduct and character of American foreign policy for \nyears to come.''\n  Mr. President, unless there are dramatic and wholesale changes to \nthis bill, I intend to vote against it. If I happen to lose that vote \nand the Congress enacts this bill, it appears that the President will \nveto. It distresses me very much that our foreign policy is being cast \nin such partisan terms. I do not believe such an approach serves the \ninterests of our Nation or its people.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                        Washington, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Pell: The Senate will soon consider S. 908, \n     the ``Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995.'' At a \n     time when our nation's security and prosperity demand \n     sustained American engagement in the world, this bill \n     mandates drastic resource reductions for international \n     affairs and undermines the President's constitutional \n     authority to conduct our foreign policy. If S. 908 is \n     presented to the President in its current form, I will have \n     no choice but to recommend a veto.\n       This bill's attack on Presidential authority is \n     unprecedented in scope and severity. It interferes with the \n     President's responsibility to structure America's foreign \n     policy apparatus by abolishing three agencies of government \n     and merging their functions into the Department of State. And \n     it slashes the numbers of foreign affairs professionals who \n     are so essential to meet the threats and seize the \n     opportunities of the turbulent post-Cold War world.\n       This bill takes no account of the serious and successful \n     efforts this Administration is taking to streamline the \n     foreign affairs agencies and to consolidate functions among \n     them. The State Department, ACDA, AID, and USIA are all \n     vigorously cutting costs and employment, realigning resources \n     to better match policy priorities, and modernizing \n     communications and information systems. Eliminating these \n     latter three agencies, as the bill proposes, would undermine \n     our effectiveness--not enhance it.\n       While S. 908 contains a number of management authorities \n     sought by the Department of State, the cumulative weight of \n     its restrictions, requirements and prohibitions would \n     obstruct the President's ability to conduct America's foreign \n     policy and cripple America's ability to lead. The bill \n     purports to prohibit any U.S. diplomatic activity in North \n     Korea, thus impeding our ability to implement the North Korea \n     Framework Accord that is helping to put an end to a nuclear \n     crisis on the Korean peninsula. It also interferes with our \n     delicate relations with China, and forces a change in our \n     migration policy that could pose a serious threat to \n     America's borders. We also oppose the provision requiring the \n     Treasury Department to issue licenses permitting letter of \n     credit payments from\n      blocked Iraqi funds where no U.S. bank has a payment \n     obligation, thus favoring certain corporate claimants in a \n     manner not compelled by the law of letters of credit, to \n     the detriment of other U.S. claimants against Iraq, \n     including injured U.S. military personnel.\n       With respect to the United Nations, we share the Congress' \n     concern about the need for reform. In Halifax and in San \n     Francisco, the President directed the world's attention \n     toward this important issue. There is growing support for our \n     reform agenda and a commitment to follow-up on the progress \n     made in Halifax. However, the funding cuts this bill proposes \n     in UN accounts and the onerous restrictions it would place on \n     our ability to support UN peacekeeping would reduce our \n     ability to achieve meaningful reform. We are especially \n     concerned about restrictions on intelligence sharing, and \n     certification requirements related to UNPROFOR in Bosnia and \n     the oversight function in the UN that will be impossible to \n     meet. As the President \n\n[[Page S 10933]]\n     noted in his speech on the UN's 50th Anniversary, turning our back on \n     the UN would increase the economic, political and military \n     burden on the American people.\n       We recognize in this bill the desire of the Congress for a \n     better foreign affairs consultation process, particularly on \n     peacekeeping issues. We believe this can better be achieved \n     through closer cooperation, rather than through legislation \n     that would unduly restrict the ability of this and future \n     Presidents to provide for the nation's security.\n       Finally, this bill's overall cuts in the International \n     Affairs (150) function compromise the safety and well-being \n     of our nation. The tiny fraction of federal spending we \n     devote to international affairs--a mere 1.3 percent of the \n     budget, of which only a third is included in this bill--helps \n     us strengthen American security by fighting the spread of \n     nuclear weapons and technology. It helps us protect American \n     lives by combating terrorists, drug traffickers, and \n     international criminals. It helps us create American jobs by \n     opening foreign markets and promoting U.S. exports. And, it \n     gives force to American principles by bolstering peace, human \n     rights and democracy around the world.\n       Moreover, the preventive diplomacy that the International \n     Affairs budget funds is our first and least costly line of \n     defense. Compare the cost of arms control and diplomatic \n     action to stem proliferation to the price we would pay if \n     rogue states obtained nuclear weapons. Compare the cost of \n     promoting development to the price of coping with famine and \n     refugees. Compare the cost of successful government-to-\n     government and public diplomacy to the cost of military \n     involvement. If we gut our diplomatic activities today, we \n     will face much greater crises with concomitant costs and \n     crises in the future.\n       The Administration cannot support a bill that deliberately \n     gouges our resources and micromanages the funds that remain. \n     We oppose this bill and will also oppose any amendments to \n     this bill that further restrict or restrain the President's \n     ability to safeguard America's interests. We will firmly \n     resist efforts that would have America abdicate its \n     leadership role in global affairs. I firmly believe that S. \n     908, as currently drafted, will have a destructive effect on \n     the conduct and character of American foreign policy for \n     years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                    July 26, 1995.\n\nStatement by the President--The Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of \n                             1995 (S. 908)\n\n       Congress is now considering legislation--S. 908, ``The \n     Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995''--that would \n     undermine the President's authority to conduct our nation's \n     foreign policy and deny us the resources we need to lead in \n     the world. If this legislation comes to my desk in its \n     present form, I will veto it.\n       S. 908 attacks the President's constitutional authority to \n     conduct America's foreign policy. No President--Democrat or \n     Republican--could accept these restrictions because they \n     threaten the President's ability to protect and promote \n     American interests around the world.\n       The legislation would ban or severely restrict diplomatic \n     relations with key countries. Indeed, had it been in effect a \n     few months ago, it would have prevented us from concluding \n     the agreement with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear \n     program. The legislation would handcuff our ability to take \n     part in and lead United Nations operations, limiting our \n     choice each time a crisis arose to acting alone--or not at \n     all. The legislation would abolish three important agencies--\n     the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for \n     International Development, and the U.S. Information Agency. \n     Each is already making serious and successful efforts to \n     streamline its operations, as part of my administration's \n     Reinventing Government program. Eliminating them entirely \n     would undermine our effectiveness, not enhance it.\n       In short, the legislation would put Congress in the \n     business of micro-managing our nation's foreign policy--a \n     business it should not be in.\n       This legislation combined with S. 961, ``the Foreign Aid \n     Reduction Act of 1995'', would also slash our international \n     affairs budget--which already is only a little over 1.3 \n     percent of our total federal budget. We use these funds to \n     fight the spread of nuclear weapons and technology, to combat \n     terrorists, drug traffickers and international criminals; to \n     create American jobs by opening new markets for our exports; \n     and to support the forces of peace, democracy and human \n     rights around the world who look to America for leadership.\n       The proposed cuts in the international affairs budget are \n     dangerous and shortsighted. We know from experience that it \n     is a lot less costly--in terms of money spent and lives \n     lost--to rely on development aid and diplomacy now than it is \n     to send in our troops later. There is a price to be paid for \n     American leadership. But the return on our investment--in \n     terms of increased security and greater prosperity for the \n     American people--more than makes up for the cost. What \n     America cannot afford are the foreign affairs budget cuts \n     proposed in these bills.\n       As I have made clear before, I want to work with Congress \n     to get an international affairs bill I can sign--a bill that \n     protects the President's authority to conduct foreign policy, \n     maintains vital resources and reflects a bipartisan spirit \n     that serves America's interests. The legislation Congress is \n     considering fails each of those tests. If it is sent to me as \n     it now stands, I will veto it.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased today that we are able to \nbring before us the State Department authorization. It is \nrevolutionary, refreshing. It is restructuring. It is an historic bill \nthat, for the first time in decades, looks upon an entire component of \nour Government in a very different fashion.\n  As chair of the International Operations Subcommittee, which has \njurisdiction over these issues, I am very pleased to play a role in the \ncreation and bringing of this legislation before the floor.\n  Before I describe some of the issues and the features of this \nlegislation, I certainly want to express my commendations and \nappreciation for the cooperation and the leadership provided to me and \nto others on the committee, to Chairman Helms, who has brought this \nlegislation to the floor. It is because of his hard work and initiative \nwe are considering it here today.\n  I also want to say I am very pleased to have worked with Senator \nPell, because of his contributions to the committee in the foreign \npolicy arena over the years, and with Senator Kerry, who is the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee.\n  I am not new to these issues. I have worked on these issues in the \nHouse as ranking member of the counterpart subcommittee for more than \n10 years. So many of these issues are very familiar to me. But we have \nnow reached a point where we have to decide how we are going to reform \nour foreign policy apparatus and policymaking bureaucracy.\n  This bill has two main themes: Agency consolidation and deficit \nreduction. It terminates three independent agencies: The Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency, the Agency for International Development, and \nthe U.S. Information Agency. It consolidates arms control, development, \nand public diplomacy within the hierarchy of the State Department. But \nit is far more than just moving bureaucratic boxes around. It \nintegrates important aspects of American foreign policy into our basic \npolicy formulation process. The purpose of this is to improve our \noverall foreign policy, not to diminish the importance of any of these \nfunctions.\n  For example, currently the independent Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency is primarily responsible for the nonproliferation policy. But \nconcerns about nuclear proliferation frames our relations with a range \nof countries around the world, from North Korea to India to Iran. This \nbill will integrate these issues into the policy formulation process at \nthe Department of State. They are too important to be considered as an \nafterthought in the interagency process. And by better coordinating \npublic diplomacy with policy, we will also directly benefit from the \nconduct of our Nation's foreign policy and foreign relations.\n  Public relations plays an increasingly important role in a world that \nis increasingly democratic. Currently, our public diplomacy expertise \nrests in the independent U.S. Information Agency. This bill integrates \nthese fields into our basic foreign policymaking institutions.\n  The world has changed dramatically in the last decade and, with it, \nthe demands on our foreign policy structure. Gone is the cold war and \nthe certainty of a single opposing force in our foreign relations. \nGone, too, is the highly focused foreign policy we once waged against \nan expansionist and authoritarian Soviet Union and its satellites.\n  In the 1990's we face a new imperative: To maintain a strong, \naggressive foreign policy, but to streamline our operations, achieve \ncost savings, and meet the new criteria of a changing world. State \nDepartment consolidation is an idea whose time has come.\n  In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the \nreigniting of ethnic strife that has been kept bottled up by the cold \nwar, we live in a new world. But it is not necessarily a safer world, \nas a multitude of crises across the world have proven in the last few \nyears. Our legislation offers a fast, flexible foreign affairs \nstructure that \n\n[[Page S 10934]]\nwe require and it also offers the promise of significant long-term cost \nsavings.\n  This leads me to the second characteristic of this legislation and \nthat is, of course, deficit reduction. Not only does this bill \nrestructure Government within our foreign policy institutions to make \nit smaller, more efficient, but it also does so at a lesser cost. These \ntwo themes are very closely related and I believe will improve our \nNation's ability to conduct a truly coordinated and consistent foreign \npolicy.\n  But, without agency consolidation, we simply cannot meet our deficit \nreduction requirements without much deeper program cuts in the \ninternational affairs account. The Congressional Budget Office has \nindicated that the consolidation plan would save $3 billion over the \nnext 4 years. And, frankly, Secretary of State Christopher had \noriginally proposed this consolidation plan last fall, even though the \ninteragency process did not permit the proposal to go forward with the \nadministration, and that is regrettable, because I think it did prevent \na bipartisan discussion of this restructuring proposal.\n  Even Vice President Gore had recommended, and said, in fact, the \nadministration would come forward with a reinventing Government \ninitiative for the State Department and its foreign affairs related \nagencies, with a planned savings of $5 billion over the next 5 years. \nWe have yet to see that plan, let alone the administration's \nlegislative proposal for the reauthorization of the State Department.\n  In all my years having managed this bill for the Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives, we have always had an authorization proposal \nfrom the administration--whether or not they agreed with subsequently \nwhat the committee might or might not do. So I regret this bill is \ncoming forward without bipartisan support. We have tried to be \nreceptive to ideas, to incorporate those ideas into this restructuring. \nBut we have yet to hear those ideas.\n  The fact is, I think this is the kind of legislation that demands \nbipartisan support. We received the unanimous support of the \nRepublicans on the committee. It certainly is not too late to be \nengaged in a bipartisan process, but it is important that we understand \nthat consolidation is necessary, and it is not because we are saying we \nare going to deemphasize these areas within the State Department. In \nfact, I say we are reemphasizing them in a different fashion as we move \nforward to integrate these functions more efficiently.\n  I am also disappointed by the administration's apparent unwillingness \nand its specific policy of not engaging us in the field of ideas with \nrespect to this major restructuring of the State Department. Rather, \ntheir strategy seems to be embodied in the explicit words of an \ninternal AID memorandum that was leaked to the press recently.\n\n       The strategy is to delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail--if \n     we derail, we can kill the merger.\n\n  So I think that is an unfortunate approach to one of the most \nsignificant consolidation issues in recent years. But I would like to \ndescribe the features of this legislation because I do think it is \nimportant for the Members of this body to fully understand and \ncomprehend what we are attempting to do through this consolidation \nproposal.\n  As I said, we are abolishing three agencies and transferring their \nfunctions within the State Department. I believe the State Department \nitself will be enhanced as well as reorganized in a way that will \nsignificantly improve the way in which we can develop our foreign \npolicy agenda.\n  The operations of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the \nUSIA, although streamlined, will be directly merged into the State \nDepartment's policymaking structure. If you have any doubt as to \nwhether or not we should have a restructuring consolidation of these \nthree agencies within the State Department, only look at this graph, at \nthe current structure of our foreign affairs agency. You can see it is \nrather complicated, convoluted. There is duplication. It is much more \ncomplex, in terms of trying to make decisions; certainly less \nefficient. In today's world, whether it is the public or private \nsector, everyone is looking toward more efficiency for less money and \nmaking it more effective.\n  What we are trying to do through this reoganization is streamlining \nthe process so the Secretary of State is better equipped to make those \ndecisions more efficiently. It is not to say that arms control is not \nimportant, or public diplomacy is not important, or development \nassistance is not important. What it is saying is, it is necessary to \nefficiently incorporate it into the structure that gets the Secretary's \nattention.\n  As many have said in the past, and before the committee, you do not \nhave to have a separate independent agency to make it a priority. I \nthink that is important.\n  As you can see here, something has to be done. Just looking at this \nchart, it is clear that we have to revise and consolidate and make it \nmore efficient in today's post-cold-war world.\n  I want to compare it to what we are proposing in this legislation. \nAnd you can see that we have far fewer boxes, far fewer areas. We are \nmaking it far more efficient to make those decisions.\n  I think that these charts certainly illustrate what we are attempting \nto accomplish through this legislation. It is an idea whose time has \ncome. Even Secretary Christopher indicated in a speech before State \nDepartment employees back in March when they were doing the strategic \nmanagement initiative that this was the 90th report since 1946 aimed at \na restructuring and improving the State Department. And I am quoting \nnow. He said, ``It is there gathering dust in the file cabinets.''\n  So a lot of these ideas have been around. But I think that what has \nhappened in the post-cold-war period has given us the impetus to begin \nthe approach to consolidate. And that is why I think it is also \nessential to have bipartisan input. That is why I regret today that has \nnot occurred.\n  As the Agency for International Development, this bill will\n   more closely tie our foreign assistance programs to policy goals \nintended to directly advance our national interests. This will be \naccomplished by integrating regional foreign aid decisions into the \nState Department's regional policy bureaus.\n\n  Former Under Secretary Bill Schneider--who was responsible for \ncoordinating the entire international affairs budget for the Reagan \nadministration--testified before my subcommittee. He noted that AID's \nstructure, autonomy, and management precludes a sharp focus on using \nour aid resources to support foreign policy functions. By its very \nnature, he argued, AID programs have little behavioral impact on the \nrecipient in terms of advancing U.S. foreign policy interests.\n  Former Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger confirmed this argument, \nby arguing for consolidating AID into State in order that bilateral \nforeign assistance be more closely related to specific, identifiable \nU.S. foreign policy interests.\n  Today's AID will be transformed into a leaner State Department \nmechanism for delivering foreign assistance. Today, vast amounts of our \nhumanitarian and developmental aid is consumed by AID's huge \nadministrative cost structure and field apparatus. For instance, there \nare 690 AID employees stationed at our Embassy in Cairo alone.\n  Out of a $2.3 billion developmental aid account, AID spends $600 \nmillion on its formal operating expenses account. This is 25 cents for \nevery developmental dollar.\n  But in reality, AID's administrative costs are much higher because \nAID's formal operating expenses only count 5,000 out of its 9,000 \nemployees worldwide. The remaining 4,000 are AID contract employees who \nare paid out of program funds, not operating expenses.\n  In looking at the Arms Control Development Agency, we certainly \nshould take very seriously the concerns that have been expressed by \narms control advocates in the administration.\n  We should also, however, consider the observations of former ACDA \nDirector Fred Ikle who testified before my subcommittee that moving \nforward with a proposal as innovative and necessary as this is opposed \nbecause it: ``hurts the pride and prestige of the affected officials, \njeopardizes job security and mobilizes throngs of contractors, captive \nprofessional organizations, and other beneficiaries.'' \n\n[[Page S 10935]]\n\n  Director Ikle also noted that people who want to preserve an \ninstitution long after they have served their purpose believe they do \nso for the noblest of reasons, but at the core of their argument is \ninevitably: ``the tendency of bureaucracies to become more vigorous and \ngrow in size as their initial purpose is overtaken by events.''\n  Director Ikle noted that ACDA was formed 34 years ago out of the need \nto maintain a tightly focused agency dedicated to continuity and \ncompetence in negotiations with a single adversary, the Soviet Union. \nNow, he noted, there is no more need for an independent agency working \nonly on arms control issues than there would be for a separate U.S. \nagency for counterterrorism, global communications, or international \ncrime.\n  I guess I could argue that there should be separate agencies even for \nthose categories.\n  Former NSC Adviser Brent Scowcroft noted at the same hearing, that \nthis changed focus of arms control argues against an independent ACDA. \nHe observed that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the \nsingle most important arms control issue today. The full range of \npolicy tools needed to addressing proliferation issues simply cannot be \naccomplished out of an isolated, insular ACDA. This, he argued can only \nbe pursued through the broader institutions of State and DOD.\n\n\n                                  usia\n\n  The most logical fit of all is the consolidation of the U.S. \nInformation Agency into the State Department. At our overseas posts, \nState Department and USIA operations work together in an almost \nseamless fashion.\n  The top USIA officer at post is the public affairs officer, who \noperates as the Ambassador's close media adviser and the Embassy's \npress officer. The USIA operation at post conducts outreach into the \ngrassroots organizations and maintains contacts with all those who help \nshape public opinion in the country.\n  The purpose of this consolidation would be to bring this same level \nof coordination to Washington. A better understanding of and \nappreciation for the impact of international public opinion can only \nhelp us to formulate better overall foreign policy.\n  Former NSC Adviser Scowcroft and former Secretary Eagleburger made \nthis same observation, when they noted that public diplomacy is a \nfunction with continuing and growing needs. They noted that in the \nworld today, individuals, groups, and publics have an increasing affect \non how the United States is viewed and how our foreign policy is \nreceived. We need to incorporate this capacity, they said, into our \ncore foreign policy institution.\n  The logic of combining these two agencies is even recognized by the \ninspector general offices of the State Department and USIA. Over the \npast few years, they have adopted the practice of jointly conducting \ntheir periodic inspections of diplomatic posts. They do this together, \nbecause the State Department and USIA functions at post are so closely \nintegrated.\n  This legislation sets up a 2-year transition period. The three \nagencies would be merged into the State Department by March 1, 1997. \nDuring this transition period, the bill sets up a mechanism for the \nPresident to transmit to Congress his own consolidation plan. The \nPresident would be guaranteed quick action by Congress under expedited \nprocedures.\n  So the President could in response to this plan offer his own very \nspecific plan that would require a resolution of approval. But the fact \nis that this legislation gives the President the opportunity, as well \nas the flexibility, to submit his own plan, or modifications to this \nplan, and it would require a resolution of approval by Congress.\n  There are other issues in this legislation that I will not get into \nhere today. Some of the issues that I have included, and others have \nincluded, are very essential to the overall bill.\n  I know there is a great deal of anxiety about this legislation among \nthe dedicated and hard-working employees of our foreign affairs \nagencies. And I understand that concern. I have worked with them over \nthe years, and they have done an admirable, commendable job in \nimplementing their responsibilities. But I think we are dealing in a \ndifferent world today. We have to come to recognize that we have to do \nthings somewhat differently.\n  That is why I certainly would prefer the administration working in \nconjunction with the chairman and myself and other members of committee \nto develop a plan that has a bipartisan consensus because the scope of \nthis legislation calls for a more proactive role on the part of this \nadministration. In fact, they have an obligation as well as a \nresponsibility to do so. But to maintain silence on this issue is \nunacceptable, let alone understandable, given the magnitude of this \nconsolidation and given the fact that it is affecting our foreign \npolicymaking apparatus.\n  I hope that during this process we will hear from them, not simply to \nstonewall, as the chairman said, this process, but to help expedite \nthis process of consolidation and integration of our foreign affairs \nagencies.\n  This approach should be bipartisan. There is nothing Republican or \nDemocratic about this approach. This should be an approach that \neverybody can endorse, and, in fact, Secretary Christopher had even \nrecommended this approach last fall only to be rejected by others \nwithin the administration.\n  As the chairman has indicated, five former Secretaries of State have \nsupported this initiative. I think that is significant. The time has \ncome for this kind of consolidation, and it is not gutting it because \nthe issue of restructuring, as even Secretary Christopher indicated, \nhas been done over the years, but the changes as a result of the end of \nthe cold war has compelled us to look at these issues very \nrealistically. We are not saying that this is a perfect plan. But it is \nvery difficult to work with the other side when they are unwilling to \nwork to make the revisions that they think are necessary to do this \nlegislation.\n  During one of our subcommittee hearings on this plan, former Bush \nadministration official Bob Kimmit, who was Under Secretary of State, \nsaid that when he was asked to testify, he gave his proposal very \ncareful and serious review. The standard he used in deciding his \nposition on this was whether he would be as enthusiastic in support if \nit had been proposed by the Clinton administration rather than by the \nRepublican Congress,\n or if it had been advanced by a Democratic Congress during a second \nBush administration.\n\n  Mr. Kimmit, together with a great number of our witnesses, made a \ncommon observation: To place a priority on the issue does not require a \nseparate agency. No one questions the importance of arms control, \npublic diplomacy or international development. Imagine if the principle \nof maintaining a separate agency for every important policy issue were \napplied throughout our Federal Government. There would be no end to \norganizational proliferation.\n  I think we get some idea just based on the current chart with respect \nto the State Department and its related agencies and the bureaucratic \nconfusion that has been created as a result of the multitude of \nagencies that exist within these agencies.\n  This is not a Republican plan against a Democratic administration. \nThis is an American plan that would benefit all future American \nadministrations, both Republican and Democratic.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider it on its own merits, devoid of \npartisan considerations. If considered on this basis, I believe we will \nreceive overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle.\n  The bill before us is breathtaking, not just in its scope but in the \nquality of the recommendations and gives credit to our chairman, to our \ncommittee, and to all the Senators who have been involved in its \ncreation.\n  In the final analysis, whether you are Republican or Democrat, what \nwe are doing here today would be arguing for fundamental, positive \nchange in our Government. This is a chance to cast a vote for exactly \nthe kind of change that the American people want. This is a vote for \ncost savings and efficiencies we will need to advance and if we are \ncertainly going to meet our deficit reduction goals required by the \nbudget resolution that passed the Congress. But also more importantly \nit is to advance our foreign policy goals. I think in the final \nanalysis this is exactly what this legislation would do.\n  On a final note, I should say that not only do I commend the \nemployees within these various agencies but also \n\n[[Page S 10936]]\nthe directors and the administrators because without a doubt they have \nbeen hard-working, dedicated individuals who are committed to their \ngoals. And although we may disagree on this consolidation, I want to \nmake sure I give credit to those individuals who currently head these \nagencies because clearly they have worked very hard to try to do what \nthey can with the kind of mandates received within current law and with \nthe structures that they have had to live with. And I understand their \ncommitment to maintaining the current structure. But I think they also \nhopefully understand we have to meet the goals that are required of us \nthrough not only the budget resolution but also because the climate and \nthe circumstances have now changed.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that as we go through this process in the \nfinal analysis we will be able to get a reorganization of State \nDepartment agencies necessary to meet the future commitments of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senate has just heard a remarkable \ndiscourse by the able Senator from Maine, whom I have long admired. She \nis certainly an addition to the wisdom of the Senate on many matters, \nespecially foreign affairs. I wish to thank her for her diligent work \non this bill, and I thank her for the great statement she just \ndelivered.\n  Mr. President, another distinguished member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee who has done so well in assisting in the drafting of this \nbill is Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. He is chairman of the East \nAsian Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I hope the \nChair will recognize him.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for the opportunity to comment \non this bill. I rise to place my full support behind Chairman Helms and \nthe efforts to overhaul and streamline the Department of State.\n  These bills are very complicated, of course, and throughout the \nduration of this debate and discussion it will be hard to track. Let me \nread just a couple of paragraphs from a letter the chairman sent to me \nthat I think is fairly succinct.\n\n       Six weeks ago, with the support of every Republican Member, \n     the Foreign Relations Committee passed S. 908, the Foreign \n     Relations Revitalization Act. This legislation is the first \n     authorization measure to reach the Senate floor within budget \n     targets, fulfilling the mandate the American people gave us \n     last November. This bill is a promise kept: Money is saved, \n     bureaucracy eliminated, and the ability of our Nation to \n     conduct foreign policy enhanced.\n       This reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy apparatus \n     saves $3.66 billion over four years. A similar measure has \n     already passed the House. Three agencies, the Arms Control \n     and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for International \n     Development, and the United States Information Agency are \n     abolished and their functions are rolled into the Department \n     of State.\n       The core functions of these agencies are not lost. Despite \n     propagandizing to the contrary, independent broadcasting is \n     protected; arms control and non-proliferation will be \n     strengthened; and the assistance programs which support \n     national interests will be liberated from a convoluted AID \n     bureaucracy. This consolidation plan has been endorsed by \n     five former U.S. Secretaries of State. . . . And as Henry \n     Kissinger recently said, if given a truth serum, Secretary \n     Christopher would endorse it too.\n\n  That summarizes, it seems to me, what it is we are seeking to do \nhere. The chairman has spoken at length, and the Senator from Maine in \nher excellent commentary spoke about the need for important \nlegislation, so I will not cover that same territory.\n  The changes proposed in S. 908 are long overdue. What I will address, \nhowever, is the way in which AID and this administration has handled \nitself in the face of the chairman's efforts. From the beginning, \ninstead of cooperating in a constructive effort to work with the \nCongress in cutting waste, overlapping responsibilities, and outmoded \nand outdated programs, the administration has chosen to ignore and \nstonewall. The word has gone out to the bureaucrats and to the Democrat \nMembers of Congress that this is the party line. A memo that was quoted \nearlier indicated that the strategy is to ``delay, postpone, obfuscate, \nderail. If we derail, we can kill the merger,'' it says. ``Official \nword is we don't care if there is a State authorization bill this \nyear.''\n  As a result, it has been strongly rumored that we will face a flurry \nof amendments to this bill as we have seen in other bills in a veiled \nattempt to filibuster. So much for the administration's dedication to \nreinventing Government.\n  Requests for meetings have gone unanswered, as have requests for \ninformation. Instead of working with Congress, AID has gone out of its \nway to preserve itself by spreading confusion and panic among \norganizations with which it does business, by distorting the purpose \nand the probable impact of S. 908. Many of these practices I believe \ncome close to pressing the breaking of the law. For instance, I am \naware of AID staffers who have contacted several private groups and \nurged them to lobby for the defeat of S. 908. My office has received \nalmost weekly information packets from AID including xeroxed copies of \narticles and editorials in opposition to the merger--omitting, of \ncourse, those that are in favor.\n  I find it highly improper that AID is spending taxpayer dollars in \nsupplies and employee time lobbying us for their own continuation.\n  Mr. President, S. 908 is supported by five former Secretaries of \nState and, until overruled by the White House, Secretary Christopher. \nIt is an idea whose time has come. Its time is here. At a time when we \ndo not have enough money to take care of our own citizens' fundamental \nneeds and are consequently forced to rethink the funding levels in our \ndomestic budget, to argue that we cannot make similar difficult cuts in \nthe structure of foreign policy is both disingenuous and unrealistic.\n  So again, Mr. President, I rise in support of this proposal. I think \nit is one of the things that the voters said to us in 1994. They said \nwe need to make some changes in the way the Federal Government \noperates; that the Government is too big, it spends too much, and that \nwe should find better ways to deliver services; that we should find \nmore efficient ways to use tax dollars.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those ways, and I urge support for this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong, enthusiastic support of \nS. 908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act. As a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I am proud to have voted for this \ngroudbreaking legislation to fundamentally reform America's foreign \naffairs agencies.\n  For much of this year, Congress has responded to the voters' demand \nto shrink the Federal Government and reduce its intrusion in their \nlives. But it is not just our domestic agencies that are in need of an \noverhaul.\n  S. 908 fulfills two important goals: First, it will help to reshape \nthe State Department so that we can better meet the new challenges of a \nrapidly changing world. And second, it will apply our limited financial \nresources in a more realistic and effective way.\n  Unfortunately, the President's proposed budget for 1996 would \nactually increase international affairs spending by $950 million, and \nthat is hardly evidence of a strong commitment to balancing the budget.\n  Moreover, some administration officials--as well as some Members of \nthis body--have thrown around reckless accusations about this bill's \nefforts to reorganize the State Department. They charge that it somehow \nrepresents a move to withdraw the United States from international \naffairs.\n  But make no mistake. It is our desire, and America's responsibility, \nto remain actively and productively engaged around the world that make \nthis legislation so necessary.\n  While the administration has been busy crying ``isolationism\" and \ndoing everything in its power to block consideration of S. 908, five \nformer Secretaries of State have come forward to ardently endorse it.\n  Former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and former National \nSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft testified on the clear connection \nbetween the cold war and the expansion of the Federal bureaucracy:\n\n\n[[Page S 10937]]\n\n       [T]his proliferation of agencies occurred in response to \n     security-related concerns which have since diminished or \n     disappeared. Therefore, we are now encumbered by a plethora \n     of programs which no longer are closely tied to, or clearly \n     serve, U.S. national interests. . . . [The] origins of the \n     agencies being considered for abolition are all rooted in a \n     world which no longer exists.\n\n  And former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger--not known for \n``isolationist'' tendencies--wrote,\n\n       What is needed is steadiness, coherence and precision in \n     the articulation and implementation of policies. . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Your proposal to abolish the Agency for International \n     Development, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the \n     U.S. Information Agency is a bold step in this direction by \n     centralizing authority and responsibility for the conduct of \n     foreign affairs where it properly belongs--in the President's \n     senior foreign affairs advisor, the Secretary of State.\n\n  Even current Secretary of State Warren Christopher reportedly made a \nsimilar proposal to Vice President Gore's ``Reinventing Government'' \nteam. But, unfortunately, the Vice President chose to reject the \nSecretary's plan and, instead, capitulated to the cold war \nreactionaries in the administration who are intent on preserving their \npet agencies at all costs.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, Congress must act responsibly with the \ntaxpayers' money and do for the State Department what it could not do \nfor itself. Rather than ``micromanage'' State Department reform, S. 908 \npreserves substantial flexibility for the President and the Secretary \nof State to determine its new organizational structure.\n  Given the complete lack of cooperation Congress has received on this \nissue from the administration, allowing such flexibility may be \nconsidered a ``leap of faith.'' However, I firmly believe Congress \nshould guide and agencies should be expected to perform.\n  Above all, Mr. President, the heart of S. 908 must be kept intact. \nThe consolidation of AID, ACDA and USIA under the State Department will \nend the current duplication of many functions and personnel.\n  As a result, S. 908 will save the taxpayers $4.8 billion over 5 years \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. The international affairs \nbudget must take its fair share of reductions to keep us on track to \nbalancing the budget in 2002.\n  But I want to remind my colleagues that without the efficient and \nprudent savings in the State Department reorganization plan, cuts in \nforeign aid programs will have to be that much deeper.\n  Finally, I hope that this bill--combined with S. 961, the Foreign Aid \nReduction Act--will encourage a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign \naid.\n  We all know that foreign aid is held in low esteem by many Americans. \nGiven the track record of AID and the minimal performance of some \nforeign aid programs, this is hardly surprising. We must not abdicate \nour oversight responsibilities. By enacting the legislation before us \ntoday, we can begin rehabilitating foreign aid in the eyes of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, we must ask ourselves: Do we really need a bureaucracy \nof 9,300 employees and contractors to manage foreign aid programs? \nThere are 405 employees at AID's Egypt mission in Cairo alone. And it \ncosts the taxpayers $150,000 to $300,000 a year--not counting salary--\nto station just one AID employee overseas.\n  We must focus our efforts on making sure that foreign aid actually \nreaches people in need rather than getting swallowed up by oversized \nU.S. and foreign bureaucracies.\n  I support an approach that conducts more of our foreign aid programs \nthrough non-governmental organizations and private voluntary \norganizations. These are groups that generally have much lower overhead \ncosts than AID.\n  As we reevaluate foreign aid and demand that it become more \naccountable, more efficient and more effective, we must also examine \nthe actions of those countries which receive taxpayer dollars.\n  Foreign aid cannot provide real, sustainable development unless \nrecipient countries are dedicated to economic freedom and free-market \nreforms. To renew Americans' faith in foreign aid, we must show them \nproven results.\n  We cannot afford to run an international welfare program which \nsubsidizes countries that show no progress toward economic self-\nsufficiency. Just like our broken welfare system at home, such a \nprogram will only encourage dependency and continue to burden the \ntaxpayers for years to come.\n  In closing, Mr. President, S. 908 offers all Senators this \nopportunity: We have all talked a good game about eliminating agencies \nthat are outmoded or inefficient. Now the question is can we actually \ndo it.\n  I urge all Members to vote for S. 908, not just for the sake of \neliminating three agencies, but because doing so will help ensure that \nAmerica has the foreign policy tools necessary to take us into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I want to pay my respects to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota. He is one of the newer members on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. He is always there, and he has always \ndone his homework. I congratulate him on his statement, and I thank him \nfor his participation in the work of the committee.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I intend to speak on the foreign \nrelations proposal at a later time, but I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes in regard to the welfare \nsituation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10929-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10937-S10938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to speak \nthis afternoon. The President of the United States is speaking about \nthe welfare situation. He has promised to end welfare as we know it, \nand it is important, as we approach the debate on welfare in the U.S. \nSenate, that we thoroughly understand the condition in which we find \nourselves as a result of 30 years during which Washington has dictated \na radical theory of welfare on America's poor.\n  The theory is that bureaucrats in Washington are best equipped to \nsolve the welfare problem. Since the mid-sixties, we have spent nearly \n$5.4 trillion on welfare, and the theory that Washington knows best is \nas dead and as hopeless as many of the people it was intended to help.\n  Most of America realizes this. Many Members of the Senate realize \nthis. But, unfortunately, it does not appear that the President \nrealizes this. Today in Vermont, veiled in glorious rhetoric, President \nClinton announced his intention, again, to end welfare as we know it. \nBut he revealed his intention to expand welfare beyond what we have \never known.\n  Like so much with this administration's public policy, what sounds \ngreat frequently is different from what is reality. The old adage, \n``signal right and turn left,'' has found new meaning in this \nadministration. When you are riding down the highway and someone \nsignals right and then turns left, it can be a very difficult and \ndangerous situation, and I am afraid that is what has happened here.\n  The reality of the Clinton plan is that it will result in more \nmisery, more hopelessness, and more despair in America's poor. It will \nprovide a boost to Washington's welfare establishment. The bureaucracy \nwill burgeon. We need another way of helping the poor. It is a way \nwhich recognizes that the States have an opportunity, and should have \nan opportunity, to tailor welfare solutions to meet the needs of their \ncitizens.\n  Last week, I spoke about Ariel Hill, a 5-month-old child, a victim of \nthe welfare system. I am sure she would have said that we needed \nanother approach to welfare. Today, I want to talk about another tragic \nstory, another personal example of welfare's failure.\n  In the picture next to me is Ernesto Ventura, a 4-year-old child who \nwas brutally abused and neglected by his mother. Though the crime was \ncommitted only a year ago, its roots began about 30 years ago at the \nbeginning of \n\n[[Page S 10938]]\na cycle of dependency, a cycle of hopelessness and Government sanction, \nGovernment approval.\n  The story begins in the fall of 1968 when Eulalia Rivera left Puerto \nRico and came to the Columbia Housing Project in Dorchester, an inner-\ncity Boston neighborhood. Within weeks after arriving in Massachusetts, \nEulalia went on welfare to support herself and her family. Her first \ncheck, instead of providing a solid foundation on which to build, \nbecame a milestone in her life, marking the first leg of a journey \nwhich has not ended to this day. ``I remember the first check,'' \nEulalia told a reporter for the Boston Globe. ``It was for $75 a month \nback then.'' The checks have never stopped and the hope has never \ngrown.\n  Eulalia never left the housing project where she first lived, and in \nthis place she raised 17 children, 14 of whom were still living as \nadults. Her daughter, Clarabel, has abused her son. Of these 17 \nchildren, almost none graduated from high school, and they have \nproduced 74 grandchildren, many of whom entered the welfare system \nthemselves.\n  As you can see on this chart, these are the children of Eulalia, and \nvirtually all of them receive at least one form of welfare benefit: \nSSI, due to suffering from a nervous condition, also collects $120 a \nmonth in food stamps; another child receives: Medicaid, subsidized \nhousing, AFDC, food stamps; this child receives Medicaid, subsidized \nhousing. Here is Medicaid, subsidized housing, food stamps, SSDI; food \nstamps, SSDI, AFDC. It just goes on in each of these cases. AFDC, SSI, \nMedicaid, subsidized housing, food stamps; AFDC, SSDI; AFDC.\n  This is the story of the intergenerational web, the lack of hope. \nFifteen great-grandchildren now comprise the fourth generation of this \nwelfare setting. The type of benefits received by the extended family \nare the alphabet soup of acronyms--all perfectly legal, and just as \nperfectly destructive to the human spirit. Many of Eulalia's \ndescendents are considered disabled due to a medical condition \ndiagnosed as anxiety attacks. SSI pays these individuals a monthly \ncheck in lieu of the jobs they are unable to perform. While \ninterviewing Clarabel's family to find the motivation behind the \ntragedy of her son's abuse, a Boston Globe reporter found that the \ncycle continues, noting several school-aged children at home watching \nMTV at 1:30 in the afternoon.\n  Theirs is a family that has given up hope of finding jobs or \nreceiving an education, a family caught in a system which rewards \nillegitimacy and discourages work. Their lives revolve around a monthly \ncheck, a dangerous public housing project, and empty dreams.\n  In the words of Robert Coard, director of the antipoverty agency \nAction for Boston Community Development:\n\n       This family is a classic example of a poverty-stricken \n     class. They are the ones who have given up.\n\n  The tragedy of this story is perhaps most evident in Clarabel Rivera \nVentura's life. At the time she abused Ernesto, she was 26 years old \nand pregnant, a mother of six, by five different fathers. Even her \nfamily is not sure about the identities of these men. ``Oh, wow,'' her \nbrother Juan told the Globe, ``I have no idea.'' Eulalia gave the same \nanswer. ``I don't even know who they are.''\n  A young woman caught up in the overwhelming system, Clarabel Ventura \nhad no hope, no education, no prospects, and her will to improve her \nlot in life sapped by every check she received. Perhaps she looked to \ndrugs as a way out.\n  Neighbors said that Clarabel sold food stamps and even the family's \nwashing machine to get money to purchase crack--shouting at and \nstriking her children in frustration, neglecting the needs of the \nchildren in order to serve her own addiction. Reportedly, Clarabel \nwould send her children out alone after midnight to beg for money, \ncigarettes, and food from other residents in their housing project. \nFinally, something snapped. In a rage, Clarabel plunged 4-year-old \nErnesto's arm into boiling water, severely burning him. It was nearly 3 \nweeks before she sought medical treatment for the wounds. When \nparamedics finally arrived on the scene, they found Ernesto in a back \nroom on a bare mattress, smeared with his own blood and excrement. His \nmother, he said, had abused him because she was mad.\n  Government-sponsored poverty has a face, it has a soul, it has \nfeelings and a body that can be hurt. Every day, children just like \nErnesto suffer in an environment which Washington has created. They \nhave no say. They cannot vote, they cannot read, they often are barely \nold enough to talk. But they pay the price of Washington's arrogant \ndemand that the entire country run a welfare system in accordance with \nthe bureaucrats' dictates.\n  The fact that welfare needs a major overhaul is beyond debate. \nWashington's one-size-fits-all bureaucratic micromanaged welfare system \nhas failed, and failed miserably. Unfortunately, President Clinton's \nsolution is nothing more than 1988 revisited, rearranging the deck \nchairs on the Welfare Titanic, just as Washington has done in prior \nattempts at reformation.\n  In 1988, Washington reformed welfare. The result has been an increase \nin spending for welfare programs of over 40 percent. We have more \nchildren in poverty today than when the war on poverty began. If there \nis anything we have learned, it is that no one solution from Washington \nhas worked in the past or will work in the future.\n  We have a mandate from the American people to tackle the welfare \nissue head on. If Congress is going to be serious, we need to do more \nthan reform the welfare system. We need to replace it. First, because \none-size-fits-none, we need to stop the system as we now know it. We \nneed to transfer to the States, in a significant way, the opportunity \nto craft real solutions. Bringing the States, under the guise of \nwaiver-granting, to Washington, DC to gain the stamp of approval from \nthis failed system is the wrong way of doing business and must be \ncurtailed.\n  Second, Government and dollars alone will not solve the problem. We \nneed to bring in nongovernmental, charitable organizations, and \ncitizens to be a part of the solution.\n  Finally, let me say that as we debate welfare reform in the days to \ncome, and as we confront the issue in the U.S. Senate, we have to \nunderstand that this is not just a debate about numbers. This is a \ndebate about families, about human beings, where despair has come and \nhope is gone. We need to involve ourselves as communities and citizens. \nWe need to disengage from the idea that Washington knows all and knows \nbest. We need to make available to the people of this country the \nopportunity to tailor solutions to this challenge in State and local \narenas.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S10937-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10938-S10959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  FOREIGN RELATIONS REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the pending business is the State Department \nrevitalization?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2025\n\n (Purpose: To withhold $3,500,000 from the ``International Conferences \nand Contingencies'' Account if the State Department expended funds for \n  the World Conference on Women while Harry Wu was being detained in \n                                 China)\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for himself, Ms. Snowe, \n     Mr. Lott, and Mr. Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 2025.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 81, line 3, add the following:\n       (c) Further Conditional Authority.--\n       (1) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated for Fiscal \n     year 1996, in (a), $3,500,000 shall be withheld from \n     obligation until the Secretary of State certifies to the \n     appropriate congressional committees, with respect to the \n     United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women being held in \n     Beijing, that no funds available to the Department of State \n     were obligated or expended for United States participation in \n     the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women while \n     Harry Wu, a United States citizen, was detained by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n\n[[Page S 10939]]\n\n       (2) If the Secretary of State cannot make the certification \n     in Section 301 (c)(1), the withheld funds shall be returned \n     to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is for funding for international \nconferences. S. 908 is an important piece of legislation. It provides \nfor a massive reinvention of our foreign affairs bureaucracies. Because \nof this, I am fearful that many of my colleagues on the other side, in \nfact, maybe all of my colleagues, will not let us complete action on \nthis bill.\n  Chairman Helms and the subcommittee Chairperson Snowe deserves credit \nfor bringing this landmark bill to the floor. I signed a letter in \nsupport of this earlier today, and ask that it be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. I signed the letter, along with Senator Helms and Senator \nSnowe.\n  Regardless of what happens on the cloture vote tomorrow, there is an \nissue we should address today: The United States plan to attend the \nfourth U.N. Conference on Women, scheduled for September in Beijing, \nChina. My amendment would withhold $3.5 million--50 percent of the \ntotal account--unless the Secretary of State certifies no United States \nfunds were expended to finance a United States delegation to the \nwomen's conference while Harry Wu is detained in China.\n  As you know, since June 19, Harry Wu has been detained in China. \nConsular access to him, guaranteed under the terms of our 1982 \nagreement with China, was originally delayed. Last week, a suspicious \ntape was released by Beijing with Harry Wu confessing that his past \nexposes on human rights abuses in China were untrue. On July 9, Harry \nWu was charged with offenses which could carry the death penalty. In \nlight of his years of experience in the Chinese gulag, there is ample \nreason to fear for Harry Wu's safety.\n  Our relationship with China is at a crucial crossroads. We have many \ndisputes with Beijing including trade, proliferation, human rights, and \nTaiwan. We must, however, choose our course of action carefully. As Dr. \nHenry Kissinger said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nearlier this month. ``The danger of the existing rollercoaster toward \nconfrontation to the United States and China is incalculable.'' I share \nDr. Kissinger's concern over the dangers of a full-scale confrontation.\n  However, the most fundamental duty of a government is to protect the \nrights of its citizens--and Harry Wu is an American citizen. I urge the \nChinese to release him. No improvement in relations will be possible as \nlong as he is detained.\n  Mr. President, there are many problems with the fourth U.N. \nConference on Women. I share the view recently expressed by Senator \nKassebaum and Congressman Hamilton on U.N. conferences:\n\n       The United Nations is in Peril of becoming little more than \n     a road show traveling from conference to conference. If an \n     issue is serious, a conference will not solve it; if it is \n     not serious, a conference is a waste of time.\n\n  In my view, the United States should stay away from any U.N. \nconference with goals and agendas which do nothing to promote American \ninterests--whether they are held in Beijing, Brusslels, or Boston.\n  There are many reasons to stay away from the U.N. Women's \nConference--from the systematic exclusion of certain nongovernment \norganizations to the irony of holding a human rights conference in a \ncountry with a poor human rights record. The tilt toward anti-\nAmericanism and radicalism--always present in lowest common denominator \nU.N. conferences--was particularly pronounced for the Women's \nConference. There was even a controversy over the definition of gender \nin the preparatory meetings of the conference.\n  There should be no doubt that China will use the Women's Conference \nto enhance its prestige and international image. It is our view that \nthe United States should not be a party to what will surely be a \npropaganda exercise as long as Harry Wu is detained. It would be wrong \nto attend a human rights conference when an American citizen is \nunjustly detained.\n  We should be realistic. The administration can use already \nappropriated funds to go to Beijing. We cannot stop that today. \nHowever, we can make our position clear. For the administration, the \nchoice in this amendment is simple--stay away from the Women's \nConference while Harry Wu is detained or lose 50 percent of your \nability to fund such conferences in the future. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: Six weeks ago, with the support of every \n     Republican member, the Foreign Relations Committee passed S. \n     908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act. This \n     legislation is the first authorization measure to reach the \n     Senate floor within budget targets, fulfilling the mandate \n     the American people gave us last November. This bill is a \n     promise kept: Money is saved, bureaucracy eliminated, and the \n     ability of our nation to conduct foreign relations enhanced.\n       This reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy apparatus \n     saves $3.66 billion over four years. A similar measure has \n     already passed the House. Three agencies, the Arms Control \n     and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for International \n     Development and the United States Information Agency are \n     abolished and their functions rolled into the Department of \n     State.\n       The core functions of these agencies are not lost. Despite \n     propagandizing to the contrary, independent broadcasting is \n     protected; arms control and non-proliferation will be \n     strengthened; and assistance programs which support national \n     interests will be liberated from a convoluted AID \n     bureaucracy. This consolidation plan has been endorsed by \n     five former U.S. Secretaries of State: Henry Kissinger, \n     George Shultz, Alexander Haig, James Baker and Lawrence \n     Eagleburger. And as Henry Kissinger recently said, if given a \n     truth serum, Secretary Christopher would endorse it too.\n       There is, however, an alternative to this reorganization \n     plan. It is called the status quo.\n       Earlier this year, Secretary of State Christopher suggested \n     a similar reorganization of the foreign affairs structure of \n     this country, only to be beaten back by Washington \n     bureaucrats protecting their fiefdoms. Attempts to engage the \n     Clinton Administration were rebuffed consistently; repeated \n     offers to find common ground have been rejected or ignored. \n     The Administration has offered no alternatives and no \n     savings.\n       President Clinton's second budget calls for a 20 percent \n     cut in all non-defense accounts. S. 908 delivers on that \n     call. But there is only one way to meet budget targets and \n     still preserve the core elements of U.S. international \n     operations: Consolidation of our foreign affairs agencies.\n       This should not be a partisan battle. A vote to sacrifice \n     desk jobs for programs that support U.S. national security \n     and humanitarian goals should be an easy one. But the \n     Administration and the Democrats cannot accept that \n     sacrifice, which means partisanship may rule the day. Their \n     plan, detailed in an AID memo, is to ``derail, delay and \n     obfuscate'' the process. Let us move this bill quickly, \n     defeat efforts to preserve the bureaucratic status quo, and \n     prove that we, at least, are serious about cutting spending. \n     We need your vote.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole,\n     Olympia Snowe,\n     Jesse Helms.\n                Amendment No. 2026 to Amendment No. 2025\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, of course I support Senator Dole's \namendment. Before I discuss it, I have a second-degree amendment to the \nDole amendment at the desk, which I ask be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2026 to amendment No. 2025.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . UNITED NATIONS DIPLOMATIC DEBTS.\n\n       Of the funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n     1996 in section 201 and section 301, not less than \n     $20,000,000 shall be withheld from obligation until the \n     Secretary of State reports to the Congress:\n       (1) the names of diplomatic personnel accredited to the \n     United Nations or foreign missions to the United Nations, \n     which have accrued overdue debts to businesses and \n     individuals in the United States; and\n       (2) that the United Nations Secretary General is \n     cooperating fully with the United States or taking effective \n     steps on his own, including publishing the names of debtors, \n     to resolve overdue debts owed by diplomats and missions \n     accredited to the United Nations.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I indicated, I am a cosponsor of Senator \nDole's amendment which is an excellent amendment. It encourages the \nadministration to do what it already should have done: make a strong \nprotest to the Chinese over the arrest and \n\n[[Page S 10940]]\ndetention of the American citizen and friend of many of us in the \nCongress, Harry Wu.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, Mr. President, I met with Harry Wu's wife in my \noffice. Jing Lee is a lovely person. She said privately, and then again \non the lawn of the White House, the United States should refrain from \nsending a delegation to the United Nations Fourth Conference on Women \nin Beijing until Harry Wu is released safely. She asked, ever so \ninsightfully, ``Why would the United States wish to confer \ninternational recognition and legitimacy on the Chinese Government at a \ntime when it is holding an American citizen in captivity?''\n  Over the weekend, the newspaper ran articles showing that the \nPresident is considering meeting with the Chinese premier in this area \nof detente, as Secretary of State Christopher is now referring to it. \nAfter the President goes through with that meeting, and Harry Wu is not \nreleased, then we absolutely have no business sending any Americans \nover to that conference in Beijing.\n  If the truth be known, the Beijing women's conference is fraught with \nproblems from top to bottom, starting with the city in which it is \nbeing held. Taking a paltry $3.5 million away from one account in the \nState Department is, in the short-term, the best way the Senate has to \nsend a signal in support for Harry Wu's release.\n  I might inquire of the majority leader, does the Senator seek the \nyeas and nays on his amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will seek the yeas and nays, and I think the Senator will \nseek the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will seek the yeas and nays after the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I could speak to the second-degree amendment. I thank \nthe Senator from North Carolina. I see on his desk a story that \nappeared in the Washington Times, and that is the purpose of the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, there are many problems in the U.N. system but today's \nfront page story in the Washington Times is another outrageous example \nof the lack of accountability in the United Nations. More than $9 \nmillion in overdue debts have been accumulated by foreign diplomats and \nforeign missions in New York. Bills for landlords, hospitals, banks, \nstores, and restaurants all go unpaid while the diplomats hide behind \nthe U.N. blue flag.\n  The U.N. Secretary General issued a report recognizing the problem \nwas serious. For example, some missions have not paid rent for 2 years; \nproperty owners were in danger of losing properties but diplomatic \ntenants cannot be evicted. The Secretary General, however, refused to \nname names. Instead, he suggested a working group to study the problem. \nI think we all know how to solve the problem. Don't form yet another \nlayer of bloated bureaucracy--just get the bills paid.\n  This second-degree amendment offered by Senator Helms is very simple. \nIt withholds $20 million--roughly double the amount owed by deadbeat \ndiplomats--until the Secretary of State certifies two things: First, \nthe identities to the deadbeat diplomats by name; and second, that the \nU.N. Secretary General is addressing the problem and getting debts \npaid.\n  The money we appropriate for the United Nations is not an \nentitlement. And, yes, the administration may have committed our \nGovernment to more money that we are willing to appropriate. But \nCongress does not have to sit by while the United Nations provides \ncover for deadbeat diplomats getting special treatment.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support the second-degree amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by saying to the distinguished \nmajority leader that I hope it might be possible to set this aside \ntemporarily, simply because we have a couple of Senators who have \namendments, or at least desire consideration, with respect to Harry Wu. \nIt may not bear directly on this, but it think it would bear on the \ndebate.\n  Mr. DOLE. We could set them aside with the understanding somewhere \naround 6 or 6:30 we would have a vote. We would not want to set them \naside and have someone say we will never vote on them.\n  Mr. KERRY. We will be glad to.\n  The majority leader is about to leave, I suppose, but let me say that \nI think there is not any issue in the U.S. Senate about how we feel \nabout Harry Wu's detainment. I think there are probably 5 or 6, or, I \ndo not know, maybe 100 different ideas here about how we might properly \nsignal our disaffection, anger, frustration over it. I am genuinely not \nconvinced that the way to do it is deny us participation in a \nconference that highlights human rights. It seems to me, when you \nmeasure the U.S. record against every other country in the world, we \nare the leader on human rights. It has been the United States, among \nall of the industrial countries, that has tried to assert human rights \nas a part of our foreign policy and also as a part of our efforts to do \nbusiness in other parts of the world.\n  I think it is fair to say that many of our allies--many of our \nclosest allies, our best friends in the international arena--have been \nvery slow to come to the level of international concern for human \nrights that we have tried to exhibit in public policy.\n  For the United States to take an action that willfully deprives us of \nour own voice in the international arena, seems to me to be a very \nshortsighted, shoot-yourself-in-the-foot, try-to-conduct-diplomacy-\nwith-one-foot-nailed-  to-the-floor approach. It just does not make \nsense.\n\n  In many ways, I suspect that China is apprehensive about the holding \nof this conference in Beijing. This cannot, in the midst of their \ntransition, be a very stable time for them to have thousands of women \nfrom around the world descending on their capital, with all of the \nmedia from the world attendant, all listening to comparative analyses \nof the rights that are afforded to citizens in each of those present \ncountries. If we just step up and take ourselves out of the picture, \nwhat we are doing is denying ourselves our own role of leadership. We \nare denying ourselves a voice at the conference. I suspect we are \nplaying right into the hands of those who would love to have a low-key, \nnoncontroversial, nonconfrontational, nonsubstantive \nconference. If you want to have that, then let us come to the floor of \nthe Senate and deny American women, who have been preparing for this \nfor years--literally--the right to go to Beijing and hold up the record \nof the Chinese on human rights for all the world to see.\n  It just does not make sense. I would be in favor of coming to the \nfloor and finding a means, as President Clinton has exhibited a \nwillingness to do, to try to do something that puts teeth in the \npolicy, and that literally matters more. To pick the women's conference \nand suggest that somehow that matters in a major way to the Chinese \nleadership is to misread China and, I think, to misread opportunity.\n  President Clinton, I read today, has already said he is not willing \nto sit down and meet with the President of China unless Harry Wu is \nfree. There are many other ways for us to come to the floor and \nleverage Harry Wu's freedom, and we ought to. We ought to do that. But \nit seems to me this is one of the weakest and most tangential of the \nways of doing it.\n  For those who want to read mischief into this amendment, it is not \nhard to do that. There are a lot of people who have never approved of \nU.S. participation in the women's conference. There are people who \ntried to stop participation at the Nairobi conference, if I recall \ncorrectly. There are people who have objected to the notion that we \nwould get together and talk about family planning and other such issues \nimportant to women or women's rights.\n  So I rather suspect there is more to this amendment than Harry Wu's \nfreedom. If Harry Wu's freedom is really what this amendment is about, \nthen we can find a much more forceful and intelligent way of putting \nthat issue before the U.S. Senate. But to deny ourselves, as I say, our \nown participation as a leader in human rights and an opportunity to go \nto Beijing and hold up for all the world to see the degree to which \nChina is lacking with respect to that, I think is just a very weak and \nnegligible, unimportant way to approach this particular issue. I hope \ncolleagues will recognize that there are \n\n[[Page S 10941]]\nother amendments which will afford them the opportunity to vote on some \nlegitimate and important way of signaling our displeasure with the \ndetention of Harry Wu. I do not think this is the method. I hope there \nwill be more said on that as we go down the road.\n  I reserve further time to speak on that as we progress. I see other \ncolleagues are here on the floor, so I will yield the floor for now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \namendment that has been offered by the Senate majority leader. I speak \ntoday as one of, I think, the Senate's strongest advocates of the U.N. \nConference on Women. But it is precisely because of the conference's \nimportance that I support the distinguished majority leader's amendment \nto call on the President, really, in essence, not to send an official \ndelegation to that conference until Harry Wu is released.\n  Frankly, this is what it is all about. It is about Harry Wu. And it \nis also about principle and at what point do we stand up and support \nprinciple.\n  As we debate this issue, we are really speaking about one of our most \ncourageous citizens, who continues to be unjustly incarcerated in \nChina. Today, Chinese authorities are violating his most fundamental \nhuman rights and are threatening his very life with a trumped-up charge \nof espionage, which, in China, is a capital crime.\n  We face a critical juncture in our relations with the People's \nRepublic of China. Given China's gross violation of Harry Wu's rights \nand privileges as an American, I certainly cannot support this \ncountry's participation in the women's human rights conference that is \nset to get underway on September 4. What kind of message does it send? \nThat is exactly what China wants. China wants to have it both ways. \nThey want to be able to have Harry Wu in prison and, at the same time, \nas their backdrop will be this human rights conference. It is a \nconference on women and it is a conference on human rights. I have been \nvery much a supporter of that conference.\n  So I hope no one will question my motivations as to why I am \nsupporting this amendment, and I am a cosponsor. Because at some point \nI believe you have to support principle. Yes, sometimes this is \ndiscomforting. Some people say this is just what China wants. I hardly \nbelieve that.\n   China wants to be able to do that in spite of keeping Harry Wu in \nprison. They want to be able to have credibility and look at the \ninternational community as having their human rights conference in \nChina in spite of the fact they have grossly violated Harry Wu's \nrights.\n  That is what this is all about. And what kind of message will we be \nsending? I know everybody is in a quandary as to what to do, \nunderstandably so. But sometimes you finally meet the bottom line, and \nyou say, ``We cannot do it.'' No, the First Lady should not attend the \nconference. But we should not send an American delegation. That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to finish my statement.\n  I think that it would be simply wrong because of the issue of Harry \nWu's rights. What he has attempted to do is to have the tragedies \nexposed, the gross violations of human rights that have occurred in \nChina. He has risked his life. I think we ought to learn from that.\n  I would like to quote for you from his book ``Bitter Wind.'' It was \npublished in 1994. In discussing his decision to return to China in \n1991 to film his famed expose, ``The China Secret Prison Facilities,'' \nhe wrote in 1991:\n\n       I married, and for the first time I found deep personal \n     happiness. But just 4 months later I arranged to travel back \n     to China. Outside China much was known about the Nazi \n     concentration camps and about the Soviet gulag, but almost no \n     information was available about the carefully developed \n     system of forced labor that had kept millions of Chinese \n     citizens incarcerated in brutal and dehumanizing conditions, \n     frequently without sentence or trial. Returning to China \n     meant risking my own rearrest and reimprisonment. \n     Perhaps I would once again disappear. Even though I had \n     wanted to forget the suffering of the past after arriving in \n     the United States and had wanted to heal the wounds in my \n     heart, the 19 years of sorrow would not stop returning to my \n     mind. I could not forget those who still suffer inside the \n     camps. If I did not undertake this task, I asked, who would? \n     I felt a responsibility not just to disclose but to publicize \n     the truth about the Communist Party's mechanism of control. \n     Whatever the risk to me, whatever the discomfort of telling \n     my story, each time I revisited my past, I hoped it would be \n     the last time. But I had decided that my experiences belong \n     not only to me and not only to China's history, they belonged \n     to humanity.\n\n   Well, Harry Wu is an American. He belongs not only to us, not only \nto those he left behind to China's gulag, but he also belongs to \nhumanity. And that is why we have to take every necessary step possible \nto get Harry Wu released.\n   When it comes to the conference, yes, there are a number of \nimportant issues. I have been a supporter of all the previous \nconferences, and I have been engaged in providing input on the \ndevelopment of the agenda. But I think there is a time that we have to \nmake certain decisions as a country.\n  There was great reluctance to have this conference in Beijing because \nof obvious reasons--the country's severe restrictions on human rights \nand most basic freedoms of speech and press. We also know what China \nhas done to governmental organizations. They have basically placed \ntheir conference about 75 miles away from Beijing with a great deal of \nconfusion and restrictions upon accreditation of the various \nrepresentatives who are seeking to go to that conference, as well, \nwhich will occur a week before the conference on women.\n  So there have been a number of attempts to encroach on the ability of \nthose people who want to attend, and certainly their ability to \nparticipate in the conference, in making it obviously very difficult.\n  But above and beyond everything else is looking at what Harry Wu \nrepresents and what he has done. Frankly, I just cannot imagine China \nas a backdrop for this conference at a time in which Harry Wu is in \nprison.\n   So I think it is important to take this step. It is one that I do \nnot take lightly. I gave it a great deal of thought. But I think that \nwe can do no less in making a very strong statement about how we feel \nas a nation toward China's treatment toward one of our citizens, but to \nanyone.\n  So that is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wonder why the Senator does not feel that--recognizing \nthe fact that the United Nations and the United States signed off on \nthe location, and the location issue is sort of behind us--why the \nSenator would not feel that having an American presence there which, on \na daily basis, raised the issue of Harry Wu before the conference, \nwhich required the conference to deal with Harry Wu's detention, which \nused this platform as a means of underscoring, would not be stronger \nthan simply denying ourselves our own presence.\n  It will not stop the conference. The conference will go on. Everyone \nelse will be there. And they will not raise this issue necessarily as \nvociferously and as passionately as we might.\n  So why would we not be better off directing our delegation to raise \nit on a daily basis and pass a resolution from this conference with \nrespect to Harry Wu?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I say to the Senator that I happen to think we have \ndifferent opinions on the subject, but I happen to think that this will \nenhance China's credibility in the international community to hold this \nconference. Frankly, I think China would find it very difficult if the \nconference was not held in Beijing. I think that happens to be a \nstronger statement, in my opinion, than holding the conference--and \ncertainly China would view it and interpret it as suggesting that in \nspite of what they have done, they are still holding this conference in \nthis country. Mind you, Beijing was on the list as the next country in \nline to hold the conference. There was reluctance even at that point at \nthe United Nations to hold that conference in Beijing for the reasons \nthat we all know. Now, this has happened.\n   I just frankly do not feel that it would be appropriate for this \ncountry to send our delegation there talking \n\n[[Page S 10942]]\nabout the very important issues but at the same time sending the \nmessage that we are still going to talk about these issues in spite of \nthe fact that Harry Wu is in prison.\n  Mr. KERRY. But my question is why not send them there to talk about \nHarry Wu?\n  Ms. SNOWE. They have an agenda. I have a letter here.\n  Mr. KERRY. They can talk about Harry Wu. The conference is going to \nhappen. The Senator keeps talking as if we are not participating.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senator asked a question. Let the \nSenator from Maine respond.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Harry Wu is an American citizen. So, therefore, we have an \nobligation or responsibility to make those determinations as a country. \nI agree that is important, too.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. May I finish my statement? It is important for the United \nStates to make that decision. I think it is that important, frankly, to \nsay something about human rights. To hold a conference in a country \nwhich has violated in the worst way the human rights of an American \ncitizen, I think that we have to stand up and be counted. It is not \neasy because there are many important issues on that agenda which are \nvery important to women throughout the country. I have been a leader on \nthose issues on international human rights for women. I put a number of \nprovisions in the State Department authorizing bill last year on this \nvery subject. I feel very strongly about it.\n  I feel very strongly about it. But I also feel very strongly about \nwhat China has done to Harry Wu.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would say to the Senator, Mr. President, there is nobody \nhere who does not feel strongly about what they have done to Harry Wu. \nThis is not a debate about whether Harry Wu should be left to be a \nprisoner or not. This is a question of what is the most efficient----\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is not asking a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator from North Carolina want me to stop----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has yielded for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KERRY. I was in the midst, I thought, Mr. President, of asking a \nquestion.\n  I ask the Senator if she does not realize from the writings of Harry \nWu and the risks that Mr. Wu has been willing to take that he would \nprobably prefer that this conference took place and that it raised the \nissues with the United States there to raise them? And I wonder if she \nhas thought about whether or not Harry Wu would rather have the \ndelegation be present.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I think Harry Wu would want the United States to stand up \nfor him, and I happen to think--again, I cannot say what Harry Wu would \nthink, but I think that China would feel very much slighted as well as \ninsulted in the international community if the American delegation did \nnot go to this conference; in fact, if the conference was not held at \nall. I think the international community should make that decision.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Harry Wu has given his life to expose the unspeakable \ncrimes that not only he endured in China's prisons but what others are \nenduring. I think it is a slap in the face what China has done to the \nUnited States. But it is more than that. It is what they have done to \nan individual. And I think that we have to stand up. I would like the \ninternational community to stand up and say, no, we will hold the \nconference someplace else. It is inconvenient to change the location of \nthis conference, but we are going to do it.\n  What kind of message would that send to China? It is obvious they \nwant to have it both ways. Look what they did, what they released \nrecently in a tape with Harry Wu.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. They want to be able to show that they are evenhanded and \nfair.\n  I would be glad to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Does the Senator remember my mentioning to her the visit I had with \nMrs. Harry Wu, in which she asked that the U.S. delegation not be \npresent? Does the Senator recall that meeting, that she came to my \noffice and made that request herself? Does the Senator recall that?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is made a matter of record at this point.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I think that that would answer the Senator's question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my question to the Senator again is, when \nthe United States takes a step unilaterally, we tend to confuse our \ncapacity to send a message. And I ask the Senator, would she not think \nthat if this were, indeed--this Senator would agree that if a \nconference as a whole were not held there or were moved, that would, \nindeed, be of significant implication, that that would have an impact.\n  Would we not be better off passing a resolution which sought a \nmultilateral response rather than one that simply denies ourself our \nown voice?\n  I ask the Senator, would she not then think it a better idea to find \na stronger way to try to send a message?\n  My point is merely that this really deprives us of something and does \nnot have the full impact. I would join the Senator if she wanted to try \nto change the whole location or if she suggested we should engage in a \nmultilateral effort to see that the conference did it. That would be a \nslap in the face of China.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I certainly would not be opposed to a multilateral \nresponse, but at the same time it should not preclude our position in \nterms of what we think is important for this country in the final \nanalysis. I do not think that prevents the United States from seeking a \nmultilateral approach in changing the site of the conference. If the \nother countries do not agree, then I do not think that it should \nprevent us from doing what we think is right.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, clearly we are not going to be prevented \nfrom what we think is right. The question is whether we can find a \nstrong and forcible best means of sending this message. I simply ask \nthe Senator whether or not that or a number of other methods I might \nadd might not strike more at something meaningful to China than taking \naway the single, strongest human rights voice in the world from a \nconference that they are trying to frustrate anyway? This plays right \ninto their hands.\n  The reason it has been moved, the reason that there are so many \ndifficulties with accreditation is that the leadership fears this \nconference. And here we are coming along and adding to that.\n  I ask the Senator why we strike in a way that somehow nails our own \nfoot to the floor rather than theirs?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would answer the Senator by saying that it is remarkably \nstriking that China sought to do what it did in face of the fact it \nvery much wanted to have the conference. That is why I happen to \nbelieve that precluding our delegation from attending the conference or \neven having the conference there, sure, that would be the best of all \nworlds, but we cannot depend upon that response in the final analysis. \nWe certainly should encourage it and prevail upon other countries. And \nI do not say that we should take that as a position as well. But I do \nnot think we should then say we are going to attend the conference if \nwe cannot change the site of that conference.\n  I just happen to think it is amazing that China would do this in \nlight of the fact it very much wanted to have the conference. It was \nvery eager to host that conference. And there was a question as to \nwhether or not to even host that conference in Beijing to begin with, \nlet alone before all this developed. But I think it makes a mockery of \nthe very purpose of that conference.\n  That is what I happen to believe. And I feel very strongly about the \nissues which are on that agenda to empower women throughout the world \non a host of issues that I have worked on personally. But I also think \nwe have to stand up and be counted. There is always a reason why we \ncannot do something--well, it is better for us. This is what China \nwants.\n  We have heard that before, but it has not stopped China.\n  Has it stopped China? No. It has not stopped China from doing a \nnumber of \n\n[[Page S 10943]]\nthings recently that certainly have been an affront to our policies and \nwhat we stand for. And at what point do we demand something in return \nwhen it comes to human rights? I just happen to think the conference \nshould not go on, no. But I certainly do not think that we should \nattend that conference.\n  That is what I happen to think. That is what I think happens to be \nthe strongest message and that is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, changing the venue on the Beijing \nconference is an absolute impossibility, and I am sure my well-informed \ncolleague from Massachusetts knows that. At this point, I agree with \nthe distinguished Senator from Maine and the distinguished majority \nleader that the strongest means of sending a message from the United \nStates is to do it unilaterally because we really do not have any other \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's second-degree amendment to the \nmajority leader's underlying amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will not be long in discussing my amendment. I \nthought about it when I read the Washington Times this morning and saw \nthe headline, ``U.N.'s Deadbeat Diplomats Owe Millions.'' Then the \nsubhead says, ``African Nations Ring Up Largest Debts to New York \nShops, Banks, and Lenders.''\n  In that, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a report to \nthe Committee on Relations with the Host Country, and I quote him:\n\n       Non-payment of just debts reflects badly on the entire \n     diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the United \n     Nations itself.\n\n  Then the Washington Times went on to say:\n\n       The topic is so sensitive around the United Nations that, \n     until recently, the problem was not publicly mentioned. But \n     the secrecy and inaction have allowed the debt to grow to $9 \n     million from the previous balance of just $1.1 million in \n     1990; it swelled by nearly $2 million in the past half-year \n     alone.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in general, the pending second-degree \namendment to the Dole amendment addresses the debt owed to the United \nStates, or to private enterprises of our country, by deadbeat U.N. \ndiplomats who just do not pay their bills. They owe over $9 million for \nlate payments or failure to pay at all on rent and everything else \nimaginable that these deadbeats have purchased or contracted for.\n  That reminds me of an amendment that I offered last year that \nrequired diplomats right here in the District of Columbia, as well as \nother places, to pay up on the parking fines owed to the District of \nColumbia. I am proud to say that it worked because they were in deep, \ndeep trouble if they did not pay.\n  This amendment is just about the same. It sheds sunshine on those \ndiplomats who choose to ignore paying their just debts, as Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali described it in his statement as quoted in the newspaper \nthis morning.\n  I think that the publicity may embarrass these people into paying \nthese bills. If not, this second-degree amendment to the Dole amendment \nwill certainly prompt their attention. Since the Secretary General has \nrefused to identify any of the diplomats or the missions that owe \nmoney, it is up to the U.S. Congress to urge him to do so in a very \nforceful way. If this provision is adopted, as I hope it will be, the \ndeadbeats in the United Nations will be known by one and all, and they \nwill be embarrassed into paying their bills.\n  The yeas and nays have not been obtained on either amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there appears not to be a sufficient second.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dole \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to it being in order to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the first-degree amendment? Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 31, 1995]\n\n                 U.N.'s Deadbeat Diplomats Owe Millions\n\n\n    african nations ring up largest debts to new york shops, banks, \n                               landlords\n\n                          (By Catherine Toups)\n\n       New York.--If the peace-keeping failures of Bosnia and \n     Somalia haven't brought enough shame on the United Nations, \n     U.N. officials fear that deadbeat diplomats will.\n       Hiding behind the shield of diplomatic immunity, diplomats \n     and missions posted to the United Nations have accrued more \n     than $9 million in debts to U.S. banks, landlords, hospitals, \n     hotels, utility companies and merchants in New York City, \n     according to a U.N. report.\n       And while the trickle-down economic boost of housing U.N. \n     headquarters enriches New York City by about $1 billion each \n     year, diplomats are finding less of a welcome from landlords, \n     hospitals and banks that are growing increasingly reluctant \n     to do business with diplomats, U.N. officials said.\n       ``The problem of diplomatic indebtedness is a matter of \n     significant concern,'' Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-\n     Ghali said in a report to the Committee on Relations With the \n     Host Country.\n       ``Non-payment of just debts reflects badly on the entire \n     diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the United \n     Nations itself.''\n       The topic is so sensitive around the United Nations that, \n     until recently, the problem was not publicly mentioned. But \n     the secrecy and inaction have allowed the debt to grow to $9 \n     million from just $1.1 million in 1990; it swelled by nearly \n     $2 million in the past half-year alone.\n       Finally, at the insistence of the U.S. mission and the city \n     of New York, the size of the debt is now public. But the \n     names of the offending diplomats and missions are not.\n       Even in Mr. Boutros-Ghali's smoldering report, in which he \n     scolds diplomats for not paying their bills and urges a \n     ``working group on indebtedness'' to come up with solutions, \n     he does not mention a single country or diplomat by name.\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali also omitted the name of a prominent bank \n     that he said will no longer make loans to diplomats or \n     missions, and he did not identify real estate agents who say \n     they are reluctant to deal with diplomats.\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali's report said 31 mission have contributed \n     to the debt but five missions alone account for 83 percent of \n     it. The debts range from $200 to more than $1.9 million, he \n     said. About 40 percent is owed to banks, 40 percent to \n     landlords and the rest to merchants.\n       ``Some missions had not paid rent for two years or more,'' \n     Mr. Boutros-Ghali said. ``And a number of residential \n     landlords had either lost their property or were at risk of \n     losing it because diplomatic tenants, who could not be \n     evicted, would neither pay their rent nor leave the \n     property.''\n       Sources familiar with the issue say the top debtor missions \n     are Sierra Leone, Congo, Zaire, Liberia and the Central \n     African Republic.\n       ``The vast majority of the 184 missions in New York and \n     their over 1,800 diplomats honor their obligations,'' the \n     secretary-general said.\n       Political and economic instability back home is part of the \n     problem, the U.N. chief said in his report. But he also \n     blamed some of the debt on bad fiscal management of missions \n     and individual diplomats.\n       There is a certain irony to the United Nations scolding \n     deadbeat diplomats. The world body itself is far from solvent \n     because of member nations that fail to pay assessments in \n     full or on time (the United States is first on that list).\n       The organization already owes more than $800 million to \n     troop-contributing nations for peacekeeping operations, a \n     debt that is expected to reach $1 billion by the end of the \n     year.\n       The United Nations has also been accused of mismanagement \n     and waste throughout its history, leading to periodic \n     reforms, including several in the past year.\n       Several diplomats on the Committee on Relations With the \n     Host Country, which handles problems between missions and the \n     United States, have argued against making a public issue of \n     diplomatic indebtedness for fear it will spark hostility \n     against the diplomatic community.\n       A December 1993 New York Times article about delinquent \n     parking tickets by diplomats prompted hundreds of complaints \n     from New York residents who said diplomats don't deserve the \n     privileges they have.\n       Russian delegates on the committee lobbied against \n     publishing the names of deadbeat diplomats and missions, \n     saying the \n\n[[Page S 10944]]\n     problem is a private matter between the United States and the debtors.\n       ``It would politicize the problem and would not help to \n     solve it,'' said Sergei Ordzhonikidze of the Russian mission. \n     ``In diplomacy, it is important to be discreet.''\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali has asked the ``working group on \n     indebtedness'' to look into several options to resolve the \n     problem.\n       Ideas included creating an ``emergency'' fund, establishing \n     group health insurance programs, giving debtors, short-term \n     jobs at the Secretariat to earn extra money and creating \n     information programs alerting missions to the high costs of \n     living in New York.\n       But giving jobs to diplomats in ``acute distress'' \n     financially was deemed unworkable and the idea of an \n     emergency fund was also rejected. A representative of France \n     on the committee suggested that for the cast-strapped United \n     Nations to create a document publicizing the names of \n     individual debtors and debt-ridden mission might be too \n     political and ``should be avoided.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from North Carolina, I \nthink he is correct to bring this question of debt before the U.S. \nSenate. I think it is an important issue. The question is whether we \nshould not withhold the amount of money commensurate with what the debt \nis reported to be rather than more than twice that amount, because we \nalready have arrearages on peacekeeping, a significant amount of \nfinancial issues.\n  I respectfully suggest that it may be possible, let us say, with a \n$10 million figure, to leverage the same response, which I suspect the \nSecretary of State would be willing to try to elicit as rapidly as \npossible, rather than withholding twice the amount of money. I wonder \nif he would consider modifying it to that effect.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will say to the Senator, of course I cannot, save by \nunanimous consent, modify the amendment, but if he wishes to offer such \nan amendment by unanimous consent, I will certainly agree to it.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think we can amend it by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course. Yes. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the amendment to be proposed under \nunanimous consent previously discussed is certainly agreeable with me, \nand I hope the Senator will offer it.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2026, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second-\ndegree amendment of the Senator from North Carolina be modified to read \n$10 million. I send it to the desk.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before it is reported, this presumes that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has agreed that we shall have a vote on \nthese two amendments this evening.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I cannot personally agree to that at this \npoint in time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am not asking you to agree for the Senate, the Democrats \nin the Senate, I am asking if that means that you are in favor of it.\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not have a problem with a vote, but others do at this \nmoment. I have to represent them as the manager. I am representing that \nI cannot agree at this point in time to have the vote this evening.\n  Mr. HELMS. May I ask the Senator, is this what we should expect for \nimportant legislation which is before the Senate----\n  Mr. KERRY. I think the Senator knows----\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me finish my question. This has been the experience on \nevery piece of legislation we have had.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me interrupt my friend. I may save him----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators please yield? The Senator from \nNorth Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. All the people all over the country, the American people, \nare wondering why the Senate is so far behind the House in the conduct \nof legislation. The answer to that is, and somebody needs to say it, \nthat there is a deliberate determination to forbid, delay, or obfuscate \nevery piece of legislation that has been brought up. And I want to know \nbefore the clerk reports this modification whether we can expect the \nvote this evening on the Dole amendment and the Helms second-degree \namendment as modified? I want an answer to that, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum while the Democrats discuss that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my friend to withhold.\n  Mr. HELMS. No, I will not. I want to know whether we are going to \nhave a vote this evening or whether it is going to be held up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we could have saved this entire exchange \nand quorum call if I had been permitted to simply say to my friend 4 \nminutes ago that the issue is not whether we will have a vote; the only \nquestion, as is normal in the Senate, is the timing. But because I was \nprecluded from saying that, in order that the country can get a message \nabout how we can never pass anything here, we get into these tangles. I \nwanted to only say to my friend the issue is when, not whether.\n  I do not know when every Senator will be back. Some are with the \nPresident. Some are with the National Governors Association. As soon as \nthey get back from a day's work elsewhere in the country, they will be \navailable to vote. That is normal procedure in the Senate.\n  My No. 2 response is that this Senator remembers last year very well. \nI will never forget it as long as I am in the U.S. Senate and \nprivileged to be here. Vote after vote, bill after bill was brought \nforward in good faith, and it was stopped dead in its tracks by a \nconscious gridlock policy. So I am never going to stand here and hear \nany colleague on the other side talk about the delay or the problems of \nproceeding forward.\n  Every good-faith effort of Senator Mitchell to move the Senate \nforward was frustrated, and everybody knows that. Piece of legislation \nafter piece of legislation that passed here went over to the House and \ncame back--dead, dead, dead. So I am not going to hear anybody talk \nabout a legitimate delay effort in the first 2 hours to legislate on \nthis bill. If there is, we will sit here in quorum call for several \ndays. Let us agree to that. That is just unfounded, uncalled for, \nunnecessary, and I think, frankly, out of order in the first hour and a \nhalf of this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification pending \nat the desk?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2026), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . UNITED NATIONS DIPLOMATIC DEBTS.\n\n       Of the funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n     1996 in section 201 and section 301, not less than \n     $10,000,000 shall be withheld from obligation until the \n     Secretary of State reports to the Congress:\n       (1) the names of diplomatic personnel accredited to the \n     United Nations or foreign missions to the United Nations, \n     which have accrued overdue debts to businesses and \n     individuals in the United States; and\n       (2) that the United Nations Secretary General is \n     cooperating fully with the United States or taking effective \n     steps on his own, including publishing the names of debtors, \n     to resolve overdue debts owed by diplomats and missions \n     accredited to the United Nations.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, tomorrow in Brunei, the Secretary of \nState is going to meet with Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen to \ndiscuss a very serious rift between China and the United States which \nhas been brewing for some time and which has more \n\n[[Page S 10945]]\nrecently erupted over the visit of President Lee of Taiwan to the \nUnited States.\n  My colleagues, I think, are fully aware of the importance of the \nChina-American relationship. In my view, it is the single most \nbilateral relationship the United States has.\n  Whether that characterization is correct, it is clear, Mr. President, \nthat China is the key to Asia. It is the largest country, one of the \nfastest growing in the world. If our relationship with China and Asia \nis secure, then our relationship with Asia, for the most part, is \nsecure.\n  If that relationship begins to spiral downward, as it has in recent \nmonths, then it portends terrible things for the United States--\nterrible things not only for our bilateral relationship, but for peace \nin the world.\n  Now, Mr. President, the problem with one of these relationships, when \nit begins to go sour, as our relationship with the People's Republic of \nChina has begun to do, it begins to get a momentum of its own; portent \nof evil becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, tempers become frayed, \npride gets in the way, insults--whether intended or unintended--are \nimagined in every bit of conduct. Sometimes the downward spiral can get \nout of control.\n  Mr. President, this is a very, very serious matter, our relationship \nwith China. It has been written about by people from both sides of the \naisle, whether in Congress or out of Congress.\n  This meeting in Brunei is, therefore, a vitally, vitally important \nmeeting. I have high hopes that from this meeting we can at least begin \na process that will relieve our relationship with the People's Republic \nof China. Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is much \nbroader and much more difficult than the detention of one American \ncitizen, Harry Wu.\n  While we all are very concerned about that, Mr. President, the \nsolution to that problem will not solve the whole relationship. It is a \nmuch, much, by many orders of magnitude, bigger problem than the \nproblem of Harry Wu, as important as that may be.\n  Mr. President, I can think of nothing more unwise to do than to start \nlegislating or making expressions about the Harry Wu situation on the \neve of the meeting between our Secretary of State and the Foreign \nMinister of the People's Republic of China.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that both the United States and the \nPeople's Republic of China are trying to find ways to get this \nrelationship back on track; trying to find ways, consistent with the \nprinciples of both countries, consistent with our long-held commitment \nto human rights, consistent with the importance of this relationship, \nconsistent with China's determination that its ``one China policy'' be \nmaintained as it has from the time of the Shanghai communique up to, I \nbelieve, the present day.\n  I believe both parties, both the United States and the People's \nRepublic of China, are searching for the way to bring that relationship \nback together. To do so takes diplomacy that is most subtle and \nrequiring the greatest degree of expertise of any kind of relationship \nwe have. It does, in fact, deal with not only fundamental interests of \nboth countries, but the pride, the feeling, the emotion contained on \nboth sides of the Pacific Ocean.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will let this diplomacy, so vital to the \nbasic interests of this country, play out and not try to sour the \natmosphere in which that relationship will take place.\n  I believe that, if we enact this amendment, as easy as it sounds in \nits terms, as innocent as it sounds from the way it is written up, I \nbelieve the adoption of this kind of amendment would really sour the \natmosphere, would be poking the People's Republic of China in the eye \nto make it much more difficult for our Secretary of State and the \nChinese Foreign Minister to get this relationship back together.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, I believe this relationship is the most \nimportant bilateral relationship that this country has. China will, \nshortly after the turn of the century, be the largest economy in the \nworld. It is the largest country in the world. Its power, both \neconomically and in a military way, is growing every day. The latter, \nalarmingly so.\n  If we can just somehow get our relationship back together, reassure \nthe Chinese that we are not trying to contain them, as some people in \nthe United States say, if we can reassure them that our relationship \nwill be one of friendship, consistent with our strong commitment to \nhuman rights, but nevertheless a relationship of friendship, I believe \nit is in the vital interests of the United States for that to take \nplace. I hope, therefor, Mr. President, that we will not adopt the Dole \namendment this evening or at any time until the Brunei conference is \ncompleted.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to support the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Louisiana. I think that Harry Wu has \nbeen treated in a dreadful manner. We all agree with that.\n  Of even greater importance is the relationship with China. I am \nreminded of the fact that the War of Jenkins' Ear, the 7-year war, \nstarted after such an incident. This could be such an incident.\n  The important thing is that we get on with our relationship with \nChina and normalize our relations there.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Senator from Louisiana for their comments.\n  Let me clarify to colleagues that this amendment does not, per se, \nprohibit the delegation from going. What it does is penalize, to the \ntune of $3.5 million, the account from which that conference \nparticipation would be paid, or other conferences would be paid, if, in \nfact, the President goes ahead and sends them.\n  So, in effect, it is a vote by the Senate as to whether or not we \nbelieve we ought to or ought not. There is punishment in it for the \nPresident choosing to exercise his constitutional prerogatives with \nrespect to this. It does not, per se, prevent the President from doing \nso.\n  That does not mean that we should not, nevertheless, oppose this \namendment by virtue of the fact that there are stronger ways to send \nthis message.\n  I think it is very, very important to understand that opposition to \nthis particular chosen method does not signal any kind of latitude with \nrespect to Harry Wu. It does not signal anything other than our \ndisapproval for that situation. In fact, there may, as the Senator from \nLouisiana has suggested, be far more effective ways to not only work \nhis release but to deal with a host of other issues which we share with \nChina.\n  In the last few months, we have been going down a road that is \ndefined largely by our mutual misinterpretation of each other to a \ncertain degree.\n  If there is any lesson that we should have learned in the last 20 \nyears, I think it is that we are not going to unilaterally, through \nsome very public confrontational method, alter an immediate event in \nChina. It does not work that way. It has not worked that way along the \ncourse.\n  It is usually when we work a fairly fine-tuned, and over the course \nof a longer period of time, strategy that is very much interfaced with \npersonal relationships and personal respect that we begin to make the \nmost progress. Every time we step out of that, we seem to take steps \nbackward. I think there are many ways to affect Harry Wu's status. We \nought to pursue every single one of them.\n  To suggest that when they have already separated the nongovernmental \norganizations from the main U.N. conference in Beijing, and they have \ndone that specifically to deny the capacity of the nongovernmental \norganizations to follow the events closely or have a major impact on \nthem, it is clear they are already in a damage control mode.\n  They are trying to manage this conference in a way that minimizes \nparticularly the capacity of American participation to have an impact.\n  I respectfully suggest that to have American participation leveraging \nHarry Wu's status, as well as the other issues, poses a far greater \nchallenge to their ability to manage the news and the output and events \nthan our nonparticipation.\n  If the conference is going to take place anyway and we are simply \ngoing to say we are not going to do this out of protest, we not only \nminimize our voice but we also set into place a series of events that \nthe Senator from Louisiana has talked to, which will have a whole bunch \nof collateral downsides. I do not think it is smart foreign policy. I \ndo not think it accomplishes the goal we are setting out to accomplish. \n\n\n[[Page S 10946]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my friend from North Carolina if we could \ntemporarily set aside the pending amendment for further business?\n  Mr. HELMS.

and\n       (7) respect civil liberties, human rights and democratic \n     norms.\n       (d) Authority To Suspend Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act and for 18 months thereafter \n     the President may suspend for a period of not more than 6 \n     months at a time any provision of law specified in paragraph \n     (4).

Mr. President, I want to make the record clear. The Jordan \ndrawdown was not eliminated even temporarily at my request, but in \norder to facilitate the approval of the rest of the amendment 1914. So \nthe Record will show that--I having said that.\n  I urge the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment as \nmodified?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are going to try \nto work out the differences that still exist on section 619, and at \nsome later date we may pull it up.\n  We are in agreement with respect to the rest of the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a committee amendment at the desk \nreferred to as the ``manager's amendment.'' I understand there are no \nobjections to this amendment and that the modifications are acceptable \nto the ranking member of the committee, Senator Pell. This amendment \nhas several parts and is designed to address three issues:\n  First, reservations and jurisdictional concerns expressed by other \nSenate committees, chairmen, and ranking members;\n  Second; provisions objectionable to the Administration; and\n  Third, technical and conforming amendments to the bill, many of which \nwere ``unofficially'' requested by this administration.\n  The amendment includes: The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act \nextension, a repeal of the two prison labor provisions in the bill that \nwill satisfy Finance Committee concerns, two changes that will satisfy \nthe budget scorekeepers on the Budget Committee, and a few other small \nprovisions.\n  I urge the amendment be adopted since there are no known objections \nto this amendment. I hope there will be additional amendments in \nagreement as we proceed on debate of the measure.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1914), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the two amendments and to call up the amendment that I have \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to our colleagues who are \ndealing with the measure that is at hand, and I certainly hope we will \nhave an opportunity to dispose of those amendments in a timely fashion. \nI also expect to at least have an opportunity to see a disposition of \nthe amendment which I am offering this evening on this particular piece \nof legislation.\n  I am aware, very much, that I have offered an amendment in the first-\ndegree and it can be seconded. I am also aware, as my colleague from \nNorth Carolina was pointing out, that we are very hopeful of being able \nto avoid parliamentary gymnastics and to be able to get a vote on \ndifferent measures that come before the Senate. I expect he will have \nan opportunity to get a vote on his amendment and I certainly hope to \nhave an opportunity to have a vote on mine as well.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that calls for us to debate and vote on raising the minimum \nwage sometime before the end of this session of Congress.\n   It does not endorse any particular outcome. It does not say that we \nshould pass S. 413, the bill Senator Daschle introduced in behalf of \nthe President, or vote to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour, \nthough I strongly believe that we should. Rather, the amendment says \nonly that the Senate should take up the issue, that we should debate \nit, and vote one way or the other rather than sweeping this issue under \nthe rug and ignoring the 12 million American workers who would get a \nraise if the President's bill were enacted.\n   The appropriate level for the minimum wage is a critical issue both \nfor the millions of low-wage workers who are directly affected by it \nand for the economy as a whole. Income inequality is a growing problem \nin the United States, and the declining purchasing power of the minimum \nwage is an important factor in this problem.\n   Mr. President, I will review for the Senate some of the most recent \ninformation that has been developed and reported in our national news \nmagazines, as well as some of the historic trends that justify action \nby this particular amendment, which effectively will do for the Senate \nwhat was done earlier this year on the issue involving the gifts \nmeasure before the Senate where our colleagues got a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that we were going to vote on the gifts issue and on \nthe lobbying legislation.\n  Really as a result of a good deal of focus and attention by Members \nwho \n\n[[Page S 10950]]\nare interested in these issues, these measures were brought up and in a \nremarkable sense of comity were worked out and action was taken which I \nthink all of us think was very, very important. And we are very \nhopeful--I and the others who will be supporting this measure--that we \nwill have an opportunity to do what we did some years ago in 1989-1990 \nwhen we had a Republican President and two Democratic Congresses and, \ninitially, reservations by the Republican President. We worked on this \nmeasure. We saw the coming together of a Democratic Congress and a \nRepublican President. That was signed into law, and was the last \nincrease in the minimum wage, which took effect in 1991.\n   Now, with a Republican Senate, a Republican House and a Democratic \nPresident, we are very hopeful that we will be able to take action that \nwill result in making this minimum wage really an American wage, a \nfamily wage, a living wage.\n  That is why I am hopeful that this resolution, which says that we \nwill address this issue prior to the end of the Congress without making \na definition as to what that particular amount would be, nonetheless \nwould reflect the sense of this body, Republican and Democrat alike, \nbecause Republicans have historically worked with us to get an increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  Historically, increases in the minimum wage were signed by Republican \nPresidents and were sometimes supported by the Republican leadership--\nand we would certainly hope on an issue of fundamental fairness, \nfundamental justice, that we could develop that kind of comity on this \nresolution and then ultimately on the matter that comes before us.\n   Mr. President, the reason for offering this measure now is because \nof the scheduling reality. We will be in session two more weeks prior \nto the August recess. We will be back. The leader has announced that we \nwill be addressing the welfare issue in the latter part of this week. \nWe have a defense authorization, a defense appropriations bill, and \nthere would not be the opportunity to have a debate and discussion on \nthis measure, although I think it is an issue that has been addressed \ntime and time again by the membership. It is not one that the Members \nare unfamiliar with. But, nonetheless, I think it is important to take \njust a brief period of time, whatever time the membership wants, so \nthat we can address this issue and give an opportunity for the Members \nto go on record about whether we as an institution, as a Congress, \nshould go back and address this issue as we have done on seven other \noccasions when we have seen an increase in the minimum wage, which is \nthe wage for working families that work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year, and try to provide food for their families, a roof for their \nchildren, to pay the mortgage, and to have some sense of hope and \noptimism for the future.\n   Mr. President, this chart reflects what happened to the incomes of \nfamilies in this country from 1950 to 1978. I know that there will be \nthose who will say, ``Well, there were variations for this period of \ntime.'' We may have the opportunity to come back and address that \nissue. We will address any of the other issues that are brought up in \nthe course of this debate. But this is a pretty good summation, even \nwith the rise and the fall of various recessions. And I will have other \ncharts that will show in more careful, actual detail what happened \nduring this period of time with the setbacks and the advances in terms \nof real family income.\n  But when you come right down to it, for close to a 30-year period--\nand we segment each of the incomes for the different parts of our \nsociety, dividing them into five different segments--what this chart \nreflects very clearly is that real family income by quintile, which is \nthe five different segments, all went up together. The ones on the \nbottom, 20 percent of the family income, rose the most, rose 138 \npercent. Those in the second lowest went up 98 percent; the middle, \nsome 106 percent; the fourth, 111 percent; and the top 20 percent went \nup to close to 100 percent.\n   This chart says that we developed in this country, and the American \neconomy responded, in such a way that the income for families during \nthis period of time, which included the increases in the minimum wage \nas well as other economic factors, all went along and grew together. We \nall made progress together, and we did it in ways that were pretty \nequitable in terms of the distribution of where our families were.\n  This, I think, is the real indication of where the country was moving \nas an economy. It included other forces beyond the minimum wage. But as \nmy next chart will show, the minimum wage kept pace during this period \nof time to be a livable wage. It has only been in the last 10 to 12 \nyears where there has been a serious decline in the purchasing power of \nthe minimum wage.\n  Over here, we go now from 1978--this chart over here, 1979 to 1993--\nand it is effectively the same chart, divided again by quintile, and \nthis chart reflects what has been happening from effectively 1979 to \n1993, real family income growth by quintile.\n  Here we see the bottom 20 percent, those at the lower level of the \neconomic ladder, they are not increasing. There are no blue marks here. \nIt is increasing red marks. Their purchasing power has declined by some \n17 percent during the period where there has been some very important \nreal growth. The next 20 percent has declined by 8 percent, the middle \nsome 3 percent, the fourth quarter has gone up 5 percent, and the \nlargest increase has been with the wealthiest individuals.\n  This is a profile about what is happening in our country over a \nperiod of time in terms of real economic growth per family income.\n   Mr. President, it is a reminder about where we are and where we have \nbeen and where we are going.\n   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1977.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   .\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the current economic recovery has generated record \n     profits for industry, but hourly wages have grown at a below \n     average rate;\n       (2) the minimum wage has not been raised since April 1, \n     1991, and has lost more than 10% of its purchasing power \n     since then;\n       (3) the average minumum wage worker provides 50% of her \n     family's weekly earnings;\n       (4) nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults, \n     and 60% are women;\n       (5) a full-time, year-round worker who is paid the minumum \n     wage earns $8,500 a year, less than a poverty level income \n     for a family of two;\n       (6) there are 4.7 million Americans who usually work full-\n     time but who are, nevertheless, in poverty, and 4.2 million \n     families live in poverty despite having one or more members \n     in the labor force for at least half the year;\n       (7) the 30% decline in the value of the minimum wage since \n     1979 has contributed to Americans' growing income inequality \n     and to the fact that 97% of the growth in household income \n     has accrued to the wealthiest 20%;\n       (8) legislation to raise the minumum wage to $5.15 an hour \n     was introduced on February 14, 1995, but has not been debated \n     by the Senate; and\n       (9) the Senate should debate and vote on whether to raise \n     the minumum wage before the end of the first session of the \n     104th Congress.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I indicated on the previous chart, we \nsaw what was happening for the 30 years between 1950 and effectively \n1980, and then in the last 13 years, about how we as a country in terms \nof our economy are effectively growing apart. Now we see the minimum \nwage no longer lifts families out of poverty.\n  Take that, and you go right back to 1960 and see what has happened \nnow from the 1980's, which is effectively this chart over here, what \nhas been going on up to 1995. This is effectively the red line, the \nminimum wage line, and the darker line is the poverty line that goes \nright across here on constant dollars.\n  Here you find that during the period of the 1960's, the 1970's, the \nminimum wage was just above what the poverty wage was; that is, it was \na livable wage. One family could receive the minimum wage and also have \na sense of respect and dignity and know that they \n\n[[Page S 10951]]\ncould effectively make it in America without being in poverty, and \nwithout being, as I will mention, a recipient of many of what we call \nthe support systems, the safety net programs. That is an interesting \nsidebar to this whole issue and I will come back to that in just a \nminute.\n  Then we saw how the minimum wage effectively stayed even in the \n1970's and 1980's and then gradually declined and continued to decline \nall the way to 1990. And this blip here was the increase in the minimum \nwage when President Bush in a bipartisan effort signed the minimum \nwage. And now we have sunk right back to where we were in 1990.\n  We have to ask ourselves, what is it about these working families, 12 \nmillion of whom would be affected by the increase in the minimum wage \nthat had been supported by the President and introduced in legislation \nby Senator Daschle? What is it we are saying to them? We are saying \nthat we effectively do not value their work; we do not respect the fact \nthat you are prepared to go out and work 40 hours a week to try to \nraise your children, to try to have a sense of dignity at the time we \nhave been seeing the expansion and the explosion in terms of the profit \nin our economy.\n  Mr. President, I have in my hand Business Week of July 10. This is \nnot the product of someone who has been a long-time fighter for the \nworking poor, although I take great pride in the fact that I have been \nfor the increased minimum wage. This is Business Week magazine. This \nparallels two other studies, which I will refer to. This is Business \nWeek. I will include the relevant parts in the Record.\n  This is what the cover story of Business Week, July 17, points out: \n``Productivity and profits are up a lot. Paychecks aren't. Is the \neconomy changing?''\n  It goes on:\n\n       Four years into a recovery, companies are flourishing and \n     joblessness is low, yet pay is inching up more slowly than \n     the prior four recoveries.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       Four years into a recovery, profits are at a 45-year high\n\n  A 45-year high in terms of profits for American companies and \ncorporations, 45-year high.\n\n       Unemployment remains relatively low, and the weak dollar \n     has put foreign rivals on the defensive.\n\n  The fact is since this President has been elected, there has been a \ncreation of some 8 million jobs in the period of the last 2 to 3 years, \nbut those have not been the high-paying, good-wage, good-benefit jobs \nthat I think most of us have associated with employment in terms of the \nstrongest industrial country and strongest economy in the world.\n  This is how Business Week continues in its article:\n\n       Yet U.S. companies continue to drive down costs as if the \n     economy still were in a tailspin. Many are tearing up pay \n     systems and job structures, replacing them with new ones that \n     slice wage rates, slice raises and subcontract work to lower-\n     paying suppliers. The result seems to defy the law of supply \n     and demand. While companies prosper, inflation-adjusted wages \n     and benefits are climbing at less than half the pace of the \n     previous expansion.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       Today even the incomes of many white collar employees are \n     sliding and labor's share has slumped to levels last seen 30 \n     years ago despite substantial productivity growth. These \n     trends have been dragging down the economy through the \n     recovery.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       But how long must we wait for productivity gains to boost \n     living standards?\n\n  What we are talking about here are living standards. We are talking \nabout families being able to educate their children. We are talking \nabout families being able to try to meet some of the needs of their \nparents, who are going to feel the pressures in terms of the Medicare \ncuts. We are talking about families being able to afford the mortgage \nand to be able to enjoy their own future with some degree of security. \nNow, this is what is happening.\n\n       But how long must we wait for productivity gains to boost \n     living standards? At this point in previous business cycles \n     gains from increased efficiencies would already have started \n     to wind their way through the economy. But after closely \n     tracking each other for decades, wage gains are now lagging \n     behind productivity growth.\n\n  We might have to talk about that in the Chamber, but all you have to \ndo is ask any working family what has been happening to their real \nincome over the period of the last 15 years. Dramatic change, and it \nhas been a downward one.\n\n       The combination of subpar pay gains and fewer wage earners \n     has already bitten deeply into pocketbooks. Per capita \n     disposable personal income has crawled along at 1.5 percent a \n     year over inflation in this recovery, half the average of \n     prior ones.\n\n  What this article is pointing out is generally we have had recessions \nin other periods of time in the last 40 or 50 years, but what is \nhappening now is even though there is the creation of additional jobs, \nthe income is not there for those new workers. And one of the principal \nreasons for the fact it is not there is because we have not met our \nresponsibilities of trying to make sure that work pays in our country, \nthat men and women who are prepared to work, will work, are able to \nreceive that livable wage.\n  ``Sooner or later,'' the article continues, ``the promise of this \neconomic strategy has to be fulfilled for the majority of Americans. \nThe sight of bulging corporate coffers coexisting with continuous \nstagnation in American's living standards could become politically \nuntenable.''\n  Mr. President, as we have seen in other parts of the magazine, we can \nsay, well, what is happening to the stock market? That has been going \nup. But we know who participates in the stock markets--certainly not \nthose who for the most part are in middle incomes. Once again, here it \nis going up through the roof. So corporate profits and CEO salaries \nhave been going up through the roof, the stock markets are going up \nthrough the roof, and the minimum wage has been in a continuing and \nconstant decline.\n  Mr. President, all we are saying is that we are entitled to try to \nbring that minimum wage back on up to make sure that American families \nwho want to work and can work are going to be able to provide for \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment or two of the Senate's time \nto review with the Senate an historical analysis of what has happened \nwhen we have had an increase in the minimum wage, because we are going \nto hear a lot of voices out here about we cannot afford an increase in \nthe minimum wage because it is going to cost jobs; we cannot afford to \nraise the minimum wage because there is going to be inflation.\n  Well, the fact is that is great rhetoric. I took the time, after the \nlast debate we had in the late 1980's, and just reread the debate \nduring the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's, and 1960's, and you could just \nsubstitute the names because the speeches were virtually identical, \nwith everyone saying we just cannot afford to do it; we are just \nbeginning to make the economy go and here you are going to go out there \nand try to undermine our economy with an increase in the minimum wage. \nThey said it last time. We increased it in 1990, and we have seen since \n1992 the growth of 8 million jobs.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a few more moments. I see my \ncolleagues waiting. I would just like to point out what has happened \nhistorically with the minimum wage because we will have study after \nstudy after study after study out here. And I will include some of the \nmost recent studies that I think have been so compelling. There will be \nothers who will try to flyspeck those studies, the study particularly \nwith regard to New Jersey, which is a very interesting and a very \npositive one. But the one thing you have to recognize is the historical \nanalysis of the increase in the minimum wage. This is history. This is \nwhat has happened. This is not some study by one of these organizations \nfor the various industries that have been historically opposed to any \nincrease in the minimum wage. This is the historical analysis of what \nhas happened to our economy on the issue of employment when we have \nseen the increase in the minimum wage. This is what we have seen. It \ngoes back to 1949 when the minimum wage rose from 40 cents to 75 cents; \nunemployment decreased.\n  In 1955, unemployment decreased from 4.4 to 4.1 percent.\n  From 1961 to 1963, from $1 to $1.25; unemployment decreased from 6.7 \nto 5.5 percent. \n\n[[Page S 10952]]\n\n  From 1967 to 1968, $1.25 to $1.60; unemployment decreased from 3.8 \npercent to 3.5 percent.\n  During the seventies, 1974 to 1976, 655,000 new jobs, despite the \nrecession; retail employment increased 5.2 percent. They are the \nprincipal ones opposed to any kind of increases.\n  From 1978 to 1981, employment increased by 8 million jobs, including \n1.4 million retail jobs. You go from $2.30 to $3.35 in 1990, $3.35 to \n$4.25, despite the severe recession from 1988 to 1992.\n  We had it up in my part of the country, New England. With 4 percent \nof the Nation's population, we lost 20 percent of the Nation's jobs; 20 \npercent of the Nation's jobs we lost. We are beginning to come back. \nThe tragedy is, those are not nearly as good jobs as they should be. \nBut despite the severe recessions that we had, we have seen the \ndramatic growth of these jobs.\n  Mr. President, this is the record. Not only on the question of the \nminimum wage and what has happened to employment, but also with respect \nto inflation--these are the two arguments that they use.\n  We will hear later on how it is going to be harmful to black \nteenagers. We are about a couple hours away until somebody brings that \nargument out. These are the standard arguments.\n  I see my two colleagues. Go back and read the history on these \nthings. You see the same old arguments that come up.\n  What has happened on the question of inflation is that we have seen, \nwith the increase of 1949, an increase of 1 percent; in the sixties, \nless than .3 of 1 percent; stability here; from 1974 to 1976 inflation \nactually decreased; then it increased marginally and then decreased; \nand then from 1990 to 1991, it decreased from 5.4 to 4.2 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, I know that there are those who are going to come \nout here and argue with the Business Week analysis in terms of what has \nbeen happening in America: Companies and corporations where the profits \nare going up, the stock market is going up, their productivity \nincreasing. The one thing they ought to recognize, which in Business \nWeek is clear as can be, and is something every worker understands, is \nthat real purchasing power for workers is going down.\n  I hope that our colleagues will not use those worn-out old arguments \nabout the problems that we are facing in inflation and the problems \nthat we are going to be facing in terms of unemployment, because the \nrecord, which is the most important record--and that is the historic \nrecord--just does not justify it. We have demonstrated and seen this, \nMr. President, and we believe that now is the time to make sure that \nmen and women who are out there working, and working hard, trying to \nmake ends meet, trying to bring up a family are going to be able to \nexperience some hope and opportunity.\n  Finally, Mr. President, one point that I want to mention on this \nchart for all of our Members--and we do not come to this consideration \nvery frequently--if you start paying the American people a livable \nwage, do you know what happens? They lose their eligibility for support \nsystems. Do you know what that means? That means the general taxpayer \npays less, that they do not have to support the various support \nprograms, which are the WIC Program, Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren, fuel oil programs, other kinds of support programs. You pay \nthe American workers, who are working and trying to pay for their own \nliving, and they lose their eligibility for those support programs and \nthat saves billions of dollars--billions of dollars.\n  Who pays for those billions of dollars? It is the workers. This makes \nsense if you are for deficit reduction, if you want to lower the tax \nprogram on workers because if they pay the minimum wage, they lose \ntheir eligibility and you begin to save the billions of dollars.\n  This makes sense. It makes sense as a matter of decency and fairness, \nas part of our commitment that has been there for some 50 years, where \nwe are going to honor work and say to men and women who want to work, \ncan work, and will work that they ought to have an American wage that \nsays that they can provide for their family and for their future, that \nthey are going to be able to educate their children.\n  That has been true all the way through the forties, fifties, sixties, \nall the way through the seventies, and it has only been in the recent \nyears that we have seen this abdication of responsibility to working \nfamilies.\n  Right in the face of this, Mr. President, are the various reports--I \nhave colleagues on the floor now--but I will review the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics report from just last week, and another very, very important \nstudy that reaches this very same conclusion.\n  These workers are entitled to be a part of the American system. They \nhave been left out and left behind. We have to ask ourselves who will \nspeak for them. At other times, we have come together, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, in order to make sure that those families that want \nto work can work, are proud to work, are playing by the rules, trying \nto bring up their children, are going to be able to live in some \ndignity. That is what the increase in the minimum wage is about.\n  We invite our colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution so that families will know that we are serious in making \nsure that for working families, work pays in America and that we honor \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may follow immediately on what Senator \nKennedy just talked about, this Friday we are going to be taking up \nwelfare reform. Ninety-five percent of what we hear about as welfare \nreform is not welfare reform. It is just moving the boxes around, \nshifting responsibility to States and doing some things like that. Real \nwelfare reform has to deal with the problem of jobs and the problem of \npoverty, and this is an issue that deals with the problem of poverty.\n  Why do we have this distribution problem in our society today? I \nthink there are three basic reasons. One is people are not as well \nprepared as they should be. As Secretary of Labor Bob Reich says over \nand over--and he is right on this--if you are well prepared, technology \nis your friend; if you are not well prepared, technology is your enemy.\n  A second reason we do not have the distribution factor that we should \nhave in our society today is that labor union membership is \ndramatically lower in our country than any other Western industrialized \ndemocracy. George Shultz, former Secretary of State and former \nSecretary of Labor under Republican administrations, made a speech in \nwhich he said all of us, management and labor and everybody, ought to \nbe concerned about the low percentage of workers belonging to labor \nunions. It is not a healthy thing for our society. If you exclude the \ngovernmental unions, it is down to 11.8 percent. That is a factor.\n  But a third factor in the distribution matter is the minimum wage. We \nsimply have not kept up with the inflation factor, and it is a problem.\n  In addition to the factors that Senator Kennedy mentioned, where we \nsave money in terms of AFDC and that sort of thing, the earned income \ntax credit, we have 11 million Americans who will benefit from \nincreasing the minimum wage 45 cents a year for 2 years, a total of 90 \ncents,\n and many of them will not get as much money on the earned income tax \ncredit. So there will be a dollar savings, in very real terms, for the \nFederal Government.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend from Minnesota here, as well. Does the \nSenator understand what it is about the institution, the Congress, that \nsays that we are going to refuse to have any increase in the minimum \nwage or even to consider it, and we are cutting back on the earned-\nincome tax credit that benefits only the individual workers that make \nsome $26,000 a year or less?\n  What is it about this institution that says that workers who are \nmaking less than $26,000, including the earned-income tax credit, ought \nto have their taxes increased, and yet we refuse to grant an increase \nin the minimum wage when we have a historic low, and at the same time \nwe are talking about tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals, who are \nat the top levels of our economy, who are right up here and giving \nthem, for the most part, a $245 billion tax reduction? Does the Senator \nfind \n\n[[Page S 10953]]\nsome difficulty in understanding why that series of policy decisions \nwould make sense for working families in this country?\n  Mr. SIMON. Well, in response to that question, which is an extremely \nimportant question for the American people, obviously it does not make \nsense. It is a response that grows out of something--and I \nknow the Senator from Massachusetts feels very strong about this--it \ngrows out of something that we ought to deal with, but we duck in \nCongress--that is, our system of financing campaigns. I join the \nSenator from Minnesota, and I applaud him for his leadership on what we \ndid on gifts and limiting on the lobbyists. But, frankly, that is 1 \npercent of the reform we need. Ninety-nine percent of the reform is on \nour system of financing campaigns.\n  If you have 20 individuals who are very wealthy in this country, who \nwanted some modest change in the law, who sent a $1,000 campaign \ncontribution to every Member of the U.S. Senate, I have an idea--unless \nit was an egregious request--that request would receive very \nsympathetic attention. We have 11 million people who will benefit by an \nincrease in the minimum wage, who, because of their situation, cannot \ngive a campaign contribution to anyone, and we are reluctant to \nrespond. I hope we will.\n  Let me just add for the benefit of the Presiding Officer--and I see \nmy friend from Kansas on the floor here, too--the last time we \nincreased the minimum wage, it passed 89-8 in the Senate, with 36 \nRepublicans voting for it. This should not be a partisan thing. We \nought to improve the lot of people who are really struggling. Are we \ngoing to be sensitive to that? I think that is the fundamental \nquestion. Are we going to be sensitive to people who really are \nstruggling in our society? I hope we come up with the right answer.\n  I am pleased to have the Senator from Massachusetts offering this \namendment, and what he is really calling on us to do is prod our \nconsciences a little bit, do what we ought to do for the people in \nPennsylvania, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, who are \njust eking out an existence, who do not know how they are going to make \nthe next rental payment, or how they are going to feed their family, \nuntil they get paid on Friday. These are people we have to be concerned \nabout. They do not make big campaign contributions to us. But that is \nwhat we ought to be here for. Those are the people we ought to be here \nfor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis remarks. I have said it to him many times, I am going to really \nmiss him. I think he has been a real conscience of the Senate, and I \nthink people admire the Senator from Illinois not only because of his \nintegrity but because of the way he treats each and every Senator with \nreal respect and sensitivity. He cares a lot about people, and that is \nwhat this debate is really about. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be included as an original cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as I understand this amendment, it \nsimply urges the Senate, asks the Senate to take the position that we \nwill indeed take up and debate legislation to raise the Federal minimum \nwage, at least by the end of the Congress. Am I correct, I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts? Is that essentially it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, it seems to me that this is a \nmost reasonable and important amendment. Despite the increases that \nwent into effect in 1990 and 1991, the current minimum wage is not a \nworking wage. It is still a poverty wage. At $4.25 an hour, a person \nworking 40 hours a week at the minimum wage earns just $170 a week. \nThat is before taxes and Social Security are deducted.\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota when you talk to people in cafes, I think \nreally probably more than any other single issue, or set of issues, the \nfocus is on what I would call basic economic justice questions. People \nreally feel the squeeze that the Senator from Massachusetts has talked \nabout. And really since the decade of the seventies, the bottom 70 \npercent has lost ground. When you talk to people and you ask people \nwhat are the issues you care most about, what people say over and over \nagain is, ``I care about being able to have a decent job that I can \nsupport myself and my family on.'' Mr. President, that is what we are \ntalking about. Right now, at $4.25 an hour, you can work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, and you still are not even up to the poverty \nlevel.\n  So there are many, many people--we are talking about 11 million \npeople-plus who would benefit from this. I think it is a fundamental \neconomic justice issue.\n  Mr. President, one popular misconception--and the Senator from \nMassachusetts may have covered this earlier, but I want to in my brief \ntime--and I will only speak for about 5 minutes, I say to my colleague \nfrom Kansas--a popular misconception is that the minimum wage is \nbasically paid to teenagers who flip burgers in their spare time. But \nless than one in three minimum wage workers are teenagers. In fact, \nnearly 50 percent of those who receive minimum wage are adults that are \n25 years of age or older.\n  It is simply impossible to support yourself or to support your \nfamily. The minimum wage is not a working wage. We had a bipartisan \nconsensus, at least up until recent history, that we would make a \nminimum wage a working wage. But when you look at this, if there ever \nwas some action that we should take as a Senate in this Congress, it \nwould be action to raise this minimum wage so that people can make a \ndecent living, so that people could support themselves, so that people \ncan support their families.\n  Mr. President, if the truism--and I know the chair has been involved \nin welfare reform--is that the best welfare program is a job, and what \nwe want to do is move from welfare to workfare, I would argue that the \nbest welfare reform is a job that pays a living wage. That means a \nminimum wage that can lift families out of poverty and thereby make a \nhuge difference.\n  Right now, if we are going to go to welfare reform--because I think \nit could be reformatory if we stay on the present course, just \npunishing children and single parents, mainly women. But if we are \ngoing to move toward real welfare reform, the problem we all have--and \nwe all know about this--is all too often by the time a mother--because \nit is usually the mother, and I wish more fathers would accept \nresponsibility for taking care of children when marriages do not work \nout well.\n  All too often what happens for that welfare mother is that by the \ntime she takes a job, and now has to pay for child care--and, like any \nparent, she wants this not to be custodial but good child-developmental \nchild care--by the time she loses Medicaid assistance and has a job \nthat does not pay but $4.25 an hour or $5 an hour, she is worse off.\n  The Washington Post had a really splendid series of articles about \nthis very problem.\n  It seems to me on matters of basic economic justice, on what it is \nthat people care the most about, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely on the mark. We ought to make a commitment. I think that is \nall he is asking for Members to do. As I understand the amendment, we \ndo not even have a specific wage. It is not a specific proposal, but an \namendment that says that this Senate goes on record, making a \ncommitment that by the end of this Congress, we will at least take up \nand debate a minimum wage bill.\n  I ask the Senator, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  If the Senator would yield for a moment, I listened with interest to \nhis statistics. He is providing a real service to the Senate in \noutlining the actual income and age of minimum wage earners in 1993.\n  I am wondering if the Senator's figures are basically in agreement \nwith this chart, the source of which is the Economic Policy Institute, \nthat says 57.6 percent of the minimum wage earners in 1993 were below-\naverage-income adults; then there is below-average-income teens, \neffectively 14 percent; above average income, 11 percent for teens; 17 \npercent for above-average-income adults.\n  The idea, as I understood the Senator, was that this increase really \nreaches the working families who are \n\n[[Page S 10954]]\ntrying to make ends meet and the ones that are prepared to work the \nlong and hard hours. If it does reach some teenagers, it is basically \nreaching teenagers who are from families with family incomes which are \nlower than the poverty line as well. Actually, it is a pretty targeted \nprogram.\n  I think the Senator might agree with me that the minimum wage has a \ngreater elevating effect on the incomes with single individuals or \nmarried couples, but the earned income tax credit has the greatest \nimpact on families with a number of children.\n  I ask the Senator, as a professor of economy, whether he would agree \nthat, therefore, doing something about both is really reaching, in many \nrespects, our fellow Americans who are trying to make ends meet--some \nwith larger families, some of them either individuals or just a couple \nmaybe with one child, I think that is the breaking point--but are \ntrying to make ends meet and they are at the lower rung of the economic \nladder and have been ones that have seen their real income decline most \ndramatically in recent times.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator and then \nyield the floor to my colleague from Kansas who is anxious to speak.\n  I respond to the Senator from Massachusetts in two different ways. \nFirst of all, I say to my colleague, as a strategy of welfare reform or \nas a targeted strategy to reduce poverty and have more economic \nopportunity, and for that matter, as a targeted strategy to move toward \na middle class or as a targeted strategy to reduce violence, I do not \nthink there is any question that it is the key. That is what we have to \nfocus on.\n  I say to my colleague, my understanding is that, roughly speaking, in \npoll after poll, 70 to 75 percent of the population agree. When we have \na broad consensus in our country that we ought to raise the minimum \nwage, we ought to make it a working wage, it is all a part of economic \nopportunity, it is extremely important to this country, then it seems \nto me the Senator from Massachusetts does everyone a real service by \nsaying, ``Let's go on record making it clear that indeed we will \naddress this problem. We will have some positive legislative \ninitiatives in this area.''\n  Again, I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I hope that this \namendment receives widespread support. It should. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I agree that Congress should increase \nthe minimum wage standard. I have voted for minimum wage increases in \nthe past and I will vote for reasonable minimum wage increases in the \nfuture.\n  The minimum wage, established in 1938 by the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, has been raised 17 times. From 1938 to 1974, the wage was raised \nfrom 25 cents to $2 per hour. The last two increases took place in 1990 \nwhen the wage level was set at $3.80 and then again in 1991 when it was \nraised to its current level. I voted both for final passage and the \nconference report of the wage increases of 1990 and 1991. If the \nminimum wage had kept pace with the Consumer Price Index, the current \nlevel would be $6.85 today.\n  I want to work in a bipartisan fashion with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts in passing the minimum wage, but I feel the schedule \nof the Senate is best left in the care of the majority leader in his \npreparation of the schedule of the Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts, and to support efforts to \nraise the minimum wage.\n  In recent weeks I have read articles and newspaper editorials \nconcerned about wage stagnation. While profits are up, wages are down. \nRaising the minimum wage represents the least this Congress can do. Our \nfailure to act to raise the minimum wage will only add to the problem \nof stagnant wages. No excuse about not being able to fit this issue in \nour agenda will satisfy workers who are just looking for a break.\n  The bill that is being proposed will raise the minimum wage from its \ncurrent rate of $4.25 per hour to $4.75 next year and $5.15 per hour in \nthe second year. If we fail to raise the minimum wage beyond the \ncurrent $4.25 an hour, the buying power of workers earning the minimum \nwill be at its lowest level since 1955--1955. How many people here \nwould be satisfied with 1955 wages?\n  There are those who will argue that the minimum wage doesn't really \nhelp families or adult workers, but that is not what the facts tell us. \nThe facts are that over 60 percent of workers receiving the minimum \nwage are adults. And over one-third of minimum wage earners are the \nonly wage earners in their families.\n  Mr. President, far too many workers are losing ground. Far too many \npeople are working longer and working harder, but their checks are \ngetting smaller. Far too many of our actions this year have ignored the \naverage wage earner. How can we justify keeping the minimum wage at \n$4.25 an hour in the same year we decide to cut the earned income tax \ncredit? If Congress opposes an increase in the minimum wage and votes \nto cut this tax credit how can we expect people to get ahead? How can \nwe expect some of these struggling families to stay off the very public \nassistance programs, which ironically, some Members are trying to cut \nor eliminate?\n  It is time we returned to the bipartisan support this issue once had. \nIt is time we returned to the spirit of 1989 when only eight Members of \nthe Senate voted against increasing the minimum wage. Let's make a \ncommitment to working men and women all across the country and tell \nthem that hard work will be rewarded and that they can get ahead. \nMaking $5.15 an hour won't make anyone rich, but it may give some \npeople a fair shake.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator from Kansas has been waiting. And I just need \n60 seconds. I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for once \nagain raising for the Senate an important issue.\n  I simply underscore--I think I am correct, and the Senator may be \nable to confirm this--in the 1960's and 1970's, the minimum wage \npermitted people in this country to be able to earn just at poverty \nlevel; but because of the diminishment of earnings in the United States \nover the course of the last 13 years particularly, minimum wage now \nproduces only 70 percent of the poverty level in income.\n  So the country traditionally has paid a minimum wage that at least \npromised to keep people at poverty level. Today, it is at 70 percent of \npoverty level, at a time when we all know it is an awful lot harder \nwithout the sufficient skills to be able to break out.\n  Not only do we have the same kinds of antipoverty or rising tide jobs \nthat lift you, you have a much greater difficulty, but you are much \nlower in the purchasing power that you have from whatever the minimum \nwage gives you.\n  I think it underscores the purpose.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could take a moment of time, the Senator is quite \ncorrect.\n  I want to just point out what we have not gotten into in the debate, \nand that is what is happening to the chief executives of major \ncorporations.\n  More than 500 were paid over $1 million, according to a Business Week \nsurvey of 742 companies. Chief executives have been getting substantial \npay in recent years. Mr. President, in 1994 executive salaries \nincreased 10 percent, while workers' wages rose 2.6 percent.\n  In many cases, the total pay went down because they did not cash in \ntheir stock options since the stock market was not at its peak. The \n$2.9 million average pay of 1994 was 54 percent higher than the $1.9 \nmillion average they received 5 years ago. The executives' pay has been \nskyrocketing, yet the workers' pay is down.\n  I am not interested, in this debate, to try and take away from those \nthat are trying to expand and make a great success in terms of \ncompanies or corporations, but it seems to me to be relevant, in terms \nof a society, about people working. Those in the white collar are \nworking hard but the blue collar are working hard, too, and they are \nthe ones that are left out and left behind.\n  We are not making this point just with regard to blue-collar workers. \nThe same thing has happened to the white collar. That is quite a \ndifferent story. It is worth considering in the total context of \ndebate.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Kansas for her forbearance.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise not to debate the pros and cons \nabout whether we should increase the \n\n[[Page S 10955]]\nminimum wage. The bill currently before the Senate is the State \nDepartment reorganization bill of 1995, a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is a sense of \nthe Senate that we should debate and vote on whether to raise the \nminimum wage before the end of the first session of the 104th Congress.\n  I would like to point out, Mr. President, that minimum wage \nlegislation comes under the jurisdiction of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, of which I am chairman and the Senator from \nMassachusetts is ranking member.\n  I believe it is important to hold hearings on this issue in our \ncommittee. The minimum wage is just one part of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. That Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation which \ncovers everything from child labor laws to overtime laws. I think it is \none that needs extensive and thorough review and hearings. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. The minimum wage is just one part of \nthat.\n  Congress has not conducted a serious oversight of the entire statute \nfor several decades. I believe it is of fundamental importance and the \nresponsibility of our committee to do so. Clearly, the law needs to be \nbrought up to date to reflect significant changes in the workplace over \nthe last 50 years.\n  I am committed to holding hearings in the Labor Committee to review \nall aspects of the FLSA, including the minimum wage. I think it is \npremature, however, to be bound by this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nand have it viewed as a debate on whether one is for or against an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n That is not what this debate is about.\n\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts, as the ranking member, knows \nthat our committee has had a very full agenda. There are a number of \nimportant issues we have been working on, including health care, job \ntraining, FDA and OSHA reform, and several reauthorization bills which \nhave to be completed this year.\n  Unfortunately, I think, despite the importance of FLSA reform, the \nschedule has just not permitted us to hold hearings yet. Hearings that \nI think we need to have and should have and, as I have said before and \nI will say again, I am committed to holding.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the Senator from Massachusetts, now \nthe ranking member, was chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee for the last 2 years. There was no real sense of urgency at \nthat time, when my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwere in the majority, to address this issue. I really have to wonder \nwhy, all of a sudden, on this State Department reorganization \nlegislation, the Senator has offered a sense of the Senate which could \nbe interpreted, I think wrongly, as a vote for or against an increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  For that reason I think this is not the time or the place to have \nthis type of debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2029 to Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself and \n     Mrs. Kassebaum, proposes an amendment numbered 2029 to \n     amendment No. 1977.\n       Strike all after the word ``that'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``that the Senate should debate and \n     vote on comprehensive welfare reform before the end of the \n     first session of the 104th Congress.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kassebaum, the chairman of the Labor Committee, for \nher statement. I hope people heard her statement.\n  Also, I will mention the reason why I offered this second-degree \namendment. The second-degree amendment says Congress should take up and \nconsider and vote on comprehensive welfare reform before the end of \nthis year. I think that is a very high priority. Maybe I think it is a \nhigher priority than increasing the minimum wage, because I happen to \nbelieve increasing the minimum wage will cost jobs.\n  The Senator from Kansas, as chairman of the Labor Committee, said she \nwill have a hearing on minimum wage. I might mention, that is more than \nour friends on the other side did. The sponsor of this amendment, when \nhe was chairman of the Labor Committee for the last 2 years, I do not \nbelieve they had hearings on increasing the minimum wage. I know, if my \nmemory serves me correctly, Senator Mitchell, when he was majority \nleader the last 2 years, they did not pull up legislation on the floor \nof the Senate to increase the minimum wage.\n  Now they offer an amendment to this bill, the State Department \nauthorization bill, and the amendment says we should consider and take \nup and vote on increasing the minimum wage.\n  No. 1, that is an amendment that has nothing to do with the State \nDepartment authorization. It is kind of saying: We were running the \nSenate for a number of years and it was not a high enough priority for \nus to do it then, but now we want to do it while Republicans are \ncontrolling the Senate. I disagree. Senator Dole is the majority \nleader. He is the one who sets up the agenda of the Senate, not the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  So I have offered an amendment in the second degree. It says Congress \nshould take up welfare reform. I think that is important. I know the \nmajority leader thinks that is important. I think the majority leader \nshould set the agenda of the Senate.\n  So I compliment my friend from Kansas. I appreciate her cosponsoring \nthis amendment. I hope people will place this amendment as a higher \npriority.\n  I will mention, actually, probably neither amendment should be on \nthis bill. We should be considering the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. We ought to be voting on it. I will say we ought to be \nvoting on it in 15 minutes, because this entire body, by the majority \nleader, was told we will have votes not before 6 o'clock. For us to \ntake up nongermane amendments, for us to debate a lot of things and not \ntake up the legislation pending, I think is irresponsible. We have a \nlot of work to do. A lot of us would like to keep most of the August \nrecess. We would like to spend a little time in our States and with our \nfamilies.\n  So I think it is important for us to pass this bill. I know the \nSenator from North Carolina urges us to do so. We have a couple of \namendments that are pending. There are a couple of amendments we have \nthe yeas and nays ordered on. I hope we will vote on those. I hope we \nwill vote on those tonight.\n  We have a lot of other amendments, very, very important amendments, \nthat we may be dealing with, talking about reorganizing the State \nDepartment, abolishing agencies, restructuring--I compliment the \nsponsors of the bill before us. It is very substantive legislation.\n  We have also heard some in the administration say, ``Let's not let \nthis pass. Let's allow it to be slowed down.'' I regret that. But I \nthink we should take up the legislation. I think the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts needed to be amended, so I have offered an \namendment. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Again, I repeat, what this amendment is, it says Congress should take \nup before the end of this year comprehensive welfare reform. I know the \nPresident of the United States spoke to the Governors and he urged we \nhave welfare reform. I know the Senate majority leader spoke to the \nGovernors today and he said we should have welfare reform. So, \nhopefully, Congress will work out its difference and we will pass a \nbipartisan welfare reform bill this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I guess I am somewhat amused by the notion \nthat the way to solve the problem of an amendment that is somehow not \nappropriate on this bill is to amend that amendment with an amendment \nthat is not appropriate to this bill. The logic of that does not quite \nsit. But, on the other hand, we all want welfare reform. So I think it \nis perfectly appropriate, now that the precedent is set, for us to \nfollow suit with other amendments. \n\n[[Page S 10956]]\n\n  We will be happy to accept the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I do not think there is any further debate on it, so we could \nproceed.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2029) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2030 to Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \namendment of Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2030 to amendment No. 1977.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   .\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the current economic recovery has generated record \n     profits for industry, but hourly wages have grown at a below \n     average rate;\n       (2) the minimum wage has not been raised since April 1, \n     1991, and has lost more than 10% of its purchasing power \n     since then;\n       (3) the average minimum wage worker provides 50% of her \n     family's weekly earnings;\n       (4) nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults, \n     and 60% are women;\n       (5) a full-time, year-round worker who is paid the minimum \n     wage earns $8,500 a year, less than a poverty level income \n     for a family of two;\n       (6) there are 4.7 million Americans who usually work full-\n     time but who are, nevertheless, in poverty, and 4.2 million \n     families live in poverty despite having one or more members \n     in the labor force for at least half the year;\n       (7) the 30% decline in the value of the minimum wage since \n     1979 has contributed to Americans' growing income inequality \n     and to the fact that 97% of the growth in household income \n     has accrued to the wealthiest 20%;\n       (8) legislation to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour \n     was introduced on February 14, 1995, but has not been debated \n     by the Senate; and\n       (9) the Senate should debate and vote on whether to raise \n     the minimum wage before the end of the first session of the \n     104th Congress.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this simply puts us back in the \nparliamentary position we were in. We have now agreed we ought to have \nwelfare debated before the end of the session. The issue before us is \nstill whether or not we ought to have the minimum wage debated before \nthe end of the session.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague. I will \nbe glad to be a cosponsor of the amendment of the Senator, but I am not \ngoing to make that request at the present time.\n  I just say, Mr. President, as the Senator from Kansas knows very \nwell, this legislation for the increase in the minimum wage was \nintroduced in February. There has been a very full agenda for the \ncommittee. I have enjoyed very much the opportunity to work closely \nwith Senator Kassebaum and our Republican colleagues. But it is a \nreflection of priorities. It has been the judgment of that committee to \nset other matters as priorities. I think at some time this should have \nhad a hearing and we have an opportunity to address this issue at this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that calls for us to debate and vote on raising the minimum \nwage some time before the end of this session of Congress. It does not \nendorse any particular outcome; it does not say we should pass S. 413, \nthe bill Senator Daschle introduced on behalf of the President, or vote \nto raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour--though I strongly believe \nwe should.\n  Rather, the amendment says only that the Senate should take up the \nissue, debate it, and vote one way or the other, rather than sweeping \nthis issue under the rug and ignoring the 12 million American workers \nwho would get a raise if the President's bill were enacted.\n  The appropriate level for the minimum wage is a critical issue, both \nfor the millions of low-wage workers who are directly affected by it \nand for the economy as a whole. Income inequality is a growing problem \nin the United States, and the declining purchasing power of the minimum \nwage is an important factor in the problem.\n  Since 1979, 97 percent of the growth in real household income has \ngone to the wealthiest 20 percent, while the remaining 3 percent of the \ngrowth in household income has been shared by the other 80 percent of \nAmericans. The real family income of the bottom 60 percent of Americans \nhas declined since 1979, while the real income of the top 20 percent of \nfamilies grew 18 percent.\n  Part of the decline in income for the middle and lower middle class \nhas been caused by the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage, which has fallen almost 30 percent since 1979, and more than 10 \npercent since it was last raised in 1991. As a nation, we are getting \nfarther and farther away from the concept that work should pay, that a \nfull-time, year-round worker should be able to keep her family out of \npoverty.\n  Today, a nurse's aide, janitor, or child care worker who makes the \nminimum wage earns just $8,500 for 50 weeks of work at 40 hours a \nweek--falling more than $6,000 short of the poverty threshold for a \nfamily of four.\n  There is an old saying that, ``the rich get richer and the poor get \npoorer.'' But that should not be our national economic policy. The \nSenate should vote on raising the minimum wage because it is immoral \nand destructive to have one out of every nine families with a full-time \nworker living under the poverty line--without enough money to feed and \nclothe their children and keep a roof over their heads.\n  The rich in America are getting richer: the value of the stock market \nhas increased more than 400 percent since 1982. But almost everyone \nelse, and the working poor especially, are getting poorer. Real wages \nhave declined, on average, 15 percent since 1982.\n  Business Week magazine, in a recent cover story called, ``The Wage \nSqueeze,'' argues that ``weak wage growth is sapping demand'' and \n``dragging down the economy throughout the recovery.'' Even though \ncorporate profits are at record highs and unemployment has been falling \nsteadily for three years, hourly pay and per capita income have lagged \nfar behind the average recovery.\n  Raising the minimum wage will not, by itself, reverse the growing \nincome inequality that threatens our economic future. But it would be a \nstep in the right direction. If we increased the minimum wage to $5.15 \nan hour, 11 million hard working people would get a raise.\n  I have heard all of the arguments against the minimum wage, and none \nof them has any merit. For years, it was argued that raising the \nminimum wage was bad for the people who got the raise because a \nsignificant number of them would lose their jobs.\n  Well, year after year, we had minimum wage increases, and the economy \ncontinued to add jobs by the millions.\n  Then it was claimed that teenagers would lose their jobs if the \nminimum wage went up. But when economists stopped quoting from their \ntextbooks and studied the actual, real world data, they found that \ntheir theories were wrong--even teenage unemployment is not \nsignificantly affected by raising the minimum wage.\n  First, Princeton's David Card and Alan Krueger, then Harvard's Larry \nKatz and Bill Spriggs of the Joint Economic Committee, found that \nbusinesses adjusted to minimum wage increases in various ways, such as \nincreasing prices, but they did not respond by cutting their workforce. \nIn some cases, they\n  actually added workers.\n\n  How is this possible? Why did demand for these workers not go down as \ntheir cost went up? The obvious answer is that their work was so \nundervalued at the minimum wage that their employment was still a major \nbenefit for employers after the minimum wage was raised. And that is \nthe situation today. The minimum wage is so low that the work done by \nthe employees who earn the minimum wage is undervalued and underpriced.\n  Raising the minimum wage is no likelier to cause job losses today \nthan \n\n[[Page S 10957]]\nit was when the last increase was made in 1991. We have added more than \n7 million net new jobs since then, and the minimum wage is a smaller \nfraction of the national average wage, and lower in real terms, than it \nwas in 1991. In other words, the minimum wage is even more underpriced \nnow than it was in 1991, and the employment effects of raising it \nshould be even less.\n  Now that the old argument about job losses has been disproved, the \nRepublicans have come up with a new argument, the exact opposite of the \nold one: raising the minimum wage is wrong, because it leads teenagers \nto drop out of school and go to work. The research supporting this new \ntheory is flawed. The data does not support it so opponents of the \nminimum wage will be forced to stretch their imaginations to come up \nwith new arguments.\n  For years, Republicans have claimed that the minimum wage is really \nno help to poor families because only teenagers work for the minimum \nwage. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 63 percent of \nminimum wage earners are adults over the age of 20.\n  Republicans have also argued that there are better ways to help the \npoor, such as the earned income tax credit. Now, however, Republican \nsupport for the EITC has begun to erode. They voted overwhelmingly for \na budget plan that assumes a $21 billion cut in the EITC over 7 years, \nwhich will raise taxes on 14 million low income workers.\n  They oppose helping the working poor with a minimum wage increase; \nthey vote to cut back the EITC; but they are rushing ahead with plans \nto give the wealthiest people in our society a lavish tax cut. It is no \nwonder we are growing apart as a nation when so much energy is expended \nto help those who do not need it, while pushing down the families at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder.\n  The growing Republican opposition to the earned income tax credit is \nbased on its budget impact--its cost to the Federal Government. The \nsame concerns should lead them to support a minimum wage increase, \nsince it will save the Federal Government more than a billion dollars \nover 5 years.\n  By moving millions of workers out of poverty, an increase in the \nminimum wage to $5.15 an hour would save more than $600 million in AFDC \nexpenditures, more than $350 million in Medicaid costs, and almost $300 \nmillion in food stamps, over five years. Raising the minimum wage is \nthe fair thing to do. It is also the cost-effective thing to do.\n  Three out of five minimum wage workers are women, and most of them \nmake important contributions to their families' income, while they also \nshoulder the responsibility for cooking meals, cleaning the house, and \ngetting their kids to day care. The average minimum wage worker brings \nhome 51 percent of her family's weekly earnings.\n  The Senate should debate and vote on raising the minimum wage because \nit is a way to help make life a little brighter for the people who \nstruggle to make ends meet, who believe in the American dream of \nworking hard in order to get ahead, but who have been finding \nthemselves slipping behind no matter how much harder they try.\n  I have met with many people who work for the minimum wage--especially \nyoung adults with families to raise--and their lives are hard. \nTypically, the husband works 30 to 35 hours a week at $4.25 an hour for \na pizza chain, including split shifts and evenings. His wife works 40 \nhours a week at similar wages. She staggers her work hours, so that \neither she or her husband can always be at home to take care of their \ntwo infants. Neither has health care coverage, and they cannot afford \nchild care.\n  So, between the two of them, they work all day long, rarely able to \nspend time together. They despair about saving to send their children \nto college because both of them are still paying off the loans they \ntook out for the 1 year of college they attended. These bright, hard-\nworking young Americans with high school educations and dreams of \nhigher education and attainment. But they are barely scraping by \nbecause the law allows their work to be undervalued and underpaid.\n   Senator Daschle introduced the President's bill on February 16, more \nthan 5 months ago. Yet the bill has not had a hearing and is not on the \ncalendar for floor consideration. With each additional month that \npasses, the value and purchasing power of the minimum wage declines \nstill more, and the lives of those who earn it are made harder.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt my amendment and commit \nitself to voting on legislation to raise the minimum wage before the \nend of this session of Congress.\n  I want to just reiterate a few items I think have made this matter \nmore timely. One is the various conclusions that are being reached now \nin Business Week magazine on the issue of wages. I will also have \nprinted in the Record the very significant June 25 story in the New \nYork Times. It starts out: ``Productivity Is All, But It Doesn't Pay \nWell.'' This is by Keith Bradsher. It points out:\n       It is a principle as old as capitalism and the antithesis \n     of Marxism: workers should reap according to their labors. \n     Yet over the last six years, compensation for American \n     workers seems to have stagnated even as they have worked ever \n     more efficiently and produced ever more goods.\n       The trend is especially striking because it breaks one of \n     the most enduring patterns in American economic history. \n     Workers have fairly consistently collected about two-thirds \n     of the nation's economic output in the form of wages, \n     salaries and benefits. Owners of capital, like stocks or \n     bonds or small businesses, have collected the other third, in \n     the form of dividends, profits and investment gains.\n       ``It is remarkable how constant labor's share has been over \n     the last 150 years,'' said Lawrence Katz, a former chief \n     economist at the Labor Department. ``This is one of the \n     strongest regularities of advanced economies.''\n       Wages and salaries and benefits actually climbed slightly \n     faster than productivity for a while in the late 1960's and \n     early 1970's. Productivity moved ahead a little faster than \n     compensation during the late 1970's, and through much of the \n     1980's. But it seems the real gap opened after that.\n       The strongest evidence so far that the workers are \n     receiving less of the fruits of their labors came last week, \n     when the Labor Department revised its estimate of wage and \n     compensation growth. After adjusting for inflation, average \n     wages and salaries apparently fell 2.3 percent over the 12-\n     month period that ended in March. Productivity rose 2.1 \n     percent during the same period.\n\n  That is what happened in June. This is what is happening in July. \nTalking about the timeliness of this particular measure, now is the \ntime. Now is the time.\n   Then the story goes on.\n\n       Include fringe benefits, and the current numbers look even \n     worse for wage-earners. Overall compensation fell 3 percent \n     in the 12-month period through March, as companies and State \n     and local governments provided fewer health benefits.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the whole article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 1995]\n\n              Productivity Is All, But It Doesn't Pay Well\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       It is a principle as old as capitalism and the antithesis \n     of Marxism: workers should reap according to their labors. \n     Yet over the last six years, compensation for American \n     workers seems to have stagnated even as they have worked ever \n     more efficiently and produced ever more goods.\n       The trend is especially striking because it breaks one of \n     the most enduring patterns in American economic history. \n     Workers have fairly consistently collected about two-thirds \n     of the nation's economic output in the form of wages, \n     salaries and benefits.

Mr. President, I would be glad to entertain a consent \nrequest. Is that the desire of the Senator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. HELMS. I want to get back to what we were talking about, the \nbill, if the Senator will allow us. I think he has made his point about \nwhat he thinks we ought to do. I thought that was the majority leader's \nresponsibility.\n  Will the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. I was informed that the Senator was prepared to make \na consent request and I was prepared to have that consideration. But I \nwill not take much more time. I will make some brief comments. I was \nattempting to try and accommodate the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a moment just \nfor the purpose of making a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving my right, Mr. President, I yield for a consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non amendment No. 2026, the Helms amendment, at 6:45 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I put in the Record the New York Times \narticle.\n  I want to just mention another article that was in the Washington \nPost of today, ``U.S. Finds Productivity, but Not Pay, Is Rising.''\n\n       The government yesterday confirmed what most workers \n     already knew: In terms of their pay, Americans are just \n     treading water.\n       The Labor Department reported that wages and benefits in \n     private industry increased 2.8 percent over the last year. It \n     was the smallest advance since the department began \n     calculating its employment cost index in 1981 and reflected \n     the low level of inflation and the inability of workers to \n     wrest pay raises from employers in an increasingly \n     competitive economy.\n       Adjusted for inflation, the compensation measure shows a \n     slight 0.2 percent decline over the past 12 months in spite \n     of robust gains in worker productivity and record levels of \n     corporate profits.\n\n  All of these studies are showing--Business Week, the Washington Post, \nthe New York Times, all within the past several weeks making the point \nthat we are experiencing record profits in the stock market, record \nprofits in corporations, declining wages in terms of workers in the \nminimum wage, and the family wage, which is now down to where it was in \n1989 which is the last time it was increased.\n   We were talking briefly out here with our friend and colleague from \nKansas saying, ``Why now?'' The interesting point about ``Why now?'' is \nwe have finally gotten to the bottom of where we were in 1989. We have \ngotten to that point in the last several weeks. At that time, a \nRepublican President said enough is enough. At that time, the President \nand a broad bipartisan group said that workers that were receiving only \nabout 70 percent of the real purchasing power of the minimum wage \nshould at least get some bump. They got some bump during the 1989-1991 \nperiod. But we have no recognition from the other side that there is a \nproblem. We do not hear our colleagues on the other side saying, let us \nget about the business and let us try to find some common ground, let \nus try to see if we cannot make a difference on it.\n   So, Mr. President, we believe that this is a timely matter, that the \nSenate should go on record as our friends from Minnesota and Illinois \npointed out. All this is saying is that we will go on record before the \nend of the session in terms of the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Really the proposal that Senator Daschle had was a bare bones program \nwhich would not even move back up, barely move us back up to where \nincreases were in 1990. The Daschle program brings up back here, not \nwhere it was in the period for some 15 years but only brings us back to \nwhere it was under a Republican President; not asking an awful lot. We \nare not out here demanding that we get a vote to bring it all the way \nback up here, although I believe that is justified. The Daschle \nproposal would move this red line right back up to where it was when it \nwas signed by a Republican.\n  This does not seem to me to be such a radical proposal to demand to \nsay, ``Oh, my goodness, we cannot possibly gain the time, have an \nopportunity to debate those issues out on the floor of the Senate. \nThere are too many other matters.'' I think we could get some time to \ndebate the importance of that particular measure that makes a \ndifference to 12 million of our fellow citizens.\n   We did not spend a lot of time when we were taking away some of the \nOSHA protection for those workers. We did not take a lot of time when \nwe were taking away the mine safety protection for those workers. We \ndid not even have the hearings over there in the Human Resources \nCommittee. We did not take much time on that when we were talking about \nsafety. Now we hear, ``Oh, my goodness.'' If we are going to just bring \nback the minimum wage to some extent to make it a little more \nrespectable for working families to have children, and 60 percent to 65 \npercent of the minimum wage workers are women in our society and are \nhaving difficulty making ends meet, we are suddenly saying, ``Oh, no. \nWe cannot be prepared to support this resolution that will just say \nthat by the end of this Congress we will consider it on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.''\n  That is what effectively we are hearing from the other side, that we \nhave too many other matters. I would be glad to be a cosponsor of \nSenator Nickles' amendment dealing with welfare reform. But what is so \ndifficult about working on the income too for working families? We did \nnot spend much time when the budget came back. When they had the \nreductions in the earned income tax credit for working families in that \nbudget proposal that is $4 trillion in terms of tax expenditures and \nthey put $21 billion in additional taxes on working families making \nless than $26,000. They were raising the taxes on these working \nfamilies.\n  All we are saying here is, ``Can we not find between now and the time \nthat we close down this business maybe a day, maybe a few hours, maybe \non a Friday afternoon, maybe on a Saturday, on something that will make \na difference to those 12 million Americans?'' We are prepared to stay \nhere and debate this on a Friday afternoon or a Saturday and set the \ntime for a vote. What do you think those families are thinking tonight? \n``We do not have the time to debate this issue. We do not have the time \nin August, in September, in October to spend a few hours and consider \nthis on the basis of the merit. We do not have time for that.''\n   Mr. President, I think they understand about who has time for them \nand who does not have time for them. I know Mr. Armey on the other side \nsaid, ``We will not have an increase in the minimum wage. We do not \ncare. It will just not pass.''\n  All we are saying is in the next 3 months give us a few hours to \ndebate it. If you are so sure of your side over there, if you are so \nsure of your facts, if you are so sure that there is going to be \ninflation and lost jobs, why not agree to debate it? Why not agree to \nit? Why not say, OK. Just let us go ahead and give us a time to vote? \nWe did it on the question of gifts. We did it on lobbying. We got votes \non those. Those were important measures. But somehow when it comes down \nto paying working families a livable wage, we will not do it.\n  Mr. President, we will have an opportunity to do it because this \nissue is not going to go away. We will hear people moaning and groaning \nabout, as I have heard for years and years and years, about, Oh, well, \nwe did not go through the committee of jurisdiction. That is always \nsuch a wonderful argument to use when you differ with something. But \nthen you come right out here at any other time, if you have the votes \nyou can get these matters up. Well, we may not have the votes to carry \nthis resolution, but we are going to keep after it. I know that this \ninstitution over a period of time will have the votes because it is \nright, it is fair, and it is the decent thing to do. It rewards \n\n[[Page S 10959]]\nwork, and it is a responsibility I think that we have to our fellow \ncitizens.\n  So if they say, no, we are too busy doing other matters; we are too \nbusy, we cannot find the time to do this, that is a message to the \nAmerican people. I do not think it will stand because it is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, this evening, my colleague from Wyoming and \nI come to the floor to discuss with the Senate what we believe to be a \nvery important issue. It has come to our attention in the last several \ndays that in a letter directed to the Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement in each of our States across the Nation, coming from the \nActing Director, Mr. Dombeck, a letter goes to them instructing them to \nengage in an outreach informational program about a pending piece of \nlegislation before the U.S. Senate.\n  If this is true, and in the manner in which it has been done, it \nappears that this Acting Director of BLM, who is a civil servant \nunconfirmed, may have acted in a way as to have violated the law of \nthis country.\n  I say so because it is very, very clear that section 303 of the 1995 \nInterior Appropriations Act states,\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this act shall be \n     available for any activity or the publication or distribution \n     of literature that in any way tends to promote public support \n     or opposition to any legislative proposal on which \n     congressional action is not complete.\n\n  The directive sent to the State directors of BLM, instructing them to \nperform in certain ways, was about the pending rangeland reform, or the \nPublic Rangeland Management Act that is now pending before the Senate. \nThis instruction went out prior to the committee's action, prior to the \nmarkup and the passing out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, this legislation. It is a detailed, instructive act.\n  Since that time, we have seen op-ed pieces, public comments, \ninterviews, and actions taken by State Directors of the BLM and/or \ntheir public information personnel.\n  While we are not sure that this constitutes a violation of the act, \nit clearly appears at this moment, at least to this Senator, that a \npublic information, if not a political campaign was launched to spread \nwhat is now misinformation about a pending piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a memo that I \nhave obtained from the Acting Director, going to the States, which \noutlines a complete campaign of information directed at a pending piece \nof legislation before the U.S. Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     July 5, 1995.\n     To: State Directors, Attention: External Affairs Chiefs.\n     From: Acting Director, Bureau of Land Management.\n     Subject: Healthy Rangelands Communication Plan.\n\n       Thank you for your excellent work over the past year \n     promoting BLM's efforts to improve the health of the public \n     rangelands. I believe that our approach to collaborative \n     public rangeland management best serves the people and the \n     lands entrusted to our stewardship.\n       In order to further promote our approach, we have developed \n     and attached a rangeland communication plan which I expect \n     each state to implement over the next three weeks. The July \n     communication's plan focuses on three areas: Resource \n     Advisory Councils (RACs), Inreach, and Outreach.\n       I commend your efforts during the RAC Domination process. \n     By now you should be working with your Governors to recommend \n     nominations for the Secretary's approval. These should be \n     submitted to the Washington Office by July 14.\n       In terms of ``inreach'', during July I want you to make \n     sure that all BLM staff have the opportunity to review our \n     briefing materials and agency testimony on the differences \n     between the Livestock Grazing Act and BLM's cooperative \n     relations and grazing administration rules.\n       Our primary focus for July is ``outreach''. The outreach \n     section of the communications plan identifies basic minimum \n     tasks that I expect the State Directors and State External \n     Affairs Chiefs to accomplish during July. Feel free to expand \n     or enhance these tasks as appropriate. The differences \n     between BLM's collaborative approach to public rangeland \n     management and the one presently under discussion in Congress \n     are dramatic. We have an obligation to make our constituents \n     aware of these differences.\n       Barry Rose (208/384-3393) of Idaho's Lower Snake River \n     Ecosystem Office and Chris Wood (202/208-7013) of the \n     Washington Office will continue to serve as field and \n     headquarters coordinators for rangeland communication issues. \n     Please provide Tony Garrett, Director of Public Affairs for \n     the Washington Office with an status update on implementation \n     of the communication plan each week during the external \n     affairs conference call.\n       Barry Rose and Chris Wood will discuss the communication's \n     plan with you at the conference call this afternoon.

Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Wyoming such \ntime as he may consume, to discuss the action that the Senate and the \nappropriate committees have decided to take.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank my colleague and the chairman of the subcommittee \nthat is handling this bill.\n  Let me say as background, it seems to me that this country relies on \nhaving a civil service legally buffered from political struggles. I \nthink that is terribly important.\n  Our Government is organized to have two levels, a political and a \ncivil service career level. Dedicated career employees implement the \nlaw, while those designated as political work with or against Congress \nto establish the law. It is a fine line that must be maintained.\n  The Clinton administration has apparently blatantly crossed that line \nand put career civil service employees in the position of violating one \nof the oldest lobbying laws on the books, that has sought for years to \nprotect against the very thing.\n  Let me cite it again, section 303 of the 1995 Interior Appropriations \nAct:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this act shall be \n     available for any activity or the publication or distribution \n     of literature that in any way tends to promote public support \n     or opposition to any legislative proposal on which \n     congressional action is not complete.\n\n  The protection, of course, is for both the employees and the public. \nThe Interior Department has asked employees in  their  jobs  to  lobby  \nagainst  the public range management action, violating both \nthe antitrust and the antilobbying action and the interior act.\n  We want to look into this from both standpoints--the standpoint of \nprotecting career employees as well as the standpoint of obeying the \nlaw and not having a bureaucracy campaigning on issues that are unfair.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Oversight Investigations, at the \nrequest of our chairman of the full committee, I have sent a letter to \nthe Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, and have asked him to \ncooperate in a reasonable investigation.\n  We have not yet determined whether there would be a hearing. If there \nare reasons to do that, we are prepared to have a hearing on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I think it is one that, obviously, is important in \nthis issue, but it is important in a broader sense than that. That is, \nthat we do have a separation, and we should protect career employees \nfrom being directed to get into the political activity of determining \nthe decisions and the political issues here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter that has been sent to the Secretary of the Interior.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,    \n                                               Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary of Interior,\n     Department of the Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Pursuant to the direction of the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee, this letter is to inform you \n     that the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee is \n     initiating an investigation of activities by employees of the \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that appear to constitute \n     violations of the 1995 Interior Appropriations Act and the \n     Anti-Lobbying Act. These lobbying activities are being \n     systematically directed against the Public Rangelands \n     Management Act of 1995, S. 852, which currently is before the \n     Senate, and other pieces of legislation pending before this \n     Committee.\n       Many of the lobbying activities relating to S. 852 appear \n     to stem from a July 8, 1995 memorandum from BLM Acting \n     Director Dombeck to all BLM State Directors which transmitted \n     a ``Healthy Rangelands Communication Plan.'' In his \n     memorandum, Mr. Dombeck states that the primary focus of BLM \n     during July is ``outreach.'' The purpose of this outreach is \n     ``to make our constituents aware'' of the differences between \n     BLM's ``approach to public rangeland management and the one \n     presently under discussion in Congress.'' As the memorandum \n     states, these differences are ``dramatic.'' Attached to Mr. \n     Dombeck's memorandum is a chart titled ``Rangelands \n     Communications Plan.'' This plan identifies five tasks which \n     apparently constitute the ``outreach'' referred to in Mr. \n     Dombeck's memorandum. These tasks involve BLM State \n     Directors, the External Affairs Chiefs and their staff in the \n     State Directors' Offices, and area and district managers. The \n     tasks include responding to ``misinformation,'' preparing \n     opinion pieces for the media, conducting briefings for \n     interest groups, meeting with key reporters, and meeting with \n     editorial boards. Mr. Dombecks' plan has resulted in BLM \n     employees in the field espousing the horrors of S. 852, and \n     numerous media stories throughout the West which cast S. 852 \n     in a very disparaging light.\n       It seems plain to me that the ``Healthy Rangelands \n     Communication Plan,'' and activities thereunder, was designed \n     to influence the legislative consideration of S. 852 in \n     precisely the manner prohibited by the Department of the \n     Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1995, Pub. \n     L. No. 103-322, section 303, 108 Stat. 2499, 2536 (1994) \n     (``section 303''). In addition, some of the actions taken by \n     BLM employees in implementing the plan may constitute \n     criminal violations of the Anti-Lobbying Act, 18 U.S.C. \n     section 1913. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight \n     and Investigations, BLM's ``Healthy Rangelands Communication \n     Plan'' and other activities aimed at influencing public \n     opinion on legislation pending before the United States \n     Senate greatly concerns me.\n       Section 303 of the 1995 Interior Appropriations Act states:\n       ``No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall \n     be available for any activity or the publication or \n     distribution of literature that in any way tends to promote \n     public support or opposition to any legislative proposal on \n     which congressional action is not complete.''\n       The language of section 303, on its face, is a very broad \n     and comprehensive prohibition on the expenditure of \n     appropriated funds. It includes four uses of the term ``any'' \n     in a single sentence. Congressional intent could not be more \n     emphatic. Moreover, the use of the word ``tends'' even more \n     clearly demonstrates that both direct and indirect conduct is \n     targeted, for, as a factual manner, even indirect conduct may \n     ``in any way tend'' to promote public support on an issue. \n     Without detailing other evidence of the breadth of section \n     303 in this letter, a close review of the legislative history \n     of this provision, which first appeared in the Interior's \n     appropriation bill for Fiscal Year 1978, and a General \n     Accounting Office opinion on this provision, clearly show \n     that section 303 is designed to prohibit any activity which \n     tends to promote public support for agency goals concerning a \n     matter pending before Congress.\n       Activities of BLM employees in implementing Mr. Dombeck's \n     plan may even rise to the level of violating section 1913 of \n     the United States Criminal Code. Section 1913 provides that:\n       ``No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of \n     Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by \n     Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any \n     personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, \n     printed or written matter, or any other device, intended or \n     designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to \n     favor or oppose, by vote or otherwise, any legislation or \n     appropriation by Congress . . .''\n       Violation of this section is punishable by removal from \n     office or employment, a fine, and up to one year \n     imprisonment. Although section 1913 permits direct \n     communications from agency officials to Members of Congress \n     made ``through proper official channels,'' actions \n     implementing\n      the ``Healthy Rangelands Communication Plan'' do not appear \n     to fall within this narrow exception.\n       The possibility that BLM employees may have violated \n     section 303 of the 1995 Interior Appropriations Act and, \n     perhaps, section 1913 of the Anti-Lobbying Act is a serious \n     matter which warrants an investigation by the Oversight and \n     Investigations Subcommittee. Your assistance in this \n     investigation is therefore requested. Accordingly, I request \n     that you forward all documents responsive to the following \n     request to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n     Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations:\n       All documents by or for any Department of the Interior \n     official or employee including, but not limited to: officials \n     or employees in the Office of the Secretary; officials or \n     employees in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Land \n     and Minerals Management; BLM officials or employees in \n     Washington, D.C., including Acting BLM Director Dombeck, Bob \n     Johns, Chief, BLM Public Affairs, Tony Garrett, BLM Public \n     Affairs Team Leader, Chris Wood, BLM Policy Analyst; BLM \n     State Directors; BLM State External Affairs Chiefs and public \n     affairs staff; BLM Area managers; and BLM District managers, \n     which discuss, analyze, implement, or \n\n[[Page S 10961]]\n     relate in any manner to the July 8, 1995 ``Healthy Rangelands \n     Communication Plan,'' or S. 852, the Public Rangeland \n     Management Act of 1995.\n       The term document shall include, but is not limited to, any \n     and all originals and drafts of any information whether in \n     written, typed, printed, recorded, transcribed, taped, or \n     audio-taped, however produced or reproduced. This request \n     shall include, but is not limited to, memoranda, letters, \n     briefing materials, analyses, talking points, computer \n     entries, electronic e-mails, telephone logs, tapes, notes, \n     diaries, journal entries, reports, studies, manuals, \n     speeches, opinion documents, position papers, messages, \n     summaries, and bulletins.\n       Because of the seriousness of these allegations, please \n     forward all responsive documents by Friday, August 4, 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Craig Thomas,\n\n                                         Chairman, Subcommittee on\n                                     Oversight and Investigations.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nhis response. He chairs the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee \nof the full Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I hope the Secretary of the Interior will cooperate. I think it would \nbe tragic if, in fact, the veteran career civil servants of this great, \nold organization called the Bureau of Land Management have been pushed \ninto a political activity by the acting director, the national director \nof the BLM.\n  At least from my cursory observation with the information that is now \navailable, it appears just that. Never in my 14 years in the U.S. \nCongress have I seen civil servants asking for and gaining interviews \nwith editorial boards, writing editorial or guest opinions in \nnewspapers, advocating a clear position on a given piece of \nlegislation. That simply is not allowed. It may well be a violation of \nthe Hatch Act.\n  There are other, broader ramifications here. At this moment, the kind \nof look that I have taken, and I think my colleagues in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee have taken, is that without question there \nappears at this moment at least to be a violation of this Senate's \nappropriations act.\n  The language that the Senator from Wyoming and I read, section 303, \nis not something new. It goes in every appropriations bill, and it has \ngone in for a good many years, directing the actions of the agencies \ninvolved and the money appropriated and how it should not be used in \ncertain cases.\n  We hope that the Secretary of the Interior would cooperate so we can \nget to the bottom of this issue, so that the State directors and the \ninformation officers of the BLM will not continually be put in a most \nawkward position over an issue they are now being asked to advocate, \nwhen it is the responsibility of the United States Congress to make \nthose decisions, and then for those agency personnel to carry them out \nand to promulgate the rules and regulations necessary.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, this should not be interpreted as a \nvote for or against raising the minimum wage. This is simply a sense of \nthe Senate that at some point we should debate and consider such an \namendment. And such we shall, but not until the Labor and Human \nResources Committee has had the opportunity to debate it and vote on it \nin committee, which I think is the proper procedure.\n  I believe this is not the time or place to address this matter, and I \nwill move to table the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a simple resolution and it is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we will consider, prior to the \ntime that we recess this year, whether we should raise the minimum \nwage. We have done sense-of-the-Senate resolutions on gifts, we have \ndone it on lobbying, we have done it on finance reform. All we are \nsaying is in the period of the next 12 weeks, can we find a few hours \nof the Senate's time to consider whether we should address the increase \nin the minimum wage, which is now nearly the lowest in terms of \npurchasing power that it has ever been in the history of the minimum \nwage, all at a time, Mr. President, that magazines like Business Week, \nthe New York Times, the Washington Post talk about record profits for \nindustry, record profits in the stock markets and record salaries for \nthe CEO's.\n  All we are saying is over the period of these next 3 months that we \nmight have a few hours to debate whether we should consider an increase \nin the minimum wage. It was good enough for \n\n[[Page S 10962]]\ncampaign financing, it is good enough for lobbying, it is good enough \nfor welfare reform. It ought to be good enough for the 12 million \nworking families in this country that today are at the bottom rung of \nthe economic ladder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n         Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 1977, as amended\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 91, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED NATIONS FOURTH WORLD \n                   CONFERENCE ON WOMEN IN BEIJING, CHINA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that----\n       (1) the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in \n     Beijing, China, should promote a representative American \n     perspective on issues of equality, peace, and development; \n     and\n       (2) in the event the United States sends a delegation to \n     the Conference, the United States delegation should use the \n     voice and vote of the United States----\n       (A) to ensure that the biological and social activity of \n     motherhood is recognized as a valuable and worthwhile \n     endeavor that should in no way, in its form or actions, be \n     demeaned by society or by the state;\n       (B) to ensure that the traditional family is upheld as a \n     fundamental unit of society upon which healthy cultures are \n     built and, therefore, receives esteem and protection by \n     society and the state; and\n       (C) to define or agree with any definitions that define \n     gender as the biological classification of male and female, \n     which are the two sexes of the human being.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment would express the sense \nof the Senate that the participation of the U.S. delegation to the \nupcoming U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women should reflect the \nAmerican perspective on the value of families.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It puts the Congress on \nrecord that the U.S. delegates should advocate the importance of family \nas the fundamental unit of our society.\n  Mr. President, most Americans would be surprised to learn that there \nis any reason for the Congress to take this step. However, some \nconference delegates from other nations apparently have views that \ndepart significantly from the mainstream and have said they may seek to \nhave them ratified during the conference. Americans are attending the \nconference. It should be as representatives of our American values.\n  Much has been said on the floor of this Chamber in recent months \nabout the importance of families and the vital role they play to ensure \nthe well-being of our children in our society.\n  Increased violent juvenile crime, high teen pregnancy rates, drug \nuse, and educational failure are painful realities.\n  In attempting to address these terrible problems, this Congress and \nour Nation have come to a common understanding, one that cuts across \nall political and social lines, that strengthening families is the \nsingle most crucial factor. We must do that if we are going to have an \nimpact on the problems that our society faces.\n  Mr. President, one of the cosponsors of my amendment is on the floor. \nI ask if the Senator would like me to yield \n\n[[Page S 10965]]\nfor him to say why he is a cosponsor of this amendment and why he \nthinks this is very important.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I am happy to yield, and I thank the Senator from Texas, \nand am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. After this discussion, we will have morning business and \nthere will be no additional action on this bill tonight.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, We have all become accustomed to the \nplethora of international conferences held by the United Nations. We \ntend to think of them as rather benign discussions about ideals. I have \ngrave concerns, however, about the U.S. acquiescing to overreaching \npolicy goals which could alter American culture. The Beijing Conference \non the Status of Women has these aims. Months of preliminary meetings \nhave produced a draft document which conflicts with the views of most \nAmericans and is silent on the unique role of women as mothers.\n  I hope that passage of this amendment will signal the United Nations \nand the administration that the Senate rejects the current language and \nthe current approach. The goals do not seek to understand and respect \nwomen's roles all over the world, but rather promote a particular \npolitical ideology of women.\n  The amendment which is being offered by the Senator from Texas \nreasserts what I believe the entire Senate and what the vast majority \nof Americans wish to reassert, regarding the role of mothers and the \nrole of traditional families.\n  It is hard to imagine how a document about the status of women could \nfail to even mention their roles as mothers. In fact one country had \nthe reference to ``mother'' replaced with ``caretaker.'' And ``family \nwith ``household''. References to fathers are made only in the negative \nterms of violence and abuse of wives and daughters. Likewise, the \ndocument fails to acknowledge the critical role of fathers in parenting \nand teaching their children by daily example to respect women and hold \nthem in esteem. There was no attempt to discuss the importance of \nfamilies in nurturing children and raising them to become responsible \ncitizens.\n  Some of the conference participants seem intent on dramatically \naltering the traditional view that the family structure is headed by a \nmarried man and woman. Demanding complete equality for men and women at \nhome, denies basic biology and trivializes women as mothers.\n  Senator Hutchison's amendment asserts the traditional family is the \nfundamental unit of society upon which healthy cultures are built and \ntherefore the traditional family should receive both the esteem and the \nprotection by society and the state. Traditional family has long been \nrecognized as the fundamental foundation, building block for this \nsuccessful society.\n  There have been attempts over the past several years to undermine the \nrole of the traditional family. I think those attempts have fortunately \nfailed because Americans, by strong majority, believe that traditional \nfamily role should be upheld and promoted wherever possible, and not \nundermined. Experience shows us--today particularly, with the declining \nsocial culture and problems that exist throughout society with young \npeople--the destructive nature of broken families and the impact that \nhas had on our social system, the incidence of juvenile delinquency, \nthe incidence of crime, the incidence of teenage pregnancy, of \nsubstance abuse, of teenage suicides, of breakdown in the moral fiber \nof our young people and in our society because of the breakdown of the \ntraditional family.\n  While gender is used 216 times in a 121 page document, it is never \ndefined. When several delegates sought to define gender, their efforts \nwere rebuffed. Behind the scenes, it became evident that the meaning of \ngender had been expanded to include not just male and female, but \ntranssexual, bisexual and homosexual.\n  A statement released by the UN Secretary General's office attempting \nto clarify some of this controversy only fuels it. It asserts that \n``sex and equality are absolute concepts'' and ``a person is born male \nor female and this is an unchangeable attribute.'' Strangely, however, \nthe Secretary General goes on to say that\n\n       Gender is also a relative concept. Although many people use \n     the term gender interchangeably with sex, the two terms are \n     quite different. Gender refers to the relationships between \n     women and men based on socially defined roles that are \n     assigned to one sex or the other . . . because the roles \n     change, gender is relative.\n\n  I wonder how many Americans consider ``gender'' to be relative. The \ndefinition of gender is sex, that is male or female, period. The \nGeneral Secretariat statement deliberately confuses roles of men and \nwomen with their identities as men and women. Clearly, both sexes can \nserve with equal skill and dexterity in many roles in our society. \nHowever, there are other roles--such as motherhood and fatherhood--\nwhich remain distinct. We should reject outright any attempt to promote \na political agenda based on a concept of gender which is alien to most \nAmericans.\n  The document makes clear the viewpoint that gender roles are all \nsocially constructed. There are no differences between the sexes. \nEmpowerment and advancement of women can only come when governments \ntake action to ensure that men and women are completely equal in all \naspects of life.\n  Other gender statements in the draft document clearly promote this \nposition. The conference goals would require gender sensitivity at all \nlevels of society with direct government involvement. Education must \nhave ``gender awareness'' Employers must have gender instruction. All \ngovernments must develop gender sensitive programs to quote ``end \nsocial subordination of women and girls''.\n  Furthermore, the eighty-one calls in the document for ``gender \nequality'' would make 50-50 male-female quotas a requirement for \nemployment and to receive funding. President Clinton's commitment to \nmake the final product of the conference a reality make this far more \nthan a theoretical discussion of policy aims. The ultimate effect of \nimplementing the document will be government dictating radical cultural \nchanges to the American people.\n  Senator Hutchison's amendment would ensure that gender be limited to \nonly male and female.\n  I am also deeply concerned that the document neglects to acknowledge \nfreedom of conscience or of religion. Instead, references to religion \nare cited as a source of repression for women. The one mention of \nwomen's spiritual needs has been bracketed--meaning subject to deletion \nin Beijing. The document does not call for religious freedom for women \nas you might expect. In fact, the entire process of preparing for \nBeijing seems determined to deny this fundamental right.\n  A number of courageous delegates from other countries were distressed \nthat their attempts to add and change language to reflect their views \nwere met with contempt. These women have expressed deep reservations \nabout proposals for social change would be contrary to the religious \nviews of the citizens of the nations they represented.\n  Mr. President, earlier Senator Dole introduced an amendment which \nwould cut international conference funds to participate in the Beijing \nconference unless Harry Wu were released. I applaud his amendment. It \nreminds us that there are larger issues which are at stake. Basic human \nrights are being denied to U.S. citizen Harry Wu, as they are denied to \nthousands of Chinese.\n  I frankly find the selection of Beijing as host of this conference \nthe ultimate act of hypocrisy. While delegations from hundreds of \ncountries discuss issues of concern to women, Chinese officials \nbrutally and cruelly force women to have abortions and be sterilized to \nenforce a one child per family policy. Our message to Chinese women \nshould be that Americans find such acts abhorrent. Rather, our official \nparticipation at Beijing signals them that we are not concerned about \nthese violent acts.\n  Diane Knippers, of the Project on Religion and Democracy, stated:\n\n       One of the more serious omissions in the draft Platform is \n     any acknowledgement of freedom of conscience or religion of \n     women. Throughout the document, religion is cited as a source \n     of repression of women. . . . But nowhere in the 121 pages \n     does the document call for the religious freedom for women. . \n     . . We believe that women should have the right to engage in \n     religious practice, to change their religion and to propagate \n     their religious faith, particularly to their children. \n\n[[Page S 10966]]\n     . . . It is outrageous that this conference on women's rights is being \n     held in a country which currently imprisons women for \n     practicing their faith and forces many to have abortions.\n\n  I strongly support Senator Hutchison's amendment. It is essential for \nthe rest of the world to know that Americans continue to value women in \ntheir roles of mothers, and that we believe that the traditional family \nis an important element to maintain a strong and healthy culture.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. Has the Senator from Texas finished?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I had about 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Texas had the floor, so I will yield the \nfloor and then I will ask for the floor on the completion of her \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will just finish. I think the \nSenator from Indiana said very well exactly what this amendment would \ndo. It expresses a sense of the Senate that our delegates from America \nshould represent our American values, and the importance that we place \non the family and on the role of motherhood. I think it is very \nimportant that we recognize that we have new experiences available, new \nopportunities for women that have come along in the last few years. But \nthese continuing changes in our society have never diminished the \nunique and important value of maternal care-giving. And our amendment \njust says very clearly that, if we have delegates to this conference, \nthey should express these views.\n  I hope our colleagues will agree to this amendment. It is a sense of \nthe Senate. I think it is very simple and straightforward. It really is \nthe motherhood amendment, and I hope no one would choose to vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Evidence relating to \ncharacter evidence in sexual misconduct cases, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      rule of evidence legislation\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that I do not \nmuch like. It involves the so-called Dole-Molinari rules of evidence \nwhich the Congress included last year in the 1994 crime law. This \nprovision made a radical change in the Federal Rules of Evidence. It \ntook the unprecedented--and in my mind absolutely unwise and \nunwarranted--step of allowing unproven allegations of prior \ncrimes to be used against a defendant at trial.\n  These new rules--which apply in sexual assault and child molestation \ncases--were added to the crime law over my strenuous objections. My \nobjections were twofold, one substantive and one procedural. I will \ndetail what I believe are the serious substantive problems with the new \nrules in a moment. First, I must point out that the way these rules \nwere adopted by the Congress contravenes--indeed flaunts--the \nprocedures we have used, with certain modifications, since 1948 for \nmaking alterations in the Federal rules.\n  I am talking about the Rules Enabling Act. That act allows for a \nthoughtful, inclusive process for considering any changes to the \nFederal Rules of Evidence--rules which have been on the books for many, \nmany years and which have been relied upon by judges and litigants in \ncountless cases. The Enabling Act process gives the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, the organization of America's Federal judges, \nand, ultimately, the Supreme Court a first cut at any proposed changes. \nThe conference, through its various committees, solicits the views of \njudges, lawyers, and academics who have studied the rules, worked with \nthe rules, and identified any problems with them. The process ensures \nthat the public is given the chance to comment about proposed changes, \nand guarantees that these comments be considered by the rule-makers. \n\n[[Page S 10967]]\n\n  It is at that point--after the careful, detailed and encompassing \nreview and drafting efforts of the conference--that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt makes recommendations to the Congress for our acceptance or \nmodification. This mechanism is designed to head off unwarranted \nchanges and avoid unintended consequences. And it ensures that \ndecisions about changes in the rules are made in a deliberative, cool-\nheaded way, rather than in the heat of a political moment. Passing as \nwe did the Dole-Molinari rules last year--in a whirlwind rush to bring \ncrime bill negotiations to a close--we thumbed our noses at this most \nimportant and worthy process.\n  I did succeed in structuring the rule change in the crime law to \nensure that we would have the benefit of the Judiciary's view, albeit \nafter the fact. The provision was drafted to delay the implementation \nof the rules to allow the Judicial Conference to weigh in on the issue. \nThis is how it works: The Dole-Molinari rules will go into effect \nunless we in the Congress repeal them outright or adopt the Judicial \nConference recommendations.\n  I, for one, would prefer a complete repeal. And, I may point out, the \nJudicial Conference agrees with me. The Judicial Conference itself \nunanimously voted to oppose the new rules. They have called on us to \nreconsider our actions and change our minds. They, too, favor a repeal. \nBut they are also pragmatic. So they have sent over a proposal--a most \nmodest of proposals, in my view--to make the rules clearer, cleaner, \nand a little bit fairer. I am pragmatic as well, and I know that I \nstand no chance of having the rules repealed, so I am introducing the \nJudicial Conference recommendations today.\n  But before we discuss these modest recommendations, I would like to \ntake a minute to talk about the Dole-Molinari rules, and why I believe \nthey are such a bad idea. Here is the way these rules will work. A \ndefendant is on trial for sexual assault. He claims he did not do it. \nHe says that the complaining witness has fingered the wrong man. Under \nthe Dole-Molinari rules, the prosecutor in this case will be able to go \nout and rummage around for any witness who will testify that, some long \nand blurry time ago, the defendant was sexually aggressive toward her.\n  It will not matter that this alleged prior event happened some 20 \nyears ago. It won't matter that the woman never reported the incident \nto the police. It will not matter that the defendant was never charged \nor convicted of the crime. It won't matter that the evidence is highly \nunreliable.\n  No, none of that will matter. The only thing that will matter to the \njury, when it hears this sort of evidence, is that this guy is bad \nnews. And the jury will be able to make the following leap of logic: \n``Well, since he did it once, he probably did it again.'' Jurors will \nalso be able to say to themselves something like this: ``I'm not so \nsure he committed this particular crime that he's now charged with. But \nhe's a bad guy--he hurt that other women, so it's OK for me to convict \nhim today--he has it coming.''\n  But wait a minute. It is a cardinal tenet of Anglo-Saxon criminal \njurisprudence that the prosecution must prove that the accused \ncommitted the specific crime for which he now stands accused--not some \nother bad act and not merely that he\n is a lousy or wicked person. Or put another way: an accused must be \ntried for what he did--not for who he is.\n\n  Over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court in the case of Boyd versus \nUnited States, underscored the importance of the rule against character \nor propensity evidence. In that robbery case, the court said that \nevidence of earlier robberies--\n\n       Only tended to prejudice the defendants with the jurors--to \n     draw their minds away from the real issue, and to produce the \n     impression that they were wretches whose lives were of no \n     value to the community.\n\n  Let us be honest about this. The whole point of these new rules is to \nincrease the number of convictions in sexual assault and child abuse \ncases. And I believe, without a doubt, that they will do just that. But \nat the risk of stating what should be obvious: More convictions are not \nnecessarily a good thing. What we want is more convictions of the \nguilty. If any of those who are convicted under the new rules are \nactually innocent--and I believe that this is precisely the danger at \nhand--there is cause only for horror, not celebration.\n  As Professor Wigmore--one of the preeminent evidence gurus of all \ntime--has said about this sort of evidence: It is the natural tendency \nof the jury to give the evidence excessive weight--and either to allow \nit to bear too strongly on the present charge, or to see it as \njustifying a condemnation, irrespective of the accused's guilt of the \npresent charge. This type of evidence has less to do--in my view--with \nthe search for the truth, than with a blind desire for vengeance.\n  Now remember, I'm the guy who authored the Violence Against Women \nAct. It has been my crusade for the past 4 years to have violence \nagainst women taken seriously. I have increased the penalties for rape. \nI have talked to anyone who will listen about the epidemic of violence \nagainst women, and about our obligation--our urgent obligation--to put \na stop to it now. I devoted an entire Judiciary Committee report to how \nthe criminal justice system is not aggressive enough in its pursuit of \nrapists and other criminals who make women their targets. I, too, want \nto see more rapists and child abusers put behind bars. But not at the \nprice of fairness. And not at the expense of what we know in our hearts \nto be right and just.\n  And let me clear up one more matter. Evidence of prior uncharged \ncrimes is admitted into evidence frequently. But it is admitted for a \nlegitimate purpose--to help prove, for instance, a pattern of conduct, \npreparation, identity, plan, intent, or purpose. What we're talking \nabout here is admitting evidence for what in my view--and which for \nhundreds of years has been considered--a patently illegitimate purpose.\n  But that's where we are. And the bill I'm introducing today--the \nJudicial Conference recommendations--doesn't change that. Like the \nDole-Molinari rules, the Judicial Conference proposal makes a dramatic \naboutface from current practice--and allows for the introduction of \npropensity or character evidence in sexual assault and child \nmolestation cases.\n  But the Judicial Conference did make a few very modest changes--which \nthe conference itself describes only as correcting ambiguities and \npossible constitutional infirmities while still giving effect to \nCongress' intent. Indeed, this proposal is so modest--and is so in \nkeeping with the intent of the original rules' sponsors--that I will be \nvery interested to hear what possible substantive objections anyone \ncould have about them.\n  Here are the changes proposed by the Judicial Conference:\n  The proposal makes it clear that the rules are subject to the other \nRules of Evidence. This is totally unremarkable. As everyone knows, all \nevidence introduced under a particular rule is subject to the other \nrules--like the rule against hearsay, and the rules allowing judges to \nbalance the prejudicial impact of evidence against its probative value.\n  What is remarkable is that the Dole-Molinari rules were drafted in \nsuch a way as to seem mandatory--they could be read to require a judge \nto admit the evidence, regardless of whether its prejudice outweighs \nits probative value, and regardless of whether any other rule would be \nviolated.\n  That would be wholly unprecedented. The rewrite simply makes it clear \nthat these new rules will work just like all the others. And let me \nadd: The sponsors of the new rules have consistently maintained that \nthe rules are not meant to be mandatory rules of admission, and that \nthe general standards of the Rules of Evidence will apply. This \nproposal by the Judicial Conference simply makes clear what the \nsponsors of the rules have forthrightly said is their intention.\n  The proposal itemizes the different factors that a judge should weigh \nin deciding whether to admit the evidence. Again, this is an \nunremarkable idea. It merely gives judges, who are having to completely \nchange how they look at this evidence, some guidance.\n  It tells them: When you're deciding what to do about this evidence, \nhere are some signposts to consider--like when the uncharged act took \nplace; its similarity to the charged misconduct; the surrounding \ncircumstances; and any relevant intervening events. \n\n[[Page S 10968]]\nAgain, there is nothing in this idea--simply\n to give judges some guidance--which would rub against the grain of the \nsponsors' intentions.\n\n  The Judicial Conference proposal would also allow the defendant to \nuse similar evidence in rebuttal. The Dole-Molinari rules, as currently \ndrafted, are unbalanced: under the rules, a defendant can't, in \nrebuttal, use prior specific instances of conduct to prove that he did \nnot have a propensity to commit the charged crime.\n  Say, for example, a child testifies under the new rule that his \nfather, the defendant, sexually assaulted him 5 years ago. The father \ncan't put his other kids on the stand to say that he had not assaulted \nthem--to help show that he does not have a propensity to assault \nchildren. The Judicial Conference proposal simply gives the defendant \nthe same evidentiary rights as the prosecution.\n  The Judicial Conference proposal also makes a number of small minor \nchanges. It consolidates the new rules into one--this is simply a \nclearer, cleaner drafting approach. The proposal also streamlines the \ndefinitions--without making any substantive changes--and makes the \nnotice provisions a bit more flexible, and more in keeping with other \nnotice and discovery provisions elsewhere in the rules.\n  As is by now clear, this is a very unassuming proposal. It allows for \nthe introduction of propensity evidence. It doesn't require that the \nprior bad act have resulted in a conviction, or even that it have been \nthe subject of a complaint or charge. It doesn't even require that the \nevidence of the prior uncharged act be particularly reliable.\n  In fact, had this rule been proposed last year, I would have opposed \nit. I would have opposed it because I believe that propensity or \ncharacter evidence should not be admitted into trial. Period. But I can \ncount. And I know that I'm nearly alone on this one. That is why I am \nintroducing this bill--the Judicial Conference recommendations--which \nonly make a handful of modest, but important changes to make the bill \nclearer and a little bit fairer. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1094\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \npermanently the exclusion for educational assistance provided by \nemployers to employees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE EMPLOYEE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today, on my own behalf and on \nbehalf of Senators Roth, Murray, Baucus, D'Amato, Grassley, Breaux, \nHatch, and Pryor, to introduce legislation that will reinstate and make \npermanent the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. This bill \nensures that employees will be able to continue to receive up to $5,250 \nannually in tuition reimbursements or similar educational benefits from \ntheir employers on a tax-free basis.\n  First enacted in 1978, section 127 has enabled over 7 million working \nmen and women to advance their education and improve their job skills, \nwithout incurring additional income tax liabilities and a reduction in \ntake-home pay. Without this provision, an employee would owe taxes on \nthe value of any educational benefits provided by an employer that do \nnot directly relate to his or her current job. For example, a clerical \nworker pursuing a college diploma who earns $21,000 annually, and who \nreceives tuition reimbursement for two semesters of night courses--\nworth approximately $4,000--would owe additional Federal income and \npayroll taxes of $1,200 on this educational assistance. The effects are \neven more severe if he or she lives in a State that uses the Federal \ndefinition of income for State tax purposes.\n  It is shortsighted to impose such a tax burden on employees seeking \nto further their education. For many low- and moderate-income \nemployees, this cut in take-home pay is simply prohibitive, preventing \nthem from enrolling in courses that would upgrade their job skills and \nimprove their future career prospects. Without this investment in our \nemployees' education, the ability of our work force to compete in the \nglobal economy erodes. By removing the requirement that educational \nassistance be job related in order to be tax-free, section 127 \neliminates a tax burden on workers seeking to further their education \nand improve their career prospects.\n  Moreover, section 127 removes a tax bias against lesser-skilled \nworkers. The tax bias arises because lesser-skilled workers have \ngreater difficulty proving educational expenses are directly related to \ntheir current jobs due to their narrower job descriptions. Therefore, \nabsent section 127, such lesser-skilled workers are more likely to owe \ntaxes on employer-provided educational benefits than are higher-\nskilled, more senior workers.\n  Congress has never quite found sufficient revenue to enact section \n127 on a permanent basis, opting instead for temporary exclusions. \nSince 1978, there have been 7 extensions of this provision. Most \nrecently, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 provided for an \nextension of section 127 through December 31, 1994. The exclusion has \nonce again expired.\n  I hope that Congress will recognize the importance of this provision, \nand \n\n[[Page S 10969]]\nenact it permanently. Temporary extensions create great practical \ndifficulties for the intended beneficiaries. Employees cannot plan \nsensibly for their educational goals, not knowing the extent to which \naccepting educational assistance may reduce their take-home pay. As for \nemployers, the fits and starts of the legislative history of section \n127 have been a serious administrative nuisance. If section 127 is in \nforce, then there is no need to withhold taxes on educational benefits \nprovided; if not, the job-relatedness of the educational assistance \nmust be ascertained, a value assigned, and withholding adjusted \naccordingly. Uncertainty about the program's continuance magnifies this \nburden, and discourages employers from providing educational benefits. \nThe legislation that I introduce today would restore certainty to \nsection 127 by extending it retroactively, to the beginning of this \nyear, and then maintaining it on a permanent basis.\n  Mr. President, my previous efforts to extend this provision have \nenjoyed wide, bipartisan support. Encouraging workers to further their \neducation and to improve their job skills is an important national \npriority, crucial for preserving our competitive position in the global \neconomy. Permitting employees to receive educational assistance on a \ntax-free basis, without incurring significant cuts in take-home pay, is \na demonstrated, cost-effective means for achieving these objectives.\n  Employee educational assistance is not an extravagant, free benefit \nfor highly paid executives. It largely benefits low- and moderate-\nincome employees seeking access to higher education and further job \ntraining. A survey undertaken by Coopers & Lybrand indicated that over \n70 percent of recipients of section 127 benefits in 1986 earned less \nthan $30,000. In fact, lower-income employees are more likely to \nparticipate in educational assistance programs than those at the higher \nend of the income scale. Employees making less than $30,000 participate \nat a much higher rate than those making above that income, and \nparticipation rates decline as salary levels increase. Moreover, \nemployees making less than $15,000 participate at almost twice the rate \nof those who earn over $50,000.\n  Further, section 127 makes an important contribution to simplicity in \nthe Tax Code. Without it, employers and the IRS would be required to \ndetermine, on a case-by-case basis, which employer-provided educational \nbenefits are sufficiently related to the job to avoid treatment as \ntaxable income.\n  Today, American workers are the most productive in the industrialized \nand developing world. Yet pressures from international competition and \nthe pace of technological changes require continual adjustment by our \nwork force. Retraining will thus be necessary to maintain and \nstrengthen American industry's competitive position in the global \neconomy. Section 127 permits employees to adapt and retrain without \nincurring additional tax\n liabilities and a reduction in take-home pay. By removing the tax \nburden from workers seeking retraining, section 127 enables employees \ndisplaced by foreign competition or technological change to learn new \njob skills.\n\n  Finally, section 127 has also helped to improve the quality of \nAmerica's public education system, at a fraction of the cost of direct-\naid programs. It has enabled thousands of public schoolteachers to \nobtain advanced degrees, augmenting the quality of instruction in our \nschools. A survey by the National Education Association a few years ago \nfound that almost half of all American public school systems provide \ntuition assistance to teachers seeking advanced training and degrees. \nThe Tax Code should not impose obstacles to this kind of shared effort \ntoward improvement. This legislation, by making section 127 permanent, \nwill ensure that it does not.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1095\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE \n                   EXCLUSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to exclusion for educational assistance \n     programs) is amended by striking subsection (d) and by \n     redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (d).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1994.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we've all heard the axiom that the \ncultivation of the mind is the secret to a happy and productive life. \nEducation not only provides untold benefits to the individual, but to \nsociety as a whole. In fact, the worth of education is increasing.\n  In 1980, a male college graduate made about 30 percent more than a \nmale high school graduate. By 1988, he made about 60 percent more. In \njust 8 years, the premium for a college degree doubled--in comparison \nwith a high school diploma.\n  On a social level, education is fundamental to the future well-being \nand competitiveness of America. Not only are well-educated men and \nwomen able to make greater contributions to our economy, but they make \nunquantifiable contributions to business, academia, and \nagriculture, as well as to our technical and communications resources.\n  The irony, Mr. President, is that while the value of higher education \nis increasing, the confidence of Americans to receive a higher \neducation is declining. Polls shows that our countrymen are less and \nless optimistic about their ability to receive higher education. A full \n55 percent think paying for college is more difficult now that it was \n10 years ago, and 66 percent say it will be even more difficult 10 \nyears now. Sixty percent believe even qualified people can't afford \ncollege.\n  The solution? Eighty percent of those polled say the best solution is \nto have financial support provided through work opportunities. This \ncompares to 43 percent who call for more direct grants to students and \neven 62 percent for those who want more money for student loans.\n  The legislation I am cosponsoring today with Senator Moynihan, is a \nwelcomed and needed measure to encourage and assist employers to \nprovide educational opportunities for their employees. What we seek to \ndo with this legislation is permanently extend the exclusion for \nemployer provided educational assistance. The exclusion, section 127, \nexpired on December 31, 1994--7 months ago--and unless it is extended, \nemployees will be taxed on their education benefits. They will owe both \nFederal and FICA taxes on the assistance they have received.\n  Mr. President, section 127 is legislation that has been approved \nbefore. We know that it is needed--that it is important. Congress has \npassed it in an effort to increase the participation of employers in \nassisting in the education of their employees. Under previous \ncongressional action, tax-free benefits were made available for \nemployees who wanted to improve their knowledge and skill in job-\nrelated studies. Beyond this, the law also allowed employees to \nparticipate in other studies. The only exclusions involved education in \nsports, games and hobbies, unless those studies were directly \nassociated with their employment needs or were part of an overall \ndegree program.\n  Congress has already established the need for section 127 and \nprovided the legislation. What Senator Moynihan and I are doing now is \nsimply making it permanent. Our bill will allow employees to \npermanently receive up to $5,250 annually in undergraduate tuition or \nsimilar educational benefits from their employers on a tax-free basis. \nIt will be effective retroactively, going back to January 1, 1995--thus \ntaking care of the 7 months that have lapsed since section 127 expired.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Moynihan and me in passing \nthis bill, reminding them of the importance of education as it pertains \nto the future of America. As Daniel Webster said when he stood on the \nSenate floor many years ago:\n\n       If we work marble, it will perish; if we work upon brass, \n     time will efface it; if we rear temples, they will crumble \n     into dust; but if we work upon immortal minds . . . we are \n     then engraving upon tablets which no time will efface, but \n     will brighten and brighten to all eternity.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1096. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that members of Hamas (commonly \n\n[[Page S 10970]]\nknown as the Islamic Resistance Movement) be considered to be engaged \nin a terrorist activity and ineligible to receive visas and excluded \nfrom admission into the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                    the hamas exclusion act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Hamas Exclusion \nAct of 1995. This bill was introduced in 1993, in conjunction with \nRepresentative Peter Deutsch in the House. I am introducing it again \nthis year because of Hamas' continued role in disruption of the peace \nprocess as well as the recent detention of Mousa Mohamed Abu Marzook at \nJFK Airport in New York.\n  Hamas continues to use terrorism as a tool to disrupt the peace \nprocess. In doing so, it continues to kill innocent Israelis without \nconcern for life. Between April 1994 and July 1995, Hamas has conducted \nat least 8 suicide bombings against Israeli targets, killing at least \n52 people. This is murder plain and simple.\n  When U.S. immigration officials detained Marzook at JFK last week, \nthey detained a man who held a place on the U.S. terrorism watchlist \nand according to the INS, is an ``excludable alien based on his \nparticipation in terrorist activities.''\n  I applaud President Clinton's recent actions against terrorism, \nespecially his Executive orders against terrorist fundraising in the \nUnited States and the total embargo on trade with Iran for which I \npushed. This latest action signals that the United States can no longer \nact as a haven for those who belong to terrorist organizations whose \nonly wish is to kill and maim.\n  My bill is simple. It states that an alien who is an officer, \nofficial, representative, or spokesman of Hamas, is considered to be \nengaged in terrorist activity and therefore eligible to be excludable \nunder the immigration statutes.\n  There can be no toleration of the actions of Hamas and groups like \nit, nor can we allow these groups to operate in the United States. \nWhile this bill is not the panacea, it will act to keep one group out. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in sending this strong message by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Section 212(a)(3)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)) is amended by adding at the \n     end ``An alien who is an officer, official, representative, \n     or spokesman of Hamas (commonly known as the Islamic \n     Resistance Movement) is considered, for purposes of this Act, \n     to be engaged in a terrorist activity.''.\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Packwood):\n  S. 1097. A bill to designate the Federal building located at 1550 \nDewey Avenue, Baker City, OR, as the ``David J. Wheeler Federal \nBuilding,'' and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n           the david j. wheeler federal building act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my honor to propose the \ndesignation of the Federal building in Baker City, OR, as the David J. \nWheeler Federal Building.\n  Mr. David J. Wheeler was an outstanding citizen until his life came \nto a tragic end on April 26, 1995. Mr. Wheeler, a U.S. Forest Service \nengineer working the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, was brutally \nmurdered by two juveniles while on assignment in the Payette National \nForest in Idaho. Mr. Wheeler's death has had a tremendous impact on the \nentire community in Baker City because he was an active civic leader \ninvolved in and committed to his hometown.\n  A true altruist, Mr. Wheeler was a member of the Baker City Rotary \nClub and was the president-elect at the time of his death. Mr. Wheeler \nvolunteered as a coach at the local YMCA. In 1994 the Baker County \nChamber of Commerce selected Mr. Wheeler as the Baker County Father of \nthe Year. These honors are a clear illustration of the model citizen \nMr. Wheeler was in his community.\n  The Federal building in Baker City is currently unnamed and houses \nthe U.S. Post Office, Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Forest \nService. To designate this building as the David J. Wheeler Federal \nBuilding is a tribute to an extraordinary American and will commemorate \nthe contributions Mr. Wheeler selflessly provided to his community.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, on April 26 of this year, the life of my \nfellow Oregonian, David Jack Wheeler, was snuffed out. He was murdered \nwhile working in the Wallowa-Whitman forest that he loved. David was an \nemployee of the U.S. Forest Service, and he was an exemplary citizen of \nBaker City, OR. David was well-regarded in the community of Baker City \nbecause he was one of those individuals who didn't stop at just holding \ndown a job and caring for a family. He gave back to his community. \nDavid worked to provide access for everyone to recreational and \nadministrative facilities within the forest. He was a mentor and \ncounselor to his coworkers. Because of this his community, friends, \nfamily, and employer would like to honor him by designating the Federal \nbuilding located in Baker City as the David J. Wheeler Federal \nBuilding. I agree with these good people in this effort and so have \nsponsored a bill to make this happen. Folks in Baker City are right to \nhonor David in this way. He gave so much to his community and this is a \nsmall thing to ask in return.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Dole):\n  S. 1098. A bill to establish the Midway Islands as a National \nMemorial, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n               THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY NATIONAL MEMORIAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in less than a month, ceremonies in Hawaii \nwill commemorate the United States victory over Japan and the end of \nWorld War II. The American people were devastated by the December 7, \n1941, Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor--undoubtedly, one of the \nmost disastrous defeats in United States history. Victory at the Battle \nof Midway was a key element to the recovery of the United States Armed \nForces and the ultimate victory on Japan.\n  Historians rank Midway as one of the most decisive naval battles of \nall time. It is only fitting, in my judgment, that American heroes of \nthe Battle of Midway be given due recognition, and that is why the \nBattle of Midway National Memorial Act is so important.\n  Mr. President, if approved, this bill will: First, establish the \nMidway Islands as a National War Memorial; second, protect the historic \nstructures associated with the Battle of Midway; and three, protect the \nsurrounding environs, without cost to the taxpayers. The bill provides \nthat the memorial be funded from revenues earned from private sector \nentities currently operating at the airstrip and the port facilities on \nMidway.\n  Historic victories such as Midway, Gettysburg, Yorktown, and Normandy \nare remembered by memorializing the hallowed ground upon which American \nblood was shed. The Midway Islands, and the surrounding seas where so \nmany American lives were sacrificed, deserve to be memorialized as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, during the month of June 1942, a badly outnumbered \nAmerican naval force, consisting of 29 ships and other units of the \nArmed Forces, under the overall command of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, \noutmaneuvered and out-fought 350 ships of the combined Japanese \nImperial Fleet. The objectives of the Japanese high command were to \noccupy the Midway Islands and destroy the United States Pacific Fleet, \nbut the forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz completely thwarted \nJapanese strategy. Victory at Midway was the turning point in the \nPacific Theater.\n  The outcome of the conflict, Mr. President, was remarkable given the \nfact that U.S. Forces were so badly outnumbered. The United States lost \n163 aircraft compared to 286 Japanese aircraft lost. One American \naircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Yorktown, and one destroyer, the U.S.S. \nHumman were destroyed. On the other hand, the Japanese Imperial Navy \nlost five ships, four of the ships being the Imperial Navy's main \naircraft carriers. Almost as devastating was the loss of most of the \nexperienced Japanese pilots. At the end \n\n[[Page S 10971]]\n\nof the day, 307 Americans had lost their lives. The Japanese navy lost \n2,500 men.\n  So severe was the damage inflicted on the Imperial Japanese Navy by \nAmerican airmen and sailors, that Japan never again was able to take \nthe offensive against the United States or Allied forces.\n  Mr. President, victory over the Japanese was achieved, of course, by \nmen and women from all the United States Armed Forces. Certainly at \nMidway, elements of each services--Navy, Marines, and U.S. Army Air \nCorps--were heavily engaged, closely coordinated, and paid a high price \nfor their bravery. The Midway Islands should be memorialized to honor \nthe courageous efforts of all the services when they were called upon \nto defend our Nation and its interests.\n  The heroism of many of American servicemen at Midway often required \nthe ultimate sacrifice. Many of the Marine pilots, flying worn out and \ninferior planes, did not live to celebrate the victory at Midway. All \nbut five torpedo-plane pilots who attacked the Japanese aircraft \ncarrier task force--without protective air cover--were shot down. These \npilots undoubtedly knew they were flying to an all but certain death.\n  But the sacrifice of these brave Americans was not in vain, Mr. \nPresident. When the battle ended, four Japanese aircraft carriers were \nsent to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, and their highly experienced \npilots were lost. Japanese naval aviation never recovered from this \ncrippling blow, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n  Mr. President, the sacrifice and heroism of these men should never be \nforgotten--it is vital that our sons and daughters never forget what \ntheir fathers and grandfathers sacrificed for freedom. The Battle of \nMidway should be memorialized for all time, on the Midway Islands, on \nbehalf of a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from four \ngallant Americans, each of whom was a hero of the Battle of Midway--Lt. \nCom. Richard H. Best, Capt. Robert M. Elder, Cap. Jack H. Reid, and \nMaj. J. Douglas Rollow--regarding the Midway Islands National Memorial \nAct, be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to these fine Americans for their \nservice at the Battle of Midway and for their diligence in putting \ntogether this bill. I certainly commend other distinguished Americans \nfor their contributions to this effort, including Dr. James D'Angelo, \nAdm. Tom Moorer, Adm. Whitey Feightner, Capt. Gordon Murray, Vice Adm. \nJames Flatley III, Vice Adm. William Houser, William Rollow, and \nAnthony Harrigan.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                              International Midway\n\n\n                                    Memorial Foundation, Inc.,\n\n                                      Rockville, MD, May 30, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Please take a few minutes to read this \n     letter to you from us, some of the survivors of the Battle of \n     Midway. We seek nothing for ourselves--only for our Country.\n       Few battles in World War II were as pivotal as the Battle \n     of Midway in 1942. Although the Battle of Britain and \n     Stalingrad turned the course of the war in Europe, the Battle \n     of Midway not only turned the course of the war in the \n     Pacific, but most likely of the entire war. There the \n     Imperial Japanese Fleet was defeated by a handful of U.S. \n     Naval, Marine and Army aviators flying obsolescent aircraft. \n     Lives were heroically lost. Had we not prevailed at Midway, \n     Hawaii would have been lost, and the Pacific war fought on \n     our West Coast.\n       Those of us who served in World War II have taken for \n     granted that the generations who succeeded us would know of \n     the enormous cost in lives paid to preserve freedom. We \n     naively assumed that future generations would cherish and \n     protect the values for which so many of our comrades died.\n       While other nations in the free world made the remembrance \n     of World War II and the values it represented an imperative \n     for their children, sad to say, our nation has not. \n     Complacency replaced patriotism; revisionists replaced \n     historians. Some would even have our children believe that \n     the United States was the aggressor--insensitive to human \n     life--particularly with regard to the end of the war in the \n     Pacific.\n       We know the truth--we lived it; but our children do not. \n     The International Midway Memorial Foundation believes that \n     one of the best ways to preserve the teachings of World War \n     II is to create World War II National Historic Battlefields. \n     There our children, historians and others interested in that \n     epic war for freedom can learn first hand, on site.\n       We now face the second battle of Midway. In September 1993, \n     after over 90 years of stewardship, the United States Navy \n     closed Midway as an operational base. The United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has requested that Midway be \n     turned over to itself primarily for use as a wildlife refuge.\n       The Foundation opposes the transfer of Midway to USFWS. \n     Instead, we wish it declared a National Historic Battlefield, \n     and administered by the U.S. National Park Service, in \n     accordance with sound multiple use principles. Interested \n     visitors can then not only see a beautiful island and its \n     wildlife, but also learn of the historic battle fought there.\n       The Foundation will raise funds to help provide exhibits \n     and materials to teach those visitors about the battle. \n     Furthermore, visitors to Midway will generate funds, which in \n     turn, will reduce if not eliminate the cost to our taxpayers \n     of maintaining Midway.\n       In closing, we believe our dead at Midway deserve something \n     better than a monument in a wildlife refuge. The few \n     threatened species utilizing the Midway Atoll (primarily the \n     Hawaiian Monk Seal and the Green Sea Turtle) can be amply \n     protected under the multiple-use program we espouse.\n       Please help us. Please support legislation to create Midway \n     as a National Historic Battlefield. Let us not lose the \n     second battle of Midway.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     LCDR Richard H.

Definition.--For purposes of this chapter, the \n     term `United States population assistance' means assistance \n     provided under section 104(b) of this Act.\n       ``Sec. 499A. Congressional Findings.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings:\n       ``(1) Throughout much of the developing world, the \n     inability of women and couples to exercise choice over \n     childbearing undermines the role of women in economic \n     development, contributes to death and suffering among women \n     and their children, puts pressure on the environment and the \n     natural resources on which many poor families depend for \n     their survival, and in other ways vitiates the efforts of \n     families to lift themselves out of the poverty in which more \n     than one billion of the world's 5.7 billion people live.\n       ``(2) Through 2015, the world's population will continue to \n     grow, with annual population increments predicted to be above \n     86 million. This will lead to a tripling of the world's \n     population before stabilization can occur.\n       ``(3) As the population within individual countries grows, \n     cities grow rapidly, movement in and between countries \n     increases, and regional distributions of population become \n     unbalanced.\n       ``(4) After more than a quarter century of experience and \n     research, a global consensus is emerging on the need for \n     increased international cooperation in regard to population \n     in the context of sustainable development.\n       ``(5) To act effectively on this consensus, the ability to \n     exercise reproductive choice should be expanded through \n     broader dissemination of fertility regulation services that \n     involve women, couples, and the community and which meet \n     individual, family, and community needs and values.\n       ``(6) In addition to the personal toll on families, the \n     impact of human population \n\n[[Page S 10974]]\n     growth and widespread poverty is evident in mounting signs of stress on \n     the world's environment, particularly in tropical \n     deforestation, erosion of arable land and watersheds, \n     extinction of plant and animal species, global climate \n     change, waste management, and air and water pollution.\n       ``Sec. 499B. Declaration of Policy. (a) In General.--\n     Congress declares that to reduce population growth and \n     stabilize world population at the lowest level feasible and \n     thereby improve the health and well-being of the world's \n     families, to ensure the role of women in the development \n     process, and to protect the global environment, an important \n     objective of the foreign policy of the United States shall be \n     to assist the international community to achieve universal \n     availability of quality fertility regulation services through \n     a wide choice of safe and effective means of family planning, \n     including programs of public education and other health and \n     development efforts in support of smaller families.\n       ``(b) Financial Targets.--The Congress endorses a target \n     for global expenditures in developing countries of at least \n     $17,000,000,000 by the year 2000 for population programs \n     described in section 499C, and establishes a goal for United \n     States population assistance by the year 2000 of \n     $1,850,000,000 in constant 1993 dollars.\n       ``Sec. 499C.

OVERSIGHT OF MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) multilateral development banks have an important role \n     to play in global population efforts;\n       (2) although the increased commitment by multilateral \n     development banks to population-related activities is \n     encouraging, together the banks provided less than \n     $200,000,000 in 1994 in assistance for core population \n     programs, and their overall lending for population, health, \n     and nutrition decreased by more than one-half between 1993 \n     and 1994; and\n       (3) the banks themselves have recognized a need to improve \n     oversight of programs, strengthen the technical skills of \n     their personnel, and improve their capacity to work with \n     borrowers, other donors, and nongovernmental organizations in \n     formulating creative population projects to meet diverse \n     borrower needs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the multilateral development banks should increase their \n     annual support for the population activities described in \n     section 499C of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added \n     by this Act, to not less than a total of $1,000,000,000 by \n     December 31, 2000.\n       (c) Report Required.--Not later than July 31 of each year, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall prepare and transmit to \n     Congress a report which includes, with respect to the \n     preceding calendar year--\n       (1) information on the resources made available by each \n     multilateral development bank for the population activities \n     described in section 499C of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961, as added by this Act;\n       (2) if such resources total less than $1,000,000,000, any \n     specific actions taken by the United States executive \n     directors to the banks to encourage increases in such \n     resources and in policy-level discussions with donor and \n     developing country governments; and\n       (3) an analysis of the progress made by the banks towards--\n       (A) meeting the objectives of the population activities \n     which are supported by the banks;\n       (B) increasing their in-country management staff;\n       (C) improving the technical skills of their personnel; and\n       (D) assuring their responsiveness to borrower needs.\n       (d) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``multilateral development banks'' means the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the African Development Bank, the \n     Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, \n     and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n     SEC. 705. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TO \n                   STABILIZE WORLD POPULATION.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) Women represent 50 percent of the world's human \n     resource potential. Therefore, improving the health, social, \n     and economic status of women and increasing their \n     productivity are essential for economic progress in all \n     countries. Improving the status of women also enhances their \n     decisionmaking capacity at all levels in all spheres of life, \n     including in the area of reproductive health.\n       (2) Throughout the world, women who participate in the \n     social, economic, and political affairs of their communities \n     are more likely to exercise their choice about childbearing \n     than women who do not participate in such activities.\n       (3) Effective economic development strategies address \n     issues such as infant and child survival rates, educational \n     opportunities for girls and women, and equality in \n     development.\n       (4) Comprehensive population stabilization efforts which \n     include both family planning services and economic \n     development activities achieve lower birth rates and \n     stimulate more development than those which pursue these \n     objectives independently.\n       (5) The most powerful, long-term influence on birthrates is \n     education, especially educational attainment among women. \n     Education is one of the most important means of empowering \n     women with the knowledge, skills and self confidence \n     necessary to participate in their communities.\n       (6) In most societies, men traditionally have exercised \n     preponderant power in nearly all spheres of life. Therefore, \n     improving communication between men and women on reproductive \n     health issues and increasing their understanding of joint \n     responsibilities are essential to ensuring that men and women \n     are equal partners in public and private life.\n       (7) In addition to enabling women to participate in the \n     development of their societies, educational attainment has a \n     strong influence on all other aspects of family welfare, \n     including child survival. However, of the world's 130 million \n     children who are not enrolled in primary school, 70 percent \n     are girls.\n       (8) In a number of countries, lower rates of school \n     enrollment among girls, the practice of prenatal sex \n     selection, and higher rates of mortality among very young \n     girls suggest that ``son preference'' is curtailing the \n     access of girl children to food, health care, and education.\n       (9) Each year, more than 13 million children under the age \n     of 5 die, most from preventable causes. Wider availability of \n     vaccines, simple treatments for diarrheal disease and \n     respiratory infections, and improved nutrition could prevent \n     many of these deaths.\n       (10) Each year, 500,000 or more women worldwide die from \n     complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, illegal \n     abortion, or inadequate or inaccessible reproductive health \n     care services, and millions more annually suffer long-term \n     illness or permanent physical impairment from such causes.\n       (11) By mid-1993, the cumulative number of AIDS cases since \n     the pandemic began was estimated at 2.5 million, and an \n     estimated 14 million people had been infected with HIV. By \n     year 2000, estimates are that 40 million people will be HIV \n     infected.\n       (12) As of mid-1993, four-fifths of all persons ever \n     infected with HIV lived in developing countries. Women are \n     the fastest growing group of new cases.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that, to \n     further the United States foreign policy objective of \n     assisting the international community in achieving universal \n     availability of quality fertility regulation services and \n     stabilizing world population, additional objectives of the \n     foreign policy of the United States shall be--\n\n[[Page S 10976]]\n\n       (1) to help achieve universal access to basic education for \n     women and men, with particular priority being given to \n     primary and technical education and job training;\n       (2) to increase understanding of the consequences of \n     population growth through effective education strategies that \n     begin in primary school and continue through all levels of \n     formal and nonformal education and which take into account \n     the rights and responsibilities of parents and the needs of \n     children and adolescents;\n       (3) to reduce the gap between male and female levels of \n     literacy and between male and female levels of primary and \n     secondary school enrollment;\n       (4) to help ensure that women worldwide have the \n     opportunity to become equal partners with men in the \n     development of their societies;\n       (5) to help eliminate all forms of discrimination against \n     girl children and the root causes of son preference, which \n     result in harmful and unethical practice such as female \n     infanticide and prenatal sex selection;\n       (6) to increase public awareness of the value of girl \n     children through public education that promotes equal \n     treatment of girls and boys in health, nutrition, education, \n     socioeconomic and political activity, and equitable \n     inheritance rights;\n       (7) to encourage and enable men to take responsibility for \n     their sexual and reproductive behavior and their social and \n     family roles;\n       (8) to help ensure that women and men have the information \n     and means needed to achieve good reproductive health and to \n     exercise their reproductive rights through responsible sexual \n     behavior and equity in gender relations;\n       (9) to reduce global maternal and infant mortality rates; \n     and\n       (10) to improve worldwide maternal and child health status \n     and quality of life.\n       (c) Authorized Activities.--United States development \n     assistance shall be available, on a priority basis, for--\n       (1) countries which either have adopted and implemented, or \n     have agreed to adopt and implement, strategies to help \n     ensure--\n       (A) before 2015, the achievement of the goal of universal \n     primary education for girls and boys in all countries and \n     access to secondary and higher levels of education, including \n     vocational education and technical training, for girls and \n     women;\n       (B) by 2005, the reduction of adult illiteracy by at least \n     one-half the country's 1990 level;\n       (C) by 2005, the elimination of the gap between male and \n     female levels of literacy and between male and female levels \n     of primary and secondary school enrollment; and\n       (D) the establishment of programs designed to meet \n     adolescent health needs, which include services and \n     information on responsible sexual behavior, family planning \n     practice, reproductive health and sexually transmitted \n     diseases, and HIV-AIDS prevention;\n       (2) governmental and nongovernmental programs which, with \n     respect to a targeted country, are intended--\n       (A) by 2005, to increase life expectancy at birth to \n     greater than 70 years of age and by 2015, to 75 years of age;\n       (B) by 2005, to reduce by one-third the country's mortality \n     rates for infants and children under 5 years of age, or to 50 \n     per 1,000 live births for infants and 70 per 1,000 for \n     children under 5 years of age, whichever is less; and by \n     2015, to reduce the country's infant mortality rate below 35 \n     per 1,000 births and the under-5 mortality rate below 45 per \n     1,000;\n       (C) by 2005, to reduce maternal mortality by one-half of \n     the 1990 level and by a further one-half by 2015;\n       (D) by 2005, to reduce significantly malnutrition among the \n     country's children under 5 years of age;\n       (E) to maintain immunizations against childhood diseases \n     for significant segments of the country's children;

HONDURAS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1981, a secret Honduran army death squad known as \n     Battalion 316 was created. During the 1980's Battalion 316 \n     engaged in a campaign of systematically kidnapping, torturing \n     and murdering suspected subversives. Victims included \n     Honduran students, teachers, labor leaders and journalists. \n     In 1993 there were 184 unsolved cases of persons who were \n     allegedly ``disappeared.'' They are presumed dead.\n       (2) At the time, Administration officials were aware of the \n     activities of Battalion 316 but failed to inform the \n     Congress. In its 1983 human rights report, the State \n     Department stated that ``There are no political prisoners in \n     Honduras.''\n       (b) Declassification of Documents.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that the President should order the expedited \n     declassification of any documents in the possession of the \n     United States Government pertaining to persons who allegedly \n     ``disappeared'' in Honduras, and promptly make such documents \n     available to Honduran authorities who are seeking to \n     determine the fate of these individuals.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 1889\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States joined the WTO as an original member \n     with the goal of creating an improved global trading system \n     and providing expanded economic opportunities for United \n     States firms and workers, while preserving United States \n     sovereignty.\n       (2) The American people must receive assurances that United \n     States sovereignty will be protected, and United States \n     interests will be advanced, within the global trading system \n     which the WTO will oversee.\n       (3) The WTO's dispute settlement rules are meant to enhance \n     the likelihood that governments will observe their WTO \n     obligations, and thus help ensure that the United States will \n     reap the full benefits of its participation in the WTO.\n       (4) United States support for the WTO depends on obtaining \n     mutual trade benefits through the openness of foreign markets \n     and the maintenance of effective United States and WTO \n     remedies against unfair or otherwise harmful trade practices.\n       (5) Congress passed the Uruguay Round Agreements Act based \n     on its understanding that effective trade remedies would not \n     be eroded. These remedies are essential to continue the \n     process of opening foreign markets to imports of goods and \n     services and to prevent harm to American industry and \n     agriculture.\n       (6) In particular, WTO dispute settlement panels and the \n     Appellate Body should--\n       (A) operate with fairness and in an impartial manner;\n       (B) not add to the obligations, or diminish the rights, of \n     WTO members under the Uruguay Round Agreements; and\n       (C) observe the terms of reference and any applicable WTO \n     standard of review.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     for the establishment of the WTO Dispute Settlement Review \n     Commission to achieve the objectives described in subsection \n     (a)(6).\n\n     SEC. ____03.

MISSILE TECHNOLOGY CONTROL REGIME.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat posed to the national security of the United \n     States by the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles \n     is significant, and is growing, both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively.\n       (2) An alarming number of countries possessing or producing \n     ballistic or cruise missiles have proven willing to help \n     others develop the same capability.\n       (3) The Missile Technology Control Regime serves as an \n     important means of stopping or slowing the spread of \n     ballistic and cruise missiles by denying non-members access \n     to missile technology.\n       (4) Sanctions, as mandated under the Arms Export Control \n     Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979, represent an \n     important means in stemming the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles capable of reaching the United States.\n       (5) The recent waiver of sanctions and the decision to \n     support countries which engage in active space programs for \n     membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime threatens \n     to eviscerate the regime.\n       (6) These recent events underscore the need to reevaluate \n     the Missile Technology Control Regime and the mechanisms at \n     the United States' disposal for preventing the spread of \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (b) In General.--The President shall seek a Senate \n     resolution of support prior to U.S. support of any State for \n     membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Missile Technology Control Regime should not \n     continue to exempt national civilian space programs from its \n     controls and sanctions.\n       (d) Report Required.--(1) Not later than December 1, 1995, \n     the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Commerce shall submit \n     unique reports to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \n     and the Senate Armed Services Committee. These reports shall \n     include the following:\n       (i) An explanation of the difference between a space-launch \n     vehicle and a ballistic missile, and an explanation of why \n     the export of space-launch vehicle components should not be \n     considered a violation of the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime.\n       (ii) An identification of the rationale guiding the U.S. \n     position on offering transfers of missile technology as \n     inducements designed to encourage countries to join the \n     Missile Technology Control Regime.\n       (iii) An assessment of whether or not the United States \n     should support or sponsor for membership in the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime any country pursuing a space-launch \n     program and the advantages of requiring countries to disband \n     their space-launch program prior to membership in the regime.\n       (iv) An assessment of the potential military implications \n     of the transfer of missile technology to members of the \n     Missile Technology Control Regime who maintain space-launch \n     vehicle programs.\n       (v) A detailed evaluation of the similarities and \n     differences in the export control system maintained by the \n     United States and those of Russia, China, Brazil, Ukraine, \n     Belarus, and Kazakhstan.\n       (vi) An assessment of the on-going efforts made by \n     potential participant countries in the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime, including those listed in this subsection, to \n     meet the guidelines established by the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime.\n       (2) In this section, the term ``Missile Technology Control \n     Regime'' means the policy statement between the United \n     States, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, \n     France, Italy, Canada, and Japan, announced on April 16, \n     1987, to restrict sensitive missile-relevant transfers based \n     on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex, and any \n     amendments thereto.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 1926\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n       At the end, add the following new division:\n DIVISION C--CONSOLIDATION AND REINVENTION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES\n\n     SEC. 1001.

as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Whereas Slovakia has held free elections, has achieved \n     associate membership in the European Union and is an active \n     participant in NATO's Partnership for Peace;\n       Whereas while the print media is free in Slovakia, the \n     state television and state news agency are in government \n     hands and have been used to advance the agenda of the ruling \n     coalition;\n       Whereas opposition parliamentarians have been removed from \n     certain Parliamentary Committee which are now comprised \n     mainly or solely of government coalition parliamentarians and \n     at least one Parliamentary oversight body, that on the Slovak \n     Intelligence Service, has no opposition representation;\n       Whereas the Slovak parliament has abandoned mass \n     privatization and has declared that the value of coupons \n     issued to Slovak citizens will now be drawn on the State \n     Property Fund rather than on shares in the companies it owns \n     opening up the possibility that the government will now be \n     able to sell state companies to single investors, an approach \n     which could favor those who are supporters of the ruling \n     coalition; and\n       Whereas the political battle between the Slovak President \n     and Prime Minister has resulted in the government taking all \n     legal means to strip the President of certain powers in an \n     apparent attempt to intimidate the President into resigning, \n     steps which do not indicate respect for a division of powers \n     and representative government; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That:\n       1. the Senate supports an independent Slovakia and commends \n     the people of Slovakia for the steps they have taken and \n     their sacrifices as Slovakia moves from devastating communist \n     rule to a democratic and free market society.\n       2. future consideration of Slovakia for accelerated NATO \n     transition assistance should be evaluated in terms of its \n     government's progress towards freedom of press, \n     representative government and privatization;\n       3. consideration of all Central European countries for \n     accelerated NATO transition assistance above and beyond that \n     given to \n\n[[Page S 10994]]\n     Partnership for Peace countries should taken into account the extent to \n     which each country makes significant progress towards meeting \n     NATO criteria as well as instituting political, economic, and \n     military reform.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 1928\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra;

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom \n     and prosperity, as well as in joining the community of \n     democratic countries that are flourishing in the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (3) to provide for the continued national security of the \n     United States in the face of continuing threats from the \n     Castro government of terrorism, theft of property from United \n     States nationals, and the political manipulation of the \n     desire of Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to \n     the United States;\n       (4) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (5) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (6) to protect American nationals against confiscatory \n     takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated \n     by the Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 2004.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this division--\n       (1) no assistance may be provided under the authority of \n     this Act to a democratically elected government in Cuba; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n     States executive director of each international financial \n     institution to vote against any loan or other utilization of \n     the funds of such bank or institution for the benefit of a \n     democratically elected government in Cuba,\n\n     unless the President determines and certifies to Congress \n     that such a government has adopted and is effectively \n     implementing a procedure under its law or through \n     international arbitration to provide for the return of, or \n     prompt, adequate and effective compensation for, property \n     confiscated by the Government of Cuba on or after January 1, \n     1959, from any person or entity that is a United States \n     national who is described in section 620(a)(2) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this title, the Secretary of State shall \n     provide a report to the appropriate congressional committees \n     containing an assessment of the property dispute question in \n     Cuba, including--\n       (1) an estimate of the number and amount of claims to \n     property confiscated by the Cuban government held by United \n     States nationals beyond those certified under section 507 of \n     the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949,\n       (2) an assessment of the significance of promptly resolving \n     confiscated property claims to the revitalization of the \n     Cuban economy,\n       (3) a review and evaluation of technical and other \n     assistance that the United States could provide to help \n     either a transition government in Cuba or a democratically \n     elected government in Cuba establish mechanisms to resolve \n     property questions,\n       (4) an assessment of the role and types of support the \n     United States could provide to help resolve claims to \n     property confiscated by the Cuban government held by United \n     States nationals who did not receive or qualify for \n     certification under section 507 of the \n\n[[Page S 11003]]\n     International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, and\n       (5) an assessment of any areas requiring legislative review \n     or action regarding the resolution of property claims in Cuba \n     prior to a change of government in Cuba.\n       (d) It is the sense of the Congress that the satisfactory \n     resolution of property claims by a Cuban government \n     recognized by the United States remains an essential \n     condition for the full resumption of economic and diplomatic \n     relations between the United States and Cuba.\n       (e) Waiver.--The President may waive the prohibitions in \n     subsections (a) and (b) if the President determines and \n     certifies to the Congress that it is in the vital national \n     interest of the United States to provide assistance to \n     contribute to the stable foundation for a democratically \n     elected government in Cuba.\n\n  TITLE III--PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OF UNITED STATES NATIONALS \n           AGAINST CONFISCATORY TAKINGS BY THE CASTRO REGIME\n\n     SEC. 2301 STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy \n     property which is enshrined in the United States \n     Constitution.\n       (2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property \n     belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban government, \n     and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the \n     expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of \n     nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic development.\n       (3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959--\n       (A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban \n     people, and\n       (B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the \n     property of--\n       (i) millions of his own citizens,\n       (ii) thousands of United States nationals, and\n       (iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the \n     United States as refugees because of persecution and later \n     became naturalized citizens of the United States.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the \n     government of Cuba respect equally the property rights of \n     Cuban and foreign nationals.\n       (5) The Cuban government is offering foreign investors the \n     opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or \n     enter into joint ventures with property and assets some of \n     which were confiscated from United States nationals.\n       (6) This ``trafficking'' in confiscated property provides \n     badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil \n     and productive investment and expertise, to the current \n     government of Cuba and thus undermines the foreign policy of \n     the United States--\n       (A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the \n     pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the \n     Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international \n     economic pressure, and\n       (B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who \n     had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban government.\n       (7) The U.S. State Department has notified other \n     governments that the transfer of properties confiscated by \n     the Cuban government to third parties ``would complicate any \n     attempt to return them to their original owners.''\n       (8) The international judicial system, as currently \n     structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful \n     confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the \n     use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and \n     private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the \n     property.\n       (9) International law recognizes that a nation has the \n     ability to provide for rules of law with respect to ``conduct \n     outside its territory that has or is intended to have \n     substantial effect within its territory.''\n       (10) The United States Government has an obligation to its \n     citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations \n     by foreign nations and their citizens, including the \n     provision of private remedies.\n       (11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated \n     property, United States nationals who were the victims of \n     these confiscations should be endowed with a judicial remedy \n     in the Courts of the United States that would deny \n     traffickers any profits from economically exploiting Castro's \n     wrongful seizures.\n\n     SEC. 2302. LIABILITY FOR TRAFFICKING IN CONFISCATED PROPERTY \n                   CLAIMED BY UNITED STATES NATIONALS.\n\n       (a) Civil Remedy.--(1) Liability of trafficking.--(A) \n     Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, that after the \n     end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this provision traffics in property which was confiscated \n     by the Government of Cuba on or after January 1, 1959, shall \n     be liable to the United States national who owns the claim to \n     such property for money damages in an amount equal to the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount which is the greater of--\n       (I) the amount, if any, certified to the claimant by the \n     Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International \n     Claims Settlement Act of 1949, plus interest;\n       (II) the amount determined under section 2303(a)(2), plus \n     interest; or\n       (III) the fair market value of that property, calculated as \n     being the then current value of the property, or the value of \n     the property when confiscated plus interest, whichever is \n     greater; and\n       (ii) reasonable court costs and attorneys' fees.\n       (B) Interest under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be at the rate \n     set forth in section 1961 of title 28, United States Code, \n     computed by the court from the date of confiscation of the \n     property involved to the date on which the action is brought \n     under this subsection.\n       (2) Presumption in favor of the certified claims.--There \n     shall be a presumption that the amount for which a person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, is liable \n     under clause (I) of paragraph (1)(A) is the amount that is \n     certified under subclause (I) of that clause. The presumption \n     shall be rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     amount described in subclause (II) or (III) of that clause is \n     the appropriate amount of liability under that clause.\n       (3) Requirement for prior notice and increased liability \n     for subsequent additional notice.--(A) Following the \n     conclusion of 180 days from enactment hereof but at least 30 \n     days prior to instituting suit hereunder, notice of intention \n     to institute a suit pursuant to this provision must be served \n     on each intended party or, in the case of ongoing intention \n     to add any party to ongoing litigation hereunder to each such \n     additional party.\n       (B) Except as provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, that traffics \n     in confiscated property after having received--\n       (i) a subsequent additional notice of a claim to ownership \n     of the property by the United States national who owns the \n     claim to the confiscated property; and\n       (ii) notice of the provisions of this section, shall be \n     liable to that United States national for money damages in an \n     amount which is the sum of the amount equal to the amount \n     determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), plus triple the amount \n     determined applicable under subclause (I), (II), or (III) of \n     paragraph (1)(A)(i).\n       (4) Applicability.--(A) Except as otherwise provided in \n     this paragraph, actions may be brought under paragraph (1) \n     with respect to property confiscated before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment of this division.\n       (B) In the case of property confiscated by the Government \n     of Cuba before the date of enactment of this division, no \n     United States national may bring an action under this section \n     unless such national acquired ownership of the claim to the \n     confiscated property before such date.\n       (C) In the case of property confiscated on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this division, no United States \n     national who acquired ownership of a claim to confiscated \n     property by assignment for value after such date of enactment \n     may bring an action on the claim under this section.\n       (5) Treatment of certain actions.--(A) In the case of any \n     action brought under this section by a United States national \n     who was eligible to file the underlying claim in the action \n     with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V \n     of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 but did \n     not so file the claim, the court may hear the case only if \n     the court determines that the United States national had good \n     cause for not filing the claim.\n       (B) In the case of any action brought under this section by \n     a United States national whose claim in the action was timely \n     filed with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under \n     title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 \n     but was denied by the Commission, the court may assess the \n     basis for the denial and may accept the findings of the \n     Commission on the claim as conclusive in the action under \n     this section unless good cause justifies another result.\n       (6) Inapplicability of act of state doctrine.--No court of \n     the United States shall decline, based upon the act of state \n     doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action \n     brought under paragraph (1).\n       (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action \n     under this section may be brought and may be settled, and a \n     judgment rendered in such action may be enforced, without the \n     necessity of obtaining any license or other permission from \n     any agency of the United States; provided, that this \n     subsection shall not apply to the execution of a judgment \n     against or the settlement of actions involving property \n     blocked under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy \n     Act, Appendix to title 50, United States Code, sections 1 \n     through 44 as amended.\n       (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any \n     certified claim against the Government of Cuba shall not be \n     deemed an interest or property the transfer of which requires \n     a license or permission of any agency of the United States.\n       (b) Amount in Controversy.--An action may be brought under \n     this section by a United States national only where the \n     matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000, \n     exclusive of costs.\n       (c) Service of Process.--(1) Service of process shall be \n     effected against an agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, or against \n     individuals acting under color of law in conformity with 28 \n     U.S.C. section 1608, except as provided by paragraph (3) of \n     this subsection.\n       (2) Service of process shall be effected against all \n     parties not included under the terms of paragraph (A) in \n     conformity with 28 U.S.C. section 1331.\n       (3) For all actions brought under section 2302 of the Cuban \n     Liberty and Democratic \n\n[[Page S 11004]]\n     Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995, no judgment by default shall be \n     entered by a court of the United States against the \n     government of Cuba, its political subdivision, or its \n     agencies or instrumentalities, unless a government recognized \n     by the United States in Cuba is given the opportunity to cure \n     and be heard thereon and the claimant establishes his claim \n     or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.\n       (d) Certain Property Immune From Execution.--Section 1611 \n     of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \n     end of the following:\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1610 of \n     this chapter, the property of a foreign state shall be immune \n     from attachment and from execution in an action brought under \n     section 1605(7) to the extent the property is a facility or \n     installation used by an accredited diplomatic mission for \n     official purposes.''.\n       (e) Election of Remedies.--\n       (1) Election.--Subject to paragraph (2)--\n       (A) any United States national that brings an action under \n     this section may not bring any other civil action or \n     proceeding under the common law, Federal law, or the law of \n     any of the other several states, the District of Columbia, or \n     any territory or possession of the United States that seeks \n     monetary or nonmonetary compensation by reason of the same \n     subject matter; and\n       (B) any person who brings, under the common law or any \n     provision of law other than this section, a civil action or \n     proceeding for monetary or nonmonetary compensation arising \n     out of a claim for which an action would otherwise be \n     cognizable under this section may not bring an action under \n     this section on that claim.\n       (2) Treatment of certified claimants.--In the case of any \n     United States national that brings an action under this \n     section based on a claim certified under title V of the \n     International Claims Settlement Act of 1949--\n       (A) if the recovery in the action is equal to or greater \n     than the amount of the certified claim, the United States \n     national may not receive payment on the claim under any \n     agreement entered into between the United States and Cuba \n     settling claims covered by such title, and such national \n     shall be deemed to have discharged the United States from any \n     further responsibility to represent the United States \n     national with respect to that claim;\n       (B) if the recovery in the action is less than the amount \n     of the certified claim, the United States national may \n     receive payment under a claims agreement described in \n     subparagraph (A) but only to the extent of the difference \n     between the amount of the recovery and the amount of the \n     certified claim; and\n       (C) if there is no recovery in the action, the United \n     States national may receive payment on the certified claim \n     under a claims agreement described in subparagraph (A) to the \n     same extent as any certified claimant who does not bring an \n     action under this section.\n       (f) Deposit of Excess Payments by Cuba Under Claims \n     Agreement.--Any amounts paid by Cuba under any agreement \n     entered into between the United States and Cuba settling \n     certified claims under title V of the International Claims \n     Settlement Act of 1949 that are in excess of the payments \n     made on such certified claims after the application of \n     subsection (e) shall be deposited into the United States \n     Treasury.\n       (g) Termination of Rights.--(1) All rights created under \n     this section to bring an action for money damages with \n     respect to property confiscated by the Government of Cuba \n     before the date of enactment of this division shall cease \n     upon transmittal to the Congress of a determination of the \n     President under section 203(c).\n       (2) The termination of rights under paragraph (1) shall not \n     affect suits commenced before the date of such termination, \n     and in all such suits, proceedings shall be had, appeals \n     taken, and judgments rendered in the same manner and with the \n     same effect as if this subsection had not been enacted.\n\n     SEC. 2303. PROOF OF OWNERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Evidence of Ownership.--(1) In any action brought under \n     this title, the courts shall accept as conclusive proof of \n     ownership a certification of a claim to ownership that has \n     been made by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     pursuant to title V of the International Claims Settlement \n     Act of 1949 (22 U.S.C. 1643 and following).\n       (2) In the case of a claim that has not been certified by \n     the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission before the enactment \n     of this division, a court may appoint a Special Master, \n     including the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to make \n     determinations regarding the amount of ownership of claims to \n     ownership of confiscated property by the Government of Cuba. \n     Such determinations are only for evidentiary purposes in \n     civil actions brought under this title and do not constitute \n     certifications pursuant to title V of the International \n     Claims Settlement Act of 1949.\n       (3) In determining ownership, courts shall not accept as \n     conclusive evidence of ownership any findings, orders, \n     judgments, or decrees from administrative agencies or courts \n     of foreign countries or international organizations that \n     invalidate the claim held by a United States national, unless \n     the invalidation was found pursuant to binding international \n     arbitration to which United States submitted the claim.\n       (b) Amendment of the International Claims Settlement Act of \n     1949.--Title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of \n     1949 (22 U.S.C. 1643 and following) is amended by adding at \n     the end of the following new section:\n\n\n``determination of ownership claims referred by district courts of the \n                             united states\n\n       ``Sec. 514.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, \n\n[[Page S 11005]]\n     as a result, no military action has occurred between two NATO member \n     states since the inception of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Central Europe would pose a security threat to \n     the United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of Central and East European \n     countries that have been freed from Communist domination and \n     that meet specific criteria for NATO membership would \n     contribute to international peace and enhance the security of \n     the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by Eastern and Central \n     European countries.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the date for membership of each country will vary.\n       (16) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO, \n     such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia and \n     should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move toward eventual \n     NATO membership, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, \n     Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia.\n       (17) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have made significant \n     progress in preparing for NATO membership and should be given \n     every consideration for inclusion in programs for NATO \n     transition assistance.\n\n     SEC. ____03. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;\n       (3) to use the voice and vote of the United States to urge \n     observer status in the North Atlantic Council for countries \n     designated under section 203(d) of the NATO Participation Act \n     of 1994 (as amended by this title) as eligible for NATO \n     transition assistance; and\n       (4) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. ____04.

These \n     accusations resulted in provoking dangerous reactions among \n     the Moslem population in Turkey against the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n       (E) Negative statements have been directed toward the \n     Patriarchate by the Mayor of the Fatih District of Istanbul.\n       (3) His All Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew and those \n     associated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate are Turkish \n     citizens and thus must be protected under Turkish law against \n     blatant and unprovoked attacks toward ethnic minorities;\n       (4) the Turkish Government arbitrarily closed the Halki \n     Patriarchal School of Theology in 1971;\n       (5) the closing of the Halki School of Theology is a \n     serious concern for the Ecumenical Patriarchate;\n       (6) Turkish law requires that the Patriarch, as well as all \n     the clergy, faculty, and students be citizens of Turkey, and \n     the Halki School of Theology is the only educational \n     institution for Orthodox Christian leadership;\n       (7) the unimpeded continued provocations against the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate and the closing of the Halki School \n     of Theology are in violation of international treaties to \n     which Turkey has been a signatory, including the Treaty of \n     Lausanne, the 1968 Protocol, the Helsinki Final Act-1975, the \n     Charter of Paris, and the United Nations Charter; \n       (8) these consequences have severely compromised and \n     threatened the safety and security of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate and the future existence of this Orthodox \n     Institution in Turkey;\n       (9) the Ecumenical Patriarchate is the spiritual center for \n     more than 250,000,000 Orthodox Christians worldwide, \n     including approximately 5,000,000 in the United States; and\n       (10) it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     prevent further incidents regarding the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate, the spiritual leader of millions of American \n     citizens, and in the overall goals of the United States to \n     establish peaceful relations with and among the many \n     important nations of the world that have substantial Orthodox \n     Christian populations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should use its influence with the \n     Turkish Government and as a permanent member of the United \n     Nations Council to suggest that the Turkish Government--\n       (A) ensure the proper protection for the Patriarchate and \n     all Orthodox faithful residing in Turkey;\n       (B) assure that positive steps are taken to reopen the \n     Halki Patriarchal School of Theology;\n       (C) provide for the proper protection and safety of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarch and the Patriarchate personnel;\n       (D) establish conditions that would prevent the reoccurance \n     of past terrorist activities and vandalism and other personal \n     threats against the Patriarch;\n       (E) establish conditions to ensure that the Patriarchate is \n     free to carry out its religious mission; and\n       (F) do everything possible to find and punish the \n     perpetrators of any provocative and terrorist acts against \n     the Patriarchate.\n       (2) The Administration should report to the Congress the \n     status and progress of the concerns in paragraph (1) on an \n     annual basis.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        SNOWE AMENDMENT NO. 1955\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 124, after line 20, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  .

and\n       (12) comprehensive plans for the demilitarization of the \n     Republic of Cyprus have been proposed.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms that the status quo on Cyprus is \n     unacceptable;\n       (2) welcomes the appointment of a Special Presidential \n     Emissary for Cyprus;\n       (3) expresses its continued strong support for efforts by \n     the United Nations Secretary General and the United States \n     Government to help resolve the Cyprus problem in a just and \n     viable manner at the earliest possible time;\n       (4) insists that all parties to the dispute regarding \n     Cyprus agree to seek a solution based upon the relevant \n     United Nations resolutions, including paragraph (2) of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 939 of July 29, 1994;\n       (5) reaffirms the position that all foreign troops should \n     be withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus;\n       (6) considers that demilitarization of the Republic of \n     Cyprus would meet the security concerns of all parties \n     involved, would enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting \n     resolution of the dispute regarding Cyprus, would benefit all \n     of the people of Cyprus, and merits international support; \n     and\n       (7) encourages the United Nations Security Council and the \n     United States Government to consider alternative approaches \n     to promote a resolution of the long-standing dispute \n     regarding Cyprus based upon relevant Security Council \n     resolutions, including incentives to encourage progress in \n     negotiations or effective measures against any recalcitrant \n     party.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  KERRY (AND PELL) AMENDMENT NO. 1957\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Pell) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the bill, S. 908, supra;

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL \n                   TREATIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1978, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 49, \n     calling on the United States Government to seek the agreement \n     of other government to a proposed global treaty requiring the \n     preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment for any major \n     project, action, or continuing activity that may be \n     reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on \n     the physical environment or environmental interests of \n     another nation or a global commons area.\n       (2) Subsequent to the adoption of Senate Resolution 49 in \n     1978, the United Nations Environment Programme Governing \n     Council adopted Goals and Principles on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment calling on governments to undertake comprehensive \n     Environmental Impact Assessments in cases in which the \n     extent, nature, or location of a proposed activity is such \n     that the activity is likely to significantly affect the \n     environment.\n       (3) Principle 17 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \n     development, adopted at the United Nations Conference on \n     Environment and Development in 1992 states that the \n     Environmental and Impact Assessments as a national instrument \n     shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely \n     to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and \n     are subject to a decision on the competent national \n     authority.\n       (4) On October 7, 1992, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the \n     Antarctic Treaty, which obligates parties to the Antarctic \n     Treaty to require Environmental Impact Assessment procedures \n     for proposed activities in Antarctica.\n       (5) The United States is a signatory to the 1991 United \n     Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on \n     Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, a \n     regional treaty that calls for the use of Environmental \n     Impact Assessments as necessary tools to minimize the adverse \n     impact of certain activities on the environment, particularly \n     in a transboundary context.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should encourage \n     governments of other nations to engage in additional regional \n     treaties, along the lines of the 1991 United Nations Economic \n     Commission for Europe's Convention on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment on a Transboundary Context, regarding specific \n     transboundary activities that have adverse impacts on the \n     environment of other nations or a global commons area; and\n       (2) such additional regional treaties should ensure that \n     specific transboundary activities are undertaken in \n     environmentally sound ways and under careful controls \n     designed to avoid or minimize any adverse environmental \n     effects, through requirements for Environmental Impact \n     Assessments where appropriate.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                PELL (AND KASSEBAUM) AMENDMENT NO. 1966\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. PELL (for himself and Mrs. Kassebaum) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Europe would pose a security threat to the \n     United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist domination and that meet specific \n     criteria for NATO membership would contribute to \n     international peace and enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of European countries into the North \n     Atlantic Alliance after such countries meet essential \n     criteria for admission would enhance the security of the \n     Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the security of the \n     United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from Communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries that meet the eligibility criteria \n     specified under section 203(d) of the NATO Participation Act \n     of 1994 (as amended by this title).\n       (17) Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, \n     Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, \n     Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine should be given every \n     consideration for inclusion in programs for NATO transition \n     assistance.\n       (18) The Partnership for Peace will continue to play an \n     important role in strengthening cooperation and \n     interoperability between partner states and NATO allies. \n     Active participation in the Partnership for Peace will help \n     prepare interested states for the rights and responsibilities \n     of NATO membership.\n\n     SEC. ____. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     Communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an evolving NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. ____. CONSTRUCTION OF TITLE.\n\n       Nothing in this title should be construed as precluding the \n     eventual NATO membership of Partnership for Peace member \n     countries that never were under Communist domination, namely \n     Austria, Finland, and Sweden, should they wish to apply for \n     such membership.\n\n     SEC. ____.

Such growth is in the economic, political, and \n     strategic interests of the United States because it permits \n     countries to progress toward economic self-reliance, improve \n     the living standards of their citizens, reduce the incidence \n     of poverty, promote food security and nutritional well-being, \n     slow population growth, and increase opportunities for \n     mutually beneficial international trade and investment. \n     Broad-based economic growth also improves the prospects for \n     the spread of democracy and political pluralism.\n       ``(B) Means.--Broad-based economic growth requires, in \n     addition to sound economic policies--\n       ``(i) a broader role for and access to markets for both \n     women and men through improved policies that protect and \n     advance economic rights for all citizens without regard to \n     gender, race, religion, language or social status, that \n     increase self-reliance in meeting basic needs, and that raise \n     real incomes for poor people;\n       ``(ii) stronger and more accountable public and private \n     institutions at the local and national level, and sound \n     public investments;\n       ``(iii) enhanced food security, including improved access \n     to safe food and adequate nutrition through sustainable \n     improvements in and expansion of local, small-scale, food-\n     based agriculture and post-harvest food preservation;\n       ``(iv) sound debt management, including debt relief as \n     appropriate;\n       ``(v) investments in people's productive capabilities, \n     including measures to upgrade technical and managerial \n     knowledge and skills;\n       ``(vi) measures to ensure that the poor, especially women, \n     have improved access to productive resources (including \n     credit for microenterprise initiatives, technical training \n     and market-related information, affordable and resource-\n     conserving technologies, and land) and that they participate \n     fully in the benefits of growth in employment and income; and\n       ``(vii) sustainable improvements to agriculture, through \n     support for agricultural research, provision of appropriate \n     technology, outreach to farmers, and improvement of \n     marketing, storage and transportation systems.\n       ``(2) Protecting the global environment.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--The economic and social well-being and \n     the security of the United States, indeed the health of \n     United States citizens and of the entire world community, \n     depend critically on the global environment and natural \n     resource base. Consumption patterns, systems of industrial \n     and agricultural production, demographic trends, and the use \n     of natural resources directly affect the sustainability of \n     long-term development and growth and the integrity of the \n     ecosystem. Development that does not take account of its \n     environmental consequences will not be economically \n     sustainable. Improved resource management is a critical \n     element of a balanced pattern of development. Both developed \n     and developing countries share responsibility to present and \n     future generations for the rational and sustainable \n     management of natural resources and for environmental \n     protection. The industrialization and consumption patterns of \n     developed countries often impose heavy environmental costs \n     worldwide. Developing countries, which are the stewards of \n     most of the world's biological diversity, not only suffer \n     disproportionately from the consequences of environmental \n     degradation, but also contribute to that degradation as they \n     struggle to meet the basic needs of their people. Therefore, \n     environmental sustainability cannot be secured without \n     reducing poverty, nor can poverty be eliminated without \n     sustainable management of the natural resource base.\n       ``(B) Means.--Protecting the global environment requires \n     addressing the root causes of environmental harm, promoting \n     environmentally-sound patterns of growth and supporting \n     improved management of natural resources. These activities \n     shall include efforts to address urgent global environmental \n     problems, including the loss of biological diversity and \n     global climate change, as well as efforts to address \n     significant environmental problems within countries and \n     regions. Such efforts shall seek to promote sound \n     environmental policies and practices and development that is \n     environmentally, socially and culturally sound over the \n     longer-term, including programs for natural resources \n     conservation, protection of threatened and endangered \n     species, preservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, \n     non-polluting methods of agricultural and industrial \n     production, preparation of environmental impact assessments, \n     improved energy efficiency, better resource management and \n     monitoring, and reduction and safe disposal of wastes.\n       ``(3) Supporting democratic participation.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--It is in the national interest of the \n     United States and in keeping with United States democratic \n     traditions to support democratic aspirations and values, \n     foster the spread of enduring democratic institutions, and \n     encourage universal respect for civil and human rights. The \n     strengthening of civil society and non-governmental \n     institutions, including business associations and labor \n     unions, that encourage broad participation and protect human \n     rights is an essential element of the ability of nations to \n     sustain development efforts.\n       ``(B) Means.--Programs to support democratic participation \n     must help to build and strengthen organizations and \n     institutions that foster inclusion in economic and political \n     decision-making at the local and national levels. Such \n     programs shall include those that promote respect for human \n     rights and the rule of law; an expanding role for \n     nongovernmental and citizens' organizations and their \n     capacity to effectively participate in political and economic \n     decision-making and to implement development programs; \n     enhanced citizen access to public information; the ability of \n     all citizens to choose freely their government and to hold \n     that government accountable for its actions; advancement of \n     legal, social, and economic equality for women, workers, and \n     minorities, including the elimination of all forms of \n     violence against women and expanded opportunities for persons \n     with disabilities; and strengthened principles of tolerance \n     among and within religious and ethnic groups.\n       ``(4) Stabilizing world population and promoting \n     reproductive health.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--Many individuals still do not have access \n     to the means to determine the number and spacing of their \n     children. Rapid population growth, among other factors, \n     aggravates poor health, perpetuates poverty, and inhibits \n     saving and investment, particularly investments in people in \n     the form of basic health and education services. Continued \n     rapid growth in world population will undercut sustainable \n     development efforts. Unsustainable population growth is \n     directly tied to degradation of the natural resource base and \n     the environment and contributes to economic stagnation and \n     political instability. The problems associated with rapid \n     population growth are interrelated with economic and social \n     inequities, particularly the low status of women, and \n     patterns of resource consumption. Rapid population growth \n     impedes development and retards progress on global issues of \n     direct concern to the United States.\n       ``(B) Means.--The primary means to stabilize population at \n     levels that are consistent with sustainable, broadly-based \n     development and with recognized standards of human rights, \n     are to provide women and men with the means to freely and \n     responsibly choose the number and spacing of their children, \n     and to contribute to improved reproductive health. This calls \n     for a focus on enhanced access to and improved quality of \n     voluntary family planning services and reproductive health \n     care. Such efforts should be complemented by programs carried \n     out in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (5) to improve \n     female education, raise the economic and social status of \n     women, and increase infant and child survival rates.\n       ``(5) Developing human resources.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--Reducing the worst manifestations of \n     poverty through the development of human resource capacity is \n     essential to long-term peace and international stability. \n     Individuals, communities, and nations cannot be fully \n     productive when impaired by disease, illiteracy, and hunger \n     resulting from the neglect of human resources. While broad-\n     based economic growth is necessary for the reduction of the \n     worst manifestations of poverty, such growth cannot be \n     sustained unless all people, and especially women, have the \n     basic assets and capabilities that foster the opportunity for \n     participation in the economic, social and political life of \n     their country.\n       ``(B) Means.--To reduce the worst manifestations of \n     poverty, sustainable development programs must develop human \n     resources by securing universal access to adequate food, safe \n     drinking water, basic sanitation, and basic shelter; \n     expanding education to all segments of society, with emphasis \n     on basic education and particular attention to equalizing \n     male and female literacy and schooling; providing equal \n     access to credit; improving the coverage, quality and \n     sustainability of basic health services; preventing the \n     spread of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases; reducing \n     substantially undernutrition and malnutrition through \n     expanded nutrition education and food safety measures, \n     promotion of breast-feeding and sound weaning practices, and \n     micronutrient therapies targeted at vitamin and mineral \n     deficiencies; and investing in the well-being of children \n     through improved and expanded immunization programs, oral \n     rehydration to combat diarrheal diseases, education programs \n     aimed at improving child survival and child welfare and \n     promoting child spacing.\n       ``(d) Cross-Cutting Principles.--Sustainable development \n     programs authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in \n     accordance with the following cross-cutting principles:\n       ``(1) Popular participation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The success of sustainable development \n     depends on the participation of targeted communities in the \n     identification, design, implementation, and evaluation of \n     projects, programs, and assistance strategies and overall \n     strategic objectives. \n\n[[Page S 11020]]\n     To be effective, such participation must incorporate the local-level \n     perspectives of traditionally underserved populations and \n     communities, including women, persons with disabilities, \n     ethnic and religious minorities, indigenous peoples, and the \n     rural and urban poor.\n       ``(B) Nongovernmental organizations.--Incorporation of \n     local perspectives requires effective consultation and \n     coordination with nongovernmental organizations, including \n     private and voluntary organizations, cooperatives and credit \n     unions, labor unions, private sector businesses and trade \n     associations, women's groups, educational institutions, and \n     indigenous local organizations which represent and are \n     knowledgeable about local people. Effective consultation and \n     coordination requires the involvement of such organizations \n     in the formulation of development strategies for specific \n     countries and sectors, the development of procedures and \n     regulations governing the implementation of programs, and the \n     evaluation and monitoring of programs.\n       ``(C) Utilization of united states institutional \n     capabilities.--United States institutions such as public and \n     private institutions of science, technology, business, and \n     education can provide a unique contribution to sustainable \n     development programs. Programs undertaken to achieve the \n     sustainable development purposes of this title bring greater \n     mutual benefit by recognizing and taking advantage of: United \n     States capabilities in science and technology; access to \n     education and training in United States colleges, \n     universities, and technical training facilities; private \n     sector entrepreneurial skills; and United States public \n     sector expertise. This may be encouraged through long-term \n     collaboration between public and private institutions of \n     science, technology, business, and education in the United \n     States and developing countries and emerging democracies.\n       ``(2) Role of women.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Women play central and productive roles \n     throughout the world in the well-being of nations, \n     communities and families. Recognizing women's contributions \n     and incorporating their perspectives, knowledge and \n     experience is critical in developing global strategies for \n     promoting peace, prosperity and democracy.\n       ``(B) Empowerment of women.--To be sustainable, development \n     must foster the economic, political and social empowerment of \n     women. Expanding opportunities for women is essential to \n     reducing poverty, improving health, slowing population growth \n     and environmental degradation, and achieving sustainable \n     development. For this to occur, women must have full and \n     equitable access to productive resources: credit, land, \n     technology, agricultural extension and marketing services, \n     training and other forms of assistance. Increased female \n     education further empowers women by allowing their effective \n     participation in the development process. Therefore, United \n     States sustainable development policies and programs must be \n     designed and implemented to fully integrate women as agents \n     and beneficiaries.\n       ``(3) Managing for results.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Assistance cannot substitute for a \n     developing country's own efforts to improve the lives of its \n     people, nor can the United States afford to provide \n     assistance which does not yield enduring results in terms of \n     improving the lives of the poor, encouraging a stable and \n     prosperous global order, and contributing to the interests of \n     the people of the United States.\n       ``(B) Country requirements.--Targeting assistance toward \n     countries that have demonstrated a need for such programs, \n     that will make effective use of such programs, and that have \n     a commitment to achieving the sustainable development \n     purposes described in this title ensures the most effective \n     use of scarce foreign aid resources. Indicators of such \n     countries include the extent to which: there is a high \n     incidence of hunger and poverty, there is an enabling \n     environment in which government economic policies are \n     conducive to accomplishing those sustainable development \n     purposes, government decisionmaking is transparent, \n     government institutions are accountable to the public, an \n     independent and honest judiciary is maintained, local \n     government bodies are democratically elected, and political \n     parties, nongovernmental organizations and the media operate \n     without undue constraints.\n       ``(C) Measuring results.--Assistance under this part \n     requires the commitment and progress of countries in moving \n     toward the purpose of sustainable development described in \n     subsection (b), while recognizing the long-term nature of \n     development processes and the difficulty of selecting \n     reliable and meaningful indicators of success. Through the \n     establishment of open and transparent systems to monitor the \n     results of assistance programs the United States will assess \n     the effectiveness of its programs and shift scarce resources \n     from unproductive programs, sectors or countries to those \n     which have demonstrated the commitment and ability to use \n     them effectively.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The repeals made by subsection (a) and \n     the amendment made by subsection (b) shall take effect on \n     October 1, 1995.\n       On page 222, strike lines 3 through 7.\n       On page 222, strike lines 17 through 23.\n       On page 224, strike lines 6 through 12.\n       Beginning on page 232, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through line 21 on page 236.\n       Beginning on page 264, line 26, strike ``, the United'' and \n     all that follows through the period on line 2 of page 265 and \n     insert ``and the United States Information Agency.''.\n       On page 266, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 266, strike lines 17 through 20.\n       On page 267, strike lines 4 through 7.\n       On page 26, line 9, insert ``and'' after ``Service;''.\n       On page 26, line 12, strike ``; and'' and insert a period.\n       On page 26, strike lines 13 through 15.\n       On page 26, line 21, insert ``and'' after ``Service;''.\n       On page 26, line 24, strike ``; and'' and insert a period.\n       On page 27, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 105, strike lines 17 through 25.\n       On page 126, beginning on line 22, strike ``the United'' \n     and all that follows through ``Development'' on line 24 and \n     insert ``and the United States Information Agency''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      SARBANES AMENDMENT NO. 1971\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SARBANES submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 29, at the end of line 5 insert the following:\n       (g) Waiver Authority.--(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the \n     President may waive any limitation under subsections (a) \n     through (d) to the extent that such waiver is necessary to \n     carry on the foreign affairs functions of the United States.\n       (2) Not less than 15 days before the President exercises a \n     waiver under paragraph (1), the appropriate agency head shall \n     notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.

COORDINATION OF PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) International Coordination and Leadership.--The United \n     States shall seek to coordinate its sustainable development \n     programs with other bilateral and multilateral donors, as \n     well as with the private sector, in order to maximize the \n     effectiveness of resources allocated to sustainable \n     development. The United States also should exercise \n     leadership in building the global commitment and cooperation \n     necessary for countries to make significant progress toward \n     the \n\n[[Page S 11024]]\n     goals adopted at international fora relating to sustainable \n     development.\n       (b) Coordination of United States Programs and Policies.--\n     The President shall establish a mechanism--\n       (1) to coordinate, and to eliminate duplication among, all \n     United States policies, programs and activities designed to \n     promote sustainable development, including those that are \n     funded or carried out by the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the Department of State, the \n     Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, \n     the African Development Foundation, the Inter-American \n     Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Peace \n     Corps, and other involved departments or agencies;\n       (2) to ensure that United States policies and activities at \n     the international financial institutions and other \n     international organizations engaged in development activities \n     are consistent and complementary with sustainable \n     development; and\n       (3) to ensure that United States policies, programs and \n     activities designed to promote growth through trade and \n     investment, such as the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, and the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States, are consistent and \n     complementary with those purposes.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and not later than March 1 of each \n     year thereafter, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report explaining the \n     way in which the responsibilities for programs are delineated \n     and coordinated among the various agencies and departments \n     described under subsection (b), and the way in which \n     duplication and waste will be avoided.\n\n     SEC. 1403. REFORM AND STREAMLINING OF GOALS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Repeals.--The following provisions of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 are repealed: Sections 102, 103, 103A, \n     104 (a)-(e) and (g), 105, 106, 113, 117 (a) and (b), 118, \n     119, 120, 125, 128, 206, 219, 241, and 281.\n       (b) Sustainable Development Program.--Section 101 of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 101. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The promotion of sustainable development \n     at home and abroad is in the long-term interests of the \n     United States. Sustainable development means broad-based \n     economic growth that protects the environment, enhances human \n     capabilities, upholds human rights and democratic values, and \n     improves the quality of life for current generations while \n     preserving that opportunity for future generations.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--The ultimate purpose of programs under this \n     chapter is to enable the poorest countries and people of the \n     world to provide for their own economic security without \n     further outside assistance. This purpose is pursued \n     internationally by supporting the self-help efforts of people \n     in developing countries--\n       ``(1) to implement sound policies that increase self-\n     reliance, equity, and productive capacity;\n       ``(2) to invest in developing their human resources; and\n       ``(3) to build effective and accountable indigenous \n     political, economic, and social institutions.\n       ``(c) Programs.--The President is authorized to provide \n     assistance under this chapter of the following five \n     interrelated types:\n       ``(1) Encouraging broad-based economic growth.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--Broad-based economic growth means \n     equitable and inclusive economic expansion in developing \n     countries. Such growth is in the economic, political, and \n     strategic interests of the United States because it permits \n     countries to progress toward economic self-reliance, improve \n     the living standards of their citizens, reduce the incidence \n     of poverty, promote food security and nutritional well-being, \n     slow population growth, and increase opportunities for \n     mutually beneficial international trade and investment. \n     Broad-based economic growth also improves the prospects for \n     the spread of democracy and political pluralism.\n       ``(B) Means.--Broad-based economic growth requires, in \n     addition to sound economic policies--\n       ``(i) a broader role for and access to markets for both \n     women and men through improved policies that protect and \n     advance economic rights for all citizens without regard to \n     gender, race, religion, language or social status, that \n     increase self-reliance in meeting basic needs, and that raise \n     real incomes for poor people;\n       ``(ii) stronger and more accountable public and private \n     institutions at the local and national level, and sound \n     public investments;\n       ``(iii) enhanced food security, including improved access \n     to safe food and adequate nutrition through sustainable \n     improvements in and expansion of local, small-scale, food-\n     based agriculture and post-harvest food preservation;\n       ``(iv) sound debt management, including debt relief as \n     appropriate;\n       ``(v) investments in people's productive capabilities, \n     including measures to upgrade technical and managerial \n     knowledge and skills;\n       ``(vi) measures to ensure that the poor, especially women, \n     have improved access to productive resources (including \n     credit for microenterprise initiatives, technical training \n     and market-related information, affordable and resource-\n     conserving technologies, and land) and that they participate \n     fully in the benefits of growth in employment and income; and\n       ``(vii) sustainable improvements to agriculture, through \n     support for agricultural research, provision of appropriate \n     technology, outreach to farmers, and improvement of \n     marketing, storage and transportation systems.\n       ``(2) Protecting the global environment.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--The economic and social well-being and \n     the security of the United States, indeed the health of \n     United States citizens and of the entire world community, \n     depend critically on the global environment and natural \n     resource base. Consumption patterns, systems of industrial \n     and agricultural production, demographic trends, and the use \n     of natural resources directly affect the sustainability of \n     long-term development and growth and the integrity of the \n     ecosystem. Development that does not take account of its \n     environmental consequences will not be economically \n     sustainable. Improved resource management is a critical \n     element of a balanced pattern of development. Both developed \n     and developing countries share responsibility to present and \n     future generations for the rational and sustainable \n     management of natural resources and for environmental \n     protection. The industrialization and consumption patterns of \n     developed countries often impose heavy environmental costs \n     worldwide. Developing countries, which are the stewards of \n     most of the world's biological diversity, not only suffer \n     disproportionately from the consequences of environmental \n     degradation, but also contribute to that degradation as they \n     struggle to meet the basic needs of their people. Therefore, \n     environmental sustainability cannot be secured without \n     reducing poverty, nor can poverty be eliminated without \n     sustainable management of the natural resource base.\n       ``(B) Means.--Protecting the global environment requires \n     addressing the root causes of environmental harm, promoting \n     environmentally-sound patterns of growth and supporting \n     improved management of natural resources. These activities \n     shall include efforts to address urgent global environmental \n     problems, including the loss of biological diversity and \n     global climate change, as well as efforts to address \n     significant environmental problems within countries and \n     regions. Such efforts shall seek to promote sound \n     environmental policies and practices and development that is \n     environmentally, socially and culturally sound over the \n     longer-term, including programs for natural resources \n     conservation, protection of threatened and endangered \n     species, preservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, \n     non-polluting methods of agricultural and industrial \n     production, preparation of environmental impact assessments, \n     improved energy efficiency, better resource management and \n     monitoring, and reduction and safe disposal of wastes.\n       ``(3) Supporting democratic participation.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--It is in the national interest of the \n     United States and in keeping with United States democratic \n     traditions to support democratic aspirations and values, \n     foster the spread of enduring democratic institutions, and \n     encourage universal respect for civil and human rights. The \n     strengthening of civil society and non-governmental \n     institutions, including business associations and labor \n     unions, that encourage broad participation and protect human \n     rights is an essential element of the ability of nations to \n     sustain development efforts.\n       ``(B) Means.--Programs to support democratic participation \n     must help to build and strengthen organizations and \n     institutions that foster inclusion in economic and political \n     decision-making at the local and national levels. Such \n     programs shall include those that promote respect for human \n     rights and the rule of law; an expanding role for \n     nongovernmental and citizens' organizations and their \n     capacity to effectively participate in political and economic \n     decision-making and to implement development programs; \n     enhanced citizen access to public information; the ability of \n     all citizens to choose freely their government and to hold \n     that government accountable for its actions; advancement of \n     legal, social, and economic equality for women, workers, and \n     minorities, including the elimination of all forms of \n     violence against women and expanded opportunities for persons \n     with disabilities; and strengthened principles of tolerance \n     among and within religious and ethnic groups.\n       ``(4) Stabilizing world population and promoting \n     reproductive health.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--Many individuals still do not have access \n     to the means to determine the number and spacing of their \n     children. Rapid population growth, among other factors, \n     aggravates poor health, perpetuates poverty, and inhibits \n     saving and investment, particularly investments in people in \n     the form of basic health and education services. Continued \n     rapid growth in world population will undercut sustainable \n     development efforts. Unsustainable population growth is \n     directly tied to degradation of the natural resource base and \n     the environment and contributes to economic stagnation and \n     political instability. The problems associated with rapid \n     population growth are interrelated with economic and social \n     inequities, particularly the low status of women, and \n     patterns of resource consumption. Rapid population growth \n     impedes development and retards \n\n[[Page S 11025]]\n     progress on global issues of direct concern to the United States.\n       ``(B) Means.--The primary means to stabilize population at \n     levels that are consistent with sustainable, broadly-based \n     development and with recognized standards of human rights, \n     are to provide women and men with the means to freely and \n     responsibly choose the number and spacing of their children, \n     and to contribute to improved reproductive health. This calls \n     for a focus on enhanced access to and improved quality of \n     voluntary family planning services and reproductive health \n     care. Such efforts should be complemented by programs carried \n     out in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (5) to improve \n     female education, raise the economic and social status of \n     women, and increase infant and child survival rates.\n       ``(5) Developing human resources.--\n       ``(A) Rationale.--Reducing the worst manifestations of \n     poverty through the development of human resource capacity is \n     essential to long-term peace and international stability. \n     Individuals, communities, and nations cannot be fully \n     productive when impaired by disease, illiteracy, and hunger \n     resulting from the neglect of human resources. While broad-\n     based economic growth is necessary for the reduction of the \n     worst manifestations of poverty, such growth cannot be \n     sustained unless all people, and especially women, have the \n     basic assets and capabilities that foster the opportunity for \n     participation in the economic, social and political life of \n     their country.\n       ``(B) Means.--To reduce the worst manifestations of \n     poverty, sustainable development programs must develop human \n     resources by securing universal access to adequate food, safe \n     drinking water, basic sanitation, and basic shelter; \n     expanding education to all segments of society, with emphasis \n     on basic education and particular attention to equalizing \n     male and female literacy and schooling; providing equal \n     access to credit; improving the coverage, quality and \n     sustainability of basic health services; preventing the \n     spread of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases; reducing \n     substantially undernutrition and malnutrition through \n     expanded nutrition education and food safety measures, \n     promotion of breast-feeding and sound weaning practices, and \n     micronutrient therapies targeted at vitamin and mineral \n     deficiencies; and investing in the well-being of children \n     through improved and expanded immunization programs, oral \n     rehydration to combat diarrheal diseases, education programs \n     aimed at improving child survival and child welfare and \n     promoting child spacing.\n       ``(d) Cross-Cutting Principles.--Sustainable development \n     programs authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in \n     accordance with the following cross-cutting principles:\n       ``(1) Popular participation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The success of sustainable development \n     depends on the participation of targeted communities in the \n     identification, design, implementation, and evaluation of \n     projects, programs, and assistance strategies and overall \n     strategic objectives. To be effective, such participation \n     must incorporate the local-level perspectives of \n     traditionally underserved populations and communities, \n     including women, persons with disabilities, ethnic and \n     religious minorities, indigenous peoples, and the rural and \n     urban poor.\n       ``(B) Nongovernmental organizations.--Incorporation of \n     local perspectives requires effective consultation and \n     coordination with nongovernmental organizations, including \n     private and voluntary organizations, cooperatives and credit \n     unions, labor unions, private sector businesses and trade \n     associations, women's groups, educational institutions, and \n     indigenous local organizations which represent and are \n     knowledgeable about local people. Effective consultation and \n     coordination requires the involvement of such organizations \n     in the formulation of development strategies for specific \n     countries and sectors, the development of procedures and \n     regulations governing the implementation of programs, and the \n     evaluation and monitoring of programs.\n       ``(C) Utilization of united states institutional \n     capabilities.--United States institutions such as public and \n     private institutions of science, technology, business, and \n     education can provide a unique contribution to sustainable \n     development programs. Programs undertaken to achieve the \n     sustainable development purposes of this title bring greater \n     mutual benefit by recognizing and taking advantage of: United \n     States capabilities in science and technology; access to \n     education and training in United States colleges, \n     universities, and technical training facilities; private \n     sector entrepreneurial skills; and United States public \n     sector expertise. This may be encouraged through long-term \n     collaboration between public and private institutions of \n     science, technology, business, and education in the United \n     States and developing countries and emerging democracies.\n       ``(2) Role of women.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Women play central and productive roles \n     throughout the world in the well-being of nations, \n     communities and families. Recognizing women's contributions \n     and incorporating their perspectives, knowledge and \n     experience is critical in developing global strategies for \n     promoting peace, prosperity and democracy.\n       ``(B) Empowerment of women.--To be sustainable, development \n     must foster the economic, political and social empowerment of \n     women. Expanding opportunities for women is essential to \n     reducing poverty, improving health, slowing population growth \n     and environmental degradation, and achieving sustainable \n     development. For this to occur, women must have full and \n     equitable access to productive resources: credit, land, \n     technology, agricultural extension and marketing services, \n     training and other forms of assistance. Increased female \n     education further empowers women by allowing their effective \n     participation in the development process. Therefore, United \n     States sustainable development policies and programs must be \n     designed and implemented to fully integrate women as agents \n     and beneficiaries.\n       ``(3) Managing for results.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Assistance cannot substitute for a \n     developing country's own efforts to improve the lives of its \n     people, nor can the United States afford to provide \n     assistance which does not yield enduring results in terms of \n     improving the lives of the poor, encouraging a stable and \n     prosperous global order, and contributing to the interests of \n     the people of the United States.\n       ``(B) Country requirements.--Targeting assistance toward \n     countries that have demonstrated a need for such programs, \n     that will make effective use of such programs, and that have \n     a commitment to achieving the sustainable development \n     purposes described in this title ensures the most effective \n     use of scarce foreign aid resources. Indicators of such \n     countries include the extent to which: there is a high \n     incidence of hunger and poverty, there is an enabling \n     environment in which government economic policies are \n     conducive to accomplishing those sustainable development \n     purposes, government decisionmaking is transparent, \n     government institutions are accountable to the public, an \n     independent and honest judiciary is maintained, local \n     government bodies are democratically elected, and political \n     parties, nongovernmental organizations and the media operate \n     without undue constraints.\n       ``(C) Measuring results.--Assistance under this part \n     requires the commitment and progress of countries in moving \n     toward the purpose of sustainable development described in \n     subsection (b), while recognizing the long-term nature of \n     development processes and the difficulty of selecting \n     reliable and meaningful indicators of success. Through the \n     establishment of open and transparent systems to monitor the \n     results of assistance programs the United States will assess \n     the effectiveness of its programs and shift scarce resources \n     from unproductive programs, sectors or countries to those \n     which have demonstrated the commitment and ability to use \n     them effectively.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The repeals made by subsection (a) and \n     the amendment made by subsection (b) shall take effect on \n     October 1, 1995.\n       On page 222, strike lines 3 through 7.\n       On page 222, strike lines 17 through 23.\n       On page 224, strike lines 6 through 12.\n       Beginning on page 232, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through line 21 on page 236.\n       Beginning on page 264, line 26, strike ``, the United'' and \n     all that follows through the period on line 2 of page 265 and \n     insert ``and the United States Information Agency.''.\n       On page 266, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 266, strike lines 17 through 20.\n       On page 267, strike lines 4 through 7.\n       On page 26, line 9, insert ``and'' after ``Service;''.\n       On page 26, line 12, strike ``; and'' and insert a period.\n       On page 26, strike lines 13 through 15.\n       On page 26, line 21, insert ``and'' after ``Service;''.\n       On page 26, line 24, strike ``; and'' and insert a period.\n       On page 27, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 105, strike lines 17 through 25.\n       On page 126, beginning on line 22, strike ``the United'' \n     and all that follows through ``Development'' on line 24 and \n     insert ``and the United States Information Agency''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 1989\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 124, after line 29, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Republic of China compromises one-fifth of \n     the world's population, \n\n[[Page S 11026]]\n     or 1,200,000,000 people, and its policies have a profound effect on the \n     world economy and global security.\n       (2) The People's Republic of China, is a permanent member \n     of the United Nations Security Council and plays an important \n     role in regional organizations such as the Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation Forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum.\n       (3) The People's Republic of China is a nuclear power with \n     the largest standing army in the world, and has been rapidly \n     modernizing and expanding its military capabilities.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China is currently undergoing \n     a change of leadership which will have dramatic implications \n     for the political and economic future of the Chinese people \n     and for China's relations with the United States.\n       (5) China's estimated $600,000,000,000 economy has enjoyed \n     unparalleled growth in recent years.\n       (6) Despite increased economic linkages between the United \n     States and China, bilateral relations have deteriorated \n     significantly because of fundamental policy differences over \n     a variety of important issues.\n       (7) The People's Republic of China has violated \n     international standards regarding the nonproliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       (8) The Government of the People's Republic of China, a \n     member of the United Nations Security Council, is obligated \n     to respect and uphold the United Nations Charter and \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (9) According to the State Department Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices for 1994, there continue to be \n     ``widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in \n     China, in violation of the internationally accepted norms . . \n     . (including) arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention, \n     torture, and mistreatment of prisoners . . . The regime \n     continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \n     assembly and association, and tightened control on the \n     exercise of these rights during 1994. Serious human rights \n     abuses persisted in Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic \n     minorities.''\n       (10) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to detain political prisoners and continues to \n     violate internationally recognized standards of human rights \n     by arbitrary arrests and detention of persons for the \n     nonviolent expression of their political and religious \n     beliefs.\n       (11) The Government of the People's Republic of China does \n     not ensure the humane treatment of prisoners and does not \n     allow humanitarian and human rights organizations access to \n     prisons.\n       (12) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to harass and restrict the activities of accredited \n     journalists and to restrict\n       (13) In the weeks leading to the 6th anniversary of the \n     June 1989 massacre, a series of petitions were sent to the \n     Chinese Government calling for greater tolerance, democracy, \n     rule of law, and an accounting for the 1989 victims and the \n     Chinese Government responded by detaining dozens of prominent \n     intellectuals and activists.\n       (14) The unjustified and arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, \n     and initiation of criminal proceedings against Harry Wu, a \n     citizen of the United States, has greatly exacerbated the \n     deterioration in relations between the United States and the \n     People's Republic of China, and all charges against him \n     should be dismissed.\n       (15) China has failed to release political prisoners with \n     serious medical problems, such as Bao Tong, and on June 25, \n     1995, revoked ``medical parole'' for Chen-Ziming \n     reimprisoning him at Beijing No. 2 Prison and Chinese \n     authorities continue to hold Wei Jingsheng incommunicado at \n     an unknown location since his arrest on April 1, 1994.\n       (16) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to engage in discriminatory and unfair trade \n     practices, including the exportation of products produced by \n     prison labor, the use of import quotas and other quantitative \n     restrictions on\n      selected products, the unilateral increasing of tariff rates \n     and the imposition of taxes as surcharges on tariffs, the \n     barring of the importation of certain items, the use of \n     licensing and testing requirements to limit imports, and \n     the transshipment of textiles and other items through the \n     falsification of country of origin documentation.\n       (17) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to employ the policy and practice of controlling \n     all trade unions and continues to suppress and harass members \n     of the independent labor union movement.\n       (18) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 states \n     that Congress wishes to see the provisions of the joint \n     declaration implemented, and declares that ``the rights of \n     the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the U.S. \n     Human Rights also serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued \n     prosperity,''. This together with the rule of law and a free \n     press are essential for a successful tradition in 1997.\n       (19) The United States currently has numerous sanctions on \n     the People's Republic of China with respect to government-to-\n     government assistance, arms sales and other commercial \n     transactions.\n       (20) It is in the interest of the United States to foster \n     China's continued engagement in the broadest range of \n     international fora and increased respect for human rights, \n     democratic institutions, and the rule of law in China.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The President shall report to Congress within 30 days after \n     the date of enactment of the Act, and no less frequently than \n     every 6 months thereafter, on--\n       (1) the actions taken by the United States in accordance \n     with section 3 during the preceding 6-month period;\n       (2) the actions taken with respect to China during the \n     preceding 6-month period by--\n       (A) the United Nations and other international \n     organizations;\n       (B) the World Bank and other international financial \n     institutions; and\n       (C) the World Trade Organization and other international \n     trade fora; and\n       (3) the progress achieved with respect to each of the \n     United States objectives identified in section 3(a). Such \n     reports may be submitted in classified and unclassified form.\n\n     SES. 5.

accepted \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; \n     committed itself to the peace process and peaceful \n     coexistence with Israel, free from violence and all other \n     acts which endanger peace and stability; and assumed \n     responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order \n     to assure their compliance, prevent violations, and \n     discipline violators;\n       (2) Israel has recognized the PLO as the representative of \n     the Palestinian people;\n       (3) Israel and the PLO signed a Declaration of Principles \n     on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Declaration of Principles'') on \n     September 13, 1993, at the White House;\n       (4) Israel and the PLO signed an Agreement on the Gaza \n     Strip and the Jericho Area (in this section referred to as \n     the ``Gaza-Jericho Agreement'') on May 4, 1994, which \n     established a Palestinian Authority for the Gaza and Jericho \n     areas;\n       (5) Israel and the PLO signed an Agreement on Preparatory \n     Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Early Empowerment Agreement'') on August \n     29, 1994, which provided for the transfer to the Palestinian \n     Authority of certain powers and responsibilities in the West \n     Bank outside of the Jericho Area;\n       (6) under the terms of the Declaration of Principles, the \n     Gaza-Jericho Agreement and the Early Empowerment Agreement, \n     the powers and responsibilities of the Palestinian Authority \n     are to be assumed by an elected Palestinian Council with \n     jurisdiction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in accordance \n     with the Interim Agreement to be concluded between Israel and \n     the PLO;\n       (7) permanent status negotiations relating to the West Bank \n     and Gaza Strip are scheduled to begin by May 1996;\n       (8) the Congress has, since the conclusion of the \n     Declaration of Principles and the PLO's renunciation of \n     terrorism, provided authorities to the President to suspend \n     certain statutory restrictions relating to the PLO, subject \n     to Presidential certifications that the PLO has continued to \n     abide by commitments made in and in connection with or \n     resulting from the good faith implementation of, the \n     Declaration of Principles;\n       (9) the PLO commitments relevant to Presidential \n     certifications have included commitments to renounce and \n     condemn terrorism, to submit to the Palestinian National \n     Council for formal approval the necessary changes to those \n     articles of the Palestinian Covenant which call for Israel's \n     destruction, and to prevent acts of terrorism and hostilities \n     against Israel;

and\n       (7) respect civil liberties, human rights and democratic \n     norms.\n       (d) Authority To Suspend Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act and for 18 months thereafter \n     the President may suspend for a period of not more than 6 \n     months at a time any provision of law specified in paragraph \n     (4). Any such suspension shall cease to be effective after 6 \n     months, or at such earlier date as the President may specify.\n       (2) Conditions.--\n       (A) Consultations.--Prior to each exercise of the authority \n     provided in paragraph (1) or certification pursuant to \n     paragraph (3), the President shall consult with the relevant \n     congressional committees. The President may not exercise that \n     authority to make such certification until 30 days after a \n     written policy justification is submitted to the relevant \n     congressional committees.\n       (B) Presidential certification.--The President may exercise \n     the authority provided in paragraph (1) only if the President \n     certifies to the relevant congressional committees each time \n     he exercises such authority that--\n       (i) it is in the national interest of the United States to \n     exercise such authority;\n       (ii) the PLO continues to comply with all the commitments \n     described in subparagraph (D); and\n       (iii) funds provided pursuant to the exercise of this \n     authority and the authorities under section 583(a) of Public \n     Law 103-236 and section 3(a) of Public Law 103-125 have been \n     used for the purposes for which they were intended.\n       (C) Requirement for continuing plo compliance.--\n       (i) The President shall ensure that PLO performance is \n     continuously monitored, and if the President at any time \n     determines that the PLO has not continued to comply with all \n     the commitments described in subparagraph (D), he shall so \n     notify the appropriate congressional committees. Any \n     suspension under paragraph (1) of a provision of law \n     specified in paragraph (4) shall cease to be effective.\n       (ii) Beginning six months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, if the President on the basis of the continuous \n     monitoring of the PLO's performance determines that the PLO \n     is not complying with the requirements described in paragraph \n     (3), he shall so notify the appropriate congressional \n     committees and no assistance shall be provided pursuant to \n     the exercise by the President of the authority provided by \n     paragraph (1) until such time as the President makes the \n     certification provided for in paragraph (3).\n       (D) PLO commitments described.--The commitments referred to \n     in subparagraphs (B) and (C)(i) are the commitments made by \n     the PLO--\n       (i) in its letter of September 9, 1993, to the Prime \n     Minister of Israel and in its letter of September 9, 1993, to \n     the Foreign Minister of Norway to--\n\n       (I) recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist in \n     peace and security;\n       (II) accept United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 \n     and 338;\n       (III) renounce the use of terrorism and other acts of \n     violence;\n       (IV) assume responsibility over all PLO elements and \n     personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent \n     violations, and discipline violators;\n       (V) call upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and \n     Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the \n     normalization of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, and \n     contributing to peace and stability; and\n       (VI) submit to the Palestine National Council for formal \n     approval the necessary changes to the Palestinian National \n     Covenant eliminating calls for Israel's destruction; and\n\n       (ii) in, and resulting from, the good faith implementation \n     of the Declaration of Principles, including good faith \n     implementation of subsequent agreements with Israel, with \n     particular attention to the objective of preventing \n     terrorism, as reflected in the provisions of the Gaza-Jericho \n     Agreement concerning--\n\n       (I) prevention of acts of terrorism and legal measures \n     against terrorists;\n       (II) abstention from and prevention of incitement, \n     including hostile propaganda;\n       (III) operation of armed forces other than the Palestinian \n     Police;\n       (IV) possession, manufacture, sale, acquisition, or \n     importation of weapons;\n       (V) employment of police who have been convicted of serious \n     crimes or have been found to be actively involved in \n     terrorist activities subsequent to their employment;\n       (VI) transfers to Israel of individuals suspected of, \n     charged with, or convicted of an offense that falls within \n     Israeli criminal jurisdiction;\n       (VII) cooperation with the Government of Israel in criminal \n     matters, including cooperation in the conduct of \n     investigations; and\n       (VIII) exercise of powers and responsibilities under the \n     agreement with due regard to internationally accepted norms \n     and principles of human rights and the rule of law.\n\n       (E) Policy justification.--As part of the President's \n     written policy justification to be submitted to the relevant \n     congressional committees pursuant to subparagraph (A), the \n     President shall report on--\n       (i) the manner in which the PLO has complied with the \n     commitments specified in subparagraph (D), including \n     responses to individual acts of terrorism and violence, \n     actions to discipline perpetrators of terror and violence, \n     and actions to preempt acts of terror and violence;\n       (ii) the extent to which the PLO has fulfilled the \n     requirements specified in paragraph (3);\n       (iii) actions that the PLO has taken with regard to the \n     Arab League boycott of Israel;\n       (iv) the status and activities of the PLO office in the \n     United States;

SENSE OF CONGRESS SUPPORTING THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration \n     have both worked relentlessly to build on the Middle East \n     peace process that began in Madrid in October 1991, with the \n     goal of achieving a comprehensive, lasting peace between \n     Israel and all its neighbors;\n       (2) on September 13, 1993, the first major breakthrough of \n     the Madrid peace process was achieved when Israel and the \n     Palestinians signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim \n     Self-Government Arrangements;\n       (3) the United States pledged to support the Israeli-\n     Palestinian Declaration of Principles by providing \n     $500,000,000 of assistance over 5 years to the West Bank and \n     Gaza;\n       (4) the May 4, 1994 Cairo Agreement between Israel and the \n     Palestinians resulted in the withdrawal of the Israeli army \n     from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area and the \n     establishment of a Palestinian Authority with responsibility \n     for those areas;\n       (5) Israel and the Palestinian Authority are continuing \n     negotiations on the redeployment of Israeli troops out of \n     Arab population centers in the West Bank, the expansion of \n     the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction into the areas \n     vacated by the Israeli army, and the convening of elections \n     for a Palestinian council;\n       (6) the issue of security and preventing acts of terrorism \n     is and must remain of paramount importance in the Israeli-\n     Palestinian negotiations;\n       (7) on October 25, 1994, Israel and Jordan signed a full \n     peace treaty, establishing full diplomatic relations and \n     pledging to resolve all future disputes by peaceful means;\n       (8) the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty has resulted in \n     unprecedented cooperation between the two nations in \n     security, economic development, the environment, and other \n     areas;\n       (9) Israel and Syria have engaged in serious and \n     increasingly substantive peace negotiations, including \n     discussions between their leading military officers on the \n     security arrangements that would accompany a peace treaty;\n       (10) Israel now enjoys low-level diplomatic relations with \n     Morocco and Tunisia, and Israeli officials have conducted \n     face-to-face discussions with senior officials from Qatar, \n     Oman, and Bahrain;\n       (11) the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council have \n     announced their decision to end all enforcement of the \n     secondary and tertiary boycotts of Israel; and\n       (12) extremists opposed to the Middle East peace process \n     continue to use terrorism to undermine the chances of \n     achieving a comprehensive peace, including on July 24, 1995, \n     when a suicide bomber blew up a bus in Tel Aviv, killing five \n     Israeli civilians.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--\n       (1) welcomes the progress made toward peace between Israel \n     and its neighbors;\n       (2) commends those Middle Eastern leaders who have \n     committed to resolve their differences through only peaceful \n     means;\n       (3) reiterates its belief that a comprehensive, lasting \n     peace between Israel and all its neighbors is in the national \n     interest of the United States;\n       (4) encourages all participants in the Middle East peace \n     process to continue working to achieve lasting peace \n     agreements while adhering fully to all commitments made and \n     agreements reached thus far;\n       (5) calls upon all Arab states to demonstrate their \n     commitment to peace by completely dismantling the Arab \n     boycott of Israel in its primary, secondary, and tertiary \n     aspects;\n       (6) reiterates its consistent condemnation of all acts of \n     terrorism aimed at undermining the Middle East peace process, \n     and calls upon all parties to take all necessary steps to \n     prevent such acts; and\n       (7) strongly supports the Middle East peace process and \n     seeks to effect policies that will help the peace process \n     reach a successful conclusion.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      HATFIELD AMENDMENT NO. 2018\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HATFIELD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 908, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 124, after line 20, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO INDOCHINESE \n                   REFUGEES.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S 11033]]\n\n       (1) A substantial but undetermined number of asylum seekers \n     who have escaped from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and who \n     are now detained in refugee camps throughout Asia, have had \n     their refugee claims rejected because of corruption, \n     hostility to asylum seekers, or other defects in refugee \n     screening processes.\n       (2) Others have had their claims rejected because the \n     standard which was applied did not recognize persecution on \n     account of close association with the United States war \n     effort as sufficient to establish refugee status.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress, as \n     follows:\n       (1) United States tax dollars should not support any \n     program or activity that involves involuntary repatriation to \n     Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia of persons who fought on the side \n     of the United States or who were otherwise closely identified \n     with the United States war effort, victims of religious \n     persecution, or other persons who are refugees under United \n     States law.\n       (2) Within numerical limitations provided by law, refugees \n     described in paragraph (1) should be permitted to resettle in \n     the United States and in other free countries.\n       (3) To the extent necessary to ensure that genuine refugees \n     are not involuntarily repatriated to Vietnam, Laos, or \n     Cambodia, persons now detained in refugee camps should be \n     offered access to rescreening under a process genuinely \n     calculated to determine whether they are refugees.

Mr. President, the fall of communism and the \nreunification of Europe makes it easy to forget that there is still one \ncountry in the world that remains artificially divided. I am speaking \nof Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974, when the Turkish military \nintervened on the island to stop a bloody coup that was threatening to \nbecome an all-out attack against the smaller Turkish Cypriot community \nthere.\n  There is now some movement in the effort to find a solution to the \nCyprus issue that has lingered for so long; longer, in fact, than the \n21 years which have passed since the Turkish military action. The truth \nis that the physical partition of the island was the logical result of \nthe de facto partition that occurred in the early 1960's, when Greek \nCypriot extremists began a campaign to drive the Turkish Cypriots off \nthe island forever. That is why U.N. peacekeepers have been on Cyprus \nsince 1963--more than a decade prior to the intervention of 1974.\n  Brian Crozier, a contributing editor at the National Review, has \nrecently written an article for the magazine entitled ``The Forgotten \nRepublic,'' which provides an excellent review of the situation on \nCyprus. I commend it to anyone interested in Cyprus, and submit it for \npublication in the Congressional Record.\n               [From the National Review, June 12, 1995]\n\n                         The Forgotten Republic\n\n                           (By Brian Crozier)\n\n       Lidice is remembered with sorrow and anger: the Czech \n     village razed by the Nazis, its inhabitants massacred. I was \n     unaware of the similar fate of Sandallar and Atlilar, in the \n     Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\n       There is not much to see: a few burnt-out houses, and two \n     simple monuments to the inhabitants. The dead at Sandallar \n     numbered 89, including some old people and a baby of four \n     months. The toll at Atlilar was 37, including two babies, in \n     16 days old, the other 15 months.\n       The Greeks who carried out the massacres included a few \n     uniformed members of the National Guard, armed with machine-\n     guns, and civilians who knew their victims and called them \n     out by name to meet their fate.\n       The date is important. The deeds were done on August 14, \n     1974, less than a month after a Turkish force of six thousand \n     troops and forty tanks had landed near Kyrenia. Was it an \n     invasion? Or a rescue operation? Or, more neutrally, just a \n     landing? It all depends on who you are, and where you stand.\n       A backward look is necessary. This was not my first visit \n     to this beautiful Mediterranean island, only 40 miles from \n     Turkey (and 560 miles from Greece). I had gone there 39 years \n     ago, when the Greek Cypriot terrorist movement, EOKA, led by \n     a political bandit called George Grivas, was in full swing. \n     Grivas had one simple aim: Enosis, or union with Greece.\n       At that time, in 1956, Cyprus was still a British colony, \n     and Britain was not eager to hang onto it. The dismantling of \n     the British Empire was already well under way, but Cyprus was \n     a tough case with some 100,000 Turkish Cypriots, scattered in \n     vulnerable enclaves, and perhaps five times as many Greeks.\n       EOKA's initials were designed to confuse: they stood for \n     National Organization for the Cyprus Struggle, but meant in \n     reality, ``for Greek Cypriots and uninon with Greece.'' There \n     was no room in EOKA for Cypriots of Turkish origin.\n       Cyprus, indeed, was a fully qualified member of the New \n     World Disorder before History began again after the collapse \n     of the Soviet system. Cyprus reminds me of Ireland: two \n     ethnic and religious communities living on the same island, \n     the majority wanting to control the minority, and the \n     minority looking to a nearby ancestral homeland for \n     protection.\n       During the EOKA terror campaign (1955-58) hundreds of Turks \n     were killed and more than 30 villages destroyed (logically, \n     one might say, since Grivas was committed to eliminating all \n     ``traitors,'' defined as opponents of Enosis).\n       The British achieved their aim of getting out of Cyprus in \n     1959 after meetings with the Greek and Turkish governments, \n     which resulted in the London-Zurich Agreements, specifying \n     that the two Cypriot communities would be the founding \n     partners of the forthcoming republic. As for Enosis, it was \n     outlawed; and so, to be fair, was Taksim (partition); which \n     is what the Turks wanted.\n       The new Republic that emerged in 1960 was, however, \n     virtually stillborn. The president, the Greek Orthodox \n     Archbishop Makarios, is often described as a ``moderate,'' \n     but the facts are otherwise. He gave \n\n[[Page S 11037]]\n     the Interior Ministry to a known EOKA killer, Polycarpos Yorgadjis, and \n     similar appointments followed. At the end of 1963, he moved \n     closer to the Grivas model, unleashing a secretly trained \n     army of Greek and Greek Cypriot irregulars against the \n     Turkish community. The Turks hit back, reportedly with arms \n     from Turkey.\n       Makarios declared the Agreements null and void and expelled \n     Turkish members of his government. By late 1963, the small \n     British peace force was out of its depth, and in mid February \n     1964, Britain referred the Cyprus problem to the U.N. \n     Security Council. The outcome was another set of initials: \n     UNFICYP, or the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus. \n     It came in 1964 and is still there, more than thirty years \n     on. Before flying from London to Kyrenia this time, I watched \n     a relevant installment of a documentary television series \n     titled A ``Soldier's Peace,'' in which the Canadian Major-\n     General Lewis MacKenzie summed up the decades of U.N. peace-\n     keeping in a telling phrase: ``It fails even when it \n     succeeds.''\n       The long-drawn-out conflict came to a climax on July 15, \n     1974, when an ex-EOKA terrorist named Nicos Sampson, with the \n     backing of the Colonels' regime then in power in Greece, \n     overthrew Archbishop Makarios and took over. But not for \n     long. There was an element of farce in Sampson's coup, which \n     put him in power for not quite a week--one of the shortest-\n     lived takeovers in history. Within days (on July 23) the \n     Greek Colonels decided, after seven years in power, to hand \n     the country over to civilian politicians.\n       There was, however, drama as well as farce, for the Turkish \n     military landing had started on July 20. Of the questions I \n     put to President Rauf Denktash on my recent visit, the key \n     one, to me, was whether the Turkish government had decided \n     unilaterally to intervene, or whether he had asked the Turks \n     to come in. His reply was frank. He had been in constant \n     touch with the then premier of Turkey, Bulent Ecevit, and had \n     pleaded with him to rescue the heavily out-numbered Turkish \n     minority.\n       The Turkish operation was followed by a massive transfer of \n     populations, obligatory for the Greeks in the north, \n     voluntary for the Turks from the south, in fear of a Greek \n     backlash.\n       Another glance backward. On my visit in 1956, Denktash had \n     called to see me at my hotel in Nicosia. Denktash has not \n     changed very much--a short, now even broader man of 71. Like \n     his counterpart in southern Cyprus, Glavcos Clerides, he is a \n     London-trained lawyer, and his exposition of the long crisis \n     and his efforts to solve it was admirably judicious.\n       The little Republic needs Denktash, but came close to \n     losing him in the first round of the presidential election \n     this April 16, when he won only 40 per cent of the vote, with \n     his right-wing rival Dervis Eroglu, close behind. But in the \n     run-off on the 22nd, he won a fifth term with 62 per cent.\n       Meanwhile, back in 1975, the Denktash government, under \n     Turkey's protection, proclaimed a Turkish Cypriot Federated \n     State on February 13. Initially, Denktash did not seek \n     international recognition. His aim was to negotiate a deal \n     with his Greek Cypriot opposite number, Acting President \n     Clerides, for a partition of the island into two separate, \n     but federally linked, entities.\n       That was twenty years ago, and the deadlock has been frozen \n     ever since. Clerides and his advisors were not interested in \n     Denktash's federal fantasy, as they saw it. There seemed only \n     one way out, and Rauf Denktash took it in 1983. He dropped \n     the federal initiative and, on November 15, proclaimed the \n     independence of his enclave, under the name of ``the Turkish \n     Republic of Northern Cyprus.'' Three days later, on the \n     initiative of the (Greek) Republic of Cyprus, the UN Security \n     Council voted for non-recognition of the Northern Republic.\n       And there, you might think, the matter rests; except that \n     it does not, and should not. Life in the unrecognized \n     republic is at least peaceful, but not as comfortable as it \n     might be. The Greek Cypriots see to that, by cutting off gas \n     and electricity daily, although the Turkish northerners hope \n     to have enough supplies of their own before long. Inflation \n     is running at 200 percent, and life without Turkish handouts \n     would be grimmer still. The Greek government tried to block a \n     mainland-Turkish move for a customs deal with the European \n     Union, but eventually lifted its veto.\n       In southern Cyprus, meanwhile, there are worrying signs. \n     For months past, a Russian-mafia and ex-KGB presence has been \n     building up there; there is a massive arms build-up as well \n     ($2 million worth a day, according to northern sources), \n     including equipment from the former Warsaw Pact as well as \n     from NATO via Greece. There are also reliable reports on a \n     still more sinister development, with the training of anti-\n     Turkish, Leninist terrorists of the PKK (Kurdish People's \n     Party) in the south.\n       Meanwhile, Turkey's military presence in the north has \n     officially grown from 6,000 to 30,000. Unconfirmed whispers \n     put the total at closer to 130,000. Reminder: Greece and \n     Turkey are both members of NATO. In February 1975, the U.S. \n     Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey; in retaliation, \n     Turkey closed 25 U.S. defense installations. President Gerald \n     Ford partially lifted the embargo in October 1975 and under a \n     new agreement, the following year, Turkey took control of the \n     installations and received substantial grants and credits \n     from the United States.\n       Time to declare? In my view, the Turkish intervention of \n     1974 was not an invasion, as widely accepted, but a morally \n     justified rescue operation. I understand the Greek ancestral \n     memories of Ottoman oppression, but I do not think they \n     justify Greek Cypriot repression of the peaceful Turkic \n     minority. I regret the Greek rejection of a federal solution, \n     which alone makes sense to me. Still more do I regret the \n     international failure to recognize the independence of \n     northern Cyprus. As it happens, talks on ways to reunite \n     Cyprus, sponsored by the U.S. and Britain, opened in London \n     on May 20. This encourages me (but only just) to end on a \n     note of hope, though not of optimism.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S11036-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALBERT BROS., INC.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nConnecticut's oldest businesses which will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary this year: Albert Bros., Inc. In 1891, Nathan and Lewis \nAlbert came to Waterbury, Ct from their native home of Vilna, \nLithuania. Traveling by horse and wagon through Connecticut, Nathan and \nLewis Albert began their livelihood by selling tin goods and buying \nscrap metal. In 1895, with the opening of their own scrap yard, Albert \nBros., Inc. began.\n  The Albert brothers moved the location of their business several \ntimes, finally settling on Judd Street in 1917. One year later, Lewis \nleft the company to manage his own coal and oil business. Spending over \n50 years on Judd Street, the company survived the Great Depression and \na flood in 1955 and continued to prosper at that location for over \nthree decades. In 1971, the company outgrew the Judd Street location \nand moved to its present location on East Aurora Street.\n  In the 1980's, Albert Bros., Inc. welcomed the fourth generation of \nAlbert's into the business. With this came yet another prosperous \nexpansion for the company.\n  Currently, Albert Bros., Inc. is one of the largest scrap metal \nrecyclers/processors in New England, operating on both a national and \nan international level. Albert Bros. has received numerous awards for \nthe quality of its processed scrap, and a variety of awards from the \nState of Connecticut for its excellence in workplace safety. The \nsuccess of Albert Bros. can be seen by recognizing its commitment to \nthe people.\n  Therefore, in this year of the 100th anniversary of Albert Bros., \nInc., I wish to commend the company for their hard work and \ndedication.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S11037-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             BEATRICE KAHAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nremember a woman who spent her life striving to improve her community, \nBeatrice Kahan of Kalkaska. She passed away earlier this month.\n  A long time resident of Kalkaska, Beatrice Kahan held many public \npositions. For her many contributions to the community she was selected \nas the Kalkaska Citizen of the Year and was recognized as one of the \ntop 10 Women of the Year by the Zonta Club of Michigan.\n  Beatrice Kahan served on the Kalkaska Village Council, the \nCosmetology Board, the Probate Court Advisory Commission, the Trout \nMemorial Board, and acted as president of the Kalkaska Chamber of \nCommerce. Her contributions to the community include spearheading the \neffort to build sewers in Kalkaska, founding the International Dog \nRaces, restoring the downtown Kalkaska Trout Memorial, and identifying \nproblems of elderly abuse.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to Beatrice \nKahan, a caring educator who established the K-College of Cosmetology \nin Kalkasa and Traverse City. Many of her former students remember her \nas the person who gave their lives direction and the skills they needed \nto compete in the marketplace.

Mr. President, one of the greatest joys of being \na U.S. Senator is the opportunity to work with the brightest, most \ntalented young people in the country. Inevitably, it is \n\n[[Page S 11038]]\nwith a mixed sense of sadness and pride that one watches them mature \nand then move on to the next aspect of their career. That certainly \ndescribes my feelings today as my upstate director, Ben Alexander, \nleaves to go to law school.\n  There are quite a few things that anyone who has any contact with Ben \nwill ascertain immediately--he is smart, he is conscientious, he is \ntireless, and he is relentlessly good natured. If one talks to Ben a \nlittle longer, one will find that he has a voluminous knowledge of \nSouth Carolina's upstate. He can tell you the economic statistics, \nelection results, business prospects and wedding announcements for \nevery town in 10 counties. And he is just as proficient at expediting a \nSocial Security case as helping industry and government build the \ninfrastructure necessary to a healthy business climate. In addition, he \nbegan an intern program that has been a boon to both my office and the \nmany fine universities found in the upstate. In short, Ben can do it \nall and do it all well.\n  Despite all this obvious talents, I had some reservations about \ngiving a 22-year-old primary responsibility for the most populous area \nof the State when he began nearly 7 years ago. On my first visit to the \nGreenville area after Ben had taken over, he picked me up at the \nairport and proceeded to reenforce all my worst fears by getting lost. \nWell, we eventually got where we were going and I later learned that \nBen was famous for his hard work but infamous for his sense of \ndirection. But there turned out to be no need to worry. Ben learned to \nread a road map just as well as he could read a political map. And I \ncan assure you that my office never took a wrong turn under Ben's \nstewardship.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to say thanks to Ben Alexander for all he \nhas done for me and for the people of South Carolina. As he heads off \nto law school, he will remain a member of the extended Hollings family. \nI appreciate this opportunity to thank him for a job well done and to \nwish him every success in the years ahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S11037-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EMERGENCY HIGHWAY RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, in describing the State of Michigan, the \nauthor John Steinbeck wrote, ``It seemed to me that the Earth was \ngenerous and outgoing here in the heartland, and perhaps the people \ntook a cue from it.''\n  One person who Steinbeck may have been thinking of when he wrote \nthose words was George Romney. And today Governor Romney's family and \nfriends \n\n[[Page S 11039]]\ngathered in Bloomfield Hills, MI, to pay a final tribute to one of \nAmerica's most generous and outgoing public servants.\n  An innovative businessman, an effective Governor, a dedicated \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, a committed members of his \nchurch, a loving husband and father. George Romney was all of this and \nmore.\n  But perhaps the title that Governor Romney cherished above all was \nthe simple title of American.\n  During his remarkable life and career, George Romney was always \nfighting for his country, and for the values that make it great.\n  He knew that the free enterprise system was the engine that moved our \neconomy forward, and, as a pioneering businessman, he introduced the \ncompact car to Americans.\n  George Romney also believed in democracy, and he chose to leave a \nvery lucrative career for the opportunity to make a difference for all \nMichigan citizens.\n  And some three decades before ``Reinventing Government'' became a \nnational fad, George Romney fought to reduce the bureaucracy, and to \nsee that Government remained close to the people.\n  George Romney also was an advocate for the uniquely American \ntradition of neighbor helping neighbor, and after leaving public \nservice, he founded The National Center, which was devoted to \nincreasing voluntarism in America, and which will stand as one of his \nlegacies.\n  Another legacy is his family. Governor Romney understood that there \nis no institution more vital to America's survival than the family. He \nfought for policies that strengthened all America's families, and he \ntook geat pride in the many accomplishments of his.\n  I know all Senators join with me in sending our condolences, to \nLenore, his wife of 64 years, and to his four children, 23 \ngrandchildren, and 33 great-grandchildren.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S11038-7", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I am sorry that the Senator from Texas left the floor. I \nunderstand the basic premise of her amendment, which says that the U.N. \nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing should promote an authentic \nAmerican prospective on issues of equality, peace, and development. \nAbsolutely that is correct.\n  But there are a couple of things here that are just odd, which does \nnot necessarily mean that I will not support this. But I find it odd \nthat in a resolution coming before the Senate that the Senate has to \nstate and go on record that there are only two genders, male and \nfemale. That is what the facts of life are. And I just find it kind of \nodd to have to say that there are two genders.

That concerns me because what she says is to ensure that the \ntraditional family is upheld as the fundamental unit of society upon \nwhich healthy cultures are built and, therefore, receives esteem and \nprotection by society in the State. Of course, our families and the \npeople in them should receive full protection of society and the \ncountry in America. But are we implying here that if we are not \nmarried, if we are single, you do not deserve to have those \nprotections? I hope not.\n  So I wanted to ask her about that.

Mr. President, I was disappointed to learn that the \nEthics Committee has voted 3 to 3 and is deadlocked on the issue of \npublic hearings in the Packwood case, with three Republicans voting \nagainst public hearings and three Democrats voting in favor of public \nhearings.\n  I have stated oftentimes on this floor that if that would be the \ncase, I was going to offer the amendment, and I stand by that. I will \ndo that because not holding open public hearings in a case that has \nreached this serious a level would be the first time in history that \nthe Senate has failed to do so.\n  And, Mr. President, I have just wracked my brain. What is it about \nthis case that should give a Senator the right to have his case behind \nclosed doors? The only thing I can come up with is the more \nembarrassing you make your transgressions, the more likely you are to \nget to be heard behind closed doors. That is a horrible message. Or, if \nit involves sexual misconduct, sexual misconduct, mistreatment of \nwomen, or, if this is done by a woman toward men, misconduct of human \nbeings because of their sexuality, that you get to have those hearings \nbehind closed doors. What an incredible message the Republican members \nof the Ethics Committee have sent to the American people today. I \ncannot figure out any other reason.\n  I think it is important to note that the Senator in question got his \nopportunity to appear before a committee in person to talk about what \nhe thought discrepancies might be in the case and to look at those \nSenators eye to eye. But the women, 17 of them in 18 different cases, \ndo not get that chance.\n  I hope the American people are following this saga. It is \nextraordinary. The women do not have a chance to come before that \ncommittee and look in their eyes and talk about their humiliation and \ntheir pain.\n  I have to tell you something. When it comes to this issue, and men \nand women who have had this experience will tell you, you never forget \nit whether it was 3 days ago or 30 years ago. It is that humiliating. \nYou remember every single detail. You remember how you felt. And it \nstays with you for your whole life.\n  These women do not have the same chance that this privileged Senator \ndid to look in the eyes of the Ethics Committee members and tell them \nfrom their heart what transpired. I think this is wrong.\n  Now, on the bright side, the committee voted 6 to 0 to distribute all \nthe documents related to the case. That is my understanding, all the \ndepositions. That is a good sign. We can at least see what the \ndepositions say, what the documents say, about the sexual misconduct, \nabout the allegations of tampering with evidence, about the allegations \nof trying to get a spouse a job related to lower alimony payments. We \nwill get to see the documents.\n  It is a good thing because I heard directly from one of my Republican \ncolleagues that he was able to see some of the depositions, and he is \nnot even on the committee. It is a good thing we are all getting a \nchance to see the documents and the depositions.\n  But, Mr. President, I have to tell you, this is like justice half \nway. You see the depositions but you do not really get to see the \npeople, and they do not get to tell their side. That is like canceling \na trial and just deciding the guilt or innocence based on paperwork. \nThat is not justice. That is justice half way. That is one-sided \njustice.\n  I know that not all of my colleagues are very excited about the fact \nthat I am going to be offering an amendment, but I know that each and \nevery one of my colleagues in their heart believes, if they felt \nstrongly about this, they would do it as well because it is about \n\n[[Page S 11040]]\nthe honor of the Senate. It is about the traditions of the Senate. It \nis about a signal we will send if we allow this deadlock to continue.\n  Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's time on this \nmatter. There will be much more to say on it. I will at this time yield \nmy time to the Senator from Rhode Island if he wishes to take advantage \nof the little extra time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/31/senate-section/article/S11039-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11040-S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    IN DEFENSE OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to outline some of \nthe concerns I have about the provisions pertaining to the United \nNations in the bill we have been considering, the State authorization \nbill.\n  Titles II and III of the bill, in my opinion, amount collectively to \nan assault on U.S. participation in the U.N. system. I know that some \nAmericans have questioned the effectiveness of the United Nations in \ncertain peacekeeping operations, such as those in Somalia and Bosnia, \nand that there are lingering concerns about the ability of the United \nStates to expend resources on foreign affairs in general.\n  That being said, I think it is fair to say there is evidence that a \nmajority of Americans support U.S. participation in the U.N. system--\nparticularly when it comes to U.N. peackeeping. To paraphrase former \nSecretary of State James Baker, U.N. peacekeeping is a pretty good \nbargain. For every dollar the United States spends on U.N. \npeacekeeping, we save many more by preventing conflicts in which we \nwould otherwise become involved unilaterally.\n  I am therefore distraught and distressed by this bill's obvious anti-\nU.N. course. If adopted in its present form, this bill could well \nestablish the foundation for an eventual U.S. withdrawal from the U.N. \nsystem. I think that would be a disastrous outcome, and one to which \nthe American public would strenuously object. As Secretary of State \nChristopher noted in a recent letter to me, ``* * * turning our back on \nthe U.N. would increase the economic, political, and military burden on \nthe American people.''\n  There are a number of troublesome sections in this bill relating to \nthe United Nations. Section 201 authorizes a reduction of more than \n$157 million from the President's request for the U.S. assessed \ncontributions to the United Nations and related agencies. From there, \nthe fiscal year 1997-99 recommendations are straightlined--frozen, to \nbe precise--at the fiscal year 1996 levels.\n  That is a mistake. If we enact this provision, the Congress will \nforce the United States to default on treaty obligations and fall \nfurther into arrears on our payments to the United Nations. I remember \nhow hard I tried to work with the Bush administration to bring the \nUnited States back from its deadbeat status at the United Nations; what \na shame it would be for us to fall behind once more.\n  Section 203, in a misguided effort to save the United States money at \nthe United Nations, calls for the U.N. General Assembly to reformulate \nthe percentages of assessed contributions, and to base those \npercentages upon each nation's share of the world's total gross \nnational product. If we were to follow these guidelines, however, the \nU.S. share of total assessed contributions to the United Nations would \neasily exceed our current mandated ceiling of 25 percent. In other \nwords, we would achieve the exact opposite of what this section \nprobably intends.\n  Section 205 is probably the most problematic of all the U.N. \nprovisions. This section would have the United States withhold 50 \npercent of its assessed peacekeeping dues and 20 percent of its regular \ncontributions, and would bar payment of all voluntary peacekeeping \ncontributions, unless the President were able to certify certain \nconditions with regard to the U.N. inspector general's office.\n  While U.N. reform is a good idea, this provision sets unworkable \nstandards for an effective U.N. inspector general. In other words, the \nPresident would never be able to certify the conditions set forth in \nthis legislation, nor in many cases would he want such conditions to \narise. In my opinion, by setting such impossible certification \nrequirements, this section is but a thinly veiled attempt to cut off \nenormous percentages of U.S. funding for the United Nations. It ought \nto be modified or, better yet, deleted.\n  There are other sections that also should be revised. I know that \nSenator Kerry and I have had discussions with our Republican \ncounterparts to express concerns about section 206, a so-called \nwhistle-blower provision; section 212, which increases advance \nnotification requirement for U.N. Security Council votes; section 217, \nwhich creates exceptions for U.S. enforcement of U.N. sanctions \nregimes; section 220, which redefines the U.S. concept of a \npeacekeeping operation; and finally, sections 313, 316, and 317, which \nwould prohibit certain U.S. contributions to the ILO and other \ninternational organizations.\n  Having returned just a short time ago from the 50th anniversary \ncelebration of the foundation of the United Nations, I am convinced \nmore than ever of the usefulness and necessity of U.S. participation in \nthe United Nations. It is often repeated--and with good reason--that if \nthe United Nations did not exist, then the world would need to invent \nit. I think it is high time that the Congress recognized the good and \npositive value we get for spending at the United Nations, and make the \ncorrect decision to reject the troublesome provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, on July 26, former Deputy Secretary of State John C. \nWhitehead, who is now Chair of the U.N. Association, wrote to me to \noutline the Association's assessment of the U.S. stake in the United \nNations. It is an important statement and offers a clear and concise \nargument for continued U.S. participation in the United Nations.\n  Secretary Whitehead's letter prompted me to recall my own personal \ninvolvement with the United Nations having been present at its \ncreation. To be precise, I was an Assistant Secretary of Committee \nIII--the Enforcement Arrangements Committee--and worked specifically on \nwhat became articles 43, 44, and 45 of the charter. These articles are \nas relevant now as they were 50 years ago.\n  To my mind, the charter has been more than mere words and paper, more \nthan a blueprint of an organizational structure. To me, the charter is \na vibrant and dynamic force, willed into being by the collective hopes \nand dreams of the participants in the San Francisco conference. \nAlthough experience has proven that the charter has not always lived up \nto such high expectations, the last 50 years have proven that \ncollective security is a pretty sound concept for relations between \nstates. It therefore pains me to see this debate in Congress over the \nfuture of U.S. participation in the U.N. system.\n  If the United States abandons the United Nations, the United Nations \ncould well meet the same fate as the League of Nations. I think our \ninterest lies in remaining solidly behind the United Nations. The U.S. \nfailure to support the League of Nations is precisely why the League \nfailed. We should not let the same thing happen to the United Nations. \nIn the coming years, I can easily foresee that the United States will \nneed the United Nations to intervene in areas of conflict or to tackle \nissues such as the international environment, world hunger, and refugee \ncrises.\n  It is unfair and shortsighted to judge the United Nations solely on \nits success or failure in dealing with an intractable, longstanding \nethnic conflict such as that in the former Yugoslavia. Rather, we \nshould look at its 50 year's worth of experience in promoting \ncollective security, humanitarian assistance and international \ncooperation in the environment and other areas.\n  The record, I would argue, has been good, and with a little work, the \nfuture holds real promise. My hope is that 50 years from now, when the \nUnited Nations celebrates its 100 year anniversary, our children will \nlook back and remember this time as the turning point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Whitehead's letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 11041]]\n\n                                           U.N.

Claiborne Pell,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: I am writing to share with you a policy \n     statement of the United Nations Association of the United \n     States (UNA-USA) on the U.S. stake in the United Nations and \n     U.N. financing, adopted in late June by UNA-USA's national \n     convention on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the \n     signing of the United Nations Charter.\n       It is a serious yet succinct statement on an issue of \n     considerable importance, with major implications for the \n     Congress. We hope you will find it of interest. UNA-USA is \n     eager to make a constructive contribution to the policy \n     debate.\n       We would be pleased to share any reactions with UNA-USA's \n     25,000 members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John C. Whitehead,\n                                      Chairman of the Association.\n       Enclosure.\n                      Financing the United Nations\n\n       The greatest threat today to the U.N.'s effectiveness and \n     even survival is the cancer of financial insolvency. \n     Countries slow to pay their share include many that are \n     small. But it is the massive delinquencies of the United \n     States that have plunged the Organization into chronic crisis \n     and sapped its capacity to respond to emergencies and new \n     needs.\n       The services provided by international organizations are, \n     objectively, quite cheap--especially in comparison with the \n     sums we spend on other dimensions of national security, such \n     as the military, as backup in the event that diplomacy and \n     the U.N. machinery fail. The annual U.S. assessments for \n     peacekeeping worldwide are less than the police budget for \n     the nation's largest city. Total American contributions, \n     voluntary as well as obligatory, for all agencies of the U.N. \n     system amount to $7 per capita (compared to some $1,000 per \n     capita for the Defense Department)\n       Some object that U.N. peacekeeping costs have exploded over \n     the past decade, from a U.S. share of $53 million in 1985 to \n     $1.08 billion projected for 1995. But the end of the Cold War \n     that sparked that increase, by freeing the U.N. to be an \n     effective agent of conflict management, also allowed for far \n     larger reductions in other U.S. security spending: Over the \n     same decade, Pentagon budgets have fallen $34 billion. \n     Increased reliance on U.N. collective security operations \n     necessarily complements our defense savings. Moreover, U.N. \n     costs are spread among all member states, and constitute a \n     truly cost-effective bargain for all.\n       However, at a time of hard budget choices, many national \n     politicians see U.N. contributions as an easy target. They \n     are misguided. In asserting that national parliaments can \n     unilaterally set their nations' assessment levels, claim \n     offsets from assessed obligations for voluntary peacekeeping \n     contributions, and impose policy conditions for payment of \n     their agreed share of expenses, some Washington politicians \n     jeopardize the institutional underpinnings of the world \n     community. No multilateral organization--whether the U.N., \n     the World Bank, or NATO--can long survive if member states \n     play by such rules.\n       In ratifying the U.N. Charter, every member state assented \n     in law to the financial obligations of U.N. membership. \n     Virtually all of America's allies in the industrialized world \n     fulfill those obligations to the United Nations--in full, on \n     time, and without conditions. Until relatively recently, so \n     did the United States. It must do so again.\n       America's leaders must recommit this nation to full and \n     timely payment of assessed contributions to the U.N. and \n     related organizations, including prompt retirement of arrears \n     accumulated over the past decade. Financial unreliability \n     leaves our institutions of common purpose vulnerable and \n     inefficient. We must sustain--and, where needed, increase--\n     our voluntary financial support of the U.N. system's many \n     vital activities in the economic and social fields as well as \n     peace and security. We should press for assessment scales \n     that fairly reflect nations' relative capacity to pay, and \n     explore other means, including minimal fees on international \n     transactions of appropriate types, to ensure that funds to \n     pay for the U.N. system budgets that member states approve \n     do, in fact, materialize.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 America's Stake in the United Nations\n\n       Fifty years ago we, the people of the United States, joined \n     in common purpose and shared commitment with the people of 50 \n     other nations. The most catastrophic war in history had \n     convinced nations that no country could any longer be safe \n     and secure in isolation. From this realization was born the \n     United Nations--the idea of a genuine world community and a \n     framework for solving human problems that transcend national \n     boundaries. Since then, technology and economics have \n     transformed ``world community'' from a phrase to a fact, and \n     if the World War II generation had not already established \n     the U.N. system, today's would have to create it.\n       The founders of the United Nations were clairvoyant in many \n     ways. The Charter anticipated decolonization; called for \n     ``respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all \n     without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion''; \n     and set up the institutional framework ``for the promotion of \n     the economic and social advancement of all peoples.'' In \n     meeting the Charter's challenges, we make for a more secure \n     and prosperous world.\n       Through the U.N. system, many serious conflicts have been \n     contained or concluded. Diseases have been controlled or \n     eradicated, children immunized, refugees protected and fed. \n     Nations have set standards on issues of common concern--\n     ranging from human rights to environmental survival to radio \n     frequencies. Collective action has also furthered particular \n     U.S. government interests, such as averting a widening war in \n     the Middle East into which Washington might otherwise be \n     drawn. After half a century, the U.N. remains a unique \n     investment yielding multiple dividends for Americans and \n     others alike.\n       The U.N.'s mandate to preserve peace and security was long \n     hobbled by the Cold War, whose end has allowed the \n     institutions of global security to spring to life. The five \n     permanent members of the Security Council now meet and \n     function as a cohesive group, and what the Council has lost \n     in rhetorical drama it has more than gained in forging common \n     policies. Starting with the Reagan Administration's effort to \n     marshal the Security Council to help bring an end to the \n     Iran-Iraq war in 1988, every U.S. administration has turned \n     to the U.N. for collective action to help maintain or restore \n     peace. Common policy may not always result in success, but \n     neither does unilateral policy--and, unlike unilateral \n     intervention, it spreads costs and risks widely and may help \n     avoid policy disasters.\n       Paradoxically, the end of the Cold War has also given rise \n     in the U.S. to a resurgent isolationism, along with calls for \n     unilateral, go-it-alone policies. Developments in many places \n     that once would have stirred alarm are now viewed with \n     indifference. When they do excite American political \n     interest, the impulse is often to respond unilaterally in the \n     conviction that only Washington can do the job and do it \n     right. Without a Soviet threat, some Americans imagine we can \n     renounce ``foreign entanglements.'' Growing hostility to U.N. \n     peacekeeping in some political circles reflects, in large \n     measure, the shortsighted idea that America has little at \n     stake in the maintenance of a peaceful world. In some \n     quarters, resentment smolders at any hint of reciprocal \n     obligations; but in a country founded on the rule of law, the \n     notion that law should rule among nations ought not to be \n     controversial.\n       The political impulse to go it alone surges at precisely \n     the moment when nations have become deeply interconnected. \n     The need for international teamwork has never been clearer. \n     Goods, capital, news, entertainment, and ideas flow across \n     national borders with astonishing speed. So do refugees, \n     diseases, drugs, environmental degradation, terrorists, and \n     currency crashes.\n       The institutions of the U.N. system are not perfect, but \n     they remain our best tools for concerted international \n     action. Just as Americans often seek to reform our own \n     government, we must press for improvement of the U.N. system. \n     Fragmented and of limited power, prone to political \n     paralysis, bureaucratic torpor, and opaque accountability, \n     the U.N. system requires reform--but not wrecking. \n     Governments and citizens must press for changes that improve \n     agencies' efficiency, enhance their responsiveness, and make \n     them accountable to the world's publics they were created to \n     serve. Our world institutions can only be strengthened with \n     the informed engagement of national leaders, press, and the \n     public at large.\n       The American people have not lost their commitment to the \n     United Nations and to the rule of law. They reaffirm it \n     consistently, whether in opinion surveys or UNICEF campaigns. \n     Recognizing the public's sentiment, the foes of America's \n     U.N. commitment--unilateralists, isolationists, or whatever--\n     do not call openly for rejecting the U.N. as they had earlier \n     rejected outright the League of Nations. But the systematic \n     paring back of our commitment to international law and \n     participation in institutions would have the same effect.\n       In this 50th anniversary year, America's leaders should \n     rededicate the nation to the promise of a more peaceful and \n     prosperous world contained in the U.N. Charter.
