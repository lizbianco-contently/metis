Mr. President, as agreed to yesterday, at this time I send \nan amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3965.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in the arrangement between myself and the \nBudget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, I am offering this \namendment today as a substitute for the basic Republican amendment that \nwas laid down when we began the budget debate yesterday by the chairman \nof the Budget Committee.\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\n  The amendment that I am offering is very clear cut. It is not \ndifficult to understand. I am proposing the President's 7-year, CBO \ncertified balanced budget as a substitute to the Republican budget that \nis now before the Senate.\n  Let us turn back the clock to a year ago. That is when my Republican \ncolleagues pulled our leg on the Senate floor. The Republicans offered \nthe President's budget recommendation as a substitute for their own \namendment. They offered that as a substitute resolution. As a result of \nthat, they had a good laugh at our expense as the amendment was voted \ndown 99 to 0, with this Senator, the ranking Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee, voting with the 99.\n  But what a difference a year makes. It is not only a different year, \nMr. President. It is a different budget. And I do not think my \ncolleagues on the other side would be smirking if they did the same \nthing this year as they did last year, but, of course, there is no \nindication that they will do that. It would not be the meaningless, \nhollow political gesture that it was in May 1995. This President's \nbalanced budget is real in every sense of the word, and it is certified \nto be in balance by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Throughout last year I heard one chorus from the Republican majority. \nThey repeated it over and over again: ``Mr. President, give us a 7-year \nbalanced budget, certified by the Congressional Budget Office.'' I was \nurging the President to do the same thing. The difference was that I \nwas interested in sound budget politics rather than partisan politics. \nIt is now a done deal. The President has complied with what the \nRepublicans were seeking and what this Senator was seeking.\n  Now we hear something different from the Republicans. In order to \navoid dealing with the President, House Budget Chairman Kasich has now \nreversed course and tells CNN, ``The problem is, of course, not in the \nnumbers.'' It is the extremist Republican philosophy that President \nClinton and mainstream Americans have soundly rejected, but they are \nstill on that course. For my colleagues who still believe that honest \nnumbers are important, here is a product, the President's budget, far \nsuperior to the Republican budget that is now on the floor. For, as the \nRepublican budget delivers fresh and needless pain, across the years, \nthe President's budget is a smart mixture of fiscal constraint and \ncompassion.\n  The President's budget achieves balance in 7 years, but it does so \nwithout the terrible burden being brought on our senior citizens, \nworking families, and the most vulnerable in America. It reflects the \nvalues and the priorities of the American people. It protects Medicare \nbenefits and it protects Medicare beneficiaries. It invests in our \nchildren's education, it protects the environment from the search-and-\ndestroy right wing radicals. It preserves nursing home standards and \nnursing home benefits. It prevents ordinary Americans from going broke \nto pay for nursing home care.\n  As I noted a few moments ago, this will be the last budget resolution \nof my Senate career, and I thank President Clinton for saving the best \nfor last, as far as this Senator is concerned. In my 18 years in this \ngreat body, I cannot think of another budget that better hits the mark \nright from the start. I cannot think of another budget that I could \nendorse so eagerly. I cannot think of another budget that ordinary \nAmericans could so readily call their own.\n  Having said that, of course the President's budget is not without \nsome flaws as far as this Senator is concerned. We could all find \nthings on which we would disagree. There is always a pea under the \nmattress that irritates one or more of the 100 Members of this body. \nAnd there are some things in the President's budget that cause me some \nconcern. But what we are talking about here is a document that I am \nintroducing today that I hope would be the basic model that we would \nbegin from, rather than the budget proposal endorsed and put together \nand offered by the Republican majority. In other words, I, too, would \nhope we could do some fine tuning on the President's budget, which I \nthink is necessary.\n  But I want to be clear on this point: The underlying mechanism in \nthis budget, which is fiscal restraint coupled with protecting our \neconomic investments so vital to America, is synchronized and in fine \nworking order, but I would certainly entertain some amendments to it.\n  After 18 years in the Senate, I harbor few illusions that there will \nbe a mass conversion on the other side of the table to what I consider \nto be my reasonable appeal. I ask my colleagues, however, to have a \nserious discussion and have a serious look at the amendment I am \noffering.\n  For too many months we have been talking at each other and not with \neach other about how to balance the budget in 7 years. This \nPresidential proposal is a serious and a honest budget, and I hope all \nof my colleagues will approach this amendment in that spirit so we can \nmove ahead in an expeditious fashion.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now beginning a debate over the \nPresident's budget proposal for 1997 and for succeeding years. In a \nvery real sense, the fact that we are debating this proposal represents \na major step forward from the situation in which we found ourselves \nlast year.\n\n  As my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, has pointed out, last year \nit was members of the Republican Party who put up the President's \nbudget to be voted on and voted down. Members of his own party were not \nwilling, systematically, to defend that budget. Because, Mr. President, \nas you will remember, last year the debate was fixed very firmly on the \nproposition that one side, the new Republican majority, felt it vitally \nimportant not only to promise a balanced budget at some time in the \nfuture, but to make the very difficult policy decisions that were \nrequired to assure that the budget was, in fact, balanced.\n  We succeeded in doing so. We succeeded in doing so so well that \nduring the entire period of time in which it looked as though this \npromise would be kept, interest rates declined all across the country. \nWhat did that mean? It meant that people buying homes paid less in the \nway of interest on their mortgages and therefore were more likely to be \nable to afford to buy a home or to buy a better home. It meant that \nbusinesses, small and large, paid less in interest and were therefore \nable to increase their productivity and increase the jobs that they had \nto offer and increase the quality and compensation for the jobs which \nthey did offer. In other words, even a binding promise to reach balance \nin the future that was believable had a positive impact on our economy, \nand by the year of balance, 2002, it would have meant at least $1,000 \nper family in the pockets of the average American family.\n  During the entire development of that balanced budget, the other side \nrefused to come up with any alternative that would reach that balance, \nand the struggle was between a group of Republicans who felt it \nabsolutely unethical and immoral to continue to spend money by the \nhundreds of billions of dollars, the bills for which we sent to our \nchildren and grandchildren, and a side led by the President who felt \nthis was not relevant and was unimportant.\n  Beginning in December, however, and culminating with the offer of \nthis Presidential budget, we have had, in fact, at least lip service--\nand I must say that lip service is important to the proposition that a \nbalanced budget is of great help to all Americans by removing some of \nthe burdens of Government from their shoulders, by freeing them up and, \nimplicitly, leaving more of their hard-earned money in their own \npockets.\n  Unfortunately, however, doing that job is more difficult. It is \nharder work than the President of the United States is willing to \nundertake.\n  His dedication to the proposition is welcome. The product itself is \nseriously flawed. As a consequence, that makes even less valid his \ncharacterization of our efforts as being extreme in nature. In fact, \nthe President has never made any real steps in our direction, even when \ncompromises and modifications were made on the part of the Speaker of \nthe House and the majority leader of the Senate and the distinguished \nchairman of our Budget Committee, Senator Domenici.\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n  So we now have a unity with respect to our goals, but a dramatic \ndifference in connection with the way in which those goals are reached. \nWhat we have in this proposal, the amendment that is the subject matter \nbefore the Senate right now, is spending increases in 1997, rather than \na move on a steady path of lowering spending so that we reach a goal on \na gradual but even path between now and the year 2002, 6 years from \ntoday.\n  What we get are a series of mechanisms and gimmicks rather than \nchoices that do require the Congressional Budget Office to show reduced \nspending and reduced deficits, though there is not a single detail as \nto how we get there in the key years right after the turn of the \ncentury.\n  More accurately, if we look at the policy judgments that are \ncontained in this Presidential budget, we see that it has a deficit of \n$84 billion in the year 2002, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Mr. President, $84 billion is not a modest amount of money by \nany stretch of the imagination, just under $100 billion after 6 more \nyears of lip service to a balanced budget and at that--to get to that \nfigure, our one-time savings and assets sales, which is immediately \nafter that year, will have resulted--the budget deficit would increase \nvery, very substantially.\n  So this proposal is a very modest step in the right direction, but it \nis not a balanced budget. It is not a serious attempt to make decisions \nnow that will lead to a balanced budget. It is, in fact, a promise of \nvery difficult choices for the President after next, for the President \nwho is elected not in 1996 but in the year 2000.\n  What are the gimmicks, what are the mechanisms that allow this to be \ndetermined as a balanced budget that are, in fact, no more than \ngimmicks? A discretionary trigger, No. 1; an end to the tax reductions \nthat are called for in the bill, No. 2; outrageous shell games with \nrespect to Medicare, one of the vital social safety nets in our entire \nsociety; welfare reform that is not reform; and a number of other \nsleights of hand.\n\n  Let us go to some of the gimmicks first. This proposal increases \ndomestic discretionary spending for next year, the one year of the \nbudget that is absolutely binding, by $10 billion, so that the \nPresident, during the course of the reelection campaign, can point to a \nwide variety of increases in programs supported by various interest \ngroups and by large numbers of people.\n  Then from 1998 to 2002, there are a significant number of cuts, none \nof which is specified, none of which can be attacked because they are \namorphous. They are simply figures on the wall without any detail to \nback them up.\n  Finally, for the last 2 years, the President calls for increased \ndiscretionary spending, even though the Congressional Budget Office \nsays that the trigger mechanism to balance the budget included in this \nproposal will reduce discretionary spending by $45 billion in the year \n2002 alone. But worse than that--worse than that, Mr. President--as \ngimmicky as it is, is the President's treatment of Medicare. This \nbudget takes one of the most vital elements of Medicare, an element \nthat is now protected by being in the Medicare trust fund, paid for by \nthe payroll taxes that each of us at work pays every single year: Home \nhealth care, not an insubstantial program, Mr. President, which costs \n$55 billion. It is taken out of the trust fund by the President's \nproposal, out of the protection of the trust fund in order that the \nPresident can show that the trust fund stays solvent for a longer \nperiod of time than would otherwise be the case, and transfers it we \nreally know not where.\n  In one sense, this Presidential budget says, ``Well, we're going to \ntransfer home health care to Medicare part B,'' the part that pays for \nphysicians' fees in Medicare, an element of Medicare that is not \ncovered by the trust fund, an element of which about 75 percent is paid \nby general taxes, that is to say, the deficit, and 25 percent by \npremiums paid by the beneficiaries.\n  Medicare part B, of course, is voluntary. It is such a good deal that \nthere is practically no one eligible for it who does not take it when \nyou are only paying 25 percent of its cost. But it is voluntary. So \nhome health care at one level is transferred into part B. But it does \nnot become voluntary, it is still there. It is not subject to any of \nthe copayments that are a part of part B. It is not subject to the 25-\npercent premium cost that part B is subject to otherwise. So, in fact, \nit simply becomes a completely, totally, absolutely unfunded \nentitlement, Mr. President.\n  What does that mean? It means $55 billion a year more in bills \ntransferred to working Americans, out of the trust fund, which they are \nalready paying and--incidentally, those payments are not cut at all--\nsimply into the general fund to be added to the deficit.\n  That does one of three things, Mr. President: either it greatly \nincreases the deficit by that $55 billion, or it will result in a tax \nincrease of $55 billion on the American people, a new tax, or at some \npoint or another, when things get tough, it just will not be paid for \nat all, and it will disappear, home health care will disappear.\n\n  Mr. President, I use the word ``gimmick.'' This does not really get \nappropriately covered by the word ``gimmick.'' This is a fraud. This is \nsomething to which people are entitled now, that is being paid for now, \nthat is in a trust fund now, that suddenly is just hanging out there \nwith a new bill for the American people.\n  There are other gimmicks in the Medicare cuts that are in the \nPresident's budget. The amount of money he claims to save is not saved, \naccording to the scoring of the Congressional Budget Office, what they \ncome up with for it. There are more triggers on the amounts of money \nfor outpatient hospital services. There is a new entitlement program \nfor workers temporarily unemployed, but it sunsets in the year 2000.\n  Taxes on working families, college students, and small businesses \nwill be increased in the year 2001. Payroll taxes will be accelerated \nat that particular period of time, Mr. President. And these really are \ngimmicks. A whole slew of asset sales are pushed into the year 2002 to \nshow a one-time balance with, of course, no balance thereafter.\n  There is a spectrum auction of spectrum for the year 2002, of \nspectrum that will not be returned to the Federal Government until \n2005, even if it is ready to be returned at that particular time. Will \nit get less money than if it were auctioned at the time it is actually \navailable? Obviously those will be lower.\n  So as CBO indicates that they will be $6 billion short, there is just \na contingent $6 billion charge on broadcasters to make up the \ndifference for the year 2002. Governors Island in New York Harbor is \ngoing to be deserted after 1998, but it will not be sold until 2002 so \nthat it can balance the budget in that year. The strategic petroleum \nreserve, the Weeks Island Naval Petroleum Reserve--the same thing, they \nget sold long after we have assumed that they would be sold to balance \nthe budget in that year.\n  In welfare, the President's welfare reform program does not require \nits recipients to be enrolled in Work First until 2003 so that the \npayment for their new education and training management does not begin \nuntil later.\n  So even if you accept all of the gimmicks, all of the tax increases, \nall of the unspecified spending cuts, to get us to balance in 2002, it \nall goes to hell in a hand basket immediately thereafter.\n  Mr. President, I have only begun to list the gimmicks and the \noutrageous transfers of responsibility that are included in this \nproposal. It just is not serious. Successive speakers will speak to \nsome of the circular reasoning that is contained in this proposal. It \nis a proposal that is very comfortable for next year, one in many \nrespects in connection with discretionary spending I wish that I could \nsupport, but one I cannot support when it does not really reform \nentitlements, when it leaves all of the heavy lifting to the President \nafter next, and when it leaves that President after next with a huge \nunfunded liability in the third year of his or her Presidency.\n  As I said to begin these remarks, Mr. President, it is a major step \nforward to have a commitment to a balanced budget on the part of the \nPresident of the United States. But when that commitment is lip service \nonly, when there is no heavy lifting, when there are no serious \nreductions or serious policy changes, we have not even gotten halfway. \nWe should be and we are grateful that we are halfway.\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n  I am grateful that the Senate is actually seriously debating two--no, \nthree before we are done--serious possibilities. I will support two of \nthose possibilities, the bipartisan budget which will come up, I \nsuspect tomorrow, and the Republican one because, while they take a \nslightly different path, they both deal seriously with the problem of \nbalancing the budget. They have a real balanced budget. They have \npolicy decisions that will affect the years not directly covered by \nthis budget as well as those that are covered by it. I regret to say \nthat the proposal that we have before us this minute does none of those \nthings. Lipservice, Mr. President, is not enough. Action is required.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are hearing repeatedly today what we \nheard from the Republican side of the aisle yesterday--every time it is \nsaid I intend to correct it--and that is that the President's budget is \nnot in balance.\n  As I said in my opening remarks yesterday, and in my opening remarks \nthis morning, contrary to the statements that are being made from that \nside of the aisle, the President's budget is certified to be in balance \nby the Congressional Budget Office. Lest we forget what that is, the \nCongressional Budget Office is run and managed by a Republican \nappointee whom I supported to be the head of that organization.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, whether run by a Democrat or \nRepublican, has always been considered to be about as fair as you can \nget with regard to certifying numbers.\n  I quote once again, as I did yesterday--and I will keep quoting it \ntoday every time somebody on that side of the aisle says that the \nPresident's budget is not balanced--and that is this quote from the \nCongressional Budget Office headed by June O'Neill.\n\n       The President's budget proposes policies that the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates would balance the \n     budget by the year 2002.\n\n  Yet that side of the aisle keeps saying, ``It does not. It does not. \nIt does not.'' I am not going to get into ``You said that, she said \nthat, he said that.'' But their claims are fundamentally wrong and they \ndo not not contribute to a legitimate debate on the budget when they \nkeep saying, ``the President's budget doesn't balance.''\n  Likewise, I would say, that the Congressional Budget Office has said \nthat the Republican budget proposal introduced by Chairman Domenici \nyesterday does balance. There are several things that I could pick \napart on that. There are several things that I could get up and say, \n``I don't agree with CBO. I think that the Republican budget does not \nbalance in the year 2002 for this reason, for that reason, for the \ngimmicks that are included in their budget.''\n  But it seems to me that when I take that kind of an argument, I am \nundermining the basic context that I think is important; that is, that \nCBO has certified that in their best judgment and by their best \nestimates both the President's budget, that I have just offered, and \nthe Republican budget offered yesterday by Chairman Domenici, have been \ncertified to by CBO as balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  Now, I do not think we accomplished very much since both of the basic \nbudgets that we are arguing about here have been certified by CBO. Last \nyear, I repeat again, the Republicans hounded the President, hounded \nthe Democrats and challenged the President to come forth with a budget \nthat could be certified to as being balanced by the year 2002 by the \nCongressional Budget Office. Now that it has been done, as I said \nyesterday, they are moving the goal posts once again.\n  I think we can have legitimate debate on what are the rights and what \nare the wrongs in both the President's budget and, the Republican \nbudget. I admitted and conceded in my opening remarks this morning, \nthat there are some parts of the President's budget that I do not agree \nwith. I think we accomplish very little by getting up on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, as Republicans did yesterday and as they are starting \nout to do today, to say the President's budget is not balanced. Says \nwho? Says the Republican majority. The Republican majority is a \npartisan referee and therefore their claims should not be considered as \nauthentic with regard to whose budget balances best and in what \ntimeframe.\n  As I say, I think there are many policy problems with the Republican \nbudget, and I think there are policy problems with the President's \nbudget. I suggest we could expedite the proceedings and come to more \nintelligent debate if we stop saying this budget does not balance and \nthat budget does not balance, and agree, if we can, that the CBO has \ncertified both the Republican budget and the President's budget that I \nhave just introduced as being balanced by the year 2002. If we are \ngoing to go down that road, we are just going to be throwing stones at \neach other's budget without getting to the specifics of what we would \nlike to see done.\n  Once again, to bring that point home, I want to talk for just a \nmoment about the Medicare part A and B trust funds that have become \nfocal in the debate, and justifiably so. Once again, I am going to \nintroduce for the Record and read a very short letter from June \nO'Neill, the Republican-appointed Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. The letter is dated May 9, 1996:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has examined the effects of the Administration's \n     budgetary proposals on the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust \n     fund. Under current law, the HI trust fund is projected to \n     become insolvent in 2001. CBO estimates that the \n     Administration's proposals would postpone this date to 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from Washington, he seems \nto assert that the home health care part of the budget would be safer \nin Medicaid part A than it would be in Medicaid part B. I find this \nassociation somewhat ironic in view of the fact there is no place in \nthe entire Republican budget where the majority seeks to find more \nsavings, or, placed in a better context, there is no place where \nreductions from real needs have been more savaged by the Republicans \nthan in Medicare part A. Yet, the majority wants to reduce $123 billion \nfrom protected Medicare part A spending. If that is what they do to \nprograms that they claim are safe, I hate to see what they would do to \nprograms they dislike.\n  What I am saying is the sound and fury from the other side with the \nPresident's shift in home health care--he is shifting it into an area \nthat would make it safer. The President is taking and transferring this \nout of the part of the budget that the Republicans are savaging with \ncuts that would be far below real needs.\n  Once again, I am not sure we are talking about apples and apples and \napples and oranges here. Suffice it to say, I think so far the attack \non the President's budget, while, once again, I say is not perfect in \nmy eye, is not honest and straightforward. I think some of their \narguments are somewhat suspect.\n  Mr. President, one more quote, again from my remarks of yesterday, \nthat are found on page 203 of the committee report:\n\n       The Republican budget is rife with gimmicks. The tax cuts \n     mysteriously drop off from $23 billion to $16 billion by the \n     year 2002. The Republicans count on savings towards balancing \n     the budget from spending cuts that they already used in the \n     Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. They similarly count twice the \n     savings in housing. Without these gimmicks, the Republican \n     budget would not be in balance.\n\n  I only cite that, Mr. President, to say this Senator, too, could be \ncharged with trying to undermine the Republican budget. The term \n``gimmicks'' in the President's budget was used by my friend and \ncolleague from Washington in remarks just concluded. This Senator used \nthe term ``gimmicks'' yesterday explaining shortcomings that I see in \nthe Republican budget.\n  I do not believe that either of us should keep hounding the other \nside on gimmicks because the facts of the matter are, there are lots of \nthings in the President's budget and there are lots of things in the \nRepublican budget that could be deemed as gimmicks. Those of us who \ncall parts of the Republican budget gimmicks and, likewise, when the \nRepublicans call parts of the President's budget gimmicks, we are \nvoicing\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nan opinion. Only time will tell whether it is true or not.\n  While I have attacked parts of the Republican budget as gimmicks, I \nsay in the end what we should all do is recognize and realize that \ngimmicks or no gimmicks, the Congressional Budget Office, which we all \nrecognize as a legitimate referee, has certified that, in their \nopinion, both budgets reach balance by the year 2002. And I suspect, \nbecause I respect the professionalism of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, that they are not necessarily blind-sided by what the Senator \nfrom Nebraska calls gimmicks in the Republican proposal, or likewise, \nwhen the Republicans charge that parts of the President's budget has \ngimmicks in it.\n\n  So, gimmicks or no gimmicks, I think we should get on with the debate \nby recognizing that while there is legitimate criticism in order to \nboth of the budget proposals, I hope that we can get off the kick of \nsaying it over and over again that the President's budget does not \nbalance and that the Republican budget does not balance. We can say \nthat, but I think it contributes not a great deal to the legitimate \ndiscussion, since it is a moot point.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that both budgets are \nbalanced. I think there is plenty of room for debate on changes that \nshould be made to improve the two budgets. But let us, hopefully, agree \nthat we are talking about two budgets that do meet balance by the year \n2002, and that should not be a key part of the debate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington. Let me \nsay, I am going to agree with----\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator will withhold for a minute so we can talk \nabout time here, a lot of people have asked me when we are going to \nvote. I simply say--and I have not had a report from the Senator yet \nthis morning--that we have about 34 amendments that Democrats are \nintending to offer. We asked last night that they try and advise us, \nand your side advise you, what amendments we have. We are trying to \ncomplete this effort by tomorrow night. We are certainly going to have \nto have some discipline somewhere along the line to get that done.\n  I would like to ask, first, about how many amendments do you see on \nyour side, or do you know about at the present time? When we have that, \nwe will add that to the 34 that we have here and multiply that out by \nthe number of hours that each one of those amendments are entitled to. \nThen we will begin to see the difficult task we are going to have by \ntrying to finish this by tomorrow night.\n  The second question I want to ask to move this debate along is this. \nLast night, Senators on both sides suggested that we put off this \ndebate until this morning and not have a vote before noon. I am \nwondering if we could possibly get an agreement that we would try and \nbalance out time so that we could have a vote in the vicinity of noon \ntoday on this matter. Is that a feasible proposal? Does the Senator \nthink that might move things along?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nebraska has me at a certain \ndisadvantage. As he knows, I am sitting in for the chairman of the \nBudget Committee this morning. I cannot give him definitive answers to \neither of his questions. I can say, however, that I have no \nanticipation that we would vote before noon. I am sure we can \ninformally divide the time between now and noon and give Members \nassurance we will not vote before then. It may be that it is after noon \nbefore we get to do so.\n  As was the case with the Senator from Nebraska, our chairman asked \nRepublican Members to report to him on all the amendments they would \nhave by noon today. Well, it is still an hour and a half from noon. We \nhave only a relative handful.\n  Mr. EXON. That is a good sign.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is certainly a good sign. We will be able to answer \nhis question, of course, more definitively in a relatively short period \nof time. I think that, on an informal basis, we can agree to simply go \nback and forth. We have yielded time to the Senator from Missouri. I \nsee the Senator from South Carolina. It would be appropriate for him to \ngo next, and then back and forth for a period of time, at least.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator. That helps answer some of the \nquestions. Let us move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe.) The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I assume that did not count against my 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It did not.\n  Mr. BOND. If we can start afresh, let me thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Washington and warn my good friend from Nebraska that I \nam going to agree with him. I know that maybe this will help the \nprocess move along. But we have before us the President's budget. This \nis a massive work that would cost about a hundred dollars if you want \nto buy it. It has the numbers in here that the President proposes.\n  Mr. President, in one sense, the Senator from Washington is right. \nThe numbers here do not balance. The numbers in the book do not come to \nbalance. Now, the President has done something in this budget. You have \nto look at the supplement to see what he has done. He said, if it does \nnot work, I have a trigger. On page 13, it says, ``In case the new \nassumptions produce a deficit in 2002, the President's budget proposes \nan immediate adjustment to the annual limit, or caps on discretionary \nspending, lowering them enough to reach balance in 2002.''\n  I agree with the Senator from Nebraska. When you impose those caps, \nthe President's budget does come to balance in 2002. I am not going to \ncall that automatic cut a gimmick, or that trigger a gimmick. Let us \njust take it for what it does. The President has presented a budget, \nand he said if it does not balance, you take a whack at it. Well, that \nwhack is a $16 billion tax increase on families in the year 2002. It is \na $67 billion cut in spending, 10 percent in 2001 and 18 percent in \n2002.\n  So when you take a look at all these numbers, remember that these \nnumbers do not balance. You have to apply the trigger. You have to \nshoot that budget down to get it to balance. I am going to show you \nwhat that does to some of these discretionary spending programs. I hope \nthat my colleagues, before they vote on the President's budget, will \nunderstand the impact of these cuts triggered because the President \nclaims he wants to get to a balanced budget.\n  Now, that may sound kind of complicated. Let me reduce it to common, \neveryday terms. It is as if you went to the grocery store and you \nfilled up your basket; you gathered all the things you needed and all \nthe things you wanted. You took it to the checkout counter, and the \nclerk ran it up at the checkout counter, and all those bar scanner \ncodes recorded the numbers. At the end, the bill comes out to be $100. \nYou look in your wallet and you say, ``Whoops, I only have $80.'' You \nhave $100 worth of wishes and wants, but you only have $80. So you are \ngoing to have to start putting some things back. So you put $20 worth \nof stuff back, and you pay your $80 and take the goods home.\n  Well, when we talk about the budget that the President proposes, let \nus talk about that $80 that he is actually going to spend. Do not be \nmisled if somebody talks about the $100 he wants. Do not be misled \nabout the tax cuts because there is going to be a $16 billion increase \nfor individuals and families. There will be a $16 billion tax increase \nfor families in 2002 because, unless you do that, these numbers do not \nadd up.\n  Mr. President, the point I made yesterday and the day before is that \nnumbers do not lie. Let us take a look at the numbers.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we take a look at some of \nthe vital impacts on health and children in this. I mentioned yesterday \nthe Food and Drug Administration. The budget we have before us reported \nout of the Senate Budget Committee essentially keeps funding for the \nFood and Drug Administration on an even keel. The Food and Drug \nAdministration is vitally important because its diverse \nresponsibilities include licensing blood banks, monitoring clinical \ninvestigations, reviewing and approving prescription drugs, generic \ndrugs, animal drugs, vaccines, biologicals, medical devices, and food \nadditives. The FDA ensures the quality of a trillion dollars\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nworth of products. This year it proposes to certify over 10,000 \nmammography facilities across the country--vital to the health and \nwell-being of our country.\n  What happens when the President applies that trigger, those caps, \nthose cuts to the FDA? Look at this red line that shows the dramatic \nreduction in funding for the FDA from almost $900 million to under $700 \nmillion in 2001 only coming up above $700 million in 2002. This is a \ntremendous cut in the vitally important activities of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  I mentioned yesterday the National Institutes of Health looking for \nnew cures, new ways of dealing with the diseases. The President has a \nnice little blip up here. But when he gets over to get to balance and \nyou apply the trigger, you take the cuts, you take the whacks, that \nfunding drops off the map. It goes from almost $12.5 billion to below \n$11 billion, $1.5 billion cut year to year from 2,000 to 2002--$1.5 \nbillion.\n  Are we going to have all the answers to health and well-being? Are we \ngoing to still need the National Institutes of Health? I think so. We \ncannot afford the cuts that the President proposed. We are dealing with \nreal numbers.\n  This is what would happen, if you believed the President and if you \nbelieved this budget will get to balance.\n  Child care and development block grant. I was very pleased to work \nwith my colleague from Connecticut on the act for better child care. We \nturned it into a development block grant because we recognized the \nimportance of assisting working families with care for their children. \nThe President has a little upswing this year. This is an election year, \nof course. But then look what happens. From over $1 billion, about $1.5 \nbillion, this thing drops off the cliff to about $800 million in the \nyear 2002--almost a $250 million cut in child care because of the \nPresident's trigger.\n\n  Do we really want to say to people who are trying to get off welfare, \n``Hey. Get off welfare this year. We are going to assist you with your \nchild care expenses. But sorry about the ensuing years. There is not \ngoing to be the money there.''\n  That is what the President's budget does. That is if you implement \nthe mechanism the Senator from Nebraska rightly pointed out is in the \nPresident's budget. That is how it gets to a balance.\n  WIC, funding for women, infants, and children. We both support this \nat least in the early years. The President's line goes up. The \nRepublican line goes up. But, whoops. The President had said he wants \nto balance the budget. So you fire the gun, you put on the cap, you \npull the trigger, and what happens to funding for women, infants, and \nchildren? It goes, in his budget, from over $4.2 billion down to about \n$3.7 billion.\n  This is a significant cut. If you believe and advocate and want to \nstand up for the President's budget, you have to be willing to say, \n``Hey. We are going to get to balance in the year 2002 by taking this \nmuch of a whack out of the feeding program for women, infants, and \nchildren.''\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that is going to happen. That is not \na realistic budget. But the President is standing by that budget. \nAnybody who votes for it says, ``I am voting for it. I believe in it.'' \nIf you vote for the President's budget, then, Mr. President, you have \nto be saying, ``I believe these numbers, and I will support these \nnumbers.''\n  I have talked a good deal about the Veterans' Administration because \nthat happens to be one of the vital functions that is funded in the \nappropriations subcommittee which I chair. The Veterans' Administration \nbudget has been very contentious. Last year we had a floor amendment, \nan amendment sponsored by the Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, and Senators Mikulski, Leahy, and Wellstone.\n  They said, if we kept an even spending level, we would have to close \nfour veterans hospitals. The Republican budget has even funding. This \ncuts almost $13 billion--25 percent. That means that one out of four \nfacilities, or more, in the United States would have to be closed. Here \nare the States with veterans facilities. Florida has 6, Massachusetts \nhas 5, New York has 13, and California has 11. One out of four--that \nmeans California is going to have three, four, or five closed. The \nSenator from California [Mrs. Boxer] was complaining that we did not \nopen a hospital last year. The question is, Which of these is going to \nbe cut?\n\n  Mr. President, the budget provided by the President is not workable. \nThose numbers do not lie.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield such time as is required for the \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Missouri talks about \nassumptions. With respect to assumptions, I only have to point out that \nwhen I asked the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici from New Mexico, about the budget assumptions, he \nsaid, ``No. That is no magic asterisk. Assumptions are not binding on \nanyone. Use the assumptions in the President's budget. Do what you want \nto be bound by it. It does not make any difference.''\n  With respect to the trigger, I remember that trigger when they had it \nlast year in the Republican Medicare assault. Unfortunately, the \ndistinguished President of the United States, coming from Arkansas, \nhaving balanced budgets for 10 years, had taken on some of the bad \nhabits of this Republican crowd.\n  Right to the point, Mr. President: I was listening this morning to \nthe chatter on the early morning shows, and the pundits were all \nallowing that the distinguished Senator from Kansas was having to \nretire from the Senate because he wanted to get away from the Senate \nitself; that the Senate had such a bad reputation.\n  I take exception to that, Mr. President. It is the Republican program \nthat has such a bad reputation. I feel for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas as the Republican nominee going around the country because, \nthough he physically removes himself, he still has to carry that load. \nI told him so yesterday afternoon.\n  It is a ridiculous contract. Get rid of plans that are working and \nthe programs on crime. The policemen on the beat; they were all here \nyesterday in support of those programs.\n  That is what is really frightening the American people. It is a \nridiculous plan: let us get rid of the Department of Commerce, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Department of Housing, the Department of \nEducation. Whoever heard of being elected to public office and then \ntrying to tear down the office itself? We are elected to come to \nWashington to make the Government work. But this pollster party is \nrunning on hot button items like 5-cent gas taxes and that kind of \nthing, trying to throw the long pass play. They are not really giving \nthe American people a program of responsibility and direction, a sense \nof where we are headed in the next 4 years. The truth of the matter is \nthat the wrong man resigned from the Congress. We ought to have gotten \nthe distinguished Speaker to be gone with that silly contract. Let him \nmove out and maybe the pollster party would have a chance in November.\n\n  But my point this morning is that yes, I am going to vote for the \nPresident's budget. It is the nearest to a factual approach to this \nparticular dilemma. It does not use the CPI. It does not have these \nmammoth tax cuts that are down to $8 billion. We do not have any taxes \nto cut.\n  That is another flaw in the contract, it leads the American people to \nbelieve that you can balance this budget by merely cutting spending. I \nhave voted for many, many cuts in spending. I voted, as did a third of \nthe Senate, to do away with a good part of the payroll tax--$190 \nbillion in tax cuts to put Social Security on a pay-as-you-go basis. \nBut I do not believe in cutting taxes when we are running these \nhorrendous deficits, when the debt is going up and the interest cost on \nthe debt ruining the land. And so what I am trying to do is get the \nnearest as I can. We tried every approach. In January 1993, we put in \nwhat would be required of a really true, honest balanced budget. It \nincluded both the horrendous cuts that would be necessary in \ndiscretionary spending and taxes. I challenge and continue to \nchallenge. At the Commerce Committee the other day, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas said that she believed the budget could be\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nbalanced by spending cuts. I challenge her. I challenge anyone in the \nCongress to give me a 7-year balanced budget without a tax increase. I \nwant to see it. You can eliminate the Government as they call it, but \nwe have worked our way into such a dilemma that, if you did away with \nGovernment as the people know it to be--foreign aid, the Department of \nCommerce, Interior, Agriculture, Justice Department, the FBI, the DEA, \ndo away with the President, the Congress, the courts--it would still \nonly be $228 billion.\n  Now, look at the bottom line, what are we spending? This pollster \nparty has got us to the point that we are required to spend $353 \nbillion in interest costs on a national debt that they quintupled. They \ndid it, not President Clinton--$353 billion, $1 billion a day spending \non automatic pilot for absolutely no Government. We do not get anything \nfor it. It is merely the carrying charges. If they had not engaged in \nthat misconduct, we could have two Departments of Commerce, two \nDepartments of Energy, two Departments of Education--double the \nGovernment. We are spending the money for it, but we are not getting \nthe Government.\n  And that is this particular Senator's dilemma. We are supposed to be \nrebuilding our economy in the wake of the cold war, putting more into \neducation, more into technology, more into the Department of Commerce. \nInstead the Republicans pursue their political endeavors solely for \nreelection purposes. They are not looking at the next generation but at \nthe next election. And we have to go through this false nonsense of a \nbudget fraud because it is their contract.\n  Unfortunately, we Democrats, to get any kind of results, have to go \nalong with this kind of thing. President Clinton put out a good budget \nwhen he first came. We had to cut $500 billion in spending. We had to \nincrease taxes on cigarettes, beer, liquor, gasoline. Yes, we voted to \nincrease taxes on Social Security, we performed a real act of fiscal \ndiscipline and responsibility without a single Republican vote in the \nSenate, without a single Republican vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. And they have the audacity, the unmitigated gall to \ncome around here talking about hoaxes.\n  Let me get everybody to turn to pages 4 and 5 of this wonderful \ndocument, Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for the Committee on the Budget. This \nis the budget resolution now in debate. Look on pages 4 and 5 under \n``Deficits.'' For fiscal year 2002 you will see a deficit of \n$108,300,000,000.\n  Mr. President, for Heaven's sake, you pick up the morning paper, the \nWashington Post, and it is talking about the ``Republican Balanced \nBudget Proposal.'' There is no idea of balancing this budget by \nRepublicans or Democrats. It is one big political exercise, one grand \nbudget fraud. And that is what everybody is running on. I am trying to \nget them to state what the law is and what the truth is.\n  The fact is here in the budget book itself: ``Budget Process Law \nAnnotated,'' up to date, 1993 edition. You will find in this book no \nsuch word as ``unified.'' That is a political gimmick that the press, \nthe money market in New York and politicians use. We have to hear about \nfraud; we have to hear about hoaxes; we have to hear about trickery, \nbut the truth of the matter is there is no such thing as unified. There \nis such a thing as not being able to rob the Social Security trust \nfund. Look at it. Section 13301 of this particular document says thou \nshalt not use the Social Security funds to obscure the size of the \ndeficit. We owe Social Security at this moment $503 billion, and in \nthis particular budget that I hold up, this document here, they \ncontinue to rob the Social Security trust fund in violation of the law. \nThey are robbing other trust funds as well that are not written in the \nlaw. I wish they were. But we continue to rob the Social Security trust \nfund of approximately $500 billion over a 6-year period and over $600 \nbillion over 7 years. So that by the year 2002, 2003, we come around, \nunder this political drama--the best off-Broadway show you are going to \nfind, running currently on C-SPAN--and they will say, ``Oh, we have \nbalanced the budget. We are the party of responsibility and we balanced \nthe budget.''\n\n  Even if it were true, using their own figures we have decimated--\ndecimated, exhausted the Social Security trust fund. We will owe it \nover $1.1 trillion. Then we will not have to hear the arguments about \nthe year 2012 or 2023--just by that year 2002 we will already owe that \nmoney. Who is going to raise $1 trillion to make Social Security \nsolvent? You should have heard it--I wish I had that record before me--\nthe distinguished chairman of our Budget Committee in his prepared \nstatement stated: We are making Medicare solvent for 10 years. Under \nthis budget we are making Medicare solvent for 10 years; we are making \nSocial Security totally insolvent in 6 years. It will be totally \ninsolvent in 6 years. And they want credit for their so-called fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Unfortunately, both sides are guilty. Why? Why do I say that about \nthis budget fraud? I have not seen a budget yet that does not \nimmediately start off by moving deficits--not eliminating deficits--\nmoving them from the general Government over to the Social Security \ntrust fund to the tune of $500 billion. The Republican budget does it. \nThe President's budget does it. And the so-called centrist coalition \ndoes.\n  They think it is wonderful they can get together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, in a fraud. I did not join them. I told them: It is a fraud \non the face of it. You can see it. You know it. Look at it. You are not \nonly robbing trust funds to the tune of what will amount to almost $1 \ntrillion, but we owe the civil service retirement, the military \nretirees.\n  You go down the list. Medicare is solvent right now. They have been \nrobbing the Medicare trust fund and on down the line to highway trust \nfunds. Finally, over on the House side, they have been robbing the \nairport funding. There are not enough inspectors. We just had a hearing \non that. Why? Because we have been taking the money that the traveling \npublic has been putting in. While they have been paying their taxes in \norder to provide those inspectors, Congress has been using the moneys \nto politically obscure the size of the deficit. This way they can say, \n``Reelect me, I am fiscally responsible up there in Washington but the \nother crowd is a bunch of bums.''\n  They know what they are doing. Not only do they rob trust funds, but \nall of their spending cuts are backloaded. There is the gimmick. That \nis why, when President Reagan first came to office, he said he was \ngoing to balance the budget in 1 year. After he got here he said it was \nsuch a disaster that it would take him 3 years. When Congress saw that \nwas not working with the so-called Reaganomics, that we were going in \nthe exact opposite direction, we tried the spending cut approach with \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. But all along, then after Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings--and I'm talking about the crowd that voted to repeal it on \nOctober 19 at 12:41 a.m--they are now all writing books now how \nresponsible and how against deficits they were. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nworked. The reason the Senator from South Carolina asked for a divorce \nis that instead of using Gramm-Rudman-Hollings as a spear to prod \nfiscal responsibility, they were using it as a shield to obscure fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  When they started doing that, I said let me out of this thing. We \nraised the point of order, made cuts across the board. And Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings worked. Do not say it did not work. It was about to \nwork too well, until they got into that cabal to reelect the President \nin 1992. Everybody knows what happened there, in 1990, when they voted \nfor its repeal. But they all, then, started backloading. Now, instead \nof 5 years of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we are going up to a 7-year \nbudget. If this crowd can get reelected they will come back next year \nand they will have a 10-year budget. They keep moving the goalposts and \ngetting the good government award.\n  The fact of the matter is, two-thirds of these cuts occur after two \nPresidential elections. They come out here and talk about the \nPresident--a hoax. But it is not a hoax--come on. Everybody can see \nwhat is going on. Every one of them, including the centrist budget, \nuses tax cuts.\n  If you look at the centrist document, the centrist document says the \nPresident cuts $8 billion in 6 years. The Republicans cut $122 billion, \nthe Breaux-Chafee in 7 years cuts $105 billion. We\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\ndo not have any taxes to cut. So the closest to responsibility is \nPresident Clinton's budget. They are running around still trying to \nlead rather than demand. The consultants will demand. Poor Presidential \nnominee Dole will have to respond, run all over the land trying to tell \npeople that which he knows not to be the case. He was chairman of the \nFinance Committee. He did not favor that Reaganomics. It was Kemp-Roth \nat that time. I know him, but now he is caught up with the Gingrich \ncontract and he has to go around and sell it. That is his dilemma, not \nthe Senate as a body. They will be here long after we are gone, long \nafter the contract crowd is gone.\n  Mr. President, we finally see the free world voting in free \nelections. We witness the spread of, not only capitalism, but \ndemocratic representative government; which is, according to Arthur \nSchlesinger, the greatest gift of the American people to free men the \nworld around. And it has taken root, Mr. President, in 14 different \ncountries. Over in Russia now, the Communists are getting ready for a \nvote. Over in China, where I recently traveled with the distinguished \nSenator from Maine, Senator Cohen, in the provinces they are beginning \nto have local elections. Now, when free democratic government is just \ntaking root, the contract crowd says, ``Get rid of the Government. The \nGovernment is not the solution, the Government is the problem. The \nGovernment is the enemy.'' And they wonder why they are down in the \npolls.\n  Back to the point: tax cuts. They talk about a dividend. I speak as \nthe former chairman of the Budget Committee. I speak as an original \nmover, along with Senator Muskie. I am the last of the Mohicans on the \nHouse or the Senate side who was in on the game back in the mid-1970's. \nI voted for a balanced budget in 1968. I worked there with George \nMahon. We said, ``Talk to President Johnson. Can we cut another $5 \nbillion?'' We cut another $5 billion. The entire Great Society and the \ncost of the war in Vietnam was $178 billion. Interest costs on the \nnational debt is $353--double the amount. And you wonder at the trouble \nwe are in? They do not want to talk sense. They want to engage in \nanother fraud. A $254 billion dividend. That came up in 1990.\n  We called it into question. They say, ``Oh, no, you look at the 1990 \nbudget.'' They have their charts and everything else. The 1990 budget \nsaid that by 1995, last year, we would not only be balanced we would \nhave a $20 billion surplus. Can you imagine the word surplus in a \nGovernment document? They put it in there.\n  Instead, the real deficit was in the neighborhood of $277 billion. \nThere was not any surplus--using the dividend. So they play more games. \nNow the centrist coalition crowd has come up with a new one, the CPI. \nThey come in and want to monkey around with the Consumer Price Index.\n  So if you do one, you have to do the other, but they only do one. \nThey are not only going to cut the benefits of the Social Security \nrecipient, which could be done--this Senator has recommended a freeze, \na freeze, if you please. But instead of inuring to the benefit of the \nSocial Security trust fund, they take even more money, robbing Social \nSecurity and allocating it to the deficit. All the Medicare plans call \nfor an increase in the premiums in order to get the benefits. Then they \ncome around with this lower CPI and give them less money. A double \nwhammy.\n  They are doing it. But it is a political year and the media is \nsupposed to cover Congress and give the American people the truth. And \nwhat is the headline? ``Balanced Budget.'' A balanced budget, come on. \nThere is not any balance in the budget before us, and they know it.\n  For Heaven's sake, deliver me from this characterization of the \nPresident's character. A hoax. The pollster says they have to attack \nPresident Clinton on his character. So every 10 seconds the Republicans \nget up: ``Hoax,'' ``Character.'' One Senator even said, ``Liar.'' \n``We'll just get in on a true-false quiz in November, and we are the \ntruth and the Democratic Party is false.''\n  I do not think the American people are going along with that \nnonsense. Deliver me from that, particularly when they are the ones \nengaged, with the misrepresentation. That is the nicest word I can \nthink.\n  Yesterday, May 15, 1996, I heard it again in the Budget Committee. \nThis is a statement by the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee:\n\n       This budget will restore America's fiscal equilibrium. It \n     will balance the budget by the year 2002 without touching \n     Social Security.\n\n  Absolutely false. He said that in the Budget Committee. I called his \nhand on it, but they continue to insist on it and the news media will \nwrite it. It touches Social Security. The best rationale the chairman \ncan give is, ``We didn't cut, momentarily, the benefits.'' But he means \nthe benefits for me at 72--old Strom and I are going to get ours. But \nthat Parliamentarian is not going to get his money. And I have to ask \nthe Parliamentarian if this really is a budget resolution. Because \nsection (C) where they have in there a provision for tax cuts in \nSeptember, will actually increase the deficit.\n  But the truth of the matter is, Mr. President, they not only touch \nit, they emasculate the fund. I made that clear. Do not come along and \nsay ``without touching Social Security.'' They know what they are \ndoing.\n  We have had a group of off-the-record sessions to try to get together \non the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I favor such an \namendment, and said I would vote for it in a flash. I voted for it \nbefore. But I am not going to vote by repealing section 13301. The \nproposal has been made time and again, ``Well, let's just use up Social \nSecurity until 2002 and stop using it.''\n  I remember when I had Clement Haynesworth before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt--he had been charged with using his office in conflict with the \nstock investments that he had. They said that under the law, he should \nhave recused himself. One day, unbeknownst to me and Attorney General \nMitchell, he came and said, irrespective of what occurred, he was going \nto take all these stock holdings and put them in a trust fund.\n  The next morning, Herblock had that cartoon with the Congress as the \ncourt. The Attorney General is the lawyer and a little client who \nlooked like a school boy with a school bag with stock tape and tickets \nstreaming out on the floor. ``But Your Honor,'' said Mitchell, the \nAttorney General, ``my client hasn't done anything wrong, and he \npromises to stop doing it.''\n  No, they have not done anything wrong--``We do not touch Social \nSecurity''--they just take Social Security to mask the deficit. \nGovernment is borrowing from itself and writing IOU's from $503 billion \nto $1.1 trillion. But they promise to stop doing it in 2002. By that \ntime, who is going to put on the taxes to pay back $1.1 trillion?\n\n  The New York crowd keeps talking about entitlements, entitlements, \nentitlements. In Time magazine and other major papers, they say: ``The \ntrouble is, we have to get a bridle on this Social Security causing the \ndeficits.'' Social Security has not caused a deficit. It is in the \nblack. Every one of the 100 Senators would have to agree with that.\n  What is causing the deficit, I say to the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, is all these general uses of Government, from defense to \neducation to housing to foreign aid to law enforcement. I happen to \nhandle the law enforcement budget. Everybody is for more policemen on \nthe beat, everybody is for more FBI, more DEA, more Border Patrol, more \nimmigration control, more this, more that. In 1987, it was just at $4 \nbillion. Now it is at $16.7 billion. They are complaining about the \ngrowth of Government, saying ``cut spending, cut spending.'' Do you \nthink they ever recommended a dime to pay for it all the programs they \ndemand? No.\n  I joined with Republicans back in 1987. We saw the dilemma. We put in \na value-added tax of 5 percent to get rid of this monster deficit \ngrowing and growing, the interest costs growing up to where we cannot \nhave Government.\n  But that is the effect of pollster politics. The pollster party says, \n``Get rid of the Government.'' They succeed. If we do not have a \nDepartment of Commerce, they are happy. If we do not have a Department \nof Education, they are enthralled. If we can get rid of the Department \nof Energy and Department of Housing and just leave them all on the \nstreets, so be it; let the market forces operate.\n  That is why they are down in the polls, and leaving this august body\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\ndoes not release the distinguished Senator from Kansas from that silly \ncontract of getting rid of the Government. That is what he has try and \nsell today as he goes around in Chicago. The contract is frightening \nthe American people.\n  At least he had the excuse of trying to keep us organized here in \nthis particular body. Now he has to sit back and listen on the hot line \nto Speaker Gingrich saying, ``Wait a minute, you've got to stick with \nthe contract, stick with the contract.''\n  All this chatter. Meanwhile we face the largest deficit in the \nhistory of the Republic.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nJanuary 1, 1995, by Judy Mann in the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist on tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next five \n     years by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the \n     expansion of the earned income tax credit to more working \n     poor families, the net increase comes to $240.4 billion in \n     1993. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, \n     by comparison, increased taxes by a net of $217.5 billion \n     over five years. Nominally, then, it is true that the 1993 \n     tax bill was the biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that a tax increase of, \n     say, $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that makes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increased over the decade, which means that \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the biggest, and when you account for \n     population and GDP, it gets even smaller.''\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     president are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     see the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performance as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n\n  (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       A dollar now is less than a dollar was back then--\n\n  Talking in the eighties under President Reagan.\n\n     so that a tax increase of, say, $10 billion in 1992 would be \n     a tax increase of $15 billion now. . . In fact, if you \n     adjusted for the 48 percent change in price level, the 1982 \n     tax increase would become a $325.6 billion increase in 1993. \n     That makes it the biggest tax increase in the history by $85 \n     billion. Nominally then, it is true that the 1993 tax bill \n     was the biggest in history. However, the biggest tax increase \n     in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under President \n     Reagan.\n\n  And the Senator from South Carolina voted for it.\n  I voted against Reaganomics. Senator Dole was against it in the \noriginal instance. The then-majority leader Howard Baker called it ``a \nriverboat gamble.'' Then-Vice President Bush called it voodoo. But they \nwant to forget that. Read Warren Rudman's book. He lays it all out. A \nsubstantial group of Republicans said this could not possibly work.\n  But I ask, Mr. President, to include in the Record the budget tables. \nIf you look at the budget tables, back when President Reagan came into \noffice, the key figure is the Gross Interest Cost, which at that time \nwas $74.8 billion. Today it is $353 billion. This crowd is against \nincreasing spending--I'm against spending increases; I'm against \nspending increases. We have put spending increases on automatic pilot \nto the tune of $1 billion a day. I ask unanimous consent that those \ntables be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Beginning in 1962, CBO's 1995       \n  Economic and Budget Outlook.                                                                                  \n\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If any Members want to, they can get the entire record \nof each one of the particular Presidents. What happened is--let me \nquote David Stockman:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax-cutting that shattered the \n     nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal \n     governance, and their own culpability in it, ever since. \n     Instead, they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of anti-tax venom, while pretending \n     that economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit.\n\n  So they have given the Senator from Kansas the chant, ``Growth, \ngrowth; tax cuts, tax cuts; growth, growth; tax cuts.'' Will we ever \nlearn?\n  The debt from the beginning--from 1776 up until 1981--the debt was \nless than $1 trillion. With all the wars, the Revolution, 1812, Civil \nWar, Spanish-American, Mexican War, World War I, II, Korea, Vietnam, \nthe costs of all the wars were less than $1 trillion--$903 billion. \nNow, in 15 years, without a war--without a war, because the other crowd \nare supposed to have paid for the gulf war--in 15 years, we have gone \nup to $5 trillion and automatic tax increases, because that is what the \nautomatic spending of interest costs amounts to.\n  You cannot evade death, you cannot evade taxes, and you cannot evade \ninterest costs or interest taxes on the national debt. So those who say \nthat ``I am against increasing taxes,'' is the crowd that comes in here \nwithout shame and derides President Clinton and this particular budget.\n  President Clinton came to town, and he is the only President to \nreduce the deficit. Since 1968, President Nixon did not. President \nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, and President Bush all \nincreased the deficit. The one man in town not responsible for this \nnonsense, President Clinton, the only man in town that has done \nanything about it, has reduced the deficit in half, and is derided now \nwith all these monkeyshine charts. ``Look at how he said this. Look how \nhe did this. Look how he did that.''\n  The economy is working, is it not? Unemployment is down. Job creation \nis up. Interest is down. How do we get the truth out to the American \npeople? The truth is, as I said before, that Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was \nrepealed. But we continue to read suggestions that we have already \ntried, suggestions that totally ignore the track record of some of us \nwho have tried.\n  A couple days ago our distinguished friend, Mr. Dave Broder, allowed \nthat what we ought to do is do away with the payroll tax with a flat \ntax, recommended by Senators Domenici and Nunn. Well, in April 1991, \nthe Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Senator Kasten, and the Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings, we all said, ``Look, if you are going to continue to violate \nsection 13-301 and rob the Social Security trust fund, then, Heavens \nabove, let's put Social Security on a pay-as-you-go basis so they will \nknow it,'' we were completely against an increase in the Social \nSecurity taxes at the time.\n  It would have been a tax cut, Mr. President, of $190 billion. But \nthey voted against that tax cut. They say they are for tax cuts for the \nrich, for capital gains, but not for the wage earner, the fellow who is \npulling the wagon. But Congress is in the wagon. We have to get these \nSenators and Congressmen out of the wagon. We are the ones using the \ntrust funds, not paying the bills, and wrecking the economy.\n  Mr. President, for the poor wage earner, who is pulling the wagon, we \nsaid, ``Let's cut their taxes,'' the payroll taxes suggested by Mr. \nBroder, we had that vote in 1991. But they do not want it that way. \nThey want to continue the charade.\n  So, Mr. President, I only hope there is a free press. Jefferson said \nit better than anyone. He said, if it is between the free press and a \nfree Government, I would choose the former --intoning, if you please, \nthat you can have a free Government, but it is not going to be free \nlong unless you have a free press. It is supposed to keep us honest, \nsupposed to keep us politicians honest.\n\n  Instead, as Jim Fallows says in his wonderful book, ``Breaking the \nNews,'' the press has joined in the post-party pap of ``I'm against \ntaxes. And we can balance the budget by just cutting spending.''\n  I have made my point on that. I wish it could be done. I have tried. \nWe tried, first, cuts across the board. We tried spending cuts. We \ncontinue to try spending cuts where possible. We have tried a value-\nadded tax. We have tried everything possible, but we cannot get the \ntruth out to the American people.\n  Yes, I am voting for President Clinton's budget. His track record is \ntrue. He is the only President we have had around here that has done \nsomething\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nabout this deficit. He has cut it in half. He has done it with tax \nincreases as well as $500 billion in spending cuts. And the ones that \ncaused this deficit--there ought to be ashes in their mouths--the ones \nthat caused this rotten dilemma of spending $1 billion a day for \nnothing, have the audacity to be running around saying how honest they \nare and how true they are and how balanced their budget is.\n  Read page 5: Deficits. It does not say ``balance'' in their document. \nIt cannot under the law. In fact, it is really more than the $108 \nbillion listed, because the law does not require them to list robbing \nthe distinguished Chair's retirement, robbing the military retirees, \nstill robbing the Medicare trust fund, and others. All told, it is \n$151.9 billion. That is why these funds are not being used for the \nhighways, the airports, or workers' retirement. We are robbing them. It \nis a shabby act.\n  But they know no shame. They come around with their little charts. We \nhadn't seen their budget or anything else. They had the President's \nbudget for 4 months, so they would work up their charts. And we would \ngo into the Budget Committee, and they would go through their little \nacts. They had the Senator from Texas complaining about exactly what \nthey have in defense.\n  They had the Senator from Missouri talk about veterans, the next one \ntalked about defense and came on with all his charts. It was just all \napplesauce, just a show on C-SPAN. We had no choice except to take \ntheir plan or leave it. What they offered was a three-way breakdown of \nthe reconciliation process and ultimately, in my opinion, a violation \nof the Byrd rule.\n  For the first time to my knowledge, they are using the reconciliation \nprocess to actually increase the deficit. By at least $122 billion. You \ncan read it again in this document, in section (c) on page 51, that if \nthe legislation is enacted pursuant to sections A and B no later than \nSeptember 18, the Committee on Finance shall report to the Senate a \nreconciliation bill proposing changes in laws with any jurisdiction \nnecessary to reduce revenues. That is so they can go around to the rich \ncrowd in New York and say, ``We will give you capital gains.'' It is in \ntheir contract but it will not work.\n  The one that should have set himself aside and be done with that \nsilly contract is the distinguished Speaker. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of this side, I yield 20 \nminutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to get back to the subject that \nwe are here to talk about, the President's budget. Rather than getting \ninto all of this argument about what is phony and what is not phony, it \nseems to me we what we ought to do is look at what this budget claims \nto do. The budget is the one issue of the year through which we define \nwhat we want America to be. In this case, we are talking about what we \nwant America to be over the next 7 years.\n  Let me begin by doing something that we do not do much of around \nhere. Let us assume that every word in the President's budget is true, \nlet us assume that we are going to do everything he asks us to do, and \nlet us assume that everything he says will work will indeed work. We \nwill grant him every assumption you would grant somebody to try to give \nthem the benefit of the doubt.\n  Let us take this budget, this great big thick document that we now \nhave debated for 2 hours, and view it as Bill Clinton's vision for the \nfuture of America. What I want to do is ask not whether you can find on \npage 54 something that does not make sense, but rather to ask ``What \nkind of vision is this?'' Is this an America we want? This is the \nquestion that we are here today to talk about.\n  First of all, let me just look at the Clinton budget and assume that \neverything works out exactly the way the President wants it to work \nout. I want to talk about what kind of America we will have if this \nhappens and compare it to the America of the 1940's, the 1950's, the \n1960's, the 1970's, and the 1980's. This, again, assumes that \neverything works out exactly as the President hopes it will. This is \nthe best case Bill Clinton scenario.\n  First of all, let us look at the tax burden. In the 1940's, the \naverage American family sent to Washington about 16.5 percent of \neverything they made; the Government took about 16.5 percent of all \ngoods and services produced in America. In the 1950's, it rose to 17.6 \npercent. In the 1960's and 1970's, it was up to 18 percent. If we adopt \nBill Clinton's budget and enforce it exactly as it is written, where \neverything works out exactly as he wants it to and with the most rosy \nscenarios he can assume, we are committing ourselves to the highest tax \nburden in the history of the United States of America: 19.3 percent out \nof every dollar earned in America is going to come to Washington and be \nspent by Bill Clinton. These are the President's numbers and this is \nthe President's vision. Under the best of circumstances, where \neverything works out exactly as the President would like it to, the \nAmerican taxpayer will face the highest tax burden in the history of \nthe United States of America.\n  Further, under the President's plan, the cumulative tax burden will \nnever have been higher. When you add up State, local, and Federal \ntaxes, over 30 percent of all money earned by all sources in America \nwill be spent not by the people who earn the money but by their \nGovernment. So this is the first part of the Clinton vision--the \nhighest taxes in American history.\n\n  The second part of his vision is social spending, by which I mean \nnondefense spending. In the 1950's, the Federal Government spent 7.4 \ncents out of every dollar earned by every American on nondefense \nprograms. This rose in the 1960's, in the so-called Great Society \nperiod, to 10.2 cents out of every dollar earned. It rose to 14.6 cents \nout of every dollar in the 1970's, and then 17.1 cents in the 1980's. \nIf we adopt Bill Clinton's budget, and if it does everything he says it \nwill do, we are still talking about social spending taking 17.3 cents \nout of every dollar earned by every American. That is the highest level \nof social spending in the history of the United States of America--thus \ngiving us both the highest taxes in American history and the highest \nlevel of social spending.\n  What about defense? In the 1940's, 7.9 percent of all income earned \nby all Americans went to national defense. As the cold war heated up in \nthe 1950's, it grew to 10.6 percent. In the 1960's, it was 8.9 percent, \nand then it leveled out at 6 percent in the 1970's and 1980's. If we \nadopt Bill Clinton's budget and all the dramatic cuts in national \ndefense expenditures that it entails, expenditures on national security \nas a percentage of the income earned by all Americans will be at the \nlowest level since the 1930's, with only 3.4 cents out of every dollar \ngoing to our national defense. This is the President's vision: the \nhighest tax burden in American history, the highest social spending in \nAmerican history, and the lowest defense spending in the post-war era. \nIf we adopt the President's budget, we will have social spending twice \nas high as the Great Society's social spending, we will have taxes \nsubstantially above the tax burden of the Great Society, and we will \nhave defense spending substantially below the Jimmy Carter era. That is \nthe Clinton vision.\n  In addition, what kind of growth rate does the Clinton administration \nsay his budget is capable of generating? Let me begin with a brief \nreminder of the country we live in. If you have ever wondered why \nAmericans, until this generation, have always been confident that their \nchildren will have a brighter future than they had, it is because up \nuntil now this has been true. We live in one of the few countries in \nthe history of the world where it has been the routine for people's \nparents to do better than their grandparents, who did better than their \ngreat-grandparents, and where people knew that if they worked hard, if \nthey were dedicated, they were going to do better than their own \nparents.\n  Here is the reason why: In the 1950's, we had real economic growth in \nAmerica which resulted in job creation, growth in the value of the \nthings that we produced, and, as a result, real GNP grew on average by \n4 percent. It grew by 4.4 percent in the decade of the 1960's.\n  But then something happened in the decade of the 1960's. What \nhappened in the decade of the 1960's is that we traded an economy which \nwas growing at 4\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\npercent a year for a government that would grow at 9 percent a year, \nand, as a result, economic growth started falling. We had 3.2 percent \ngrowth in the 1970's, and 2.8 percent growth in the 1980's. The most \noptimistic assumption that the Clinton administration could come up \nwith, given their budget, given what they are doing in taxing and \nspending, is that the economy will grow by a mere 2.3 percent. This is \ntheir rosy scenario.\n  So, when you go back and look at it, what is the Clinton vision? It \nis the highest tax level in American history. It is the highest level \nof spending on social programs in American history. It is the lowest \ndefense expenditure level since World War II and it is the lowest \neconomic growth rate that we have had in the 20th century. That is the \nvision of this budget and that is exactly why it ought to be rejected.\n  Let me address another issue: Medicare. It is an issue that \nfrustrates me, because almost nobody is facing up to this problem, \nleast of all the Clinton administration. The trustees of Medicare did a \nstudy last year which, given the rate that money is being spent out of \nthe Medicare trust fund, and given the rate that it is coming into the \ntrust fund from the high premium you pay in your payroll tax and the \npart B premium that our senior citizens pay for physician services, \nconcluded that only people who were age 60 and above had any kind of \nguarantee of receiving benefits. This means that the remaining 93 \npercent of the people in America, many of whom had paid in excess of \n$30,000 into Medicare, had no guarantee whatsoever that they were going \nto ever get a penny of benefits from Medicare. Now, I remind you that \nthree of these trustees are Cabinet officials of the Clinton \nadministration. So this is not Senator Domenici talking; this is the \nClinton administration.\n  What happened since that time? Well, two things have happened. The \ncommission has gone back and looked at the data and, because costs are \nup sharply, they have concluded that Medicare is not 7 years from \nbankruptcy, it is now 6, and we are moving toward 5--so the numbers are \nactually worse than what is on this chart. The Clinton administration \nclaims that it has submitted a plan that will protect 13 percent of the \nbeneficiaries of Medicare and will roughly guarantee benefits to \neverybody who is 55 or older. That means that, according to President \nClinton's own figures, 87 percent of the people who have paid into \nMedicare have no guarantee whatsoever.\n  But when CBO looked at the Clinton proposal, they concluded that, at \nbest, it would keep Social Security solvent only for one extra year. So \nthe best the Clinton administration could do, while telling senior \ncitizens that the people who want to deal with the Medicare crisis are \ntrying to take their benefits away, is give us a Medicare policy that \nsays to 92 percent of the people who have already paid into Medicare, \n``We are not going to guarantee your benefits. The problem is getting \nworse, but we are not going to fool with it.'' Why? Well, 7 years is \ntwo Presidential elections away so it's not this President's problem.\n  Now, we can be sure that after the election, they are going to start \ntalking about raising the payroll tax because if you raise that payroll \ntax by about a third, you can begin to come to grips with this problem.\n  Let me remind you of what the Republicans tried to do in the balanced \nbudget act that the President vetoed. The President went on and on \nabout how we were going to decimate Medicare. But let me just show you \nhow modest our attempt was relative to the crisis we are facing. We \ntried to guarantee Medicare for a generation. Had our reforms been \nsigned into law, it would have guaranteed Medicare, under the current \nestimates, to everybody who, based on an average life expectancy, is 46 \nyears old or older. But you will notice that for 72 percent of the \npeople who have paid Medicare taxes, we could not have guaranteed their \nbenefits. We have, in our budget today, a modest proposal on Medicare, \nwith the goal of making it solvent for another decade. Some day, we are \ngoing to have to come to grips with this.\n\n  The great tragedy is, rather than the President doing what, very much \nto his credit, Ronald Reagan did--that is, getting a bipartisan group \ntogether in the mid 1980's and solving, at least for 20 years, the \nSocial Security problem--the President is now playing politics. He \ncalls dealing with a third of the problem an assault on Medicare while \nletting 92 percent of the people stand with no guarantee of medical \nbenefit is called responsible.\n  The truth is that the President has not come to grips with this \nproblem, and the real crime is that our senior citizens are being told \nthat the Republicans, who are attempting to deal responsibly with this \nsituation, are trying to take something away from them. The truth, \nhowever, is that leaving the current situation in place, where in 6 \nyears Medicare is going to be bankrupt, creates an environment in which \na great tragedy is just waiting to happen. In the private sector, \nanybody in a position of fiduciary responsibility in who let this \nhappen would go to prison.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Parliamentarian be sure to advise us when the \nSenator's time has expired? I will yield him time off the resolution.\n  Will the Senator look at the last column, the 31 percent, which is \nthe Republican proposal? Is it not true that in order to get that which \nwas vetoed by the President--and we are talking about the trust fund \nonly--is it not true that there was not any increase in payments by \nsenior citizens, that this was done by reform, that was done by \nprovider changes and giving options to the senior citizens, and there \nwere no increases in the costs of part B protection to the seniors? Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to note one other thing. I do not want to get into \na big discussion on Medicare but one of the clearly irresponsible \nactions that ought to be denounced on a bipartisan basis is what the \nPresident has done with his nursing home provision. One of the things \nthe President's budget does in order to make Medicare look less \ninsolvent is to take the nursing home component, which costs $55 \nbillion over 7 years and which is now being paid for out of part A, out \nof Medicare. But he is not putting it anywhere, and, as if by magic, he \nassumes that somewhere this $55 billion is going to appear.\n  The final issue I would like to talk about is the issue of taxing and \nspending. Let me start by talking about taxes. It never ceases to amaze \nme that we have something underway here in Washington that the public \nis beginning to understand, but has not quite come to fully appreciate, \nand it is very much like the defense realization that occurred in the \n1980's. By the early part of the 1980's, the American people understood \nthat, in foreign policy, the Democrats had a basic approach of blame-\nAmerica-first. Whatever happened, according to the Democrats, it was \nour fault. If there were troubles in the world, the Democrats said it \nwas because of our greed and our imperialism. But finally, in the \n1980's, the American people began to disregard these claims because \nthey realized that this was just the knee-jerk approach of the \nDemocrats. I want to talk about taxes from this point of view and the \npoint I want to make is this: To the Democrats, every tax increase is \nfair, and no matter how unfair it may actually be, they define it as \nbeing fair and go to incredible lengths to convince people it is fair.\n\n  The second point I want to make is that, according to the Democrats, \nevery tax cut is unfair, no matter who it goes to and no matter who it \naffects. By definition, the Democrats say every tax cut is unfair. And \nafter a tax is increased and it actually turns out to be unfair, only \nthen do the Democrats say it is unfair--yet they propose to correct it \nby raising taxes again.\n  Let me give you an example. In 1993, we heard on the floor of the \nSenate--and the President to this day says, ``We only taxed rich \npeople.'' Let me take a couple of examples that I think reveal the \nerrors of this statement.\n  The President proposed in his budget in 1993, in his largest tax \nincrease in American history, to raise taxes on people who earned \nSocial Security benefits. He raised taxes on people who made $25,000 or \nmore, but how did he go about hiding it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would tell the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield me 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes off the resolution.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How they went about hiding it is, first, they said that \nreally they are not talking about people earning $25,000 because these \nare older people who own their own homes. So we are going to impute, \nfor the first time ever, income, and it became part of a concept of \nAmerican budgeting. So if your mother owns her own home, the President \nwould say, ``Well, look, if she had to rent that home she would have \nhad to pay $400 a month or $500 a month. So we are not really taxing \nher at $25,000 because we are not taxing the imputed value of her \nhome.'' Or she owns a lawn mower, or she owns a car, or she owns a \ndishwasher; if she rented those things, it would be imputed income. \nActually, she is rich. She is making $25,000 a year, but she is rich \nbecause she may own a dishwasher, she may own a car. She worked a \nlifetime. She owns her own home. If you imputed the value of all of \nthose things, her income would be higher.\n  The Congress rightfully rejected that. But our Democratic colleagues \nimposed the tax on anybody making $34,000 a year or more who gets any \nSocial Security. They said, this is not an income tax. But I want to \nshow you that it is.\n  This chart is a page from the advisory that was put out to go with \nyour 1040 form in 1994, the year after the tax increase went into \neffect. People get a notice from the IRS that they are getting ready to \nbe taxed again, then later get a form telling them how to fill it out, \nand then they get the tax form.\n  Let me read for you what the IRS said when they sent income tax forms \nto 120 million Americans. Here is what they said:\n\n       Social Security benefits. If your income, including one-\n     half of your Social Security benefits, is over $34,000 if \n     single (over $44,000 if married, filing jointly), more of \n     your benefits may be taxable. See the instructions for lines \n     20(a) and 20(b).\n\n  Let me show you on the 1040 form. This is income taxes. Look down \nhere at line 20(a) which I have blown up. What line 20(a) says is, \n``Social Security benefits.'' In other words, you put your Social \nSecurity benefits right there and then you pay an income tax on them.\n  So do you know how the Democrats argue that they were taxing rich \npeople? Basically, they argued if you make $25,000 or more, you are \nrich, and if you own a dishwasher or if you own your own home or you \nown your own car, you are richer than you think, because if you had to \nrent all of those things, it would cost you money.\n  We are trying to cut taxes on working families. The only tax cut in \nour budget this year is the $500-per-child tax credit. That would mean \nthat if you have two children, you are going to pay $1,000 less in \nincome taxes. You are going to be able to invest that money in your own \nchildren, your own family, your own future.\n  We know that most people who are rich or who are upper-middle income \nreally only start making money once their children are grown. So we are \nnot shocked to hear that 75 percent of the benefits of this $500 tax \ncredit goes to families that make less than $75,000 a year. But do our \ncolleagues say, ``Well, we are against cutting taxes for working \nfamilies because we believe Government can do a better job spending \ntheir money than they can do for themselves''? No. They say this is a \ntax cut for the rich. When they tax people who make $25,000 a year, \nthey say they are rich. So, in one sense, they are consistent.\n\n  But let me remind you what they are consistent about. They are \nconsistent in saying that every tax is a tax on the rich and that every \ntax is fair.\n  Another example which disproves this is the gasoline tax. President \nClinton tried to implement a so-called Btu tax that would have raised \nthe price of gasoline 7 cents a gallon. What he got was 4.3 cents. I am \nglad every Republican voted against it. I am proud of it. This was the \nfirst permanent gasoline tax that went to general revenue, and not \ntoward build highways.\n  Historically, the gas tax has gone to highways because to do \notherwise makes it a discriminatory tax. If you live in Texas, the odds \nare you spend almost twice as much on gas than if you live in New York. \nIf you live in a rural area where you have to drive great distances to \nget to work, you spend more on gasoline. If you live in the West, you \nspend more. If you live in the East, you spend less. If you live in the \nSouth, you spend more. If you live in the North, you spend less.\n  The way we have dealt with the inequity is that we have used the \ngasoline taxes to build highways. So if you pay more, you get more. But \nPresident Clinton took the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and spent \nit on his social programs. So we took money away from people driving \ntheir car and their truck to work to give money to people who do not \nwork.\n  Is that taxing the rich? No. It is taxing working people. We are \ntrying to repeal the tax--the Democrats say it is a great idea. The \nproblem is, this is the 21st day that we have tried to offer an \namendment to repeal that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax and, to this day, we \nhave not gotten a vote.\n  So, the principle I want people to understand is: whenever the \nDemocrats raise taxes, whether they tax people who make $34,000 a year \nor whether they tax gasoline, they always claim to be taxing rich \npeople. Whenever we try to cut taxes, therefore, they say we are \ncutting taxes for rich people.\n  The plain truth is, God did not make enough rich people to make the \nDemocrats's claims hold true. As these tax burdens, year after year \nafter year, have gone up, what we have discovered is, if you are going \nto take 19.3 percent out of every dollar earned in America, you are \ngoing to have to take it from the people who earn that money. That is \nbasically middle-income or upper-middle-income families and that is \nwhat the Democrats have consistently done.\n  One very final point--and I do not want to get into the sparring \ncontests with our colleagues about what is phony and what is not phony, \nbut to stand up here and say that President Clinton's budget is in \nbalance with a straight face neglects the fact that when the \nCongressional Budget Office Director, Dr. June O'Neill, was before the \nFinance Committee and she was asked, ``Is the Clinton budget in \nbalance,'' here is what she said: ``CBO estimates that the basic policy \nproposals in the President's budget would lower the deficit \nsubstantially below the Congressional Budget Office baseline \nprojections, but the deficit would still total $84 billion 7 years from \nnow.''\n  So how does the President close that gap? He closes that gap with a \nlittle piece of fine print where, in essence, he says, if for some \nreason the budget is not in balance, take back the tax cut.\n  Tax America first. Spend first, tax first. Always tax. Never give the \ntax back. This is the Clinton prescription that we are talking about \nhere.\n  In the end, we are talking about competing visions. What kind of \nvision do we have for our country? The vision of Bill Clinton, the \nvision of our Democratic colleagues, is one of more Government, more \nsocial spending than ever in history, less defense than ever in the \npostwar period, and the highest tax burden in American history. That is \ntheir vision.\n  Our vision is different. You can be for it. You can be against it. \nBut our vision is a vision of more freedom and opportunity. We want to \ncontrol spending. We want to let working families keep more of what \nthey earn. We think families can spend their money better than the \nGovernment.\n  That is the choice. The Democrats believe Government can do it \nbetter. We believe that families can do it better. It is a choice the \nAmerican people need to make. We are going to make part of that choice \nhere on the Clinton budget. The question is, do we want to commit \nourselves to a future of more taxing and more spending? I think the \nanswer is no. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  Before Senator Gramm leaves the floor, would you put up your Medicare \nchart?\n  I want to share a few observations with you about this, and you can \ntell me whether you think I am right, and you can add your marvelous \nway of expressing things to what I am talking about.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  We have in our files a letter from the Congressional Budget Office \nthat says if you do not do something about part A, the Medicare trust \nfund, in 10 years--10 years--it will be $440 billion in the red.\n  Now, you have been talking about whether we ought to do something or \nnot based upon what we understand the facts to be.\n  It seems to me that what the President is doing--and yesterday I gave \nthe President's budget an award. I crowned it with a new award. It is \ngoing to get the Oscar for fiction. The Oscar for fiction.\n  Let me ask you if you do not think this is a marvelous fiction in \nthis budget. While this fund is going to be $440 billion in the red, \nthe President says, ``I want to fix that, so I will take away some of \nthe responsibility of this trust fund.'' Right? That is what you have \nbeen telling us about. What is the responsibility in that trust fund \nthat is growing the fastest of all of the accounts?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Home health care.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Home health care. Right.\n  Now, if you wanted to fix that trust fund without doing anything \nreal, then you would say, ``Let us not pay for the fastest growing part \nof Medicare. Take it out.'' So the President's budget says, ``We are \nnot going to pay for that out of the trust fund and, seniors, you ought \nto be thrilled; I am making your trust fund more solvent.''\n  My mind has not yet permitted me to reduce this to some simple \nstatement, but it is smoke and mirrors at least. It is gimmickry at its \nworst.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It seems to me it goes beyond that because there is \nalready a lot of cynicism in budgeting--probably because the numbers \nare so big and we are doing it over multiple years. But to simply take \nhome health care, the fastest growing part of Medicare and say we are \ngoing to help Medicare by taking it out of the Medicare expenditure \naccounting but we are not paying for it in any other way, we are just \nsimply taking it out of accounting, that creates a level of cynicism \nwhich I think reaches a new level.\n  It would be like if the Senator went to the doctor and the doctor \nsays: You are in great shape except you have liver cancer. I cannot \ncure that but let me tell you, I can work on the rest of your body. You \ncan go on an exercise program, you lose a little weight; you can quit \nsmoking----\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You did not mean me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, but you would not just do all this other stuff until \nyou died. No doctor in the world would do that. Instead he would say: \nLook, we have got to do something about this cancer. We have got to do \nit right now.\n  All I am saying is, and I am not giving us the Academy Award for \nsolving the Medicare problem, but we are trying to solve the problem \nfor at least a generation. The President, however, is simply saying: \nLook, it is not going to happen until after the election. After the \nelection, maybe we can raise the payroll tax.\n  I think this is something we ought to do something about now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator actually \nsaid it right. The President takes $55 billion worth of the \nresponsibility from the protected care for seniors. They are guaranteed \nit under that trust fund, and he takes it out. And you said he does not \nprovide any means of paying for it.\n  Now, in a sense, that is because the taxpayers are going to pay for \nit--$55 billion worth of new taxes are going to be required for that \n$55 billion that, lo and behold, made Medicare solvent so the President \ndid not have to bite any difficult bullets with reference to Medicare.\n  Now, that is how I see it. I am being as honest as I can.\n  Now, let me finish the thought and you fill in anything if I have not \nsaid it right. There is the second part of Medicare, which is the part \nB insurance program, started under Dwight Eisenhower, a great idea. We \nsaid back then we will put up 50 percent; seniors, you put up 50 \npercent, and we will write you a health insurance. Everything that is \nnot covered in the trust fund we cover. That is essentially the rules \nof the game. But we always thought the senior would pay part and the \nGovernment would pay part.\n  Incidentally, the whole argument last year was what that part should \nbe. Should it be 31 percent or 25, should it be $6 more or $7 more or \n$2 more. The President decided that for this new $55 billion, the \nseniors would pay nothing. The taxpayers will pay the $55 billion.\n  Now, frankly, that is nice. That is nice except I wonder about the \nworking families around who have two or three children and they do not \nhave any health insurance or they are struggling for it. They have just \nbeen given a nice present--$55 billion of your taxes over the next 6 \nyears have to be used to pay for the President's gimmick, as I see it.\n  I thank the Senator for accommodating me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may just conclude with this point. I have always \nbelieved that not addressing this problem before the election means \nsometime later we will be looking at a massive increase in the payroll \ntax. I believe that next year or the year after, if we do not address \nthis problem now, we are going to be here on the floor of the Senate \ndebating a 20- or 30-percent increase in the payroll tax, and all \nbecause the President was unwilling to do anything about these \nexploding costs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to just close my remarks. There was an article \nby Robert Samuelson found in the Washington Post a few days ago. \nActually, it was about Senator Dole's opportunities. That was the \nstyling of it. I am going to put it in the Record after my remarks. But \nI want to read two sentences.\n\n       At some point, spending and benefits will be cut to avoid \n     costs that seem politically intolerable. The trouble is that \n     the longer the changes are delayed, the more abrupt and \n     unfair they will be. That's why silence is irresponsible.\n\n  I believe that is true. Silence or gimmickry on this issue is \nirresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \ndistinguished minority leader, Mr. Daschle, and the distinguished \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Exon.\n  I have been talking with the people of Massachusetts about this \nbudget. The people of Leominster and Worcester and Falmouth don't come \nup to me and say: ``Senator, how does that spending compare to the OMB \nbaseline?'' They don't scream out: ``What is the savings in the \noutyears compared with the savings in next fiscal year?'' They don't \nask: ``What is the cap on entitlement spending?'' But, Mr. President, \nthat does not mean that the people of Massachusetts are apathetic about \nthe Federal budget. They want to know if the Congress is going to work \nwith the President to balance the budget. And they want to know how the \nbudget is going to help them.\n  The proposal submitted to Congress by the President of the United \nStates balances the budget. This proposal before us eliminates the \ndeficit in 2002.\n  When he came to office in 1993, the President worked with Democrats \nin Congress, and we took a $290 billion deficit and cut it in half in 3 \nyears. That achievement fulfills the President's promise in 1992 to \nhalve the deficit in his first term.\n  America's deficit is still pernicious--but right now, we are doing \nbetter than any other nation in the world. Our deficit is smaller as a \nshare of our economy than the shortfall in any other major economy in \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, let me state clearly: President Clinton and the \nDemocrats in Congress worked together to enact this economic plan--and \nwe did this without one single Republican vote.\n  This budget reflects our priorities of deficit reduction without \nforgetting our commitment to middle-class Americans. Please remember, \nMr. President, something the Republican Party seems to forget: Deficit \nreduction, in and of itself, is not an economic policy.\n  It is part of a larger picture. It is part of a vision--the \nDemocrats' vision--of this country's future which will lead us into the \nnext century with a healthier American economy and a stronger middle \nclass. That's good for America's corporate headquarters and America's \nhouseholds.\n  Our plan has kept interest rates low, so more Americans have been \nable to buy a first home or a new car.\n  Our plan has subdued inflation to 2.7 percent since 1993--the yield \non 10-year\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nTreasury notes dropped a full point when this plan was enacted. That \nhelped alleviate the credit crunch which hurt so many of my friends and \nneighbors in Massachusetts during the Reagan-Bush recession.\n  Our plan has created more than 8 million jobs--including 1 million \njobs in basic industries like construction and manufacturing. It has \nfostered robust and steady growth of gross domestic product--unlike the \nrecession of the early 1990's which crippled the American family.\n  This proposal before us, the President's budget, continues our good \nrecord. It balances the budget the right way--by making Government \nsmaller and more efficient, by promoting a strong economy and a healthy \nbusiness environment, by investing in the programs that matter to \nworking Americans.\n  There is a right way to balance the budget--to make Government more \nefficient without ripping away the safety net from the American family. \nThis budget leaves no one behind. It helps people who need help and \ncloses loopholes on those who don't.\n  The American people understand this, Mr. President. This is a budget \nwhich reflects their priorities.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to tell our colleagues about the \nimpact this budget has on the families in my home State of \nMassachusetts. The President's budget designates more American cities \nas empowerment zones--a program designed to stimulate community \nrevitalization. Our colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, \nunderstands how important this program is to America's cities. He has \nintroduced legislation which would expand the tax credits under the \nEmpowerment Zone Program to cities designated as enterprise \ncommunities. I support his efforts and I support the President's \nexpansion of the current successful program.\n  The expansion promises to help communities across Massachusetts like \nBoston, Lowell, Springfield, and Lawrence. The President's budget will \nallow these cities and others to develop and expand opportunities for \ntheir residents through a series of tax benefits, social service \ngrants, and better program coordination.\n\n  At a time when some cities face high unemployment and high poverty \nrates, the Congress should be passing a budget which encourages \neconomic growth and citizen participation in strategic plans for \nrevitalization.\n  We, Democrats, are fighting to expand empowerment zones while we hold \nback Republican attempts to distress our urban centers further by \ncutting services vital to low-income Americans, like the low-income tax \ncredit.\n  The President's budget commits a full $1 billion for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program in fiscal year 1997, $1 billion in \nadvanced appropriations for fiscal year 1998 and $300 million for \nemergency funding. Mr. President, this past winter, my State survived \none of the most brutal winters we have seen in a century.\n  There was record snow in Boston and small towns all over New England. \nFamilies in Dorchester, in Everett, and in Malden--families all across \nMassachusetts--relied on LIHEAP to assist with staggering heating \nbills.\n  This program literally kept families from freezing: I am proud the \nPresident has committed Federal resources necessary to meet the needs \nof working Americans, and I am discouraged that the Republican budget \nresolution is silent on funding for LIHEAP. The President and the \nDemocrats are committed to the working families in Massachusetts and \nNew England. The Republicans are silent.\n  The President's budget proposes $200 million to electrify the Amtrak \nsegment between Boston and New Haven--a project which will make \npossible high-speed rail travel between Boston and Washington, DC, by \nthe year 2000.\n  The President and Democrats commit $5.5 million to conservation and \nmanagement of fisheries which would help restore New England's \ncollapsed stock of cod, flounder, and haddock. The Republicans are \nsilent.\n  The President and the Democrats are fighting for $500 million in mass \ntransit operating subsidies for Massachusetts. This means commuters to \nBoston will not constantly be asked to pay higher fares just to get to \nwork. Republicans are silent.\n  The President and the Democrats are fighting for $650 million for the \nCentral Artery. The Republicans are silent.\n  The President and the Democrats are fighting to expand the Summer \nJobs Program which gives so many young people in Massachusetts their \nfirst work experience.\n  This budget follows the wisdom of Mayor Menino who joined me in \nfighting against the Republican shut-downs earlier this year. He knew \nthe effect these shut-downs would have on summer jobs. We forced them \nto open the Government, fund the Summer Jobs Program and we will \ntogether fight to expand it by giving another 500,000 kids a chance for \nemployment. But, then as now, the Republicans are silent.\n  The President and the Democrats are fighting the AIDS epidemic and \nhave committed resources to highly affected cities like Boston by fully \nfunding the Ryan White CARE Program. This means nutrition services to \npeople living with AIDS, and testing and counseling for those who fear \nHIV-infection, will continue at the AIDS services organizations across \nthe State. The Republicans are silent.\n  The President and the Democrats are fighting for $100 million for the \nclean-up of Boston Harbor, and the Republicans are silent.\n  That silence is unacceptable, Mr. President.\n  I will do all I can to break the silence. I will come to the floor as \noften as possible and discuss the ill-effects of the Republican budget.\n  If the President's proposal is not accepted by the Senate, I will not \ngive up on the environment. I will offer an amendment at a later stage \nin this debate, and I will fight to restore drastic cuts in \nenvironmental programs the Republicans have imposed on the American \npeople and the residents of Massachusetts.\n  And, while we fight to clean our air and our water, the Republicans \nhave locked arms against the American taxpayers. The Republican plan \nslashes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and allows \npolluters to foist the tab for their mess on the taxpayers rather than \nforcing the polluters to clean up after themselves.\n  If the President's budget is not accepted, I will offer an amendment \nthat recognizes education as the key to economic and income security. I \nwill offer an amendment to add-back the cuts the Republicans are making \nto the President's plan. I am proud he has included a provision for \nwhich I have been fighting in this Congress--the President's budget \ncalls for a $10,000 deduction for educational expenses. That is real \nmoney to working families who face double-digit inflation in the cost \nof higher education.\n\n  Real money to help real people. Listen to some of the letters I have \nreceived recently:\n  Melvin Harris of Roxbury wrote to me:\n\n       My son is currently attending school at Morgan State \n     University in Baltimore. He and I were shocked to find that \n     federal funds had been cut drastically which he was depending \n     on. With me being a retiree, it is hard for me to pay his \n     tuition, room and board. Would you please do something to \n     help me?\n\n  The President's budget will help Mr. Harris.\n  Timothy Crawford of Wellesley wrote to me:\n\n       As a senior in high school, I am looking forward to going \n     away to college next year. I have worked hard to get good \n     grades throughout high school and have been accepted to good \n     schools and am now trying to make the decision of where to \n     attend. One very important part of my decision is the price \n     of the school and the assistance I can get.\n       I am afraid the Republicans in our government will cut \n     education programs and I may not be able to attend college, \n     my brother may not be able to attend college, or we have to \n     work out a plan so that one of us goes to college while the \n     other works.\n       I hope you will continue to support education and do \n     something to help us.\n\n  The President's proposal will help Timothy Crawford and his family.\n  I have dozens of letters from students at Wellesley College. And, \nhundreds of letters from physicians and attorneys who cannot repay \ntheir student loans, and millworkers and musicians who ask for help \nsending their kids to college. And, the President's proposal will help \nthem all.\n  The President has learned from Massachusetts the importance of \nscience and technology to the American economy. This budget marks the \nfourth\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\nstraight year the Democrats have proposed an increase in science and \ntechnology programs--while the Republicans would cut science and \ntechnology programs by 30 percent by the year 2002.\n  I will fight for the President's proposal for an increase of $13 \nbillion for university-based research: it is the key to America's \nfuture. And, Massachusetts knows this better than almost every other \nState in the Union.\n  The President and the Democrats have given us a chance to fight back \nagainst crime in our neighborhoods. This budget proposes $2 billion for \n49,000 new police officers to protect America's neighborhoods. Putting \nadditional cops on the beat in communities across Massachusetts will \nhelp deter crime, break the cycle of violence, and make our towns and \nneighbhoods safer places to live.\n  In 1994, I fought successfully to increase the funding in the crime \nbill to put an additional 100,000 cops on the street by the year 2000. \nAnd, it is paying off for Massachusetts. Just this week, 99 \nMassachusetts cities will receive more funding--Worcester will receive \n$1.85 million to hire 18 officers. Springfield will receive $1.25 \nmillion to hire 17 officers and Lowell will receive $1.5 million to \nhire 20 new officers. To date, thanks to this program, my home State \nhas received funding for 1,300 new police men and women.\n  While the Republicans continue to threaten the community policing \nfund--jeopardizing the safety of corner stores and neighborhood schools \nand households--the President's budget understands the needs of \nMassachusetts' neighborhoods. That's why I support this proposal.\n  The President and the Democrats also propose $25 million for new \nadvanced police officer education and training. State and local police \ndepartments need assistance to meet the growing demands of law \nenforcement and I am prepared to fight to help them.\n  And, Mr. President, what do we hear from the other side of the aisle? \nThe same, war-torn, threadbare rhetoric about tax and spending. The \nsame partisan bickering. Is this proposal all tax and spend? Of course \nnot. The President's budget is certified by the Congressional Budget \nOffice to balance in 6 years. It protects the environment. It protects \nour elderly. It funds education and puts cops on the street. It takes \ncare of the little guy.\n  In the face of the extreme Republican budget, the President and we, \nDemocrats, have given the country hope by reducing the deficit with \ncommon sense and compassion. It saves the Medicare Program for our \nseniors, and the Medicaid Program for our children and low-income \nAmericans.\n  My friends in Massachusetts just don't buy it when you tell them: \n``this isn't a cut--it's merely a reduction in the growth of \nspending.'' They understand that the extreme Republican budget forces \nthem to spending twice as much on Medicare premiums.\n\n  They understand that Cape Cod beaches will be under attack, and \nBoston harbor clean-up will be stalled while their water and sewer \nrates are skyrocketing. They understand that they are paying into the \nsystem and--under the Republican plan--they will be getting little in \nreturn.\n  They understand that when the Republicans are not speaking in arcane, \nincomprehensible, confusing budget jargon--they are silent.\n  The President's budget speaks to the people I meet at home in \nMassachusetts. This budget meets our spending priorities and promises \nmore good economic news for the American family. That is why I support \nit.\n  I urge our colleagues to support his balanced budget.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks by commending my \ncolleague from New Mexico, who is the chairman of this committee, who \nhas the unenviable task of chairing the Budget Committee. While we have \nour disagreements from time to time, I have a great deal of respect for \nhim as a colleague, as a Member, and I appreciate the fine work that he \ndoes on behalf of his State and on behalf of the country.\n  I will take a few minutes and go over some of the budget items. He \ndoes not have to stay. I know he has other things to do. But I did not \nwant him to leave the floor without expressing my appreciation for the \nwork he does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say for the Record, it is mutual. While my \ncolleague does not chair the budget committee--there cannot be that \nmutuality--he probably would not want it anyway. In any event, I want \nto say that my colleague's participation and contribution in matters \nthat we work on, from my standpoint, is very much appreciated. I \ncommend the Senator on the way he has handled himself.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, at some later point I will also have some extended \nremarks on the announcement by the majority leader, who has decided he \nis going to retire from the Senate the first part of June. While we, \ntoo, have our differences, suffice it to say, as a colleague and a \nfriend, he will be missed. I mean that very deeply and sincerely.\n  Mr. President, I will just begin my remarks here by asking unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from June O'Neill, who \nis the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, dated May 9, 1996, \nin response in part to the colloquy between my colleague from New \nMexico and our colleague from Texas regarding the condition of the \nhospital insurance trust fund. She says in that letter, here, and I am \nquoting it now:\n\n       Under current law, the HI trust fund is projected to become \n     insolvent in 2001. CBO estimates the administration's \n     proposals would postpone this date to 2005.\n\n  She goes into greater length here, responding to that, but I thought \nfor the Record my colleagues ought to know what the Congressional \nBudget Office says with regard to the hospital trust fund.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has examined the effects of the Administration's \n     budgetary proposals on the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust \n     fund. Under current law, the HI trust fund is projected to \n     become insolvent in 2001. CBO estimates that the \n     Administration's proposals would postpone this date to 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by trying to, if we can, get \nback to some basic information here, because you can get lost in a lot \nof the data and charts and numbers that get thrown around. Let us just \nremember we are talking about the President's budget. There is a budget \npresented by the committee and there will be some alternatives that \nwill be offered in the coming days when we debate what the budget of \nthe country ought to be, but I think it is worthwhile to point out we \nare talking about the President's budget to begin with.\n  Remember, this is a man who arrived in town in January 1993, 40 \nmonths ago--not 40 years ago, not a decade ago or 15 years ago; 40 \nmonths ago he arrives in town. He never served in Congress, never \nserved in the Cabinet. He was the Governor of a small State. As he \narrives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he has left on his doorstep a \nmountain of debt. A mountain of debt is left on his doorstep. As you \nbegin to look back at 1980 and start there and follow this redline, \nwhere the Congressional Budget Office projections were before, those \nare facts, where the deficit was going, where it was headed just prior \nto the President's arrival in town, and then what has happened to the \nprojection of the deficit since his arriving, right here, in 1993. Here \nwe get clearly where things were going up until his arrival here, and \nnow the same Congressional Budget Office says we are headed this way.\n  So, just for the purpose of clarity, let us keep in mind conditions \nwhen this\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nPresident arrives. We had mountains of debt, most of it accumulated \nbetween 1981 and 1993. In fact, we had a debt that went up almost $4 \ntrillion, from $1 trillion in 1981 to $4 trillion the day this \nPresident arrives in town. Then, in the 40 months he has been here, he \nhas taken the projection of our deficit, which we are told was headed \nin this direction, and we are now moving it downward. So you begin with \nat least looking at the trend lines and where we are going.\n  The President's budget is a commonsense approach. It cuts more than \nhalf a trillion dollars in spending over 7 years, yet, at the same \ntime, it maintains our priorities as a nation. The President's budget \ninvests in people. It protects Medicare and Medicaid, education and the \nenvironment, and it would maintain our national investments in \neducation, job training and technology, all of which I think we agree \nare important.\n  The budget maintains access to health care for our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens. It keeps our natural environment and our \nworkplaces safe. It understands that our overwhelming focus on \nbalancing the budget should not cause us to ignore our national \npriorities. The President understands that all of this talk about \nbalancing the budget should not cause us to lose sight of our most \nimportant national goals.\n  As I have said in the past, this body, in my view, needs to be \nfocusing more of its attention on increasing economic growth. We need \nto reform the Tax Code so it promotes savings and investment and higher \ngrowth. We need to increase opportunities for education and job \ntraining so that all Americans will have the tools to succeed. We need \nto make pensions and health care portable so that Americans can better \ncope with the technological and economic changes that are occurring in \ntheir lives.\n  We should all remember that an increase of as little as one-half of 1 \npercent in the growth rate of the United States could create enormous \nopportunities for new jobs and expand options for millions of working \nAmericans. Increasing growth is a priority, in my view, that should be \nreflected in everything that we do in Washington, and it should be \nreflected in the Federal budget. It is reflected in the President's \nbudget.\n  All along, President Clinton has stressed there is a right way and a \nwrong way to balance the budget. The right way is by maintaining our \ncommitment to Head Start, to police officers on the beat, to clean and \nhealthy drinking water, to summer jobs, and to encouraging community \nservice. Those are the kinds of priorities that help build a strong \nnation.\n\n  The wrong way to balance the budget is by having unnecessary, unwise \nspending cuts and tax cuts for those, frankly, who do not need them. I \nam going to get to that in a minute here. Our dear friends on the other \nside, with all due respect, have not learned the lesson. The American \npublic have said over and over again: You are going in the wrong \ndirection. We want our budget balanced. We want it done, if we can, in \nthe next 6 or 7 years, but we want our priorities to be reflected in \nthat decisionmaking process.\n  What good does it do if you balance the budget and simultaneously \nmake it impossible for my children to get a decent education, have \naccess to higher education in this country? Balancing the budget and \ndepriving the next generation of the tools it needs is foolhardy.\n  What good does it do to talk about balancing the budget if you are \ngoing to rip the heart out of the environmental laws that have made \nthis a stronger and a healthier nation? What good is it to balance the \nbudget if you then increase the financial burden of older Americans, if \nyou begin to make it more difficult, because Medicare is being reduced, \nfor these people to make ends meet? How many middle-income families \ndepend upon Medicaid so their parents and their grandparents can have a \ndecent, long-term health care program?\n  These are the kinds of things people say we need to invest in \nintelligently, making choices about where you reduce spending so we can \nachieve a balanced budget but make our country strong simultaneously. \nIn our view, the President has done that with his budget. No one is \nsuggesting any budget proposal is perfect, but certainly, given the \nevidence of the last 40 months, the direction we are heading in will \nmake the case that this is a good proposal and one we ought to be \nworking on, if we can, to achieve some common ground over the next 20 \nor so days left here so we can complete this budget process and do what \nthe American public have asked us to do.\n  Let me, if I can, address some of these issues with greater \nspecificity. I want to begin with the budget being cut. I say this \nbecause I think it is important that people understand where we have \ncome from in the last 40 months. This is what is called a primary \nbudget. This is entitled ``Budget Without Interest Payments.''\n  Obviously, interest payments must, like any financial obligation, be \npaid. But if you remove the interest payments--remember, you only get \ninterest payments because of the burdens you accumulate. So if you take \naway the interest payments, here is the deficit that occurred over the \n12 years from 1981 to 1993, those 12 years: $660 billion. If you took \naway the interest obligations in the last 40 months, we have created a \nsurplus of $239 billion in this country in the last 40 months. Those \nnumbers are not being made up. Those are real numbers.\n\n  So with all of this talk of what has happened here, here is a \nPresident who arrives in town in Washington for the first time in a \nFederal Government position, and in 40 months he is able to move us \ninto the black, if you will--this chart is in the blue--but into the \nblack for the first time in years.\n  President Clinton inherited a $290 billion deficit in the year that \nhe arrived in office. This year, the 1996 deficit will be $144 billion. \nThat is cut in half. Those are the realities.\n  Back in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office projected the deficit \nwould hover around $300 billion. That was their projection. Following \nthe implementation of the Clinton budget plan in 1993, as I pointed out \nearlier, the budget has declined sharply. In fact, Mr. President, let \nme point out one additional statistic reflected in this chart. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the 1996 deficit will come \nin at 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product. That will be the first \ntime since 1979 that the deficit has been below 2 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. That is significant progress, and we ought to stay on \nthat track, if we can.\n  This chart is without interest payments, as I said, and has been cut \nin half as a result of what has happened just in the last 40 months of \nthis administration.\n  Let me, if I can, turn to the chart on job growth rate, because this \nis what people care about. Again, you can balance the budget tomorrow \nif you want to, just by juggling some numbers around here and getting \nrid of a lot of things. But this cannot be a process of just people \nwith green visors and sharp pencils. What happens to real people in \nthis country as a result of the decisions we make? If our only function \nwere to balance the budget, we could do that simply by cutting out all \nour spending, if we wanted to, and raising taxes on everybody.\n  We have to ask the question: What happens to real people when you do \nthis? So while we have been able to cut the deficit in half, and, if we \neliminate the interest payments, actually we put this country into \nsurplus for the first time in years. What has happened to jobs out \nthere? What has happened to people's jobs? Again, look at jobs created \nper year.\n  In 1981 to 1992, jobs created per year were 1,540,000. That is the \nnumber of jobs created each year in those years. In 1989 through 1992, \nit averaged 608,000 jobs per year. But from 1993 to the present time, \nMr. President, we have created in excess of 2,684,000 jobs a year. \nCompare that with 1,500,000 from 1981 to 1992; 600,000 from 1989 to \n1992. We are now getting close to 3 million new jobs a year, while \nsimultaneously bringing the deficit down.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield, because I think it is so \nimportant.\n  What that chart shows is the number of jobs created essentially under \nthe Bush Presidency as opposed to the Clinton Presidency. What my \nfriend is saying, and it is so dramatic I would like him to repeat it, \nis that under the Bush Presidency, there were how many new jobs \ncreated?\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Under the 4 years President Bush served as President, we \ncreated on average of 608,000 jobs per year, and in the last 40 months, \nfrom January of 1993 through December of 1995--it does not include \nthese last 4 or 5 months, but my colleagues will recall there were in \nexcess of 620,000 jobs created in the month of February alone. That is \nmore jobs created on a yearly basis than between 1989 and 1992.\n  Quickly someone is going to say, ``Well, those aren't great jobs.'' \nThat is wrong. The overwhelming number of jobs, more than 90 percent of \nthese jobs, are private sector jobs, and well over 60 percent of these \njobs are high-paying jobs. Not every one of them is, but the \noverwhelming majority are high-paying jobs in the private sector.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My last question. When President Clinton ran for office, \nhe made a promise on new jobs. As I understand it, that promise has \nbeen met; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from California, I believe it has, \nand promises were made in terms of cutting the deficit in half. Those \nare real numbers. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says they \nare real numbers. So here is the deficit coming down, job creation is \ngoing up, and my colleagues on the other side are treating this like \nbad news, as if this was some dreadful information.\n  If we are on the right track, if things are working right, why do you \nnot stick with the plan and the program here so that you have a healthy \nbalance--investment in education, investment in our environment, \ncutting back our spending where we can, trying to have some sense of \nfairness about all of this so we move into the 21st century as a \nhealthy nation.\n  Today, of the G-7 countries, we are the healthiest economy. We are \nthe healthiest economy of all the great economic powers in the world. \nWe are the healthiest today in terms of job creation and deficit \nreduction. Why are our markets responding the way they are? The people \non Wall Street are not making those investments because they want to \nhelp Bill Clinton get reelected. It is not because they are Democrats. \nThey are making cold, hard financial decisions: Are we heading in the \nright direction or the wrong direction? They are investing because they \nthink things are going in the right direction. It is their money they \nare putting on the table, and they like the trend lines they see: the \ndeficit coming down, job creation going up.\n  You can dance all around this, you can try to throw out a lot of \nmisinformation about it, but the hard line bottom facts are, we are on \nthe right track, we are going in the right direction. A lot more has to \nbe done. It would be foolish for anyone to stand up here and say our \nwork is over with. It is not. There are going to be some difficult \ndecisions that have to be made. But you cannot argue with the facts. \nJob creation, deficit reduction, the trend lines of where we are going \nin this country are on a solid and sound footing.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the coming days to move \naway from politics as usual. We need to come together. We have 20 to 25 \ndays to get a job done. There is no debate here about whether or not we \nought to balance the budget. I know some hope others will take a \nposition--in fact, I heard someone the other day in the House of \nRepresentatives say, ``We don't want to settle this because it is too \ngood of an issue.''\n  It reminds me of the story of the law clerk who arrives in a law firm \nand he has only been there a month. He walks in to the senior partner \nwith this huge file, a file that has been around 20 years. He says to \nthe senior partner of the law firm, ``I've got great news, boss. This \ncase that has been here 20 years. I've settled this case. It's over \nwith. It's done. Everybody's happy.''\n  The senior partner says, ``Why did you do a thing like that for? I've \neducated four of my children on that file. You don't want to close that \ncase, that's too good a case, keep that case open.''\n  So we have certain friends who want to keep the case open, because it \nis a good case politically for them. Do not let it settle. For God's \nsake, do not come to an agreement, they say. Do not try to resolve your \ndifferences. The politics of that are dreadful; they are dreadful \npolitics. Keep the issue alive, keep the debate going.\n  We are here to say today, let us end the debate. We can. We have \nagreed on balancing the budget in 7 years. We all have agreed to do it \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office numbers. We are on the \nright track. The differences are not that great. They can be resolved. \nWe can get the work done.\n  I urge my colleagues today on both sides, particularly those on the \nmajority side--it is difficult, I know, to admit when you are wrong. \nThat is a hard thing for anybody to do in this world. It is \nparticularly hard, if you are in politics, to admit you are wrong, but \nthe facts do not lie. The deficit has come down. A young Governor \narrives from a small State in January of 1993, gets dumped on his \ndoorstep--dumped on his doorstep--$4 trillion in debt, some $290 \nbillion, $300 billion in an annual deficit.\n  In 40 months, that deficit is down to $144 billion. The Congressional \nBudget Office now says we are heading in the right direction, going in \nthe right direction now. That is the right direction to be going in.\n  Job creation is up, the basic thing people need. The best social \nprogram anybody ever created is a job, a good job in this country. Here \nwe have jobs being produced in the Nation while the deficit is coming \ndown, and intelligent priorities, good priorities.\n  I heard the other day the House majority leader--put aside whether \nyou are for or against a gasoline tax; we can debate that, and will, in \nthe coming days--but, my Lord, to hear the majority leader of the House \nof Representatives say, I'll tell you how we'll pay for that--we'll cut \neducation.\n  In my State, my working-class families in my State need the Pell \ngrants and the student loans and the Stafford grants and so forth. \nOtherwise, they could not get an education. We have commencements \ncoming up.\n  I am going to give a commencement speech at Western Connecticut State \nUniversity, a State university in my State. Fifty percent of their \nstudents receive some form of financial help or assistance. Here we \nhave the majority leader of the House of Representatives saying we \nought to just pay for that gasoline tax by going after education. You \nwonder why people are suspicious.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. With some reluctance, I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just say----\n  Mr. DODD. I am on a roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The distinguished majority leader in the House has not \nsaid that since that day.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from New Mexico obviously got a hold of him \nand straightened him out. I appreciate that. But come on, what else do \nyou rely on, when you get up on a national news program and you say, \n``I'll tell you how I'd do it. This is how I'd do it''? Immediately the \nphones were ringing off the hook. What a foolish thing to say. So \nimmediately they start to backtrack.\n  But if you wonder why the American people get suspicious about what \nthe priorities are, it is statements like that. What are your real \nintentions?\n  So when we hear statements about Medicare, and we say, ``We will let \nit wither on the vine,'' or, ``I'm proud I voted against it 35 years \nago,'' then everyone gets upset. You can understand the average person \nin this country gets a little nervous when they hear that. If they are \nrelying on Medicare, relying on Medicaid, in order to meet basic health \ncare costs, they are wondering, which side do we chose here? Who is \ngoing to watch out for me? They have one person saying, ``Look, I think \nit ought to die or we get rid of it. I never thought it worked very \nwell.'' And others say, ``Look, we're going to have to make it work \nbetter and make tough decisions so it's there.'' Then you begin to \nunderstand the suspicions, the worries, the fears, the insecurities \nthat many people feel. This is not an abstraction to them.\n  We have a good health care program as Members of the U.S. Congress. \nThank God for it. We have a good health care program. But millions of \nAmericans outside of Washington, Mr. President, they rely on Medicare. \nThey rely on it. For many, Medicare is the difference between having a \nlife of relative decency and being wiped out financially. It is not an \nabstraction to them.\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n  So when we talk about these numbers and CBO and OMB and percentages \nand GDP, and so forth, that person out there today watching this debate \nsays, ``What does that mean in terms of me, my kids, our jobs, our \nhealth care? Where are we going? Who is on my side?''\n  So, again, I come back to the point, Mr. President, I tried to make \nat the outset here. Put aside all the glitter and all the distractions; \nwe are going in the right direction on deficit reduction. It is a major \nissue. People care about it deeply. This President in 40 months, not 40 \nyears, not 15 years, but 40 months, has moved the country in the right \ndirection on deficit reduction for the first time in decades.\n\n  At the end of this fiscal year, we will have now had 4 years of \ndeficit reduction, 4 consecutive years. You have to go back to Harry \nTruman's adminis- \ntration--Harry Truman's administra- \ntion--to find another American President who took us through 4 years of \nconsecutive deficit reduction.\n  We have reduced the size of the Federal work force under President \nClinton by 270,000 jobs. Now, 30 percent of those jobs were in the \nmilitary. My colleagues on the Budget Committee pointed that out. That \nis accurate. But 70 percent of those jobs came from the civilian work \nforce.\n  By contrast, with all due respect, under President Reagan, the \nFederal work force increased by 188,000 positions; 188,000 positions \nduring the 8 years of President Reagan. Contrast that with 270,000 \nfewer jobs in 40 months under President Clinton.\n  Under the leadership of Al Gore, the President has ripped out 16,000 \npages of the 80,000 pages of Federal regulations, so that businesses in \nthis country can work with less paperwork cluttering their desks.\n  Is it done yet? No; but for the first time, there is a real reduction \nin paperwork, real reduction in the size of the Federal work force, \nreal reduction in the deficit, getting the unemployment rate down. \nThose are the things that people care about, seeing to it that \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment are going to get \nproper protection.\n  It is a commonsense budget. That is what has happened under this \nproposal. That is why I urge my colleagues on the other side in these \ncoming few days to sit down. Let us work out this budget.\n  The President extended the hand to our majority leader. He said, \n``Let's come on down, you and I, no staff, no one else, and let's work \nthis out together.'' Our majority leader is going to be here until June \n11. I hope he will take him up on that offer. What a great thing it \nwould be, before the majority leader leaves and retires from the \nSenate, with one of the great issues we have tried to resolve, if an \nAmerican President and the majority leader, from the two different \nparties in this country, the two major parties, came together, with no \none else in the room, and the two of them sat down and worked out this \nproblem before June 11.\n  What a great achievement that would be. I think both individuals \nwould deserve the sincere praise and credit from the American public. I \nknow we have an election in 25 weeks, but this issue deserves \nresolution, and we are close to achieving it.\n  You have a President taking us in the right direction. You have a \nmajority leader who is about to retire from here, who I think could \nclose the gap. I urge that that offer the President made to our \nmajority leader be picked up before he retires, and let's see if we \ncannot complete this work.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to take a \ngood, strong hard look at the budget that has been proposed by the \nPresident. It takes us in the right direction for all the reasons I \nmentioned. I urge its adoption. With that, Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I speak off the resolution, Mr. President.\n  I might say to Senator Dodd, I cannot at this point, because we are \ngoing to offer an amendment--but so the Senator will know, I will have \nan interesting rebuttal to what the Senator has said. I will give the \nother side of the coin sometime today. I do not want to do that and not \nhave the Senator know about it. I cannot do it right now while the \nSenator is here because I have some commitments. But we will let the \nSenator know in advance, so if he wants to come down and sort of chide \nme, as I did him, he can.\n\n  I say, I had a little trouble with the Senator's analogy of the law \nfirm and the old case, because it seems to me it is the President who \nis gaining from this budget debate. He is the one who has that old \ncase. He is the one who ought not to get rid of it because it has been \ngood for him. I have a strong suspicion that unless you settle the case \nhis way, he is going to have that old case right on through the \nelection because it is, as that senior partner said, it is a great \nlivelihood and it has kind of been a great political livelihood for \nhim.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. DODD. Our colleagues will appreciate that my friend from New \nMexico and I have spent a lot of time working together on old cases.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right.\n  Mr. DODD. So we share at least our concern about old cases. I \nappreciate his comments. I will try to be here when he makes them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we have tendered an amendment, \nsecond-degree amendment. We have given it to the minority so they know \nwhat it is. I understand that there are 7 minutes left on our side for \nour statutory time to rebut the President's budget. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the 7 minutes. Now I yield to Senator \nFrist for a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3968 To Amendment No. 3965\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the discretionary \n   spending caps should not include triggers that would make drastic \n reductions in nondefense discretionary spending in fiscal years 2001 \nand 2002 (the last 2 years of the budget) for the purpose of achieving \n                 a balanced budget in fiscal year 2002)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3968 to amendment No. 3965.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment.\n\n     SEC.   . COMMON SENSE BUDGETING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) President Clinton proposed in this fiscal year 1997 \n     budget submission immediate downward adjustments to \n     discretionary caps after the year 2000 if the Congressional \n     Budget Office projected that his budget would not balance in \n     2002;\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated \n     that President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget submission \n     will incur a deficit of $84,000,000,000 in 2002;\n       (3) as a result of CBO's projected deficit in fiscal year \n     2002, the President's budget would trigger drastic reductions \n     in discretionary spending in 2001 and 2002 to reach balance;\n       (4) these drastic reductions would have to occur in \n     nondefense programs such as education, environment, crime \n     control, science, veterans, and other human resource \n     programs;\n       (5) 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary cuts in the \n     President's budget occur in 2001 and 2002; and\n       (6) the inclusion in a budget submission of triggers to \n     make immediate, drastic reductions in discretionary spending \n     is inconsistent with sound budgeting practices and should be \n     recognized as a ``budgetary gimmick'' that is antithetical to \n     legitimate efforts to achieve balance in 2002.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the discretionary spending caps should not include triggers \n     that would--\n       (1) result in 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary \n     reductions occurring in fiscal years 2001 and 2002; and\n       (2) make drastic reductions in nondefense discretionary \n     spending in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (the last 2 years of \n     the budget) for the purpose of achieving a balanced budget in \n     fiscal year 2002.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I submit what is a very simple and \nstraightforward amendment today that strikes, I think, at the heart of \none of the major problems that we all have with the President's \nproposal.\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\n  To set the stage for this amendment, let me go back and set the \nbackground, starting with where we are today and how we have gotten \nhere.\n  The President proposed in his budget, the 1997 fiscal year budget, \nthat there would be immediate downward adjustments to discretionary \ncaps after the year 2000 if the Congressional Budget Office projected \nthat his budget would not balance in the year 2002.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, second, has estimated to us that \nPresident Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget submission will, indeed, \nincur a deficit of $84 billion in the year 2002. Now, as a result of \nthe CBO's projected deficit in the year 2002, the President's budget \nwill trigger drastic, drastic reductions in discretionary spending in \nthe years 2001 and 2002. It is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand that these drastic reductions which will kick in would have \nto occur in those nondefense programs such as education, the \nenvironment, crime control, science, veterans, and other human resource \nprograms.\n  It is also interesting, and, again, important for our colleagues all \nto understand, that 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary cuts in \nthe President's budget that occur in 2001 and 2002, over that 2-year \nperiod, 100 percent of those cuts will occur.\n  Now, the inclusion of a budget submission of triggers to make \nimmediate drastic reductions in discretionary spending is simply \ninconsistent with sound budgeting practices and needs to be recognized \nfor what it is--budgetary gimmickry, smoke and mirrors. This is, \nindeed, inconsistent with our bipartisan, I hope, legitimate efforts to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Thus, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment says it is the sense of the \nSenate that the discretionary spending caps should not include triggers \nwhich would result in 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary \nreductions occurring in fiscal year 2001 and 2002, and, second, should \nnot include triggers that make drastic reductions in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the last 2 years \nof the budget, for the purpose of achieving a balanced budget in the \nyear 2002.\n  This amendment is very simple. That is it. You just heard the sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment. It is straightforward. By passing this \namendment, the Senate, today, can make a strong statement opposing \nbudgetary gimmickry, smoke and mirrors, and in support of nonsense \nbudgeting.\n  We all travel around this country and to our town meetings. It is \nvery clear that the American people are tired of gimmicks out of \nWashington, are tired of the smoke-and-mirrors budgeting that we have \nundertaken in the past and that is reflected in the President's budget. \nRepeated use of these gimmicks over time has contributed to the overall \nlack of confidence that we see in our budgetary process in our Federal \nGovernment today.\n  A few months ago, the President introduced his 1997 budget, proudly \nclaiming that his budget balanced in the year 2002 using Congressional \nBudget Office numbers. Now, this is the 2,200 pages of the President's \nbudget for 1997. Intrigued by the President's new enthusiasm, very \ndifferent than a year and a half ago, for a balanced budget, my \ncolleagues and I on the Budget Committee went through the 2,000 pages. \nIt was very interesting what we discovered. Buried in the budget \nsupplement on page 13, we discovered a very troubling budget gimmick \nthat it is important for all of our colleagues to understand, to note \nthat is in there. It is really the purpose of the sense of that \namendment to point this out and to refute it.\n\n  On page 13, it says that in case the new assumptions produce a \ndeficit in 2002, the President's budget proposes an immediate \nadjustment to the annual limits or caps on discretionary spending, \nlowering them enough to reach balance in the year 2002.\n  Let me explain how this proposal works. The proposal is called a \ntrigger here in Washington, but to the typical American it is not a \ntrigger. It is a gimmick. It is a smoke-and-mirrors approach. The CBO, \nthe nonpartisan Federal budget analysts that look at this information, \nsays the budget of the President will have a deficit of $81 billion in \nthe year 2002. To make up that deficit which the CBO tells us will \nexist in 6 years, the President's budget, in this document, includes a \ntrigger. That trigger will make unspecified cuts in discretionary \nspending over those last 2 years. That is how his budget achieves so-\ncalled balance, through this gimmick.\n  Now, discretionary spending, what is it? It makes up one-third of our \nentire Federal budget. It includes spending on our basic Government \nfunctions, including education, including roads, including the \nenvironment, including science and scientific research, including \nveterans, including medical research. The President's trigger says it \ncuts discretionary spending in these fields in the years 2001 and 2002 \nbut does not say where these cuts will come from. It does not say which \nprograms will have to absorb these drastic and instant cuts of such \nmagnitude.\n  Let me refer to this first chart. It basically is headed ``Spend now, \nsave later.'' In red is the President's budget. In green is the budget \nproposed today before the U.S. Senate, the chairman's mark. The \nPresident's budget frontloads the spending and backloads the savings. \nThe President proposes to increase spending over the next several \nyears. This is 1996, 1997, and 1998.\n  The President's budget says: Yes, increase the nondefense \ndiscretionary spending over the next several years and then drastically \ncut thereafter. Contrast that to the mark that we have before us today, \nthe chairman's mark for spending cuts; reductions begin and continue \nevenly over that entire period of time.\n\n  These drastic cuts are really what we are focusing on in this sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment today because what the President's budget tells \nus in the supplement, that if they do not reach balance and the CBO \nsays it will not reach balance, these cuts come in. Look at the drastic \ncuts occurring in these 2 outlying years. The chairman's mark shows a \nsteady glidepath of decreased spending over time.\n  Now, discretionary spending is an inside-the-beltway term. Let me \nshow how the cuts and the President's budget compare to the cuts in the \nSenate balanced budget resolution. On the second chart we will look at \none such area that is of the Food and Drug Administration. As we can \nsee in our budget before the Senate today, in the Senate budget, we see \nwe assume a freeze at a spending of about $880 million over the next 6 \nyears. In contrast, we see the President's budget also has a freeze the \nfirst year but then a reduction over time--again, with drastic cuts \ncoming in to the year 2000.\n  The Food and Drug Administration, a program we all know is valuable \nto the safety of our country, that is valuable both in terms of food \nand drug safeguards, we see the significant cuts. If we look at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Senate plan, again, in green, \nincreases spending about $900 million next year and freezes it over the \nperiod out to the year 2002. In contrast, the President's plan \nincreases spending over time. But, again, in those last 2 years, \nbecause of this smoke and mirrors, because of this budgetary gimmickry, \nwe see drastic cuts that have to take place according to the budget as \npresented and written by the President in these last 2 years.\n  It is these drastic cuts that we are addressing in this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. On the one hand, we have had many attacks on this \nside of the aisle for ravaging the environment. Look at the difference \nof what actually occurs in the Senate-reported budget versus that of \nthe President of the United States.\n  Let me turn to another area which is obviously quite close to me, \nbeing a scientist in the U.S. Senate. That is the National Science \nFoundation. Once again, you see that what is in the chairman's mark, \npassed out of the Budget Committee, is very different than what is \nproposed in the President's budget--once again, if we focus on the last \n2 years.\n\n  The National Science Foundation funds many of those important \nscientific research policies, projects, and investigations, which have \nlong-term payouts and affect our individual lives.\n  Another area I am very close to is the National Institutes of Health. \nIf there is one thing I keep coming back to this floor talking about, \nit is that we need to think long term. We cannot just think short term \nand think just what gets us to the next election, or what will be \npolitically appealing to the masses of people today. We have to\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\nthink long term. The National Institutes of Health, as you can see, is \nat about $12 billion in spending right now. Under the Senate-reported \nplan, it will be frozen and will continue at that level. Right now, \nunder the President's plan, there is a proposed increase. It makes us \nfeel good because this is long-term investment for this country. But \nlook what is also in the document. Look what happens in 2001 and 2002, \nwhich is 5 years from now. There are drastic cuts in the President's \nplan for the National Institutes of Health--a valuable program that \nengages in life-saving research that will affect everybody's lives in \nthis body and all Americans lives in the future. It is this long-term \nview, not just the short-term view, that we must take.\n  We can look at another area, again, that I have been close to, which \nis veterans' medical care and hospital services. I have had the \nprivilege, over the last 12 years of my life, to spend every week \noperating in a veterans' hospital, either in Tennessee or in \nCalifornia. It has been a big part of my life to see the sort of care \nthat can be delivered to our veterans, who deserve this care. Well, \nonce again, we see in green on the chart what happens under our budget \nproposal, which came through the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. You can \nsee that over time, there is essentially a freeze of about $17 billion. \nBut contrast that with the realities that are in the President's \nbudget. The realities are that we have extreme and drastic cuts, over \ntime, into the year 2000.\n  Again, we will focus on the years 2001 and 2002. These charts are \nreally selected charts. You can go on and on, program by program. But \nwhat is important is for all of our colleagues to understand what \nhappens by putting in this budgetary gimmickry. These are just a few \nexamples, and there are many, many more. The simple fact is, Mr. \nPresident, that these cuts are never going to happen. I hope that they \nwill not happen because they are so drastic, and they would occur in \nfields that need sufficient funds. And that is, science, education, the \nenvironment, and the Veterans' Administration. People know that these \ndrastic cuts will never happen. We have this feeling put forward in the \nPresident's budget that we can spend more right now, and we can worry \nabout saving later, and that we can cut drastically later. This is not \nfair to the American people or to Members of this body.\n\n  We, as Senators and elected leaders, must avoid gimmicks when we are \ndealing with taxpayers' money. Earlier today, there has been a lot of \npointing as to what happened in the past, 10 years ago, and with \nasterisks, and 15 years ago. Well, it is a new day and time, and there \nare new people in this body, and we have come here and said, ``No more \ngimmicks. That is not what the American people want. No more smoke and \nmirrors. Let us address the problems that can be addressed in a \nbipartisan way.'' We know what the problem is and the problem is that \nwe have not been spending very smart in the past. We have been spending \ntoo much. Now is the time to avoid gimmicks and to spend smarter.\n  Again, I will also re-echo what my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut just said. This can be done in a bipartisan way; this can \nbe done bringing both sides of the aisle together. I hope that in that \nspirit of bipartisanship both sides of the aisle will come together and \njoin me in opposing the budgetary gimmicks and the budgetary smoke and \nmirrors that are in the President's plan, and support commonsense \nbudgeting.\n  Mr. President, at this juncture, I will yield 5 minutes to my \ncolleague from the State of Missouri, and that 5 minutes should be \ntaken off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank and congratulate my colleague from Tennessee. \nSenator Frist has put his finger on the real problem in this budget. \nThe President, in his budget, has glowing words, as several of my \ncolleagues on the other side have, about the priorities that they think \nare important. The President has said that we must invest in education \nand training, the environment, science and technology, law enforcement, \nand other priorities.\n  But, as I pointed out earlier today, when it comes to making these \nsets of numbers balance out, they have a meat ax, a paint-by-numbers \nmeat ax that whacks 10 percent out of all of those budgets in 2001, and \n18 percent in 2002. Now, are you for the priorities? If so, this is an \nopportunity to vote for some honesty in budgeting. The President has \nclaimed he gets to balance. I think most of the people in this body say \nwe want to get to balance. But do we really want to get to balance by \ntaking the drastic cuts that my colleague from Tennessee has just \ntalked about?\n\n  I talked earlier this morning about the cuts in NIH, National \nInstitutes of Health, FDA. Yesterday, I talked about the serious cuts \nthat would happen to the Environmental Protection Agency if you apply \nthis meat ax arbitrarily in 2001 and 2002, because the President's \nnumbers do not add up, unless you have the meat ax.\n  What the Senator from Tennessee is saying is, if you are serious \nabout this budget, serious about reporting a responsible budget that \ngets to balance, let us take a look at what your budget, as now \nproposed, would actually do. It savages some of the very programs the \nPresident said he wants to promote and defend on the way to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Well, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nif you are serious about establishing priorities, if you really believe \nthat numbers do not lie, if you believe that budgets should say what \nthey mean and mean what they say, let us get rid of the arbitrary cuts \nin NIH, funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program, funding \nfor child care, funding for the National Science Foundation, and NASA, \nand, yes, funding for the Veterans' Administration.\n  My distinguished colleague who has had experience in working with the \nVeterans, Administration knows how compelling the needs of those \nveterans are. I have visited facilities and talked with people who are \nfinding that the problems in those Veterans' Administration facilities \ncannot be dealt with.\n  If we follow this meat ax budget approach, we would be closing more \nthan one out of four veterans' facilities in the Nation. That means, as \nI said, California, with 11 hospitals, would lose 3, or probably 4. Our \nfriends from California might want to tell us which of these four \nhospitals would be closed; and Florida, with six facilities, would \nprobably lose at least one, maybe two; Illinois, with six, would also \nlose one or two; Massachusetts, at least one; Missouri, at least one; \nNew York, at least three, and probably four; Pennsylvania, at least \ntwo, and probably three; Texas, at least two; Ohio, at least one.\n  Do we arbitrarily want to close all of these facilities because we do \nnot want to meet our obligations to the men and women who have defended \nthis country who are either injured in war or who are now medically \nindigent? I cannot believe that is a serious budget proposal.\n  If my colleagues really want to pursue the President's budget and \ndefend his priority, then I urge them to vote for the Frist resolution \nso that they can go back and make some intelligent decisions rather \nthan taking a meat ax to the very programs the President said he wants \nas his priorities. His program would slash environment, children, \neducation, and health care for veterans. Mr. President, that is not \nacceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment which I think is very \nwell considered presented by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes off the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the fiscal 1997 budget \nresolution, we ought to take a good look at the history of what has \nhappened to the Federal budget in the last 15 years.\n  The fiscal records of Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan could not \nbe more different. For 12 years the Reagan and Bush administrations \nracked up $2.3 trillion a day. In fact, if we did not have to pay the \ninterest on the debt that was chalked up in these 12 years, the budget \nwould be balanced in fiscal 1996.\n  Just to be sure there was not too much confusion to make the point, \nlet me repeat that, if we did not have to\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\npay the interest on the debt that was stacked up in these 12 years, the \n12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations, $2.3 trillion worth of \ndebt, the budget would be balanced in fiscal year 1996. Not once did \nPresident Reagan or President Bush propose a balanced budget. \nFortunately, President Clinton's 3-year record is much different. \nPresident Clinton promised a change in 1992, and he has produced one.\n  If you would consider the following, it makes the point very clearly. \nThe deficit has gone down for 4 straight years. The deficit for the \nyear that we are in now is expected to be only $144 billion which is \n1.9 percent of our gross domestic product. This is the lowest annual \npercentage of any industrialized country. For example, Japan's deficit \nis over 3 percent of its GDP. Great Britain's is 7 percent, and Italy \nis 9 percent budget to GDP.\n  Finally, President Clinton is the first President to put forward a \nbalanced budget proposal since the 1974 Budget Act created the Budget \nCommittees.\n\n  So the question is no longer whether we will balance the budget. The \nquestion is how we will balance the budget. President Clinton has laid \nout the right way to balance the budget. He did exactly what the \nRepublicans demanded last year. He put forward a 7-year balanced budget \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  President Clinton once again has put forward a 7-year balanced budget \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office. His budget is much different \nthan the Republican budget. His budget protects Medicare and Medicaid, \neducation and the environment, and does not increase taxes on working \nfamilies. The President's budget not only protects 37 million senior \ncitizens from deep Medicare cuts contained in this budget but would \nalso make the Medicare trust fund solvent until the year 2006. It \npreserves the guarantee of Medicaid for 37 million seniors and disabled \npersons. It protects our Nation's environment by ensuring full funding \nfor implementation of the major environmental programs that so many \nsupport like clean air, clean water, and toxic waste cleanups. It makes \ncritical investments in education and training. It provides increased \nfunding for programs like Head Start, title I, and Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools.\n  Finally, the President's budget maintains the EITC, the earned-income \ntax credit, which provides tax relief for working families who earn \nless than $28,000 a year. This allows them to maintain their family \nneeds for basic essentials for sustenance.\n  The Republican budget is much different. It is punitive to working \nfamilies and senior citizens. In reality, the underlying budget \nresolution should be dubbed ``extremist budget, part 2.''\n  For example, they claim that they have lowered their Medicare care \ncuts. But have they? The answer is no. They claim that their cuts have \ncome down to the President's level. But they have not. In January the \nfinal Republican offer in the budget negotiations included a $226 \nbillion cut in Medicare over 7 years. This budget resolution calls for \n$228 million in Medicare cuts over 7 years. The number is virtually the \nsame.\n  These large cuts combined with their structural changes will truly \nmake Medicare, as it is said, ``wither on the vine.'' I think that \nquote comes from the Speaker of the House. If the Republican budget is \nenacted Medicare will become a second-class health care system.\n  The Republican budget also eliminates the guarantee of Medicaid \ncoverage for seniors, for the disabled, for children, and for pregnant \nwomen.\n\n  This budget continues the Republican assault on education. Over 7 \nyears the budget cuts $70 billion in education and training compared to \nthe President's budget.\n  This budget contains the Republican trashing of the environment. It \nwill cut environmental programs by 19 percent in the year 2002. It will \nslow down toxic waste cleanups.\n  I am not going to stand idly by, and neither are many, and watch this \npillaging of the environment go unchallenged. Senator John Kerry and I \nwill offer an amendment to restore these deep cuts in the environmental \nprotection programs.\n  Finally, their budget contains the Republican war on working \nfamilies. At the same time the Republican leadership is opposing an \nincrease in the minimum wage, they are also proposing a tax increase on \nworking families who earn under $28,000 a year. It is hard. It is \nunfair. And that is why this resolution should be called ``extremist \nbudget, part 2.''\n  Mr. President, as we heard the debate here, I have heard references \nto moral fiber; to the fact that the President lacks the moral fiber to \nproduce a budget that truly answers the question as to balance in 7 \nyears. Mr. President, when we talk about moral fiber I cannot help but \nthink about the moral fiber that is necessary to say to 12 million \nAmericans that you ought to make more than $4.25 an hour, that on $180 \nyou are still way below the poverty level, and when you go, if we \nfinally can get there, to $5.15 an hour, you are still being asked to \nget by on less than the poverty level.\n  Where is the morality of that issue? I cannot see it. We can talk \nabout the accountants' version of morality. That is what we are \ndiscussing. We are discussing whether or not this budget is balanced in \n7 years.\n  The President, President Clinton, has delivered on his promise, and \nthe budget deficit has come down 4 years in a row. It is the first time \nsince President Truman that has happened. And we question the moral \nfiber of the proposal? It is an outrage.\n  Part of the proposal put into the underlying budget resolution is a \nreduction, or the elimination, of much of the earned income tax credit. \nThat is the payroll tax portion of the incomes less than $28,000. Give \nit back--$28,000.\n  The poverty level for an individual today is $8,000 worth of income, \nand $11,000 for a family of three. But we are saying that even though \nthe average income is substantially above the $28,000 that we ought to \nraise taxes on those people. Does anybody have an idea how well you can \nsupport a family in the high-cost areas of the country on $28,000 a \nyear? At the same time, Mr. President, it is proposed that we furnish a \ntax break for those in the higher income levels. Under the original \nproposal, if someone earned $350,000, they would have gotten an $8,500 \ntax deduction, but we do not want to give a 90-cent raise to people \nmaking $4.25 an hour. It is outrageous. We ought not to loosely talk \nabout morality when we discuss these. If we want to discuss them as \nnumbers, if we want to challenge the figures, everyone has a right to \ndo that. But when we get into the subjective evaluations of what is \nmoral and what is right, it is more hokum than a serious evaluation of \nmorality.\n\n  Mr. President, I have had the good fortune to have spent a lot of my \nyears in the corporate sector, and I ran a fairly successful company. \nThe company today employees 29,000 people, the company that I started \nwith two other fellows, all of us from poor families in the working \ncommunity of Patterson, NJ. So I know something about the corporate \nworld, and I know something about how one conducts business. When I \nhear about how we have to achieve this balance in our budget, eliminate \nthe deficit in 7 years, I think it is a worthwhile target, but I think \nwe have to include in that evaluation which part of the budget is \nimportant and which part of it is simply paying attention and \nfulfilling obligations to special interests.\n  There are few companies worth their salt in this country that do not \nbrag about their creditworthiness, about their ability to borrow to \nmake investments in the future. Unfortunately, the accounting technique \nthat we use in Government does not permit us to take capital \ninvestments and amortize them over a period of years. They are treated \nlike cash investments. So we have a skewed view of what national \naccounting is about.\n  I announce here and now that I, too, want to achieve a budget \nbalance, but I do not want to do it on the backs of poor working-class \nfamilies. I do not want to do it on the backs of citizens who have been \npromised as they paid into the Medicare trust fund that they would get \nparticular benefits, that they had a contract with their Government. I \ndo not want to balance the budget on their backs. I do not want to \nbalance the budget on the backs of young people who desire and have the \nability to get an education who are not going to be able to get it if \nwe continue to cut into college loan funds.\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\n  So it is a question of not when we are ready to balance the budget--\nthe President has laid down a budget that will balance in 7 years; CBO \nsays they agree with him; they are the objective voice that we are \nusing here--it is only a question of how we get that budget balanced. I \nthink if we all work at it, we all try our best, we can achieve \nsomething that is fairer to all of the members of our society.\n\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the President's balanced budget \nand oppose the extremist Republican budget. Last year, we stopped the \nextremist Republican budget that gutted Medicare to pay for tax breaks \nfor the rich. They want to do it again.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask how much time we have on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the remainder of that time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon to use as he sees fit.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask, how much time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the Senator from Oregon if he would reserve \njust 3 minutes of his 15 minutes. We do have an offer we want to \npropound to the other side.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me say thank you to my friend from New Jersey as well \nand say that I think he has made a fine statement and offered much on \nthis issue with which I agree. I commend him for it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many Americans see the process of setting a \nbudget resolution as a murky, inside-the-beltway exercise that, \ncharitably speaking, leaves them confused and frustrated. More than \noccasionally I have shared this frustration. But Americans also know \nthat the decisions we make now are going to affect their futures and \nthe futures of their children and their grandchildren. At home in \nOregon, that means doing the hard work that the majority budget \nresolution simply ignores. At home in Oregon, it means making tough \nchoices, not politically expedient ones.\n  For example, it means fixing Medicare and Medicaid, not just sucking \nbillions of dollars out of these extraordinarily important health care \nprograms. At home in Oregon, we have ground down the cost of health \ncare and Medicare to one of the lowest per capita averages in our \nNation. Republican budget drafters could have built on Oregon's \nsuccess. They could have helped transform the Medicare Program, its \nmanagement and its finances, in a way to encourage innovation and \nequality and efficiency as we have done in much of my State. But this \nbudget simply cuts rather than transforms. It leaves behind many of the \nsame old problems in the Medicare Program, the problems that have seen \nso often results in rewards for inefficiency and instead again pounds \nthe vulnerable. I think it is a mistake, and I think it is possible to \ndo far better.\n\n  On the welfare reform issue, all of us understand this is a job that \nmust be done. Again, at home in Oregon, we found a way to make a real \nstart by reforming our health care system for the working poor and \nlaunching a new welfare-to-work program that is putting our citizens in \ngood-paying jobs. It took an up-front investment that is already paying \ndividends and is expected to be yet more successful in the future. But \nit took political will. It took reasonable public support to get the \njob done, and again I think this budget is not going to make that \npossible.\n  I am afraid this budget on the welfare reform issue promises a \nstillbirth for future efforts in other States by operating on the idea \nthat you can just out-cheap the system rather than transform it to make \nit work.\n  If you look at the budget offered by the majority, we would have to \ncut $56 billion more than the administration foresees for education and \ntraining. On one of the issues most important to the future of Oregon \nfamilies, this budget says it is more important to spend on a number of \noutdated military weapons systems than it is to support education and \nvocational training for our children who are going to need the skills \nand the experiences essential to compete in a global economy.\n  I say to my friends, the cold war is over. We won it. But the \nmajority budget does not reflect this reality.\n  The new war, the economic war that enlists every schoolchild in my \nState and across the country, is the one that we are going to have to \nfight aggressively. Our competitors in Asia and Europe shoot with real \nbullets. They are making stronger investments in education and training \nthan we are, and they are creating world standard, technical quality \nwork forces.\n\n  What is the response in this budget? The majority budget extracts \nfunds that we need for training and educating our schoolchildren and \nreinvests it in goldplated weapons systems that even the military \nquestions today. The majority budget goes on to cap the Direct Student \nLoan Program at 20 percent, a program that eliminates red-tape and \nmiddle-level bureaucracy in order to get funds to working families and \nstudents. Head Start would be frozen, eliminating opportunities for up \nto 20,000 children. And, while Americans across the country are talking \nabout the specter of corporate downsizing, this budget would deny \nassistance over the next 6 years through the Job Training for \nDislocated Workers Program to many of the workers in our Nation who \nhave lost their jobs.\n  On the environmental issue, an issue of great importance to our \nState, we see again how there is a retreat in this budget from much of \nthe great bipartisan progress that has been made in the last 20 years. \nFor example, in my State this bipartisan progress has led to effective \nstewardship of great natural treasures like Crater Lake and the Three \nSisters Wilderness. This budget would put that bipartisan tradition of \nenvironmental protection in reverse, simply by cutting the National \nPark Service budget by 20 percent below the administration's proposal. \nThis is going to force some parks to close, others are going to cut \nback on maintenance and access, and we are going to spoil, in my view, \nmuch of the important progress in environmental protection that has \nbeen made in the last few decades.\n  In the early 1960's, citizens of my State launched a huge public \nprogram to clean up the polluted Willamette River, a project that, at \nthat time, was one of the biggest and most expensive environmental \nefforts in our history. We understand the value of clean water and \nresource protection, and we were willing to pay the price of renewing \nthat great river. And that wise investment has been paid back many \ntimes.\n  The people of our State want to see those special values and \nenvironmental stewardship projected in this budget resolution. But this \nbudget makes a retreat from those values by cutting the environmental \nprograms nearly 20 percent in 2002. The budget would relieve polluters \nof certain Superfund cleanup costs and make every taxpayer shoulder new \nburdens. EPA enforcement activities would be rolled back, and there \nwould be fewer environmental cops on the beat.\n\n  I am particularly concerned that the need for salmon restoration \nfunds in the Columbia River and maintaining our fish hatcheries in this \nGreat Basin are priorities that again come up unattended and short in \nthis resolution.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides, one of the efforts I have \nbeen proudest of in my early days in the Senate was getting 34 Senators \nto join me in a letter that I authored, making it clear that it was \nimportant to get the nongermane and devastating environmental riders \nout of the omnibus appropriations bill. We were successful at that. The \nspending bill does not gut the environmental protections that have been \npushed so hard by so many for so long. If this budget resolution forces \na retreat on environmental protection, we will make the same effort, as \nthis process goes forward, to turn it around as we did in our \nsuccessful work in terms of getting the antienvironmental riders out of \nthe omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Let me conclude with a word or two about taxes. Oregonians want tax \nreform and they believe that this should be a priority as part of this \nbudget resolution. But this majority budget cuts taxes in strange and \nmysterious ways\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nthat many of my constituents challenge. A $500 per child tax credit for \na person making $110,000 per year? How does that square against \nincreasing taxes to low-income working families, families that work \nhard, that play by the rules, and have had a chance to see work \nrewarded under the earned income tax credit? This budget, \nunfortunately, retreats, in terms of support for working families that \nare struggling to get ahead. It retreats on the question of Medicare \nand Medicaid. And I believe, as a result of those changes, we are going \nto see lower quality health care, a sicker pool of individuals relying \non those Government programs, and we will see, as a result of the tax \nchanges and the health changes, a significant reduction in the \nopportunities that all of us want to see for individuals in these \npublic programs who want to get out having that opportunity to do so.\n  The proposed cuts in Medicaid would end guaranteed health coverage, \nfor example, for 36 million Americans. For seniors, the $250 billion in \nMedicaid cuts over 7 years risks cutting off prescription drugs, home \nand community-based care, and assistive devices such as wheelchairs. I \ndo not think our families can afford those additional burdens.\n  So, as we now go to the amendments on this issue of extraordinary \nimportance, let us look beyond the cold, stark figures of the budget. \nBudgets just are not about numbers, they are about the hopes and \naspirations of the American people. We have to get a balanced budget. \nThe families of my State balance their budgets. It is important for the \nCongress to balance the Federal budget as well. But it has to be \napproached in a way that ensures a sense of fairness, that sacrifices \nare not just singled out for those who do not have political power. Let \nus make sure that this budget resolution, this budget resolution which \nwould provide an opportunity to reform Medicare and Medicaid in a way \nthat Oregonians have already begun, would be pursued by the Congress as \na whole.\n\n  I am happy to yield time to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I would explain we would just \nlike to assure the vote is after 2 o'clock and we will be delighted to \nvote on this amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 2 minutes and \n25 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do we have a unanimous-consent agreement \nnow we are going to vote on the Frist amendment at 2 o'clock?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We do not yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. We have 2 minutes and 30 seconds we would like to \nuse.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, does the Senator from Tennessee have any \nadditional time he would like to use?\n  Mr. FRIST. We still have 13 minutes on our side. If we have time, the \nSenator from Michigan would like to use some of that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In any event, I ask unanimous consent we vote on the \nFrist amendment at 2 o'clock, and there be no intervening amendments or \nrequests for votes in the interim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to just ask--we would like to \nuse a few minutes off the bill as well as this 2\\1/2\\ minutes. We would \nlike to do that. Under the rules, are we permitted to do that? Would I \nhave that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You may choose what block of time you would \nlike.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to add to the 2 minutes another 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are you yielding it from the time on the \nresolution?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes; that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am a little bit puzzled by the amendment the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has offered because it is an amendment regarding a \ntrigger that is supposedly in the Democratic budget that is on the \ntable, and there is no trigger mechanism in the budget we have offered. \nI ask my colleagues to carefully peruse this document, and you will not \nfind a trigger mentioned in the budget that is before you.\n  So this is really a phantom amendment about something that is not \nhappening in the Democratic budget. Behind me is a chart which shows \nthe Democratic budget that we have before us, and it shows that the \ndiscretionary spending is fairly close between the two budgets, the \nDemocratic one and Republican one, despite the fact Senators on the \nother side have decried steep reductions in veterans, so on and so \nforth. That is not true. There is no trigger in this budget. We spend \n$65 billion more on discretionary spending than does the Republican \nbudget.\n  So, in our view, this is a kind of bizarre situation. We are happy to \nvote for the Senator's amendment because we agree that we do not want \nto see deep cuts in the outyears, and we do not have them in our \nbudget. So we would be happy to take this without a vote, although \nSenator Domenici says he prefers a record vote. We are happy to do \nthat. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota who has comments to make \non this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it seems to me a mistake has been made \nhere, and I do not know the genesis of the mistake. As I understand it, \nwe have an amendment that has been offered that suggests there should \nnot be a triggered reduction in discretionary spending pending certain \nevents, and there is no such trigger in the legislation before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Momentarily--I will be happy to yield, just briefly.\n  Mr. FRIST. The word ``trigger'' is not used, but if you look in \nfunction 920 of the document--I do not have it before me, I will have \nit shortly--you will see a series of numbers, and in those series of \nnumbers the trigger is spelled out in actual numbers. So the effect of \nthe trigger is spelled out in function 920, and that is what we are \naddressing.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a matter of fact, not a matter of conjecture. \nThere is no trigger that would automatically reduce discretionary \nspending pending certain events in the future. If we are going to \nlegislate this way, maybe we should legislate against four or five \nother triggers that do not exist. As long as there is no prohibition \nagainst legislating to prohibit things that do not exist, let us amend \nthis by saying, ``Let's prohibit a trigger that would reduce defense \nspending.'' There is no such trigger, but why not add that.\n  I do not quite understand the circumstances here. There is, in fact, \na trigger that given certain circumstances would allow an increase in \ncertain discretionary spending, but there is no trigger that would \nprovide for the decreases that are the subject of this amendment.\n  In fact, the important point here is contrary to the assertions that \nhave been made on the floor of the Senate yesterday and today about a \nwhole range of issues, including funding for the NIH, funding for the \nEPA and others, contrary to those assertions, the budget that has been \nproposed by the President would provide more spending in these areas. \nIn the aggregate, it proposes more spending in the discretionary \nspending accounts because that represents what he believes to be a \npriority.\n  We have the circumstance of people coming to the floor of the Senate \nsaying, ``We want more spending''--the majority party--``We want $11 \nbillion more spending on defense. We want to buy trucks the Defense \nDepartment did not ask for, planes they do not need, ships they do not \nwant. We want to spend it on defense.''\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\n  The President has said he believes we ought to spend slightly more on \ndiscretionary spending than the majority party is proposing. But this \namendment is a real Trojan horse. It seeks to preclude something that \nhas not been proposed, and if that is a new standard of amendments, \nthen let us have fun by precluding a dozen additional proposals that \nhave never been made. But it is not, in my judgment, a very sensible \nway to legislate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the Senator for participating in this. As \na member of the Budget Committee, I will tell you right now, we have \nlooked at this document. There is no word ``trigger'' in it. The \nSenator from Tennessee, who wrote this, admits there is no word \n``trigger.'' And yet, he has a sense-of-the Senate amendment that says \nthe discretionary spending caps should not include triggers. We agree. \nThat is why the bill we have put forward, the Democratic budget, has no \ntriggers.\n\n  This is what it has. We have used these numbers. They are $65 billion \nmore than the Republicans have put forward, and they are complaining \nthat we cut the budget too much--we cut the budget too much. They spend \n$65 billion less on veterans, $65 billion less on all of these \ndiscretionary spending areas.\n  So this amendment is a phantom amendment, and that is why we are \ngoing to support it, because we do not like the idea of a trigger. We \nhave not offered a budget that has a trigger, so why have an argument \nabout it?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I simply observe, it seems a waste of the Senate's time \nto have a record vote on an amendment designed to prohibit something no \none proposed. It might be fun to offer an amendment like this, but it \nserves no purpose and will simply delay the Senate.\n  I think the Senator from California, I think the Senator from \nNebraska also said, since this has not been proposed, if someone feels \nthe urge to offer an amendment to prohibit something not proposed, we \naccept it. It seems to me irrelevant and nonproductive to have a record \nvote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are ready to do a voice vote, but if the chairman \nwants a record vote that has nothing to do with the budget on the \ntable, we will vote for it.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be referring to function 950 in the \namendment. This is the President's policy which is laid out, the \nnumbers that were put before us in the President's bill. Let me just \nread, again, what that policy is, and I quote page 13 of the \nPresident's budget:\n\n       In case the new assumptions produce a deficit in the year \n     2002, the President's budget proposes an immediate adjustment \n     to the annual limits or caps on discretionary spending, \n     lowering them enough to reach balance in the year 2002.\n\n  June O'Neill from the Congressional Budget Office came before our \ncommittee, and I will quote from her testimony on April 18, 1996. She \nsays:\n\n       The basic policies outlined in the President's budget would \n     bring down the deficit to about $80 billion by the year \n     2002 instead of producing the budget surplus that the \n     administration estimates.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me finish this line of thinking. We are going to have \na deficit in the year 2002, according to CBO, using the policies set \nforth in the budget presented by the President of the United States. \nThat is the President's plan. The President does have a trigger in his \nplan, and it is spelled out in function 950, which I ask you to refer \nto. Correction, 920. And if you look on page 41, those triggers, the \ntrigger in the reduction is actually spelled out in numbers. The \ntrigger has already taken place, and what my sense-of-the-Senate \namendment simply says is that those triggers, which result in drastic \nreductions in the year 2001 and 2002, which are spelled out on page 41 \nof this document, are already written and worded right now. Those \ntriggers have taken place.\n  My sense-of-the-Senate amendment says those drastic reductions \nspelled out in actual numbers, as spelled out in the policy by the \nPresident of the United States, are wrong.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate that. I yielded to the Senator when he \nasked. I enjoy the opportunity to discuss this. I guess the Senator's \npoint is accurate with respect to what he read from the document in \nfront of him. That is not what is before the Senate.\n  Will the Senator not agree with me that is not what we have laid \nbefore the Senate, and if that is the case, you are talking about \nsomething we are not debating today?\n  If I can make one final point. When you talk about cuts, there is not \nany way to deny that the amount of discretionary spending proposed by \nthe majority party is substantially less than the amount of \ndiscretionary spending proposed by the President.\n  So those two questions: Is it not true that we are debating something \nhere that is not before the Senate? And what is laid before the Senate \ndoes not contain a trigger; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. To answer the Senator's question, is this the President's \nbudget? This is the President's budget. I read the policy. The budget \nis spelled out in actual numbers on page 41 of function 950, the actual \nnumbers which is the trigger in place, the actual numbers of policy \nspelled out in the document.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to my colleague from Michigan on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I think we should begin by just reminding everybody \nwhat we are about. Pending is an amendment to the Republican budget \nresolution which would substitute the President's budget for our own. \nSo I will incorporate here in my comments remarks both about that \nbudget itself, as well as the amendment by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The President's budget, in my judgment, is quite deficient in a \nvariety of ways. We can call it a balanced budget if we want to, but as \nthe amendment before us reveals, it is only a balanced budget if \ndrastic reductions in discretionary spending take place in the final \nyears of that budget. But that is not the only problem with the budget.\n  First, and foremost, I believe the budget is inadequate to deal with \nthe Medicare crisis which faces this country. We know already that the \nMedicare part A trust fund is headed towards bankruptcy. We have not \ngotten the most recent projections of the trustees of the Medicare \ntrust account, but we believe that the date of bankruptcy will be much \nsooner than anticipated just a year ago when the majority attempted to \ntry to address the problem and were thwarted by the President and the \nminority.\n  The fact is that Americans expect the trust fund to be solvent. Right \nnow the trust fund is paying out more than it is taking in. It will \nreach insolvency far sooner than anticipated. What we have attempted to \ndo, in the budget that the majority has presented here today, is to try \nto keep that trust fund solvent for 10 years.\n  The President's budget attempts to do that by simply removing a very \nvital part, home health care, from the trust fund and moving it off the \ntrust fund somewhere else.\n  If that is the way we are going to approach Medicare, Mr. President, \nthen who knows what will be taken out of the trust fund next. Americans \nhave a right to expect that trust fund will remain constant, that the \nitems covered will remain protected, and that every time we face a \ncrisis, Congress does not simply remove more and more parts of the \ntrust fund and eliminate the coverage it provides.\n  By moving them, as they have in the President's budget, the President \nand his budgeteers are, in fact, moving some $55 billion of trust fund \nresponsibility to the taxpayers as part of the general account. That is \nnot the way to guarantee the solvency of Medicare, and it is in \ncontrast to Republican efforts to ensure Medicare's solvency for 10 \nyears its solvency in the budget we have presented.\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\n  The second concern I think needs to be addressed is the issue of \ntaxes. As Senator Gramm just a few moments ago indicated in a series of \ncharts that the tax burden faced by America's hard-working families is \nthe highest in the history of this Nation. Indeed, if the President's \nbudget becomes the law of this land, under this budget we will move to \nthe highest federal tax burden ever.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, under this budget, social spending \nwill also reach record highs at 17.3 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of this country. That means more and more working families \nsending more and more dollars to Washington to pay for more and more \nprograms that Americans find to be overbloated, bureaucratic and, in \nmany cases, unnecessary.\n  That is not the direction we should head, Mr. President. That is why \nthe President's budget sends us in the wrong direction.\n  To just once again comment on the tax portion of this budget, as I \nsaid, it heads us toward the highest tax burden in history. There has \nbeen an effort in the budget to address the question of high taxes with \na purported tax cut. But when one examines the President's budget and \ncalculates all the taxes that are cut and all the taxes that are \nraised, what you come up with is a final bottom line number of $6 \nspread over 6 years. Distributed to 250 million American people, that \nworks out, Mr. President, to $4 per year per American.\n\n  I have talked to the taxpayers in my State. When they think in terms \nof getting a tax break, they at least were hoping for something \nslightly more substantial than that, Mr. President. The $4 a year will \nnot make much of an impact on the hard-working middle-class families of \nmy State or any of the other States.\n  But I would like to more totally focus my comments at this point on \nthe amendment before us to this budget. In this amendment, we are \ntrying to address what we consider to be the truly extremist issue \nbefore us today. That is the proposal that in the final 2 years of this \nbudget we will see drastic cuts, across the board virtually, in the \ndomestic discretionary spending programs, huge cuts, cuts which I think \ngo way too far. I think probably most of my colleagues, one way or the \nother, would agree they go too far.\n  To approach balancing the budget in this fashion, to approach it by \nhaving all of these cuts happen somewhere in the far distant future, \nand to happen at this drastic of a level, literally 100 percent of the \nPresident's discretionary spending reductions happening in the years \n2001 and 2002, in my judgment, totally undermines any validity to claim \nthat this is a balanced budget.\n  This is the same thing as having a family say, ``Well, we're running \nin the red right now. We're spending more money than we take in. We've \ngot to correct this. The way we're going to do it is not by addressing \nthe problems over a period of time, this year, next year, and the \nfollowing years, but 5 years from now we're going to eliminate all our \nexpenditures on food.''\n  That might make the budget of the family balanced in the fifth year, \nbut it is unrealistic and wholly improbable that in one year an \nAmerican family is not going to consume any food. The same way, it is \ninconceivable that 100 percent of the discretionary spending cuts are \ngoing to take place in the final 2 years of this budget to achieve \nbalance. Neither will happen, Mr. President.\n  For those reasons, I think the approach that is taken in this \namendment is on track. I think we have to make a clear statement to the \nAmerican people that we are not going to achieve a balanced budget with \nany kind of cook books, any kind of gimmickry, any kind of last-year \nchanges of this magnitude. We are going to go at it in a responsible \nway.\n  So for those reasons, Mr. President, I am pleased to support the \nFrist amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the situation? Do we have a unanimous consent \nto vote at 2 p.m. on the pending amendment? What exists with reference \nto time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Senator Frist's side has 1 \nminute 50 seconds. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes. The \nremainder of the time can be taken from the general-issue pool.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, while the distinguished manager of the bill \nis here, I will just make a comment or two and see if we cannot do \nsomething to move this process along. I understand that a rollcall vote \nhas been demanded on that side of the aisle, which is surely their \nright to demand a rollcall vote. I understand--I do not know who it \nis--but someone on this side of the aisle could not be here to vote \nuntil after 2 o'clock.\n  I simply point out that we are wasting an awful lot of time. In the \ncommittee, as the chairman knows, this Senator has tried to move things \nalong. On the floor, this Senator has been trying to move things along.\n  Here we are debating a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which we all \nknow has no effect in law whatsoever. But if we are going to spend this \nmuch time on sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that have no effect in \nlaw, and then put off votes that should have occurred an hour ago until \nsome time after 2 o'clock--if that holdup is on our side, I apologize--\nI simply say that I guess we have given up all chances of finishing \nthis bill by tomorrow night as was clearly stated was the goal.\n  Since that goal was stated, we have had one vote. We have been locked \npretty much in meaningless debate in the view of this Senator, since \nyesterday morning at 9:30. We had only one vote yesterday. Like \nyesterday we came in at 9:30 this morning. Here we are at 2 o'clock \nthis afternoon and we are continuing to move around, politicize and \nquestion the motives of others.\n  We have so much to do in the U.S. Senate. I would have liked to have \nseen this finished by tomorrow night. I recognize now that is \nimpossible. I simply say that this Senator is interested in reducing \nthe number of the amendments that we have, as best we can. I simply say \nI hope we do not get tied up for this lengthy period of time as we have \non the amendment before the Senate. We have agreed to accept the \namendment.\n  Earlier today I said we had 31 or 32 amendments. We now have 51 \nDemocratic amendments on this side of the aisle. If we take as much \ntime on those and other amendments that I am sure are pending on that \nside, we could be here through July 4th on the budget resolution, \ntalking past each other. We have agreed to accept this meaningless \namendment by voice vote, but that is not good enough. Why? I do not \nquite understand. I simply say I think we are bogging down this process \nin an unreasonable manner. I renew my pledge to do whatever I can to \nexpedite the process.\n  I do not think there is any question that the majority is going to \nvote down the budget of the President of the United States, which is \ntheir right. Why do they not just go ahead and do it and move on with \nthe process?\n  I renew my pleading to the chairman that we move forward and expedite \nthis process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. I very much \nwant to not use up our time. Senator Hutchison would like to have some \ntime before this 2 o'clock time. She has been waiting a long time.\n  Let me suggest to my good friend, Senator Exon, first, if the Senator \nwants to work with me to establish policy for the rest of this debate, \nthat sense-of-the-Senate resolutions--what was your word--are \nirrelevant, unnecessary.\n  Mr. EXON. I said it had no effect in law, which it does not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will make a deal with you. We will get a grand \nagreement. You do not offer any of them, we will not offer any of them. \nI put that before you, since sense of the Senates have no effect in \nlaw. We are ready to negotiate. Just have real amendments from now \nuntil tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock and we will be finished with \nthis. I am authorized to speak for the majority leader. We intend to \nfinish this budget resolution this weekend so people who have plans \nbetter start talking to our leaders about how they might help us get \nthis budget resolution finished. Everybody has plans, but\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\nwe have plans to get a budget resolution finished. Frankly, I think we \ncan. I look over the list of amendments on our side. I have not had a \nchance to look over them on your side. I will shortly.\n  Frankly, I do not know why, from now until 3:30 tomorrow afternoon, \ngiving us until 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock tonight, and a nice chunk of \ntime tomorrow, we could not get it finished.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this amendment. The interesting thing \nabout this amendment and the budget tendered by the minority, they may \nhave pulled the trigger but they have replaced it with a giant plug. \nThere may be no trigger but there is a plug. The plug is $67 billion \nout there in a little compartment of Government called function 920. \nYou do not have to tell anybody how you got there, just put $67 billion \nin. What it will do, who it will hurt, what it will cut, is not \nitemized, as ours is. We would like to make sure that the vote says we \nwant to pull the plug, pull the trigger on that plug so it is not \nthere.\n  Having said that, Senator, I seriously will work with you to try to \nnarrow what we are doing and get on and try and get this done. Thank \nyou for your cooperation.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your cooperation. This is an \nirrelevant amendment, a sense of the Senate that we should not have \ndebated as long as we have. But we have. Talk about plugs, the kettle \nkeeps calling the pot black.\n\n  I simply cite on page 43, line 20, there is a $43 billion plug in \nyour budget. Take a look at it. Maybe you can explain it. I simply say \nthat it seems to me we keep blaming each other for the delays, when it \nis a responsibility of both of us. I think this sense-of-the-Senate \nmatter is irrelevant. That is why I agreed to a voice vote. But you are \nentitled to a rollcall vote.\n  I yield 4 minutes off my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not a debate about plugs and \ntriggers but a debate about that we feel is important in terms of \ninvestments for the future of this country. I am going to speak, after \nwe have voted on this amendment, about the budget more generally. I \nwant to stay on this subject because I think it is very important to \nlay out the facts.\n  The facts are these: If you get rid of all the discussion about any \ntriggers, all the discussion about plugs, the question of who is \nspending more or investing more in discretionary spending, especially \nnondefense discretionary spending, is not a serious question any longer \nat all. The President's budget proposes more investment in the kinds of \nthings that many of us think are very important--college financial aid, \nHead Start, cops on the beat, the WIC Program. Things that we think are \nimportant are going to be better funded in the President's budget.\n  Now, the majority party says their priority is to add $11 billion \nabove what the Pentagon asked to be spent to buy trucks, planes, ships, \nand submarines that the Pentagon did not request. They want to add $11 \nbillion in that spending. Then they want to make the case that somehow \nthey are spending more money in discretionary spending than the \nPresident's budget. It is simply not true.\n  If you pull out the defense numbers from that chart, which is \nincluded in discretionary spending, the Republican budget would put $10 \nbillion less in nondefense discretionary, which means that the \nRepublican budget over those 6 years is $116 billion below the budget \nsubmitted by the President in budget authority--$116 billion below in \ndiscretionary spending.\n  You cannot paint those numbers any other way. That chart does not \nlie. That chart, if you take out the $11 billion increase in defense \nthe majority party wants, would show a wider gap in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. The President is requesting a much more \nsubstantial amount of spending in things like Head Start, WIC, \neducation, student financial aid, cops on the beat, and a whole series \nof those issues than would exist in the majority party budget. They \nwould have us believe somehow with charts and all kinds of tapdances \naround these numbers that they are proposing more funding for \ndiscretionary spending. It is simply and demonstrably not true. That is \nthe point that is important as we cast this next vote.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has it absolutely right. I do not know why \nwe are wasting time voting on a proposal to eliminate something that \ndoes not exist, but, I suppose, some people will feel better if they \ncan amend something that did not exist and maybe we can have six or \neight more of these, but it wastes time and accomplishes nothing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has been consumed. \nThe Senator would now have to yield time on the resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield time from the resolution to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Domenici \nand Senator Frist for all the work they are doing to try to draw \ndistinctions between the President's budget, which is before us as an \namendment, and the underlying budget resolution, which is the \nresponsible budget resolution that really balances by the year 2002.\n  My colleagues have said that the President's budget balances and that \nit provides for middle-class tax relief. The American people want a \nFederal budget that balances, and they also want to keep more of the \nmoney that they work so hard to earn. But let us look at the \nPresident's budget and let us respond to the demands of the American \npeople. As Paul Harvey would say, ``Now it is time for the rest of the \nstory.''\n  Let us look at the issue of balance. I really think the President \ncannot have a straight face when he says his budget balances, when more \nthan half of the cuts--more than half--come in the last 2 years--2001 \nand 2002--of the 7-year period the budget covers. There are $600 \nbillion in cuts over 7 years, and some $350 billion of those are in the \nlast 2 years.\n  I think it is very obvious that whoever is elected President this \nyear, 1996, is not going to have to face the issues in the year 2001 \nand 2002, because there will be yet another President.\n  I do not think we can, responsibly, with a straight face, pass the \nPresident's budget and tell the American people that we have done the \nresponsible thing. I want to use some examples of what the President's \nbudget does. Take NASA for an example. Under the President's budget, \nthe NASA budget lopes along about where it is now for 3 years, and then \nit drops 10 percent over 2 years. Now, that is not a responsible \napproach toward a research, technology, or scientific endeavor. How can \nyou be midway into an experiment and, all of a sudden, not have the \nmoney for it?\n  The Republican budget, on the other hand, has steady declines in the \nNASA budget, for which they can prepare. NASA officials can see very \nclearly what is going to happen and plan how they are going to have to \nallocate their resources.\n  Let us take defense spending, another example. The President is \nproposing another $3 billion in cuts this year. That would make it the \n12th straight year of decline in defense spending. Today we spend only \na little more than one-half of what we spent on defense in 1985. \nWeapons purchases alone are down 70 percent from 1985. And here we are, \nat a time when we have American troops all over the world that are \nseeking to keep peace in some way or another; while we must maintain \nthe highest defense readiness, and we are looking at a major technology \ninitiative in theater missile defense to defend against the very real \nballistic missile threat to our country and our troops in the field; \nwith all these priorities, we are looking at a Presidential budget that \nreduces defense spending again.\n  Now let us look at tax cuts. The President's budget has a tax credit \nof $300 per child up to the age of 13. But the tax credit is only \ntemporary, because it ends if a balanced budget isn't reached in the \nyear 2002. And, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nPresident's budget will not be balanced by the year 2002.\n  By comparison, the Republican budget, the underlying budget, has a \npermanent tax credit of $500 up to the age of 18 for middle-income \ntaxpayers. That is\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\na big difference to an American family. Anyone who has a teenager knows \nthat those are the years when you face the most urgent demands on their \nhard-earned income.\n  Let us talk about the homemakers of this country. The budget that is \nunderlying--like the budget that we sent to the President last year and \nwhich was vetoed--hopefully will include homemaker IRA's. But the \nPresident's budget does not. He does not think that the work done \ninside the home is every bit as important as the work done outside the \nhome. Therefore, he did not provide for the retirement security options \nfor the homemakers of this country. We must not stand for that. We must \nmake sure that this year we do address that terrible inequity, so that \na one-income-earner family and a two-income-earner family will have the \nsame retirement security options. It is only fair that homemakers have \ntheir retirement nest egg and that one-income-earner families, who are \nsacrificing to have a homemaker at home when their children come home \nfrom school, will not have to suffer in retirement years.\n  So there are big differences between the President's budget and the \nbudget that we are trying to pass today. We must reject the President's \nbudget. It is a hollow budget. The balance will only occur if we make \nhuge cuts in the year 2001 and the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for Congress to act responsibly, to \nhave cuts that are sloping very gradually, so that agencies or people \nthat are entitled to benefits will know exactly what is there in a \nresponsible manner. The cuts in the rate of growth of spending should \nbe gradual, not staying at the same level until no one around here will \nbe in office anymore, and then cutting to the bone and saying, ``Oh, \nyes, we are going to set the budget numbers, but we are going to let \nyou in the future make the tough decisions.'' No, Mr. President, now is \nthe time to make the tough decisions, and that is the issue before us.\n  Are we going to do the responsible thing for our children and \ngrandchildren for the future of this country, or are we going to adopt \nthe President's budget that is before us on the floor right now, which \nwill not really balance? Those tough decisions being put off now will \nnot be any easier then. Most certainly, we cannot expect a defense \nbudget to go up, down, and back up. Nor can we afford to have an \nexperiment at NASA proceed to a certain point and then drop off the \nface of the Earth--figuratively speaking.\n  Mr. President, that is not responsible. We know it, and the American \npeople know it. Let us do the responsible thing and reject the \nPresident's hollow budget and make the real tough decisions now. That \nis what the American people asked of us in 1994. It is what we \npromised. Let us keep the promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes before the vote. There is \nno time remaining on the amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nimmediately to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 114 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Dole\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3968) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me tell my colleagues where we \nare. Frankly, we have a long way to go. Once again, I am urging that \nSenators on our side--and I will yield to Senator Exon on his side--we \nneed all the amendments, everybody who has an amendment to get us the \namendment or at least the substance of it. We are going to try to work \nsomething out so we can get out of here at a reasonable time.\n  We are not anywhere close to that. I think on our side we have 22 \nproposed amendments. We are looking them over, first with staff and \nthen with various Senators.\n  Senator Exon has a tentative list that is not even completed, of how \nmany?\n  Mr. EXON. Fifty-one.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is 51, and 22, that makes 73 amendments.\n  Our leader has told me his desire is that we finish this budget \nresolution over this weekend. That means we have all night tonight and \nwe have all day tomorrow and perhaps we have part of Saturday. I know \nthat brings a lot of grumpy looks on lots of faces, because I am sure \neverybody has something they planned to do tomorrow. I have great \nrespect for that. But if I am the general, I will do the job. If I am \nthe follower, I will do the job. Right now, I am the follower. I am \ndoing what the leader suggested.\n  We are going to be here a long time unless we can reach some \nagreement. In fairness, we are working with the minority leader and \nwith Senator Exon, who is being very cooperative, to see how we can \nnarrow this down.\n  Maybe my colleague could report to the Senate from his side?\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the chairman for bringing this up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We need order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, everything he said I second. The way we \nare going we will not be through even if we would stay here all weekend \nincluding Sunday. The way we are going that would not be enough, we \nwould not get out of here until July 4 sometime, and I am not saying \nwhat year. We must move this ahead, not only because I think we are \nwasting a lot of time but because we have other things that we must \naddress.\n  I say to the leader, we are sending out a hotline at the present time \nto try to get an agreement that all the Democratic Senators would file \namendments with me by 4 o'clock, or maybe 5 o'clock. I think something \nlike that would very likely be acceptable on my colleague's side. Then \nwe would know how many amendments we have and we might be able to work \nout something so we can maybe come to a reasonable agreement and if \nnecessary go over sometime until next week, which I think everyone \nwould like to do.\n  But we are not going to do that, I suggest, following up on the \nstatement of the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, as \nhe has just indicated, unless we can have some movement. I think we can \nget that small amount done, and that small amount is simply to get the \namendments listed as we have previously. I think that can happen, but I \ncannot commit to that now because we are running a hotline. But I \nbelieve that\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nwill come to pass. I think the immediate thing we have to do is decide \nwhere do we go from here? The Senator from Nebraska is interested in \ngoing to a vote as soon as possible on my amendment offered this \nmorning at 9:30, to have a vote on the President's budget. We have had \na lot of debate on it. I do not know whether we shed much light, but we \nhave had a lot of debate.\n  In the meantime, I understand the next amendment on that side, and \ncorrect me if I am wrong, is an amendment that is supposed to be \noffered by the Senator from Missouri. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I am looking at this for the first time now. Is this a \nsense of the Senate? It is not a sense of the Senate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, sir, it is a substantive amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been here listening to the dialog \nbetween my colleague from Nebraska and the Senator from New Mexico, the \nmanager of the bill. I just have a question maybe one of them can \nanswer.\n  I have been faithfully attending to my duties here in the Senate the \nlast 3 weeks. Frankly, we have not been doing anything. We have been \nplaying here on the gas tax, minimum wage, and something called the \nTEAM Act. What, all of a sudden, when we finally have something we can \nwork on that is substantive --what is the rush? Why, suddenly, are we \ngoing to work like we have not been working before? Is there some \nreason suddenly we have to work on these very weighty issues into the \nmiddle of the night and on weekends?\n  Mr. EXON. I do not know for sure how to answer my friend and \ncolleague from Nevada, except to say I do not think it would hurt the \nimage of this place very much, in the public mind, if we would at least \nappear to be getting something done. That is the reason that I have to \nsay we should move on this more expeditiously. But I think the question \ncan more likely be answered by the chairman of the committee, with whom \nI have been working. I suspect maybe that is who the question was \ndirected to anyway.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nebraska had the floor. I certainly am \nwilling to work whatever hours anyone wants. I, like most Senators \nhere, when there are not things going on on the floor, still have lots \nof work to do on committees.\n  Mr. EXON. May we have order in the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I will await the judgment of the manager of the bill and \nthe Democratic manager of the bill and be available whenever it \nrequires. My only comment was that we have not been doing a great deal \nthe last few weeks and I hope since we are on the bill now \nsubstantively, where we do not have the opportunity to offer an \namendment on minimum wage which 90 percent of the American public \nwants, that we can handle this--expeditiously, of course--but I see no \nreason to treat this bill any differently than we do other bills. There \nis a lot of work that needs to be done and I think we should do it in \nan expeditious fashion, not necessarily work in the middle of the \nnight, on weekends, on this bill when we have not been doing it on \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would say to my good friend, Senator \nReid, from Nevada, it is not like we are trying to hurry this thing \nthrough. We almost always have agreed to waive substantial portions of \nthe time on budget resolutions. Almost every evening as we went out we \nwould say we have agreed to use up 5 hours or 7 hours, and I am \nchecking so we will know and next time we can answer you, how we have \nbeen doing that.\n  Second, it is very important we get this finished because we want to \ngive the Appropriations Committee--the Senator serves on that \ncommittee--we want to give them their numbers at the earliest possible \ntime so the 13 appropriations bills can be done early this year, rather \nthan holding them over until December and maybe next year.\n  In addition, we are not in any way talking about forbearing, \nprecluding amendments. We are talking about whether we really need to \ndo 75 amendments.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield, I understand. I know how hard he \nhas worked on this bill.\n  I do say, however, the budget resolution was not reported on time. I \nsay to my friend from New Mexico, and I am not speaking for anyone \nother than myself, I have listened to the debate on this. I think it \nhas been a productive debate to this point. I think it has been good \nfor the Senate. I think it has been good for the American public to \nhave this debate.\n  I hope this budget resolution can be debated in its entirety. I think \nwe need to have debate on the issues. I say to my friend, I agree with \nmy friend from New Mexico, I do not think we need 75 or 100 amendments \non this budget resolution but there are some substantive amendments \nthat I think we need to fully debate and arrive at conclusions on.\n  My only point is, as my friend knows, he works hard, I work hard. I \nam willing to do that. I just am a little bit concerned that there is \nsome attempt to stop a full and complete discussion on this, one of the \nmost important matters we are going to decide all year. But I \nappreciate the courtesy of explaining the Senator's position.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have just received word, I want to \nsay--Senator Daschle is here--I just want to say we are going to have \nSenator Bond's amendment ready in 5 or 10 minutes. He will come down \nand offer it. In the meantime, I want to say it is the intention of the \nmajority that we proceed well into the night to see how much time we \ncan use and how many amendments we can take care of.\n  I wanted to make sure you knew that, your Senators know that, and I \nam informing ours right now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I hope we can get a \ngood debate on amendments. We have a number of them we are prepared to \noffer just as soon as we dispose of the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished ranking member. We will be prepared to offer those. I \nassume we will alternate back and forth.\n  I think it is good to put Senators on notice that we will be here \ntonight. We are prepared to vote, and we ought to continue as we are.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                COAST GUARD BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with an extensive shoreline in Washington \nState, the Coast Guard plays an important role in protecting those \npeople who rely on the waters of the Columbia River, Puget Sound, and \nthe Pacific Ocean for commercial and recreational purposes. Whether it \nis dangerous search and rescue operations, enforcement of existing \nfishing treaties with Canada, or maintenance of navigational aids, the \nCoast Guard does its job and it does it well.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I included language in the report \naccompanying the budget resolution that commends the Coast Guard for \nboth its current operations, as well as its efforts to streamline and \nreduce its overall budget. Under Adm. Robert Kramek's leadership as \nCommandant of the Coast Guard for the past 3 years, the Coast Guard has \nreduced its work force by 4,000 positions and lowered its budget by \n$400 million per year. All of this done without reducing any valuable \nservices to the general public.\n  In all of the debate over the next 9 months regarding funding for \nspecific programs, I hope that the fiscal year 1997 Coast Guard budget \nappropriately reflects the efforts being made by Admiral Kramek and all \nof his staff to provide better government at less cost, while still \nproviding important services to the citizens in Washington State and \nacross the country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum just for a few \nmoments until Senator Bond arrives and that it be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long does the Senator desire to speak?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ten minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5111-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5140-S5142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE MORAL CHARACTER OF CONTENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, after 3 years of inaudible policy on \ndrugs, the administration is suddenly trying to find its voice. \nNaturally, after not having been used for so long on this issue, the \nvoice is a bit rusty and unsteady. For those of us not used to the \nsound after so long a silence, it is just a little hard to make out the \nmeaning. At the moment, the meaning sounds a lot like a New Year's \nresolution--full of seasonal promises. It is not too clear just what is \nbeing said or how much faith we ought to put in this election-year \nresolution. It is also not too clear if what is being said bears any \nrelationship to the issue being addressed.\n  The question is, Is the voice speaking from principle or opportunism? \nThe answer lies in finding clues to see whether we are in the presence \nof conviction or convenience. Sincerity, after all, is not measured in \nthe volume of one's words or the lofty sentiments with which they are \npressed. It is to be gaged by actions that match rhetoric. It is \nmeasured not in sound bites or self-serving gestures but in commitments \nmade and promises kept. It is signified by candor and stout-\nheartedness. It is judged by deeds. It is marked by courage. And it is \ngenerally easy to tell the difference between stage-managed courage and \nthe genuine article. The genuine article generally has a past and a \nfuture because it is based on substance, on character. Its history is \nnot one of fair-weather friendships and will-o'-the wist obligations. \nThe counterfeit tends to swell on cue and to fade when the audience \nleaves.\n  So, as the administration clears its throat on the drug issue, it \nmight be timely to take a look at the content and context of the \npronouncements that are likely to ensue. At the moment, the new-found \nconviction of the President on the drug issue, as I said, looks a lot \nlike a New Year's resolution. It is probably only a coincidence that \nthis new year is also an election year. I hope, however, that the \npresent resolution is a little sturdier than most New Year's \ndeclarations--so full of promise and so short on fulfillment. We do \nhave some guideposts to go by to decide whether what we have on the \ndrug issue reflects principle or calculation.\n  It is no secret to the press or to many in the public that the \nPresident is candor-challenged. He has a problem with consistency when \nit comes to what he says. And much of this fidelity deficit seems to \nowe a lot to expediency. The question is, Does policy grow from sound \nfoundations or from what sounds good at the moment? It was one of the \nchief advisers to the President who gave us some insight on this. As \nMr. Stephanopolous told us, to this President, words are actions. Just \nlisten to what I say, don't look at what I do--or say tomorrow.\n  There is something of the magician in this philosophy. It is, after \nall, essential to the illusionists' art that you be distracted by words \nfrom what the hands are up to. Thus, it is possible to have no \nconsistent policy but to claim one. It is possible to have mismanaged \nforeign affairs and assert the opposite. It is possible to have reneged \non a bounty of campaign promises and to call it keeping faith. It is \npossible to make a virtue of having offered no fiscally responsible \nbudgets while blaming others for the lapse. It is possible to have \ndiscovered the drug issue on the eve of an election and then to \ndenounce critics as playing politics. And all of this with an elegant \nturn of phrase.\n  But there is more involved here than words. We have actions to guide \nus, to help us go beyond the sleigh of hand. What do they tell us when \nit comes to sincerity on fighting drugs? In this case, actions do speak \nlouder than words.\n  The echoes of the Inauguration balls were hardly over before the \nPresident cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the Nation's \ndrug czar--by 80 percent. That gesture was not an economy it was a \nmassacre. It would also seem to be a statement about the importance of \ndrug policy in the President's own household. But it was not singular.\n  The new-car smell of the administration had hardly dissipated when \nthe Nation's chief medical officer, the Surgeon General, suggested we \ncould legalize our way out of the drug problem. The tepid condemnation \nthat followed from the President did nothing to foreclose this line of \nthinking. In fact, the idea of normalizing drug use has gathered \nstrength in the last few years. But this was not all.\n  The administration also cut interdiction funding. This controlled \nshift in the priorities in our interdiction policies produced \nuncontrolled muddle here and abroad. We may not have scared our enemies \nwith this policy, but we successfully confused our friends and our own \npeople. But the story does not end here.\n  Along with these actions, the President also abandoned the bully \npulpit. This is, perhaps, the truest measure of intent. If there is one \nthing that the President is able to do, it is to talk. He has a gift \nfor words. We must ask ourselves, knowing this, why the President spoke \nvirtually not at all on the drug issue for 3 years? What does this say \nabout a commitment to the drug issue? In over 1,700 utterances in 1994 \nalone, illegal drugs were mentioned less than a dozen times. As they \nsay, ``silence is golden.'' This is a silence that speaks volumes. But \nthere's more.\n\n  In these years of just say nothing, the nature of our drug problem \nbegan to change. Although we still had a hardcore addict population \nlargely resistant to our efforts to treat them, we had made major \nstrides in reducing use, particularly among our young people. Between \n1980 and 1992 we had succeeded in reducing so-called casual use by more \nthan 50 percent for all drugs, and over 70 percent for cocaine. We had \nsucceeded in persuading young people that drugs were both dangerous and \nwrong to use. That is now changing.\n  Since 1992, teenage drug use has surged. The age of people using \ndrugs has dropped. The belief that drugs are dangerous and wrong has \nreversed. Popular culture once again abounds in drug glorification \nmessages. The legalization movement is better funded and organized, and \nhas found allies like William Buckley. Much of the media has declared a \nmoratorium on discussing drugs--unless it is to give space to \nlegalization arguments. All of this in 3 years, and all of it with \nhardly a word from the Nation's leading wizard of words.\n  If the past is any guide, then, we need to approach the present born-\nagain resolution on drug policy with some questions about its meaning \nand purpose. In this regard, I was struck by comments in several \nleading periodicals about the new resolution on drugs coming from the \nWhite House this election year. These may give us a hint about the \nfuture, about whether the President's new found voice speaks from \nprinciple or poetic license.\n  The Weekly-Standard, a policy journal, recently editorialized that \n``Bill Clinton is mostly talk. He enjoys daily political combat and \nnegotiates its demands with rare talent. But he has never been much for \nactual, week-in, week-out government. Over any given administrative \nterm in his long career, the Clinton record is thickly stained with the \nevidence both of his personal disengagement and of the ideological \ninclinations of his loosely supervised appointees.'' The piece further \nnotes, ``So the early months of a Clinton election year always look the \nsame: He mounts a slick and furious propaganda offensive to muddy that \nevidence, the better to confuse and silence his opponents. What looks \nbad, Clinton knows, can often be made to look good--if you jabber about \nit enough.''\n  If this view is any indication of the depth of the recent \npronouncements on drug policy by the President, then we are in the \npresence of a pretty shallow reservoir. We have words filling in for \naction. But this was not the only comment on the President's newly \nfound vocabulary on drugs.\n  A recent piece in the Wall Street Journal noted that ``Bill Clinton's \nretreat in the drug war is among the\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\nworst sins for which his administration should be held accountable.'' \nThe editorial reminds us that the President didn't inhale. It also \nreminds us that ``some dozen White House employees, including senior \nstaff, had been `requested to be part of an individual drug testing \nprogram' because of their prior drug history.'' But past indiscretion \nmay be no guide to the future.\n  The Journal piece, however, touches on something more fundamental. \nSomething that I have talked about before that may be more telling. \nThis involves the character issue. The Journal notes, `` * * * we would \nlike to know exactly why Bill Clinton took a powder on the drugs wars * \n* * .'' It then adds, `` * * * the heart of our complaint with this \nPresident's attitude on drugs has to do with what we would call its \ncharacter, its moral content.''\n  It goes on to make the following point: ``Unlike the Reagans, you \nwill never see the Clintons articulating the war on drugs as an \nessentially moral crusade * * * the Clintons, like the generation of \nliberal constituencies that  they lead, are going to be rhetorically \ncorrect, believers in the powers of bureaucratic healing--and \nnonjudgmental.'' In other words, Clinton is unable to be a leader on \nthis issue because his opinions on the subject have no fixed address. \nIf this is an accurate assessment, then the President's newly found \nfervor on the drug issue is likely to have moved on by next November. \nIf true, the present commitment will not last much beyond the echo of \nhis pronouncements. It is not based on principle but on opportunism.\n  There are many more news accounts about the President's election-eve \nconversion. These provides us with more insight on how we are to judge \nthe present situation. They do not give us a definitive answer. We must \njudge for ourselves. But there is not much in the past to indicate that \nstrong principle informs the present sincere-sounding rhetoric. It must \nhave content not just context. For the content to be serious, it must \nbe backed up by character. Without principle what confidence can we \nhave in the words? What we need, what we are looking for, is not \nresolutions but resoluteness. We do not live by words alone. But it \nseems that words are all we are likely to get.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these news items be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 2, 1996]\n\n                           Waiting to Exhale\n\n       Now, in April 1996, with eight months left on a four-year \n     term, Bill Clinton flies the press into Miami so he can be \n     seen standing shoulder to shoulder with General Barry \n     McCaffrey, a decorated war hero he's enlisted to lead a war \n     on drugs. Standing among school children Monday, the \n     President poured his great rhetorical heart onto the drug \n     war. Along the way came these key words: ``Make no mistake \n     about it, this has got to be a bipartisan, American, \n     nonpolitical effort.'' Translation: Don't blame me for this \n     problem, especially during an election campaign.\n       In fact, Bill Clinton's retreat in the drug war is among \n     the worst sins for which his Administration should be held \n     accountable. After years of decline in drug use, recent \n     surveys make it clear that a younger generation of Americans \n     is again at risk (see the chart nearby). The number of 12-to-\n     17-year-olds using marijuana increased to 2.9 million in 1994 \n     from 1.6 million in 1992. Marijuana use increased 200% among \n     14-to-15-year-olds during the same period. Since 1992, \n     according to large surveys of high school students, there has \n     been a 52% increase in the number of seniors using drugs \n     monthly. One in three report having used marijuana in the \n     past year. Private anti-drug advocates such as Jim Burke of \n     the Partnership for a Drug Free America and Joe Califano of \n     Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse \n     have been running alongside this drug fire, yelling for help \n     to anyone who'd listen.\n       Better late than never, of course, and it is good that Mr. \n     Clinton wants to mend his ways with General McCaffrey. We \n     applaud the appointment and think General McCaffrey has \n     sounded many right notes. Legalization, he says, ``is out of \n     the question.''\n       A quarterly regional analysis put out by his office brings \n     the problem up to date: ``A recent New York State high school \n     survey reports that 12% of New York teens said that they \n     smoked marijuana at least four times a month, double the \n     number in the 1990 survey,'' Discussing ``Emerging Drugs,'' \n     the report notes methamphetamine's popularity in the San \n     Francisco area: ``in addition to its use by young users who \n     combine it with heroin (`a meth speedball') it can also be \n     found in `biker's coffee,' a combination of methamphetamine \n     and coffee popular among young, fairly affluent urbanites.'' \n     Additionally, the report notes that ``Club drugs, a name \n     which generally includes MDMA, Ketamine, 2c-B, LSD, \n     psilocybin and a range of other hallucinogens, are \n     increasingly mentioned in this quarter.''\n       These recent events are not a coincidence. The drug retreat \n     was the result of a series of explicit policy decisions by \n     Mr. Clinton and those around him. Which is why we think it is \n     worth focusing on the meaning of his wish that the anti-drug \n     war be ``bipartisan, American, nonpolitical.'' This means \n     that between now and November's election no one is allowed to \n     utter the phrase ``didn't inhale.'' No one is allowed to \n     remember Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders talking about drug \n     legalization, even as her own son was arrested and convicted \n     on drug-sale charges.\n       Nor should anyone be allowed to bring up White House deputy \n     personnel director Patsy Thomasson's admission to a \n     congressional committee that some dozen White House \n     employees, including senior staff, had been ``requested to be \n     part of an individual drug testing program'' because of their \n     prior drug history. Ms. Thomasson's experience in these drug \n     mop-up duties extends back to her days in Arkansas when she \n     took over the business of Dan Lasater--Little Rock bond \n     dealer, Clinton campaign contributor and friend-of-brother \n     Roger--while Mr. Lasater served prison time for ``social \n     distribution'' of cocaine. This week Mr. Lasater is \n     testifying before the Senate Whitewater Committee, and we \n     assume he will be asked to enlighten the committee about the \n     millions of dollars of mysterious trades that his firm made \n     through an account without the knowledge of the account's \n     owner, Kentucky resident Dennis Patrick.\n       On matters of pure policy, among Bill Clinton's first acts \n     was to cut spending on the war. The staff of the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy was cut to 25 from 146. Drug \n     interdiction funds were cut. The number of trafficker \n     aircraft seized by Customs fell to 10 from 37 in FY '93-'95. \n     Drug czar Lee Brown wandered the nation's editorial pages \n     seeking the public support he rarely got from his President. \n     New York Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel announced: ``I \n     really never thought I'd miss Nancy Reagan, but I do.''\n       Finally, about a year ago, Mr. Clinton received a stinging \n     letter from FBI Director Louis Freeh and DEA director Tom \n     Constantine, charging that the President's anti-drug effort \n     was adrift. So now we have General McCaffrey, who says, \n     ``There is no reason why we can't return America to a 1960s \n     level, pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.''\n       Sorry, General, but pre-Vietnam America is not coming back. \n     General McCaffrey's current President is a founding member of \n     the generation that transformed America in the years of \n     Vietnam and those that followed. It bequeathed to all of us a \n     culture and ethos of such personal and moral slovenliness \n     that we must now enlist a battle-hardened soldier to save the \n     children of the anti-Vietnam generation from drugs. It is \n     perhaps the most perfect, bitter irony that when these \n     parents now exhort their children to stop using marijuana (of \n     a strain that is significantly more potent than anything they \n     dabbled in), the kids reply: ``Why should we? We're not \n     hurting anyone.''\n       Basically, we'd very much like to know exactly why Bill \n     Clinton took a powder on the drug wars after he became \n     President. There was in fact a rationale of sorts offered at \n     the time for the change in tone and direction. In contrast to \n     what was thought to be the Republican approach of throwing \n     people in jail for drug offenses, the Clinton approach would \n     emphasize prevention and treatment. There is a case to be \n     made for prevention and treatment, but the heart of our \n     complaint with this President's attitude on drugs has to do \n     with what we would call its character, its moral content.\n       Unlike the Reagans, you will never see the Clintons \n     articulating the war on drugs as an essentially moral \n     crusade. With its emphasis on treatment and programs and \n     prevention, it is mainly the kind of effort that the \n     sociologist Philip Rieff identified as the triumph of the \n     therapeutic. Rather than the school-marmish Nancy Reagan, the \n     Clintons, like the generation of liberal constituencies that \n     they lead, are going to be rhetorically correct, believers in \n     the powers of bureaucratic healing--and nonjudgmental. In \n     their world, no one is ever quite caught for disastrous \n     personal behavior or choices. Instead of absolution, there \n     are explanations.\n       This, in our opinion, is the real reason the drug war waned \n     when Bill Clinton became President. The message this new \n     President sent to his young, yuppie, MTVish audiences was \n     that he was just too cool to go relentlessly moralistic over \n     something like recreational drugs. Sure he had an anti-drug \n     policy in 1992 and a czar and speeches, but Bill Clinton \n     wasn't going to have any cows over the subject. Surely, the \n     drug-testing White House staff understood that much.\n       We don't doubt that a lot of people in this country, \n     especially parents of teenaged and pre-teen children, would \n     very much like to rediscover General McCaffrey's pre-Vietnam \n     world of less constant cultural challenge. But the people who \n     turned that culture upside down, making it a daily challenge \n     for parents, have at last been given the chance to run the \n     government. But this death-bed conversion on drugs simply \n     lacks credibility. As much as we applaud General McCaffrey's \n     new offensive, only a triumph of hope over experience could \n     lead anyone to believe it would be sustained past November if \n     Mr.\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n     Clinton and his crowd are returned to the White House.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, May 13, 1996]\n\n                  General Clinton, Losing the Drug War\n\n                            (By David Tell)\n\n       Bill Clinton is mostly talk. He enjoys daily political \n     combat and negotiates its demands with rare talent. But he \n     has never been much for actual, week-in, week-out government. \n     Over any given administrative term in his long career, the \n     Clinton record is thickly stained with the evidence both of \n     his personal disengagement and of the ideological \n     inclinations of his loosely supervised appointees. So the \n     early months of a Clinton election year always look the same: \n     He mounts a slick and furious propaganda offensive to muddy \n     that evidence, the better to confuse and silence his \n     opponents. What looks bad, Clinton knows, can often be made \n     to look good--if you jabber about it enough.\n       This is your president's brain. And this is your \n     president's brain on drugs: Clinton is justifiably nervous \n     that his credibility gap in the nation's drug war--still a \n     major public preoccupation--might be exploited by Republicans \n     in the fall.\n       Candidate Clinton didn't inhale. President Clinton's \n     surgeon general, Joycelyn Elders, made repeated \n     pronouncements on the virtues of drug legalization. Before \n     the ink was dry on his presidential oath, Clinton gutted the \n     White House drug office with a two-fold, shabby purpose: \n     satisfying a campaign pledge to trim his staff, and purging a \n     hundred-odd career civil servants whose only sin (shades of \n     Travelgate) was to have worked under a Republican \n     administration. That massacre remains the president's best \n     known drug-war initiative; three years later, he has spent \n     very little time on the effort. ``I've been in Congress for \n     over two decades,'' Democratic Rep. Charles B. Rangel grumped \n     late last year. ``I have never, never, never seen a president \n     who cares less'' about drugs.\n       So it is now, predictably, ``inoculation'' season, as the \n     Clinton campaign embarks on a weeks-long media tour designed \n     to portray the president as fully and effectively engaged in \n     the war on drugs. Much of it is typical hokum. A talk-show \n     schlockmeister has been recruited to produce anti-drug \n     television commercials; ``Montel Williams's leadership on \n     this crucial effort is inspiring,'' burbles the White House. \n     A Gallup poll on the drug war has been commissioned, as the \n     White House admits without embarrassment, ``to demonstrate \n     thinking which will support our efforts.'' And the president \n     himself--in a spare Miami moment between rounds of golf and \n     multimillion-dollar Democratic fundraisers--has unveiled a \n     ``new'' drugfighting strategy. He is ``working hard in \n     Washington,'' he tells a group of network cameramen and \n     middle-school students. And his work is paying off, since \n     ``every year for the last three years. . . . drug use has \n     dropped.''\n       We'll come back to this falsehood in a moment. Were the \n     Clinton drug-fighting record purely a matter of Elders-like \n     bloopers and mere inattention, the president's current show \n     of concern--and the debut of his newly minted tough-guy \n     ``drug czar,'' retired army general Barry McCaffrey--might be \n     sufficient protection against GOP election-year complaints. \n     But it really isn't true that Clinton has done ``nothing'' \n     about drugs, as Republicans may want to charge. It's worse, \n     far worse: His administration has engineered the most \n     significant redirection of federal drug policy in several \n     decades. This is a poorly reported story. And an alarming one \n     that begs for informative political debate.\n       Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the federal \n     government pursued what might fairly be described as a ``do \n     everything'' strategy against illegal drugs. Executive-branch \n     agencies conducted crop eradication and criminal \n     investigative efforts in foreign countries. They launched \n     ``interdiction'' programs against smugglers operating in the \n     so-called transit zone between those countries and the United \n     States, and on our borders. They undertood a dizzying variety \n     of law-enforcement, drug-prevention, and rehabilitative-\n     treatment initiatives here at home. It was a richly funded \n     campaign; total federal spending on the drug war rose nearly \n     700 percent between 1981 and 1992. And it roughly coincided \n     with a more than 50 percent decline in the rate of overall \n     drug use nationwide, from its historical high in 1979 to its \n     subsequent low in the final year of the Bush administration.\n       There was a standard Democratic critique of government drug \n     policy during this period of Republican presidencies: The \n     executive branch was supposedly placing exaggerated emphasis \n     on efforts to reduce the supply of illegal drugs to American \n     neighborhoods, and shortchanging an equally necessary \n     therapeutic approach to addicts and schoolchldren. The drug \n     war's most visibly warlike aspects--its overseas and \n     interdiction programs--were subjected to particular scron. As \n     the Customs Service was spending millions of dollars to get \n     radar balloons tangled in high-tension electical wires on the \n     Southwest border, the scoffers said, cocaine addicts went \n     homeless and died for want of bed-space in federally funded \n     treatment facilities.\n       Of course, it is a simple fact that federal law can only be \n     enforced by the federal government, and that effort--G-men \n     and prisons, most obviously--is intrinsically more expensive \n     than even the most lavish education and drug-treatment \n     programs could ever be. And so the federal drug budget will \n     always be heavily weighted toward ``supply reduction'' (and \n     away from ``demand reduction'') activities. Even in a \n     Democratic administration. President Clinton still spends \n     twice as much money on restricting drug supply as on ending \n     demand.\n       But he is spending it very differently. Democratic \n     hostility to drug-war ``militarism'' is alive and well in the \n     Clinton administration. Under his supervision, the federal \n     government is now conducting an anti-drug effort almost \n     exclusively inside the United States. At our borders and \n     beyond, the drug war has, for the most part, been canceled. \n     By formal White House directive.\n       In 1993, the administration instituted what is technically \n     called a ``controlled shift'' of federal drug-war assets. \n     Money and personnel devoted to anti-smuggling efforts in the \n     Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and on the U.S.-Mexican border \n     were ostensibly redeployed directly to the Latin American \n     countries in which most illegal drugs originate. But that \n     redeployment has never actually occured. The federal drug-\n     budget accounts from which any new Latin American initiative \n     could be funded are 55 percent smaller today than in 1992. \n     The old-fashioned anti-smuggling effort has been ``shifted'' \n     to nowhere. It has been eviscerated.\n       The result? Coast Guard cocaine and marijuana seizures are \n     down 45 to 90 percent, respectively, since 1991, In 1994, the \n     Customs Service let two million commercial trucks pass \n     through three of the busiest ports-of-entry on the Mexican \n     border without seizing a single kilogram of cocaine. Between \n     1993 and early 1995, the estimated smuggling ``disruption \n     rate'' achieved by federal drug interdiction agencies fell 53 \n     percent--the equivalent of 84 more metric tons of cocaine and \n     marijuana arriving unimpeded in the United States each year. \n     Drug Enforcement Agency figures suggest that cocaine and \n     heroin are now available on American streets in near-record \n     purity--and at near-record-low retail prices.\n       Which can only be evidence that the supply of illegal drugs \n     on American streets has significantly expanded on Bill \n     Clinton's watch. Because the only other possible explanation, \n     that the demand for drugs has fallen, is at variance with the \n     facts. The president was sadly mistaken--or, well, he lied--\n     when he told those Miami schoolchildren that American drug \n     use ``has dropped'' every year since he took office. Drug use \n     has steadily risen since 1992, especially among the young. \n     Overall teenage drug use is up 55 percent. Marijuana \n     consumption by teenagers has almost doubled.\n       This is a pretty striking picture of deliberate government \n     decision-making gone disastrously awry. It's the president's \n     fault. He has proposed nothing to correct it, Gen. McCaffrey \n     and Montel Williams notwithstanding. And he should be called \n     to account. All the president's facile election-year \n     speechifying aside, there are serious differences of \n     personnel and policy that divide this Democratic \n     administration from the Republican administration that would \n     replace it in 1997. Where the drug war is concerned, as in so \n     many other respects, those differences should be clear. They \n     do not flatter President Clinton.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has made a 10-minute \nattack on the President on an issue dealing with the fight on drugs. I \nask that the same courtesy be extended and that I be permitted to speak \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5140-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5142-S5143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FIGHT ON DRUGS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say, Mr. President, that it always \nsaddens me when the floor of the U.S. Senate is turned into a place to \ndebate issues regarding the Presidential race. I think it is very \nimportant that when things are stated on the floor that are not true, \nwe have an opportunity to respond. I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for giving me that opportunity.\n  There is a lot of talk around here about the failure of this \nPresident to crack down on the issue of drug enforcement. I want to set \nthe record straight. Federal drug prosecutions are up 13 percent from \n1994. Federal prosecutors achieved an 84 percent conviction rate in all \ndrug cases in 1995. So we are beginning to see a change. During the \npast 3 years, there has been a 9.4 percent increase in prosecutions of \nthe toughest, most complex drug cases. There are now about 48,000 \nconvicted\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\ndrug dealers in Federal prisons, three-fifths of the total Federal \ninmate population, and the highest number in history.\n  There has been a drug-testing initiative. The President ordered \nFederal prosecutors to seek drug testing of all people arrested on \nFederal criminal charges, and is seeking $42 million to fund this \ninitiative in 1997. These tests will help Federal judges determine \nwhether a defendant should be granted bail.\n  The Justice Department has funded 65 grants, totaling $8.5 million to \nhelp communities establish and expand drug courts that help break the \ncycle of drugs and crime. The 1994 Crime Act authorized $1 billion \nthrough the year 2000 to support State and local drug courts.\n  So, Mr. President, people can come down here and make speeches about \nour President. But at least have the facts. I think this President, and \nevery President, is entitled to the facts. Who is the President that \ncame up with the idea of putting 100,000 cops on the beat? It was this \nPresident of the United States of America, Bill Clinton, who came up \nwith the idea that we need more cops on the beat, because it is \nprevention to have cops on the beat, it is prevention to have community \npolicing. It is the other side of the aisle that wants to rescind that \nlaw providing 100,000 cops on the beat and replace it with a block \ngrant, and who knows where the money will go. We want cops on the beat. \nWe are on our way to getting it done. Which President signed the \nViolence Against Women Act? I am so proud of that because I worked with \nSenator Joe Biden on it for 5 long years. It was this President. And we \nare going after violence in domestic situations. We are going after the \ncrime of rape. We are working toward making streets safer. Do we have a \nlong way to go? Of course, we do. This is complicated.\n\n  Clearly, if we can get drugs out of society, there will be a decrease \nin crime. We know there is a definite correlation here. We have a \nPresident who understands we need enforcement and understands we need \nvery good people to prosecute these cases. We have a President who has \ncracked down on the border. I come from California, and we are seeing \nan entirely different situation down there, with large increases in the \nBorder Patrol, and with the U.S. attorney who has just done wonders \nwith the conviction rate of second-time criminal aliens coming back \ninto this country from Mexico. He has prosecuted more of them in 1 year \nthan the previous 5 years altogether.\n\n  So when we come down to this floor and we start to use it as a debate \nover the Presidential race, I wish we would not do it. But if we do it, \nlet us be honorable about it. Let us be factual about it. This is the \nPresident who fought so hard to take prevention, effective prosecution, \nenforcement, interdiction--take all of those aspects of fighting drugs \nand putting them into one policy, getting through an effective crime \nbill, and making sure that in fact we are waging an effective war on \ndrugs. This is the President who understands this issue.\n  So I want to thank my chairman of the Budget Committee for giving me \nthis opportunity to put into the Record what the record truly is. And \nthe fact of the matter is since I have been here all I have heard from \nmany on the other side is a desire to repeal the crime bill, repeal the \nban on assault weapons which are used by gangs, repeal the Brady bill \nwhich has kept weapons out of the hands of 67,000 people who have had \nmental health problems in the past. We do not want those people getting \nguns.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to correct the record.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5142-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5143-S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous agreement the debate on the \nBond amendment is limited to 1 hour.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, this is a simple amendment. It \nincreases function 700 for veterans by $13 billion over the period of \n1997 to 2002, and to pay for that it increases the reconciliation \ninstructions for welfare reform by $13 billion which raises the total \nnumber under the President's plan from $39 to $52 billion.\n  I think it is time that we get back to talking about the budget which \nis the subject in front of us today. We have just had a very clear-cut \nindication in this body that people want to talk about a real budget \nthat does not make drastic cuts in the last year. They said it was a \nbad idea. This is the first good opportunity to vote on the President's \nproposal to achieve the balanced budget by taking a tremendous whack \nout of discretionary programs including those items which he cited as \nhis high priorities in the last 2 years.\n  I am very pleased that our colleagues unanimously on both sides of \nthe aisle said that did not make any sense, and that we should not go \nat it in a meat ax way. I think we ought to start taking a look at \nresponsible adjustments to try to bring this proposal back into the \nrealm of reality.\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\n  The amendment that I have just offered has a series of numbers. Those \nnumbers ensure VA medical care will not be one of the victims of the \nPresident's drastic outyear cuts, and it also restores the cuts \nproposed for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000 before the trigger--before \nthe cap--hits.\n  My amendment would bring the VA medical care up to what is included \nin the Senate Republican budget proposal, an almost $13 billion add-on. \nAs I said, it offsets this by asking for greater savings in welfare.\n  Let me address the second part of that first. After 30 years of ever \nmore expensive and less effective approaches to poverty, last year \nCongress came up with a plan that we sent to the President which he \nvetoed which would have reformed welfare in a meaningful way. I think \nour approach struck a fair balance between the role of the Federal \nGovernment in providing a safety net and giving States increased \nresponsibilities. You would have saved $64 billion over 7 years in the \nprocess.\n  Since the creation of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, public \naid has been regarded as an entitlement. If you meet the requirements \nfor eligibility, you receive the cash with no strings attached. The \ncurrent system has been rightly maligned by persons from all walks of \nlife, including researchers, advocates, politicians, and even the \nrecipients themselves. They know the system does not work. The system \nis impersonal. It is inefficient. It encourages continued dependency.\n\n  I am concerned that, if we do not require recipients of public \nassistance to work, or at least behave responsibly, or take steps to \nwean themselves from public assistance, our efforts at reform are just \ngoing to be another word for more of the same.\n  Our welfare bill which passed the Senate overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis had a real work requirement. In that bill, we also \npermitted States to implement reform ideas without undertaking a \nlengthy and cumbersome waiver process. States who wanted to require \nwelfare recipients to obtain preventive health care for their children, \nor to ensure their children stay in school and wish to allow recipients \nto keep more of their earnings from a part time job--all of them a good \nidea--now have to go through a waiver process from HHS. It is costly, \ntime consuming, and silly.\n  I have addressed before a silly problem that came up in Sedalia, MO. \nYou have heard me talk about this on previous occasions. But this is \nthe example of what the Federal law, as it now stands, does not permit \nStates to do. The State of Missouri working through their local family \nservices office and the employers in the area decided in Sedalia, MO, \nto try a pilot program to get people jobs in an expanding new industry \nin town. People seeking food stamp assistance were sent, if they were \nable bodied, to the employer for job interviews. If they were offered a \njob then they got off the need for food stamps. If they refused to show \nup, or if they were offered a job and refused it, then the State could \nsanction them, and did not have to give them food stamps. There was a \nreal incentive for these people to make an effort to get work. A lot of \nthem did get work. Some of them did not like the work that was offered. \nThey went out and took another job. That is fine.\n  A lot of people in that community who had been depending upon public \nassistance went back on the work rolls. Two of the people, however, who \nwere sent to the employer they failed the employer's mandatory drug \ntest. When they went back to the State the State could not cut them off \nof welfare, or food stamps in this instance, because they had failed a \ndrug test. And the State wants a waiver. The State said this is crazy. \nAnd they are right. If we want to get people off of welfare and to \nwork, and we prohibit States from saying, ``If you cannot get a job \nbecause you failed the drug test, then we will pull you off the welfare \nrolls. We will not give you assistance.'' That means, if somebody wants \nto stay on public assistance and get food stamps, or welfare, all they \nhave to do is take drugs. What a perverse incentive.\n\n  The State has been battling to get a waiver. My view is the States \nshould not have to get a waiver. The States ought to be permitted to \nmake those commonsense determinations and see what works.\n  The current system that President Clinton is defending by his vetoes \nkeeps those nonsensical requirements in place.\n  Where States, despite the best efforts of the Clinton administration \nto keep control, have been able to implement significant reforms the \nresults have been astounding. Welfare caseloads have dropped to 25 \npercent from 30 percent in some States including Massachusetts, \nIndiana, and Michigan. That is why we are here. More families are able \nto obtain self-sufficiency which has the added benefit of saving the \nFederal Government money.\n  As I pointed out, the welfare reform plan that we sent to the \nPresident which he vetoed would have saved $64.1 billion over 7 years. \nIn this amendment before us I am proposing that we save $53 billion in \nwelfare programs so that we can keep a promise we made to our Nation's \nveterans who risked their lives for us that they would always have \nhealth care.\n  This, I would think, is not an unrealistic number. The Senate Budget \nCommittee plan calls for $54 billion in welfare savings. Some of the \nsavings would be achieved in the Supplemental Security Income Program, \nwhich, as the fastest growing entitlement, desperately needs reform. We \ncan make these savings by reforming the programs and returning them to \nthe States for them to administer, thereby eliminating huge Federal \nbureaucracies.\n  I think the people of America want to see us get serious about \nwelfare reform. If you believe what the President says--he says we want \nto change welfare as we know it--I think it is time we did what the \npeople want and the President says rather than rely on the President's \nveto to keep the status quo.\n  Now, what this will do on the other side, for the Veterans' \nAdministration patients, is to ensure that when they need health care \nthey are not going to be denied. The people who are served in Veterans' \nAdministration facilities around the country are the ones who have been \ninjured in combat overseas and/or those who are medically indigent.\n  This is where they are cared for--in all of these locations. These \nare 170 Veterans' Administration facilities across the Nation. Last \nyear, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that we could \nnot have a flatline of spending in veterans affairs because it would \nresult in closure of four of those hospitals. Frankly, there are \nsavings that can be made in the Veterans' Administration, and I think \nthat those savings are being pursued in the health care area by Dr. Ken \nKizer and others. But there is no way that an almost 25-percent cut, \n$12.9 billion, can do anything but devastate the program. Millions of \nveterans will not be served. At least a quarter of these hospitals and \nveterans facilities will have to be shut.\n  Pick a State, any State. As I mentioned earlier, some of the major \nStates like California would probably have to have three or four \nclosures. My home State of Missouri would have to have at least one \nclosure. All of the States with veterans facilities would be faced with \nlosing some of those facilities, as well as service to many of their \nmost needy people.\n  Massachusetts would lose at least one; Washington, at least one; \nTexas, two; Pennsylvania, two, probably three; Illinois, with six \nfacilities, one or two; and Florida, the same position, at least one or \ntwo. I do not think that is acceptable. When we asked the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, who came before our committee, to comment on these \nproposals, he said he could not live with that scenario.\n  He did not like our scenario, which was a flatline, but I believe \nthey can live with that. But he sure cannot live with a scenario that \ntakes a tremendous whack out of the budget and, beginning after 1997, \ntakes funding for the Veterans' Administration in a precipitous \ndecline. That is why I think we need to have a realistic budget. It is \ntime that we started talking honestly about what our needs are going to \nbe in the future.\n\n  We are joined in this concern by a number of organizations which have \nexpressed their grave concern over this. The Independent Budget, a \ngroup comprised of Amvets, Disabled Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nStates, wrote to Secretary Jesse Brown on May 14, 1996, which I will \nsubmit. I received a copy. My colleagues, chairs, and ranking members \nof the VA-HUD Appropriations Committee, received it. I will cite to you \njust the middle paragraph of the letter. It says:\n\n       Our Nation's sick and disabled veterans deserve a viable \n     health care system devoted to them and their special health \n     care needs. Many of us have opposed budget plans brought up \n     in Congress because we believe they call into question the \n     continued existence of such a health care system. President \n     Clinton's 7-year balanced budget proposal does not provide \n     the funding necessary to meet these needs. This is true in \n     view of the fact that we have yet to witness true VA health \n     care eligibility reform.\n\n  I send that letter to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Independent Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Brown,\n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Department of Veterans \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Brown: On behalf of AMVETS, Disabled \n     American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars, the collective authors of the \n     Independent Budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, we \n     are writing to inform you of our concern over President \n     Clinton's seven year budget plan as it relates to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical care.\n       Our nation's sick and disabled veterans deserve a viable \n     health care system devoted to them and their special health \n     care needs. Many of us have opposed budget plans brought up \n     in Congress because we believed that they called into \n     question the continued existence of such a health care \n     system. President Clinton's seven year balanced budget \n     proposal does not provide the funding necessary to meet these \n     needs. This is true in view of the fact that we have yet to \n     witness true VA health care eligibility reform.\n       We all are aware that we live in fiscally constrained \n     times, and we all support taking steps to continue on the \n     path of deficit reduction. But we cannot, and must not, set \n     budgetary targets for VA medical care that are unrealistic \n     and which are not a clear response to the problems faced by \n     the VA, and the many veterans who rely upon the system. When \n     budget plans do not reflect the true needs of the VA medical \n     system, we will oppose them, and call on others to oppose \n     them.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth Wolford,\n       National Commander,\n       AMVETS.\n     Richard Grant,\n       National President,\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n     Thomas A. McMasters III,\n       National Commander,\n       Disabled American Veterans.\n     Paul A. Spera,\n       Commander-in-Chief,\n       Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I also would note that the American Legion, in a letter to \nme dated May 10, 1996, states:\n\n       After reviewing President's Clinton's FY `97 budget \n     proposal for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the American \n     Legion is deeply disturbed with the outyear funding levels \n     recommended.\n\n  They conclude by saying:\n\n       The American Legion strongly believes there are acceptable \n     alternatives Congress should seriously consider before \n     turning its back on American veterans and their families.\n\n  Mr. President, that is simply what is at issue here. Are we going to \nturn our backs on veterans, or are we going to make some responsible \nchoices and say it is time to get serious about welfare reform and make \nsure we put people to work and use some of the funds that we save to \nensure that we care for our Nation's veterans, the elderly, the sick, \nthe war-injured, the medically indigent who need our help and care.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield. I relinquish my time, and I will \nbe happy to yield the time on the other side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I came over to speak on the budget, and I just came \nout on the floor, and I apologize to my colleague. But if I understand \nthe context, could I ask the Senator, first of all, exactly what cuts \nare being made in the welfare area? Is this food stamps? Is this the \nSupplemental Security Income Program? Where exactly are you proposing \nto make these cuts?\n  Mr. BOND. I say to my friend, we are proposing in the reconciliation \nnumbers, if you will look at the copy of the amendment, which is not \nvery descriptive unless you have the whole document with you, and I \nassure him that these change the numbers for reconciliation so that in \nthe reconciliation process----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is this in food stamps?\n  Mr. BOND. The Finance Committee will have to make the changes to come \nup with the numbers which show the actual reforms made. We, on the \nBudget Committee, cannot make those reforms. The Finance Committee has \nto make those reforms. This will give them the same directions that the \ncurrent Budget Committee report, now on the Senate floor, makes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is the Senator prepared to say that there would not be \nreductions in, for example, the food stamps or the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program, or does the Senator believe there will be \ndeductions in order to make the target?\n  Mr. BOND. We are not saying, Mr. President, exactly what the outlines \nof this welfare reform proposal will be. The Finance Committee has \npreviously presented welfare reform proposals. We presented and adopted \nin this body a measure taking $64 billion out of welfare. It was \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act. I would expect that the beginning \npoint would be that point, and if Members wish to change that measure, \nthey can even reduce that by some $10 billion and still achieve the \nsavings that are necessary.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield, the Senator is saying now \nin the Chamber--just a couple of other questions--that, in fact, there \nwould not be cuts in the Supplemental Security Income and Food Stamp \nPrograms? Because the Senate has gone on record in voting on the \nproposition I introduced that we would not take any action which would \ncreate more hunger among children.\n  The Food Stamp Program is a major safety net program. Is the Senator \nprepared to say that we are not going to be taking any action by this \noffset that would create more hunger among children?\n  Mr. BOND. This offset is not designed to create hunger among \nchildren. I would point out to my colleague from Minnesota that if he \nwere here earlier, he would have seen the drastic slashes that the \nPresident's budget proposes in the feeding program for women, infants, \nand children. This is a program devoted to providing vitally needed \nnutrition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President----\n  Mr. BOND. Since the Senator from----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I did not ask about WIC.\n  Mr. BOND. Let me show this chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. This is the President's proposed spending on women, \ninfants, and children. This drops off the cliff. We propose to continue \nto fund it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on the question, could I ask----\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the questions, I say to the \nSenator from Minnesota. I have been asked for my attention by the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask a question? We had a debate for about an \nhour and a half about this trigger idea. Lo and behold, we found the \nposition of the Democrats is this budget does not have any trigger in \nit. You know, the trigger was the President's way of getting to a \nbalanced budget when he did not have a balanced budget. So they have \nsuggested they do not have a trigger.\n  But I say to my very good friend, sitting over in a little category \ncalled function 920, allowances, is $68 billion in budget cuts. So that \nwas the trigger under the President's budget which permitted him to \nsay, ``We are not cutting anything. It is those bad Republicans who are \ncutting everything, including veterans.''\n  Now the cat is out of the bag. Your budget, the President's budget as \nsubmitted by the Democrats--which they are going to vote for, I \nunderstand, willingly--it says to get to balance we really have to cut \na lot of things we have not told anybody about yet. Right?\n  Mr. BOND. This is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is the Oscar for fiction that I described: We do \nnot have\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\nto cut anything except that big bunch of money that is there. You are \nsuggesting that even cuts more than Republicans expected to cut in our \nbudget, and on veterans you have shown what it does. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct, the cuts in veterans are absolutely \ndevastating and would result in closing at least one-quarter of all \nveterans facilities. To me that is totally unacceptable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to just make one last observation and a \nquestion. The amount of money that you say should be taken out of \nwelfare in the President's budget, Senator Well- stone wants to know \ndetails. As a matter of fact, is it not true that the bipartisan \nwelfare bill which passed the Senate with 87 votes cuts more in \nwelfare, and had 87 votes, Democrats and Republicans, than the final \nproduct even when you take the additional amount out? Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask one more question?\n  Mr. BOND. If this has been on our time, I need to reserve the time. I \nwill be happy to respond, if there are further discussions, on time on \nthe other side. But I wish to yield the floor. I will be happy to \nlisten to my colleagues.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator need, I say to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time is left?\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do you need?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. All the time that is left.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \nup to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I actually came out to talk about the President's \nbudget versus the Republican budget, but I will say to my colleague \nfrom Nebraska I will do that later on.\n  I did want to, in responding to this amendment, just say to my \ncolleague from Missouri, I have not really sorted out the whole \namendment, but I did want him and my good friend from New Mexico to \nknow that, as a matter of fact, the Office of Management and Budget \ncame out with a report saying that that welfare reform bill that passed \nwould, in fact, lead to more poverty among well over 1 million \nchildren. So, before we start talking about all these cuts, it would be \nhelpful to know exactly where you intend to make the cuts and what \nimpact it is going to have on the most vulnerable citizens in this \ncountry. It is true they do not have lobbyists outside. It is true they \nare not the heavy hitters. It is true that they are not the big \nplayers. But I think we ought to be careful. Again, I have to look at \nthe specifics. But I never did hear a response to my question as to \nwhat impact this would have on what has been a major food and nutrition \nprogram.\n  My second point is it is my understanding from talking to the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse Brown, that the agreement with the \nPresident on the outyears is that each year this will, in fact, be \nnegotiated. The interesting thing is that many of us fought against the \nlast Republican budget which did have the reductions which we thought \nviolated a contract with veterans. As a matter of fact, the President \nheld very strong on that issue.\n  What I find interesting when I hear my colleague from Missouri \ntalking about veterans is I know what I have been trying to push, which \nis what I hear from the veterans community, which is health care \neligibility reform, which would make a huge difference. So I wonder why \nit is that all of a sudden we have this amendment out here on the floor \nwhen in fact it is not clear exactly who is going to be cut. I cannot \nget an answer to my question how it is going to affect children in this \ncountry.\n\n  In addition, what has been left out, from what I heard from my \ncolleague from Missouri, is the very clear understanding between the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, who has been a huge advocate for \nveterans, and the President, is that of course there will always be \nnegotiation when it comes to the out years because we all know that we \ntake a look at this year by year with a very strong commitment to \nveterans.\n  So I take rather serious exception as to whether or not the President \nhas been hanging in there strong for the veterans community versus the \nRepublican budgets that we have had before us.\n  I say to my good friend from Nebraska, I will not take any more time \nnow. Later on I hope I will have a chance to talk about this budget in \noverall terms, but I gather we do not have time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I hope the manager of the bill, the chairman \nof the committee, could be present because I would like to straighten \nsome things out. We had made an earlier agreement that we would move \nback and forth.\n  I thank my friend, the chairman of the committee, for being on the \nfloor.\n  We made an arrangement. Good-faith arrangements are something this \nSenator has always lived up to in 18 years in the U.S. Senate. I was to \noffer the next amendment. I could not do so since the Senator from Iowa \nwas on the floor, got the floor, and was talking as in morning business \nfor 5 minutes. It went on way beyond that.\n  In the meantime, I have been working diligently with the chairman of \nthe committee to try to work out the increasing number of amendments \nthat are coming forth. We had discussed this, either off or on the \nfloor. There were private discussions going on in good faith, I \nthought, with Chairman Domenici and myself, as ranking member. I went \nin to visit, to try to work that out and accommodate everyone. I came \nback out to find that the Senator from Missouri, probably unknowingly, \nbroke the arrangement. The Senator from Nebraska had been faithfully \nwaiting to offer the next amendment and I thought my prerogative would \nhave been protected, as is customary in this body.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee whether or not it is true that \nthe Senator from Nebraska was to be next recognized to offer an \namendment, under the previous agreement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I am quite certain \nthat somewhere in the record it will reflect we were going to your side \nafter we had finished our last amendment.\n  I do not think we should cast any aspersions on Senator Bond. He came \nto the floor. Nothing was going on. He was unaware of this. We had been \nrunning him down at committee hearings to try to get him here. Frankly, \nwhen he first arrived, I told him to sit down and rest, he had hurried \nover here with such enthusiasm. He is not the great athlete he was 20 \nyears ago. I should not say that. Obviously, he still is.\n  But what would the Senator like? He will finish his and you have one? \nIt was not ready a while ago, but your staff told me it is ready. Would \nyou like to offer yours and then what? Vote on yours first?\n  Mr. EXON. What I was hopeful of is that I would offer my amendment, \nwe would have a vote on that, then go on to your amendments and proceed \nin the usual fashion. That is what I would like to have done. But it \nseems to me now you have used up considerable time on the time that you \nhad. Is that right, I ask the Senator from Missouri?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time has the Senator used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 11 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Nebraska has 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the Bond amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say what I would like, and I would like to work \nour way out of this situation--the Senator from Nebraska was expecting \nto be recognized to offer an amendment, and I would like to have had a \nvote on that. Then you would go back to your side, and I assume the \nSenator from Missouri would be next in line?\n  Somehow we got out of whack. My knowledge of the Senator from \nMissouri is that he has always been a very fair and articulate person. \nMaybe he came in here and maybe staff ignored him, maybe staff did not \ntell him what the proper procedures were and he went ahead. Whatever \nthe situation is, the agreement that we have and entered into has been \nviolated, and I think it is\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nup to the chairman to say how he wants to straighten it out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want anybody to have this idea that anybody \nviolated anything.\n  Mr. EXON. That was the result.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I propose that we fix it this way: Whatever time is \nleft on this amendment, we complete the amendment. We set it aside, and \nSenator Exon proceed with his amendment for whatever amount of time you \nwant. When you are finished, we will vote in sequence, voting on your \namendment first, but we will do them together so Senators will come \ndown and vote twice, vote on yours first, and then Senator Bond's \namendment second.\n  Mr. EXON. If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that we \nfinish the debate with the allotted time----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Then allow me to come in and have whatever time I need that \ncan be agreed to, then we will vote on my amendment first and his \nsecond, to get back on the right course.\n  I have no objection to that, and I say to my friend from Minnesota, \nif he needs additional time, I will be glad to yield. The reason I did \nnot yield unlimited amounts of time before was because I thought it was \nimportant that we get straightened out the violation of what I thought \nwas the agreement. Now that we have done that, I yield----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me get a unanimous-consent agreement on this so \nnobody will be objecting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the time has expired or yielded \nback on the Bond amendment, that it be set aside temporarily for the \npurpose of permitting Senator Exon to offer an amendment; that when the \ntime has expired on the Exon amendment or yielded back, that we will \nvote on the Exon amendment or in relation thereto first, to be followed \nby a vote on Senator Bond's amendment, and I also ask at this point \nthat the second vote be a 10-minute vote, since the Senators will be \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. May I suggest one other extension? Maybe we do not have to \nhave a unanimous-consent agreement on this because we generally go with \na gentlemen's agreement. Our side would offer the first amendment after \nthe two votes; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. By agreement, that is the way we are doing it. I do not \nknow we should put it in the consent. I do not intend to violate the \nagreement.\n  Mr. BOND. First, I was going to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us get the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, just so I understand, so we do not have \nanother disagreement, the agreement that we have gone back to, to \nrecognize the agreed-to procedure, that the Senator from Nebraska will \ngo next--I will do that--then we will have the vote on my amendment, \nthen we will vote on the amendment from the Senator from Missouri. \nAfter we finish the second vote, then it will be a Democratic amendment \nup at that time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have kicked this one along and \naround far enough. I am very happy that we have reached an \naccommodation where we will finish debate on this and then we will set \nit aside to go to Senator Exon's amendment.\n  To set the record straight, I was called out of a hearing that I was \nchairing because it was envisioned that I would offer an amendment at 3 \no'clock. I came to the floor. There was a quorum call, and then the \nSenator from California was speaking. When she concluded, there was no \none else around, and I offered an amendment. I figured that we might \nget on to the business of the Budget Act.\n  I apologize for preempting the Senator from Nebraska, but I trust \nthat everyone is happy now, that his vote will be ahead of ours, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask my friend from Minnesota, we may have some other \nspeakers on this amendment, you sought additional time. We have 21 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. EXON. Can I yield 7 minutes, will that be adequate?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska.\n  I want to respond to some of the comments of my colleagues on the \nother side, from Missouri and New Mexico, about the President's overall \nbudget, what has been presented by my Republican colleagues.\n  I will say that as I look at the Republican's plan, I really do not \nquite understand what I think is a real disconnect with the people we \nrepresent, because as I look at this plan over a 6-year period of time, \nI see the same too deep of reductions in both Medicare and medical \nassistance.\n  Just to talk about this from a Minnesota perspective, I want to make \nit very clear that in my State, we are the skinny kids on the block. We \nhave kept our costs down. We do not have the same fat in our system \nand, therefore, the effects of these cuts would, in fact, do harm to \nthe quality of care for elderly people within our State. I am talking \nspecifically about Medicare.\n\n  Some of the changes that the Republicans have made in their plan now \nput even more of an emphasis on the reimbursement to the providers. But \nin greater Minnesota, Mr. President, as high as 60 percent of the \npatient payment mix for some of our rural hospitals is Medicare, \nalready below the cost of delivering care.\n  So I will say what I have said many times on the floor of the Senate \nin this debate, the numbers cannot drive the policy. The policy has to \ndrive the numbers. This is a rush to recklessness. It will not work for \nMinnesota and, therefore, I hope that it will be rejected, and I know \nthat people in Minnesota will reject it.\n  Mr. President, on the medical assistance, I will just say, again, to \nmy colleagues, you have chosen to target some of the citizens who are \nthe most vulnerable in America. In the State of Minnesota, 60 percent \nof medical assistance, which is what we call it in Minnesota as opposed \nto Medicaid, goes to people in nursing homes. I ask my colleagues, why \ndo we want to make cuts there?\n  We have about 300,000 children in my State who receive medical \nassistance. It is the best safety net program in our State to make sure \nthat children receive health care. Why do we want to cut there?\n  Then, Mr. President, I see another disconnect. I say to my colleagues \nhere--I see the Senator from California--it was not more than about 2 \nmonths ago I had an amendment on the floor. We received 84 votes for it \nwhere we restored the funding that had been cut in title I, school to \nwork, safe and drug-free schools, Head Start, and all the rest. Now I \nsee similar kinds of cuts in education and job training.\n  The cuts proposed in the Republican budget are too extreme, they are \ntoo harsh, they are shortsighted, they go beyond the goodness of \nMinnesotans, they go beyond the goodness of America, and they should be \nrejected.\n  Mr. President, then I look to the higher education. I am going to \nhave an amendment out on the floor. It is an amendment Democrats are \ngoing to offer, and we will have a vote on it. I will say to my \ncolleagues, once you go beyond the tax credits that go to children and \nfamilies, anything else you have left over in your budget should go to \ntax deductions to pay for higher education.\n  Mr. President, I do not see tax cuts that flow disproportionately to \nhigher income people. I think we ought to reinvest it in education. If \nyou want to talk about a middle-class issue, talk about making sure \nhigher educational is affordable.\n  Mr. President, I have said it before, at least in committee--I will \nsay it on the floor of the Senate today--I do not think some of my \ncolleagues with their proposed cuts, again, in higher education, \nunderstand the squeeze that students and their families feel.\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n  We have students in Minnesota that sell plasma at the beginning of \nthe semester to buy textbooks. We have students in Minnesota working at \ntwo or three minimum-wage jobs--it would help if we raised the minimum \nwage--while going to school. Therefore, it takes them 6 years. We have \nstudents in Minnesota no longer 19 living in the dorms. They are older. \nThey have families. They are trying to afford the education to get back \non their feet, to be able to obtain decent employment.\n  I am going to have an amendment out on the floor that will hold all \nof us accountable and see who is committed to making sure there is \naffordable higher education.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention two other amendments that I am going \nto introduce, one of them which speaks to the question I raised for my \ncolleague from Missouri, by the way, who I think is a great chair of \nthe Small Business Committee. I think we are good friends. We do not \nalways agree on issues.\n  But I am going to have this time a recorded vote, because I had an \namendment at the beginning of this Congress. I could see it coming, \nthat it was the sense of the Senate that we would not take any action \nthat would create more hunger or homelessness for children. And I lost. \nPeople voted against that amendment.\n  The third time around it was voice voted for approval. I wish I had \nnot done that because I think it was dropped in the conference \ncommittee, as I remember. As I look at some of these proposed \nreductions, I see the same kind of action taken.\n  So this time I am going to have a recorded vote where we go on record \nthat we will not pass any legislation that could create more hunger or \nhomelessness among children; and if in fact the result of some of these \ncuts is to do just that, then the next year we will revisit the action \nthat we have taken. It is important that the Senate go on record this \ntime with a recorded vote.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say to my colleagues, we went \nthrough the battle on the COPS Program, community policing, and we made \nsure that it was not block granted. We made sure that there was a focus \non community police. I could brag for the next 24 hours, and I only \nhave probably 2 minutes--I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 more \nminutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. About some of the work of the police chiefs and \nsheriffs in Minnesota and the men and women in law enforcement; very \ncreative work to reduce violence in homes, very creative work with some \nof the kids, at risk kids, some of the kids that have the most trouble \nin schools, very creative work in some of the neighborhoods and some of \nthe cities, but a program that has been extremely effective in \nmetropolitan Minnesota and greater Minnesota.\n  I think I may come out with an amendment that makes sure that we in \nfact have the funding this next year for that program and make a \ncommitment over the 6-year period.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just say that on the President's \nbudget I do not find everything in there to be perfect. I think there \nis too much for the Pentagon. I think there is too much by way of tax \ncuts.\n  If I had my way--but I could never get my colleagues to vote for \nthis; in fact I could not get quite a few Democrats to vote for it; I \nhardly got any support among Republicans. I want one more time on the \nfloor of the Senate, with 1 minute left, to shout it from the \nmountaintop.\n  Why are you so anxious to cut educational opportunities for children, \nand job training, and not adequately fund community police, but you are \nmore than willing to give away the wasteful subsidies to the \npharmaceutical companies, to the oil companies, to the tobacco \ncompanies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?\n  Where is the Minnesota standard of fairness? What we have here, with \nthe Republican proposal, is deficit reduction, a balanced budget, one \nmore time, based on the path of least political resistance. You have \nyour deepest cuts that affect those citizens who have the least amount \nof political clout. And when it comes to the big players, and the heavy \nhitters, and all the wasteful subsidies that go to so many of these \nlarge corporations, you hardly touch it. You hardly touch it. It is not \ncredible. It is too extreme. And it should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri yield me 2 minutes for a brief statement?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5143-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5148-S5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEATH OF ADMIRAL BOORDA\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take just a few minutes now to advise the \nSenate that I have just learned of the tragic death of Adm. Mike \nBoorda, the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  Since many of us were close personal friends with Admiral Boorda, and \nhave dealt with him on a very close basis, I will take a moment to \noffer our prayers and very best thoughts to his family.\n  Admiral Boorda has been a model for our country. He rose through the \nenlisted ranks to become the leader of our Navy through hard work and \nperseverance. He was what is known in the Navy as a Mustang. He went in \njust as an enlisted sailor. He became the Chief of Naval Operations. \nAlong the way, he was a surface warfare officer, and he commanded the \nU.S.S. Farragut, Destroyer Squadron 22, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8, and \nBattle Force Sixth Fleet.\n  Most of us first saw the bright, intelligent and personable style of \nAdmiral Boorda when he took over as Chief of Naval Personnel in August \n1988. In 1991 he received his fourth star and became the commander in \nchief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe. As CINCSOUTH, Admiral Boorda was in \ncommand of all NATO forces engaged in operations enforcing U.N. \nsanctions against the warring factions in the former Republic of \nYugoslavia. On April 23, 1994, Admiral Boorda became the 25th Chief of \nNaval Operations.\n  Over the years, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have \nknown many naval officers, and I have known, since being a Member of \nCongress, many Chiefs of Naval Operations. I have never known one \nbetter than Mike Boorda. The men and women of the Navy loved him.\n  I know my colleagues join me in remembering Admiral Boorda and \nexpressing our deepest sympathies to his family. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before the whip \nleaves that I may just say a word or two and ask a question of him.\n  We have had a lot of shocking developments around this place, but \nnone has shocked me more than the statement he just made.\n  Admiral Boorda was a truly outstanding man, a great friend of mine. \nIn fact, the last time that I saw him was just a few weeks ago. And he \nstopped in my office, without any notice whatsoever, and he said that \n``I have nothing on my mind at all except to thank you for all the help \nthat you have been over the years to the U.S. Navy.'' That is the kind \nof person he was.\n\n  Do you have any details at all on this? This had to be a very sudden \naffair. Do you know what caused his death? Could you explain a little \nbit?\n  Mr. LOTT. We do not know all the details, only what is being reported \non CNN and through the Naval Congressional Liaison Office. I understand \nit was an accident of some sort of gunshot wound, that he perhaps went \nhome at lunch, and this bullet wound was inflicted during that lunch \nperiod. And he had been discovered in the last couple of hours. I do \nnot know any details other than that.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Alaska on the \nsame basis.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor in a state of \nshock. Adm. Mike Boorda, a personal friend, traveled with me to my home \nState this year. I have spent many times with him in my office and in \nhis office.\n  We will say a lot about him later, but Mike Boorda was the first \nChief of Naval Operations to have been a walk-in enlistee. He was an \nenlisted man who worked his way through the Navy to the highest \nposition in the Navy, as the CNO and Chief of Staff.\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\n  I really say to the Senate that this is a great loss. He suffered the \nloss of his father this year, very dramatic for Mike Boorda. And we \ntalked a lot about that. But I hope that this is something that we can \nfind a way to deal with very quickly because he is going to be sorely \nmissed in this mix of our national defenses.\n  I think that from what I have heard, what the assistant majority \nleader just said, that we are in a different circumstance now. This is \nhard for us to take for certain what we have heard, which I hope is not \ntrue. It is a very difficult situation.\n  Mike Boorda I think was one of the bright stars of our military \nsystem today as it stands and is responsible for a lot of the \ninitiatives that would have brought the Navy back to its prominence of \ndays gone by. So I am really sad to be here.\n  I am pleased you have made the announcement, Senator Lott. But that \nit is a most disturbing development is all I can tell the Senate, very \ndisturbing.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I also had the privilege, just several \nmonths ago, to be traveling with Admiral Boorda, and a couple weeks ago \nvisited with him in my office again.\n  He was truly an outstanding person, had great ability and great \ndedication to this country, and was more than willing to make any kind \nof contributions he could. All we can say is that our thoughts and our \nprayers are with his family and loved ones. And it is with deep, deep \nsorrow and shock that we receive this news.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, suffice it to say I still have not recovered \nfrom the shock. I find myself in one of those positions that maybe we \nhave all found ourselves in sometimes, having some kind of a bad dream \nbut you know it will all turn out right and you will wake up. I am \nasking myself, am I having a dream? Obviously, I am not. This is a \nterrible, terrible shock. I simply want to join the others in wishing \nthe best to the family. Our prayers are with all of them during these \nvery, very difficult times.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I add my words of condolences. My memory \nof Admiral Boorda is coming to a meeting with women Senators with a \nnumber of other leaders from the military and being so concerned about \nmaking sure that this military moves forward in a way that is fair to \nwomen as well as to men. I will always remember that meeting.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I was here when Admiral Boorda was first announced as the \nChief of Naval Operations, the first man to come up through the ranks \nto become the Chief. I worked with him then on a variety of issues, but \nespecially on his mind was the aftermath of Tailhook. As the only woman \non the Armed Services Committee, we had a chance to sit down and talk \nabout what had happened and what could be done to get the Navy going in \nthe right direction.\n  The Navy is very special to me because it is the service that my \nhusband chose during the Korean war. I love the Navy, and Mike Boorda \nloved the Navy.\n  I want to say that I thought he did as much as any human being could \ndo to be in charge of a service during the downsizing time, which \neveryone knew had to be done. He did it in a way that would plan for \nthe future, to make sure that the strategic part of what the Navy does \nfor our national defense and our security were strong. Yet, he had the \ncompassionate side that worried very much about sexual harassment. He \nwanted to make sure that he instilled in the men and women that he \nserved as their leader, that, in fact, the value system that was \ninstilled in the men and women of the Navy was the most important part \nof their service. He did everything a human being could do to instill \nthat value system in them. Every time a problem arose, I would talk to \nMike Boorda and he would be showing concern and saying, ``What more can \nwe do?''\n  I think that he was a fine leader. I am stunned, as every one of us \nis, that we have lost this fine leader. I hope that his memory will be \nserved as the person who was a man of his word, who served his country \nwell, and who had the respect of everyone that met or touched his life. \nI yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5148-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3971\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is advised each side \nhas approximately 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I have a heavy heart about this amendment, because I \nthink if we do anything on this floor we should cross party lines and \nhonor the children of this country.\n  What this amendment will do is hurt the children of this country and \nhurt them badly. We know that right now one in five children in America \nlives in poverty. Yet, this amendment would turn these children against \nthe veterans in this country. That is not what we should be doing.\n  The fact is, we are talking here about assistance to disabled \nchildren. We ought to think about what I mean when I say a disabled \nchild. We are talking about a child with cerebral palsy. We are talking \nabout a child with spina bifida. We are talking about a child with \nheart problems. We are talking about children who are so vulnerable \nthey cannot even get up in the morning without assistance. And we are \ngoing to cut from their sustenance? I do not know how we do that.\n  The irony about this amendment, it does not increase the caps on \ndiscretionary spending. So even if we vote for this, the chances that \nveterans will get more are not very good.\n  I think I really have to say there is something that I think my \nfriend from Missouri is missing in his amendment. Maybe he does not \nrealize that half a million veterans are on welfare. Half a million \nveterans are on welfare. So when he cuts welfare to give to veterans, \nhe forgets that half a million veterans are going to get hurt by this. \nWe know who they are-- veterans who just cannot make it back, who were \nsuffering from disabling diseases, be they physical or mental, half a \nmillion of whom are on welfare, some form of welfare. So we cut this. \nWe are saying we are cutting it in order to help veterans, yet we are \ncutting 500,000 of the most vulnerable veterans.\n  I really believe there are other ways we can help the veterans. I \nwould like to cut corporate loopholes. I would like to cut corporate \nwelfare. That is what I am going to vote to do. We have a lot of \ncorporate loopholes out there that need to be closed, businesses that \nget favorable tax treatment if they leave the country, people escaping \ntaxation who were very wealthy. We should go after corporate welfare, \nnot go after the disabled children, the disabled veterans. Then, we \nshould spend it on the veterans.\n  I think we, on the Democratic side, will have an opportunity to honor \nour veterans by increasing what we spend on them by taking the money \nout of corporate loopholes, corporate tax loopholes. I think everyone \ncan get behind that. However, we should not hurt the most vulnerable \nchildren, the most vulnerable veterans.\n\n  I really do believe that my ranking member is going to have an \nexcellent amendment, instead of this one, which turns our veterans \nagainst the most severely disabled children and the most severely \ndisabled veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for a few minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5149-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5149-S5150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ADMIRAL BOORDA\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, Senator Lott a moment ago spoke about the \nlife and death of Adm. Jeremy Mike Boorda. I think all of us were \nstunned by this revelation.\n  Yesterday, most of us, Republican and Democrat alike, were shocked, \nand saddened, in some respects, at the announcement of another man of \ncharacter and courage who decided to leave\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\na position he loved most to achieve a higher dream.\n  Today, just moments ago, we are advised of another man in our public \nservice, one of the best and brightest that the Navy has ever had to \noffer, took leave of life. The reports at this point have not been \nconfirmed. On one network they have indicated that it was a self-\ninflicted wound. I hope that is not the case. We are trying at this \nparticular point to verify rumors. No such confirmation has been \nforthcoming at this point. We do not wish to add to the speculation any \nfurther than what is on the television at this moment.\n  I say a few words about Admiral Boorda from a personal point of view. \nHe was a very close friend of mine. He attended my wedding a few months \nago. Our relationship goes back several years, at least, when we were \nin Munich together, the Wehrkunde conference. It was memorable to me \nbecause one night while we were there, Sarajevo had been shelled. There \nwas a great loss of life. Admiral Boorda took charge immediately. He \nordered C-141's to get to Sarajevo. He did so over the objection of the \nU.N. command at that point. Akashi could not be reached. They said, \nwait until tomorrow; do not send any aircraft down. Mike Boorda said, \n``I am not waiting for anything. Get those planes in there. Get those \nwounded people out of there and get them to the hospital.''\n  That was the kind of man of action and passion that I came to know \nand admire. He, over the last several years, demonstrated that time and \ntime again in terms of his commitment to the Navy.\n  Yesterday, Senator Dole talked about life being a hardship. Nothing \ncame easy to Senator Dole. I might say that for Mike Boorda. Life was a \nhardship as well. He was not born into wealth. He was not a man of \nprivilege, but he is what we call a common man. He rose through the \nranks of common men and women to the highest position in the U.S. Navy. \nHe was admired by everyone who ever came within his presence. He was \ninspiring to those men and women who now served in our U.S. Navy. All \nof them will be equally stunned and shocked, as we were, to learn of \nthe news of his death. I can only hope that the reports I have heard to \ndate are not correct.\n  I pray for the members of his family who are alive today and no doubt \nin a state of shock and grief. I can only indicate to them that every \nperson who has ever been touched by Jeremy Mike Boorda will remember \nhim for the rest of their lives. I can only express my condolences at \nthis moment and hope to have further comments about the life and times \nof Mike Boorda at a later time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5149-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5150-S5157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 8 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  We have heard a lot of straw men set up by opponents on the other \nside. We have heard about all kinds of horrible cuts that would come if \nwe get a responsible budget number for welfare. This body should know \nthat the $53 billion cut, which we propose in this amendment to include \nin reconciliation instructions, is equivalent to the $53 billion cut \nthat was passed by an 87-vote majority in this body when we debated \nwelfare previously.\n  Now, there could have been as many as 13 Members of the body that did \nnot like what was in that welfare bill. But I can assure you, with 87 \nMembers of this body voting for welfare reform, the horrible, tragic \nthings that we hear about that could happen if we have to achieve \nreconciliation savings of $53 billion in welfare are so much smoke and \nmirrors. What we are concerned about in the numbers is assuring that \nveterans health care does not take an impossible hit, a $12.9 billion \nreduction. There is no way that one can work out.\n  My colleague from California, who has argued so eloquently for the \nveterans and has talked about them, did not propose any changes when \nshe voted for the amendment that would slash Veterans' Administration \nspending by almost $13 billion in the Budget Committee. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota had said we should not worry about the cuts in veterans. \nWe just cannot adopt a budget number that is consistent with the \nprevious welfare reform that 87 Members of this body, on a bipartisan \nvote, supported when we first passed welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, budgets are about setting reasonable expectations for \nGovernment so that we can carry out our functions in a responsible \nmanner and not continue to add to the deficit. All of the horror \nstories, all of the very difficult and compelling cases that were cited \nare not the ones that would be hit by the budget reconciliation \nproposal that this amendment contains.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. How much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes for the majority, and 2 minutes \n55 seconds on the Democratic side.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \ncomments of the distinguished chairman of the VA--HUD and Independent \nAgencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri. \nHe does a tremendous job. I have watched him through the years. He is \nattentive, he does his homework, he is impressive, and he gets quite \ninvolved in every way and in every issue in a most positive way.\n  What has been curious to me, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, is the remarkable behavior of the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, Jesse Brown. He is continually distancing himself and the VA \nfrom the President's budget. I understand he testified early last month \nbefore the House Veterans' Affairs Committee that he ``felt the \nPresident's budget would be devastating for veterans.''\n  Later in the month, April 24, the Secretary appeared before the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I chair, and which I \noversee as chairman. In response to a question from my friend, Senator \nCraig of Idaho, the Secretary stated that the VA budget described in a \ndocument submitted to the Congress--over the signature of the President \nand entitled ``Budget of the United States of America''--does not \nrepresent the policy of the President.\n  I ask, whose policy does it represent? Did an employee of the \nGovernment Printing Office change the numbers for the proposed VA \nbudget on his or her own, making the President of the United States and \nthe Congress the victims of some wild practical joke? Did some cyber \nsurfer hack his way into the White House computer system and change the \nnumbers? Did somebody forge the signature of the President of the \nUnited States on a document submitted to the Congress in his name? My \nHeavens, we may have a real scandal here on our hands.\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs told the committee that VA's future \nmedical budget will be subject to annual renegotiation by the \nPresident. He tells us he has received the President's assurances that \nthe budget numbers are not binding. Well, that makes quite a puzzle.\n  The President of the United States has proclaimed to the American \npeople that he will balance the budget in 7 years. His plan, like any \nbudget, includes difficult decisions allocating limited resources \nbetween many worthwhile programs.\n  But, according to the Secretary's testimony, the President does not \nstand behind the parts of that plan relating to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  There are only 2 ways the President can deliver on his commitment to \nSecretary Brown. He can increase the VA spending by abandoning the goal \nof the balanced budget. But the President has made a commitment to the \nAmerican people to present a balanced budget. We have heard that \ndiscussion for several hours. So I am sure that he would not take that \ncourse. Or, in the alternative, the President could increase the VA's \nbudget by reducing the budget of other programs.\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\n  Does that mean the President has a secret plan to cut non-VA \ndiscretionary spending programs in order to fund increases in veterans' \nhealth care? I am sure he does not, Mr. President, because his budget \nalso represents a funding promise made to the beneficiaries of non-VA \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the veterans' health care budget proposed by the \nPresident--when examined through the lens created by the statements of \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs--presents the Senate with a \nremarkable mystery.\n  Veterans may wonder upon which rock the Senate should build their \nfuture, Mr. President--the budget proposed by the President? Or \nSecretary Brown's hopes that those budget numbers will be changed? That \nis what he said.\n  Mr. President, on April 24, Secretary Brown testified that, since \n1980, VA's medical care funding has increased 20 percent--after \nadjusting for inflation. The resolution reported to the Senate by the \nCommittee on the Budget builds on that rock.\n  So I submit to America's veterans--and to the Senate--that a generous \nhistory of increasing funding, combined with already-identified \nproposals for more cost-effective operation of the VA Health Care \nAdministration, are much firmer rock upon which to build for the future \nthan the administration's budget--a budget Secretary Brown tells us the \nPresident has already repudiated.\n  That, I think, is a most extraordinary thing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who yields time? The Senator from \nNebraska has 2 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, when I introduced the President's budget \nthis morning, I indicated that there were several features of the \nPresident's budget that I wish to change and would attempt to make \nchanges in. One of those certainly was the fact that the Veterans \nAffairs allocation under the President's budget was not one that those \nof us on this side of the aisle were satisfied with. So I thank the \nSenator from Missouri, who has brought up this matter.\n  We recall during the deliberations of the Budget Committee that it \nwas something we wished to correct also. We may have some differences \nof opinion on where the money should come from to do the correction. \nBut I simply say that I think we all agree that a correction has to be \nmade.\n  This is one of the things I had in mind--without spelling them out--\nwhen I said I am for the President's budget, with some changes. This is \none of them. I want to say that I am offering an amendment that will \nprecede the vote on the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, along \nthe same lines. I am taking the money from a different source. \nRegardless of where the money comes from, it is something that will \nprobably have 100 votes for to make a correction in this particular \narea.\n  However, after we finish this debate, as agreed to previously, I will \noffer my amendment and we will vote on that first. It essentially does \nthe same thing as the Senator from Missouri does, but it takes the \nmoney to fund it from a different source. We will not need to go into \nthat in any great detail now. We might talk about that when I offer my \namendment.\n  I want to correct one thing before we finish debate on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri. We may be wrong, Mr. President, \nbut I would simply note that we feel--I state this for the Record--if \ncorrections are necessary by the offer of the Senator from Missouri, we \nwill certainly cooperate in trying to offer an amendment. We feel that \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri attempts to increase \nspending for veterans, which is a worthy cause. We agree with that. His \namendment raises the functional category for veterans. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment as drawn, in our view, would not increase discretionary \nspending, which I think the Senator from Missouri wants to do; that is, \nthe discretionary spending limits and the appropriations caps as it \naffects that.\n  So, in reality, it is our view that the Senator's amendment would \nmerely cut income security and leave the discretionary spending levels \njust the same as in the President's budget. I am sure that is not his \nintent. I am just making that suggestion. Is that something that the \nSenator has agreed with? Should we correct it? If so, in fairness, we \nwould like to give time to do it. If we are not reading this right, \nplease tell us so. I want to call it to the Senator's attention in the \ninterest of fairness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I guess I had better talk rapidly.\n  We have raised the caps in the amendment in the copy we have. We \nwould be happy to have staff be sure we are talking about the right \nnumbers. The fact remains that both sides agree that we cannot cut, as \nthe President has proposed, spending on the Veterans' Administration.\n  I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee for \nhis kind comments. We will have more to say about veterans affairs and \nthe credibility of the President's budget on the next vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside to permit the introduction of an amendment by the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee and that the amendment so set aside be \nplaced second in the order for votes at the end of debate on the \namendment by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the regular order the amendment is set \naside, the amendment by Senator Bond is the second in order, and we now \nturn to the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska with 1 hour equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield myself what time I may need, and there will probably be \nothers to speak on this.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3973 to Amendment No. 3965\n\n     (Purpose. To cut corporate welfare to fund veterans' benefits)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3973 to amendment No. 3965.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I start my formal remarks, let me \nstraighten out any misunderstanding.\n  Were we not furnished a copy of the amendment. Is that what I \nunderstand? I am just trying to make sure that we know where we are \ncoming from.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we will be happy to show the distinguished \nchairman. I am sure it is there.\n  Mr. BOND. If it is there, that is all I need to know. We were \nconcerned it might not be.\n  You made a change. You made a change in the copy of the amendment \nafter it was given to us. Is that the mixup? The best guess is that we \nwere not furnished the final copy of the amendment. It is no big deal. \nThe fact is it is in there. That is what I wanted.\n  Can you give us a copy of yours?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. We will give a copy of the amendment to the majority. \nIt does the same thing.\n  Mr. President, this amendment addresses the veterans proposition \nalso. This amendment does much of the same as that intended to be done \nby the Senator from Missouri. It adds back to veterans the source of \nfunds in the same amount. However, the Senator from Missouri cuts \nwelfare to make up the difference. My proposal would cut corporate \nwelfare. It is this Senator's belief that the majority turns too \nquickly to reducing projected spending on means-tested programs that go \nto the heart of the needs of the most needy in our society. Some of \nthat was brought up during debate on the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Some may believe that we are all too eager to cut the neediest \nprograms that we have--those so-called means-tested programs.\n  I am simply saying, while I consider it a must to better fund the \nveterans programs almost exactly as the Senator from Missouri has \nsuggested, let us cut corporate welfare to pay for this and keep our \nreduction in the unnecessary spending under control.\n  We have had a good debate, I think, on veterans affairs. We do not \nneed to extend the debate for any lengthy period of time because I \nthink we would just be repeating ourselves over and over again. What we \ncome down to, therefore, is that the amendment before the body is the \namendment which we will vote on prior to voting on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  At this time, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment presently \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and recognize any of my colleagues who wish to speak in behalf of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to be able to enter into a \ndebate on this. But I am still waiting to see what it is the amendment \ndoes. I know it deals with veterans. But I am a bit at a loss to know \nhow we should debate it when we do not have the amendment before us. I \nhave been in some difficult situations, but this is probably one of the \ntoughest ones.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to.\n  Mr. EXON. We have the only copy we had of this at the desk. We are \nmaking a copy for you. I think the Senator from Missouri is probably \njustified in wanting to see the amendment. The amendment does exactly \nwhat I said it would do; that is, to have the same figures that you \nhave proposed but rather than take the money to make up the difference \nout of welfare as we know it, we take it out of corporate welfare. But, \nonce again, in the interest of fairness, I suggest that we temporarily \nstand in recess until a copy can be made and delivered to the majority \nand give them whatever reasonable time they want.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest we do not need to go into recess. \nI would make my friend an offer. If he will just tell us what he means \nby cutting corporate welfare, maybe we can carry out the debate, \nbecause I would trust his characterization. I would ask the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, does he mean he is raising taxes? Could he be a little \nmore specific about the things we are doing?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator, certainly as a member of the Budget Committee, \nknows full well what I am talking about with regard to corporate \nwelfare. These are moves that we have made over the years that have \nbeen prominently under discussion for the last year with regard to the \nbudget negotiations between the Congress and the White House.\n  If the Senator will refer to the material that I think he now has, \npage 3 of this year's Republican budget resolution states that in \naddition to the child tax credit, and I quote, ``The committee \nrecommendation would accommodate further tax reform or tax reductions \nto be offset by the extension of expired tax provisions of corporate \nand business tax reform.''\n  It continues, ``Such receipts could be used to offset other tax \nreform proposals such as estate tax reform, economic growth, fuel \nexcise taxes or other policies on a deficit-neutral basis.''\n  To outline this further, last year's vetoed reconciliation bill, \nsupported by virtually every Senate Republican, included approximately \n$26 billion in revenue increases for corporate and other reforms.\n  That is what I am talking about. President Clinton has proposed \nnearly $40 billion in corporate reforms in his balanced budget \nsubmission to the Congress. Although the proposals are not identical, \nRepublicans and Democrats agree that revenue can be raised from this \ncategory which is customarily referred to, as I think the Senator from \nMissouri knows, as corporate welfare.\n  The committee report to this budget, on page 63-67, describes \nexpenditures in our Tax Code that lose hundreds of billions of revenue \nover a 5-year period. In that context, the Republican proposal as well \nas those of President Clinton are modest efforts to reduce loopholes \nthat have allowed corporations to benefit.\n  That is what corporate welfare is all about. It eliminates corporate \nwelfare to the extent that it is necessary to adequately fund the \nveterans programs at essentially the same figures that both you and I \nwould like to see. Another way of saying this: What it does is make our \ntax laws fair for all Americans.\n\n  I am not surprised that the first words out of the mouth of the \nSenator from Missouri were, ``Are you going to raise taxes?'' If \ncutting corporate welfare, which I think the corporations are not \nentitled to during a time when we are strapped for money, if that is \nraising taxes, call it raising taxes. I think closing unfair corporate \nloopholes to take care of the needs of our veterans is far better than \ntaking it away from what I referred to earlier, from the general \nwelfare fund that goes essentially to the neediest among us.\n  I would simply say that these are modest efforts, modest loophole \nclosings. Our amendment ensures that additional receipts from closing \ncorporate loopholes will be used to lessen the cuts on the veterans \nrather than apply it to help pay for additional tax breaks for the \nwealthy, which I basically feel is in the mind of the Republican \nbudgetmakers some time down the line.\n  In any event, whether that is true or not, all that the Exon \namendment does is to return to the welfare funds the amount that the \nSenator from Missouri and others are proposing. And we\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nthink that is good. We are simply saying that rather than to subtract \nthis from welfare, the neediest among us, let us take the necessary \nfunds from corporate welfare that we all know has drawn far beyond due \nbounds in recent years.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  We obviously are getting some basic philosophical differences here. \nMy distinguished friend from Nebraska has accused us of reflexively \nturning to means-tested entitlements.\n  What we have done, Mr. President, in fact, is to turn to failed \nprograms and say it is time to reform them. The President himself has \nsaid it is time to end welfare as we know it. That is why 87 Members of \nthis body, Democrats and Republicans, said we need to reform welfare. \nThe system is not serving the people it is supposed to serve--the \ntaxpayers who fund it, the communities that see its impact, or the \nfuture generations who hope that we could help people get out of \nwelfare and into productive employment. What we are saying is it is \ntime to reform these programs. We are going to keep saying that because \nI think the overwhelming body of American citizens knows that welfare \nneeds to be reformed.\n  By the same token, my friends on the other side of the aisle \nreflexively turn to tax increases. If it moves, tax it. We are talking \nabout an amendment to the budget presented on behalf of the President \nby the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Let me point out that that bill already has $36 billion in new taxes \nin extenders. It raises $36 billion in extending taxes. It has $54 \nbillion in other loophole closings. They have already got $90 billion \nof tax increases. And the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee says, let us just hit them with another $13 billion of taxes.\n  Now, Mr. President, I thought that maybe our friends would have \nlearned something when President Clinton proposed and they voted for \nthe significant tax increases of 1993. I have cited before on this \nfloor the studies have shown that raising taxes in the way that was \ndone in 1993 did not generate the kinds of revenue expected because it \ndiscouraged economic activity. It has slowed economic activity, \neconomic growth and jobs in this country, and we have no less of an \nauthority than the President himself, who said at a reception attended \nby people, I guess, whose taxes he had raised markedly in Texas, that \nhe raised taxes too much.\n  We agreed with him at the time. Unfortunately, he just did not see it \nour way until later on. Now we want to take a $90 billion gross tax \nincrease here and add another $13 billion to it. Certainly, our budget \nprovides for changes in the mix of taxation if we need it. That can be \ndone right now.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee will offer a bill that may \nraise some taxes and lower others and shift the mix of taxes. But when \nwe talk about the total burden of taxation, that is one of the problems \nwhich is causing our country to slow down, jobs not to be created, and \nas we get into a debate on the President's budget the one argument I \nhave not heard made about it is that it does not raise enough taxes. \nBut that is really what the amendment by the Senator from Nebraska \nwould do. Are we really in trouble because we do not tax enough? I \ndon't think so, Mr. President.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and vote for the \namendment which will follow it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. It may well be we can shorten down the time. We have been \ntrying to move this ahead, move forward.\n  I did not realize we would be getting into a rehash of what we did 2 \nyears ago with the President's budget. Once again, the Senator from \nMissouri is certainly entitled to his position. He indicates that the \nbudget that we passed 2 years ago, the President's budget, has hurt \njobs creation, has been devastating to the country. Evidently, from \nwhat he said, it has hurt employment.\n  The facts of the matter are that those same things were said in one \nform or another by those on that side of the aisle during the debate, \nand we passed that proposition with all Democrats supporting that to \nget it by, without a single Republican vote in either the House of \nRepresentatives or the U.S. Senate. The facts of the matter are, as we \nexplained yesterday, that primarily because of that, coupled with the \nexcellent leadership of President Bill Clinton, this Nation has been on \na steady, logical growth pattern in all areas.\n  I remember hearing people on that side of the aisle who attacked that \nbudget at the time saying it would be devastating to the economy of the \nUnited States of America, that we would never recover if we passed \nthis. We have more than recovered, we have had one of the most \nastonishing periods of growth in American economy since that was passed \nthat we have ever seen.\n  At the same time, coupled with that tax increase package and coupled \nwith the economic growth that we have had under the direction of the \nClinton administration, we have seen a dramatic drop, 3 years in a row, \nof the deficit of the United States of America, from basically $300 \nbillion a year, now down to $147 billion.\n  I did not know we were going to get into a debate all over again on \nthat measure that I voted for, and would vote for again, because I \nthought it was the right thing to do. In addition to being the right \nthing to do, we would not be in a position here in the Congress this \nyear, nor would we have been in a position last year, to work toward a \nbalanced budget, were it not for the fact that the Democrats, under the \nleadership of Bill Clinton, reduced dramatically the deficit which has \nspurred growth in the United States of America.\n\n  So if anyone wishes to take me on for what I did wrong 2 years ago, I \nam willing to do that because the facts of growth in the economy speak \nfor themselves. I do not generally say how the stock market goes is how \nAmerica goes, but certainly that is one factor in our economy that we \nneed to look at. I suggest to all that since the development of that \nsound package by all Democratic votes and not one Republican vote in \nthe House or the Senate, we have seen the stock market break every \nrecord that it ever established before.\n  The people are happy with it. It has reduced the deficit. It has \ngotten us to the place where we have a chance--although it is still a \ntough task--to balance the budget by the year 2002. Were it not for \nthat particular measure that is now being criticized--in my opinion \nirresponsibly once again--we would not be in the shape we are in today \nof reaching for a goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002, which \nis something this Senator and many like me have fought for ever since I \nhave been here.\n  I yield 5 minutes, or whatever time he needs, to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. This is one of those \ndebates, as I listen to it, that I think causes people who are watching \nfrom outside the beltway to just shake their heads, because they have \nto wonder what is this all about? I must say, unless you are a green \neyeshade type and spend all of your time poring over the subaccounts of \nthe Federal Government, it is a little confusing.\n  I think one of the things that perhaps has been lost in this \ndiscussion is that if we are looking at a comparison between the \nvarious budgets on domestic discretionary spending--and that is, after \nall, the pool of money from which veterans benefits are drawn and all \nof the other discretionary spending elements of the Federal budget--the \nreality is, the Republican budget over 6 years cuts $296 billion, the \nPresident's budget, $229 billion, so the cuts in discretionary spending \nin the Republican budget are substantially greater than the cuts in the \nPresident's budget.\n  The issue has been raised, what are the subtotals? When you \ndistribute those reductions, when you distribute them among all the \nfunctions in domestic discretionary spending, how do\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nveterans come out? I think one of the things that has been lost in this \ndebate is that these functional totals are not binding. They are not \nbinding. That is the way the budget process works. There is no \nrequirement that the committees of jurisdiction abide by that \nfunctional subtotal.\n\n  I ask my colleague from Nebraska, is that not the case? As the \nranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, is it not the case that \nthese functional subtotals are not binding?\n  Mr. EXON. I would certainly emphasize that the Senator from North \nDakota is so right. I am so glad he has pointed that out.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So, we get lost here in the details, but the overarching \ntruth is the Republican budget, over 6 years, cuts $296 billion out of \ndomestic discretionary spending. The pool of money for domestic \ndiscretionary spending is reduced by $296 billion. The President's \nbudget reduces it by $229 billion over 6 years. I point out the \ncentrist budget, which a bipartisan group of Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have agreed to, is $179 billion over 6 years.\n  Frankly, I would say both the Republican budget and the President's \nbudget have unrealistic reductions in domestic discretionary spending. \nThey are unlikely to ever occur. One of the reasons is, in both of \nthose budgets, that the overall pool of money available for domestic \ndiscretionary spending is so sharply reduced that future Congresses are \nunlikely to adhere to the spending path outlined in either one of those \nbudgets.\n  The fact is, the bipartisan group, which has tried to put together a \nbudget alternative that would really have some prospects of actually \nholding course, holding to the course set for a 7-year period, has \nlower domestic discretionary savings than either of the other budgets. \nIt is also true the President has less in the way of domestic \ndiscretionary savings than the Republican budget has. So if people are \nreally concerned about veterans or any other subcategory of the budget, \nand they are comparing the President's budget and the Republican \nbudget, the President's budget is more adequate, has less reductions \nover a 6-year period, or a 7-year period, than does the Republican \nbudget.\n  So if you are concerned about veterans or if you are concerned about \neducation or you are concerned about all of the other elements that are \npart of domestic discretionary spending, the President's budget is \nsuperior to the Republican budget.\n  The fact is, these functional subtotals that are the concern of the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri are not binding. Those are the \nrules we work on around here. Those totals are not binding.\n  Somehow I think we are missing the point. We have bogged down in the \ndetails in an attempt to score partisan political points. \nUnfortunately, that is what is happening around here more and more. We \nhave not gotten into what is the heart of the debate and the \ndiscussion, what is the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter \nis, all of us need to move toward a balanced budget. We need to do that \nbecause we are on a course that cannot be sustained.\n  The Entitlements Commission told us last year if we stay on the \ncurrent course, we are going to have an 82 percent tax rate in this \ncountry, or a one-third cut in all benefits. That is the harsh reality \nof what we confront. And all of these budgets--all of them--are \nreducing domestic discretionary spending, they are reducing every other \nelement of the Federal budget from what current law provides in an \nattempt to move towards fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I will just say in conclusion, I hope my colleagues \nwill remember, the reality is, the President's budget has less \nreductions in domestic discretionary spending than does the Republican \nbudget. That is just a fact. And the second fact that is important to \nremember is these functional subtotals that are the subject of debate \nhere are not binding in any event. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I call on my distinguished friend, how many \nminutes?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute first and just say, \nI thank the Senator from North Dakota. He has been a great champion for \nreforming entitlements. He and I agree entitlements need to be \nreformed.\n  My amendment proposes reforms in the entitlement programs. The \namendment of my friend from Nebraska, Senator Exon, adds another $13 \nbillion in tax increases. And in looking at the extensive list on page \n153 and 154 of tax increases that are already included in the \nPresident's recommendation, I am puzzled where they find another $13 \nbillion. But that is the argument: Do we reform entitlements or raise \ntaxes?\n\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is the first time that I have spoken \non the budget. I am not on the Budget Committee, I am not an \nappropriator, but I, obviously, am very interested in this process, \nperhaps more interested in it as it pertains to the policy direction it \nwould take than specifically in the dollars.\n  The budget is a document that has more impact than simply spending. \nThe budget document is one that gives us some direction in terms of \nwhere we go. It gives us some direction in terms of philosophy. Do you \nwant more Government or would you have less?\n  I have to tell you that I believe the people in Wyoming think the \nFederal Government ought to be less expensive, ought to be smaller, we \nought to spend less. It has to do with balancing the budget, and it is \ninteresting to listen to those who have worked so hard through the \nyears: ``Balance the budget.''\n  Have you ever heard anyone rise who did not want to balance the \nbudget? I do not think so. It has not been balanced for 25 years. I \nbegin to wonder if all this rhetoric has been so meaningful. But in any \nevent, we need to balance the budget. It is morally and fiscally \nresponsible to do that.\n  It is a philosophical question if you want to balance the budget. We \nhear a lot of talk about how we moved the deficit down. How did we do \nthat? By the largest tax increase in the history of this country. I do \nnot happen to think that is the proper way to do that. I think we ought \nto reduce spending.\n  Of course, whenever you talk about reducing spending, somebody says, \n``No, I don't want to reduce it there, I want to reduce it there. I \nwant to reduce it for you, not for me.'' I understand that. When the \naverage family spends 40 percent of their income in total taxes, that \nis an excessive amount. So we need to talk about that, and we need to \ntake a look at our goals and see if this really, really does it.\n  I agree with the Senator from North Dakota that maybe we get bogged \ndown entirely with all these details, which somebody has to do. But for \nmost of us, it is a direction, a philosophy, it is where we are going, \nand the budget has something to do with that, a great deal to do with \nthat.\n  I was very involved in our budget in the Wyoming Legislature. It was \nmuch smaller, much easier, same principle. One of the differences was \nwe had a constitutional amendment that said we had to balance the \nbudget. We could not spend more than we took in. What an idea.\n\n  So we talk about that Washington has never spent more on bureaucracy \nthan it does now--this administration--never spent less in real dollars \non defense since World War II. The tax burden has never been higher \nthan it is now. Americans will pay half a trillion dollars more in \ntaxes because of our tax increase.\n  I am concerned as well about the backloading. Now I hear, ``Well, we \nall backload.'' That is true. But the fact is that the Clinton budget \nbackloads much more than the other one, 66 percent of the savings in \nthe last 2 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, this is the first time I have talked. I would like a \nchance to do that. Thank you.\n  So it is backloaded, and no one can argue with that. It is there and \nperhaps none of it should be backloaded. Of course, it will be when you \nreduce so much this year, it builds up, and I understand that. But we \nhave to make some tough decisions if we are going to do that, and that \nis what it is about.\n  Raising taxes--as I understand, the Clinton budget takes out $97 \nbillion in taxes, puts back 60, a net reduction of\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\n$37 billion. That is really not much of a bite; not much of a bite for \na country that pays that much in taxes.\n  The Republican budget, on the other hand, is about 122, I believe; \n$500 credit for children. That is a pretty good idea, I think. \nPermanent; age 18. We do not start with three.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate that, Mr. President. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. CONRAD. One minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would just like to say to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming, I am disturbed by backloading, too, but the reality is \nthe Republican plan has 64 percent of its savings in the last 2 years. \nSo this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Both of them \nhave 82 percent of their savings in the last 3 years. They are both \nbackloaded.\n  So to come and criticize the President's plan when your own plan does \nexactly the same thing is a little misleading.\n  Let me just say----\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think if we were going to be direct with each other, we \nwould acknowledge both plans are backloaded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 16 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Nebraska has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from North Dakota for \nhis excellent remarks. His statement with regard to the savings that \nare talked about in discretionary programs is something that I intend \nto follow up on in my closing remarks.\n  I will just say at this time that I have been here on the floor since \nthis debate began. I have heard the same things over and over and over \nagain--the Republicans seem to think if they say something enough \ntimes, it is true. They have said on many occasions that the \nPresident's budget does not balance in the year 2002. I do not know how \nmany times I have refuted that point, and noted that the Republican-\nappointed head of the Congressional Budget Office says that the \nPresident's budget does balance in the year 2002.\n  The same CBO office says that the Republican plan balances in the \nyear 2002. So if the Republicans are trying to impeach the written word \nof their own appointed CBO office, then they impeach the source of \ntheir balanced budget as well.\n  Why can we not be realistic? Both programs are estimated--and I use \nthe word ``estimated'' with emphasis--by the Congressional Budget \nOffice as reaching balance.\n  I have heard another myth that is repeated over and over and over \nagain and that is with regard to the terrible backloading, as alleged \nby the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I refer to the chart behind me once again. We have had it out here \nbefore. I am going to drag this chart out every time I hear on that \nside of the aisle that there is backloading going on.\n  This chart has been here before, but the red line on that chart is \nthe President's backloading and the blue line on that chart is the GOP \nbackloading. The years are below, and the numbers are up there.\n  So suffice it to say, it is not accurate, nor is it fair, nor does it \ncontribute to the debate for me to get up and say, ``Oh, boy, there's \nall kinds of backloading in that GOP budget.''\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will not yield.\n  I would be fearful that the Republicans would bring out something \nlike this and show me that what they are accusing the Democrats of \ndoing is what the Republicans are doing. Essentially they are one and \nthe same.\n  I simply say that I will reserve the remainder of my time for my \nclosing statement. But I just wish that we could keep our debates on \nsomething that is realistic, without going overboard and saying things \nover and over again, things that I do not know how many times I \nrefuted. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, before yielding to the Senator from \nWashington, I just want a point of clarification with my distinguished \nfriend from Nebraska.\n  Does that chart show the President's numbers with or without the \nautomatic trigger?\n  Mr. EXON. The automatic trigger, we went through that earlier, did we \nnot?\n  Mr. BOND. That chart, does it show it with or without the automatic \ntrigger?\n  Mr. EXON. Once again I say, whether it triggers or not, this is an \nhonest chart on honest numbers that has been verified by the CBO.\n  Are you indicating there is something tricky about these numbers?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the CBO said the only way the President's \nnumbers get to a balance in 2002 is if an automatic trigger clicks in \nand cuts 10 percent of discretionary spending in 2001 and 18 percent in \n2002. I am simply asking whether that chart--and I did not prepare the \nchart--does that chart present the President's number assuming no \ntrigger or assuming a trigger? Which way is it?\n\n  Mr. EXON. I have been advised this is the chart with the figures in \nit. If I find out differently, I will correct it for the Record.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my good friend from Nebraska. That is all I wanted \nto ask, because we have, as he indicated, I think on a bipartisan \nbasis, voted overwhelmingly that we do not want the trigger. We have \nsaid, no trigger. We do not want a meat ax.\n  So the only difference between the President's budget and the \nRepublicans' budget is that the President's budget, by CBO numbers, \ndoes not now get to balance--without the trigger, it does not get to \nbalance. Ours does. With that, I will yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in my few minutes, I will make three \npoints. The first point is to agree with my colleague, the Senator from \nNebraska, by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office, the \nPresident's budget does indeed balance in the year 2002. It does, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, because of an automatic \nset of tax increases and spending cuts in the years 2001 and 2002, if \nthe Congressional Budget Office's projections of spending and of the \neconomy are correct.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the President's budget would balance if the \nCongressional Budget Office showed half a trillion dollars' difference \nbetween now and the year 2000 with automatic huge tax increases and \nspending cuts in the years thereafter.\n  If you put in such a trigger, the balance is automatic. The real \npoint is that in the real world, using the same set of figures, it will \nnot reach balance unless that trigger is pulled. We have just voted \nagainst the trigger.\n  The second point I would like to make is with respect to the debate \nright now on two amendments in front of us. Those two amendments each \nsay that we should not reduce veterans benefits in the way that the \nPresident's budget indicates they will be reduced, a little increase in \nthe first couple of years, then a huge reduction thereafter.\n  The difference is the classical difference between the parties. \nRepublicans restore those veterans benefits by welfare reform. \nDemocrats restore them by tax hikes, tax hikes sufficient so that the \nPresident's very modest tax reductions in his budget become a net tax \nincrease over the period of time covered by this budget.\n  That is a classical difference. People can decide, would they rather \nsupport our veterans with welfare reform or would they rather support \nthem with tax hikes? I think that is a relatively simple question.\n  But, Mr. President, my third point is that I am not sure of the total \nrelevance either of the debate on triggers that the Senator from \nNebraska has\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\nspoken of, or even of the two amendments with which we are going to \nengage now. It is at this point I want to compliment and support the \nremarks of my Democratic colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, \nwho points out that there is a superior way of going toward either of \nthe proposals that are on the floor here right now, one which I believe \nwe will debate early next week, the first proposal in several years \nthat is in fact bipartisan in nature, the one that most decisively \ndeals with a reform of entitlement programs, that makes them more \nrealistically affordable by the people of the United States and, \ntherefore, is more reasonable with respect to the amount of money that \nwe have to spend on education and the environment and law enforcement \nand national parks and the myriad of other year-to-year \nresponsibilities of this body.\n  So in that respect the Senator from North Dakota is right. I have the \nprivilege to work with him. We will later on in this debate be \npresenting that budget.\n  I believe the Republican budget much superior and much more honest to \nthe one that is before us right now, and I intend ultimately to vote \nfor it if that is the last vote before us. But I believe the one worked \nout by this bipartisan group to be markedly superior to any of the \nothers that have been presented this year.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me yield myself up to 5 minutes to also speak on the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, as I look at this amendment that is before the Senate \noffered by the Senator from Nebraska in response to the previous \namendment from the Senator from Missouri, once again I am struck by the \napproach that is being taken with regard to the President's budget. I \ntalked several times about the President's budget during the course of \nthis debate and tried to point out the extent to which the claims the \nbudget includes relief for America's taxpayers are exaggerated.\n  Once again we see the approach being taken to make sure taxpayers end \nup with less. The President's budget claims initially it will provide \nAmericans with $99 billion in tax relief. When you include the various \nso-called corporate loopholes and other increased revenues involved \nwith the President's budget, the net tax relief drops to $36 billion. \nThen, when you terminate the various tax cuts as triggered in the year \n2000, it reduces total tax relief between the year 1996 and the year \n2002 to $6 billion approximately.\n  Mr. President, $6 billion works out to about $1 billion a year, or \n250 million Americans working out to $4 per American per year in the \nbudget that the President is offering. That is not a lot of tax relief \nby my standards. I think it would not be seen that way by the American \npeople.\n  Here comes yet another wrinkle. An amendment that would further \nchange the bottom line on taxes with regard to this budget. Indeed, by \nincreasing the revenue side of this equation by an additional $13 \nbillion, we now eliminate all of the tax relief contained in the \nPresident's budget and instead have turned the President's budget, \nshould this amendment pass, into one which would have a net tax \nincrease of $7 billion. I cannot imagine that is the approach the \nAmerican people want us to take, to actually increase, on a net basis, \nthe taxes we burden them with.\n  Some will argue that these taxes would somehow fall on the \ncorporations, the big companies, and so on. I question that, Mr. \nPresident. It seems to me the big taxpaying entities have discovered a \nlot of ways to pass along the taxes to the average working families in \nAmerica. Indeed, during the recent debate about the gas tax repeal, we \nwere told that the 4 cent repeal would never get to the consumers \nbecause the intermediate-stage corporations would somehow find a way to \npocket the dollars for themselves. If that is true for the gas tax, it \nwill certainly be true for this tax. If this increase is put into our \nbudget, we will again see the actual people paying for it, the hard-\nworking families of our country.\n  I have to stand in support of what the Senator from Washington just \nsaid, complimenting the Senator from Missouri for his amendment and \nurging its support and urging our colleagues to oppose an increase in \ntaxes as would be contained in the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I simply say to my \ncolleague on the other side with respect to the Senator's amendment, \nyou can close a tax loophole and not raise taxes on any Americans. As a \nmember of the Finance Committee, I have been trying for some time to \ndeal with the question of the fact that 73 percent of the foreign \ncorporations doing business in the United States do not pay a penny of \ntaxes here.\n  The question is, how can that be? How do they avoid paying taxes in \nthe United States when they are obviously doing very well here?\n  Mr. President, the reason is, we have a scheme called transfer \npricing in the international tax system that allows corporations to put \ntheir taxes or their profits where there are no taxes. Foreign \ncorporations who are in here competing with American corporations have \nbeen taking advantage of this loophole in a very significant way to \navoid paying any taxes here. That is not only unfair to U.S. taxpayers, \nthat is unfair to U.S. companies who are expected to compete with the \nforeign enterprise that escapes and avoids tax responsibility, that an \nAmerican-based corporation cannot escape and avoid.\n  I say that my colleague from Nebraska has come up with a very \nreasonable way to take care of the needs of our veterans by closing a \ntax loophole. Now, some of our friends on the other side have never \nseen a tax loophole they do not like. They have never seen a tax \nloophole they do not endorse.\n  There is absolutely no reason to allow foreign corporations to do \nbusiness in this country and not pay any taxes here. It is not fair, \nnot only to U.S. taxpayers, it is not fair to American corporations \nwith whom they compete.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time we have \nand how much time Senator Exon has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 6 minutes remaining, and the \nSenator from Nebraska has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, without using that time, might I \nexchange with Senator Exon about where we are going next. If we use our \n6 minutes and you use your 4 minutes, are we ready to vote in the \nsequence that we heretofore agreed to?\n  Mr. EXON. We are ready. That sequence, just to set the record \nstraight, we would vote on the Exon amendment first and the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Missouri second. And I believe, if I remember \ncorrectly, the first vote would be a 15-minute vote, and the second \nvote, I believe it was stipulated by the Senator from New Mexico, is to \nbe 10 minutes. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Mr. President, first, I want to congratulate \nSenator Bond on his amendment and Senator Exon on his amendment, \nbecause we are going to have an opportunity here, in about 12 minutes, \nto vote on 2 proposals.\n  There could be nothing closer to reflecting the difference between \nthe 2 parties than these two amendments. So, make no bones about it, we \nwill first vote on a Democrat amendment, which will increase taxes, no \nmatter what you call it. You increase taxes to pay for appropriated \naccounts that are cut, which they are finally admitting in cutting this \nbudget--that is, the veterans of this country. So the first vote is \ngoing to be: Do you want to raise taxes to spend more money? The second \nvote is going to be a Republican vote, and it will be very simple: Do \nyou want to increase spending for veterans by cutting spending \nsomeplace else?\n  We say, yes. We say, the American people are not interested in \nraising taxes. We already raised taxes 2 years ago, which was the \nlargest tax increase in history. The President has, in his budget, $90 \nbillion, under the rubric of ``corporate welfare''--but it is $90 \nbillion. Senator Exon says that $90 billion is not enough to do what we \nwant to do. We want $13 billion more because\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nwe caught them with the reality that they are reducing the level of \nexpenditures for the veterans of this country by at least $13 billion, \ndecimating our commitment to the veterans.\n  As our President is prone to say, we do not want to violate our \nvalues. Our values are very simple: Protect the veterans of America. \nLive up to your commitment. We do not want to violate that value. But I \nwill suggest that the reality of it now is that the President violates \nthat value. But he almost got away with it, with nobody understanding \nit--except for this amendment today, which clearly now says it, and \neven the Democrats understand. They understand veterans is cut enough \nthat they want to raise taxes to pay for it.\n  Now, they were not saying they were cutting veterans just 4 or 5 days \nago because, obviously, they just wanted to say Republicans were \ncutting programs to get to balance. There is a nice little gimmick. The \nPresident called it a ``trigger.'' The problem is that the trigger \nwould not work on the floor, because if you have to use CBO economics, \nand not the President's choice of economics, then you have to pull the \ntrigger, and they did that and they put a giant plug in their budget. \nThat plug, so everybody will know, is a big whopping plug. It is $32 \nbillion in tax cuts that have to be sunsetted. So we raise taxes $32 \nbillion after having cut them. That is the first thing in the plug. We \nadd Medicare cuts of $13 billion, and the President adds spectrum fees \nof $6 billion. This is kind of the cornucopia of solving budget \nproblems. Spectrum fee. Mr. President, $38 billion is in the budget. \nThis says $6.6 billion more to get to the balance of the President and \nthe balance the distinguished minority manager put before the Senate.\n  And then is the big ticket item: discretionary cuts of $67 billion \nare in this new plug. Pull the trigger and expose the reality and there \nsits a plug, without which you cannot balance the budget. And $67 \nbillion of that is in the discretionary programs, such as veterans. And \nwe are trying to fix veterans with this amendment. We do it very \nsimply, very simply. We say, we think veterans ought to get this $13 \nbillion because we have a high value on our relationship to veterans. \nWe think the welfare program of the country could be reduced by $13 \nbillion to pay for it. Reduce welfare and turn it into workfare. And \neven at that, we have not reduced welfare to the extent that the \nbipartisan welfare reform that cleared this place would have.\n  So, in summary, we have now exposed the reality of the President's \nbudget. We have exposed the reality of it. He did not want anybody to \nknow that, to really get to balance, we needed $124 billion, and we now \nhave that before the Senate--a piece of it before us. Do you want to \nincrease taxes to take care of our veterans? Or do you want to reduce \nwelfare to take care of our veterans?\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Will Rogers once said, ``It's not what he \nknows that bothers me; it's what he says he knows for sure that just \nain't so.''\n  Two points: No. 1, the President's budget proposes more in \ndiscretionary spending than the Republican budget. There is no debate \nabout that, and there is no amount of bluster on this floor that can \nchange that.\n  No. 2, this is not about tax increases. The fact is, if this is a \nsong with unlimited verses--tax increases, I guess--we spend $2.2 \nbillion to pay companies to shut their American plants and move them \noverseas. How about shutting that down and using the money in a \nconstructive way? Two men from Florida did a study that says we lose \n$40 billion a year by foreign corporations doing business in America \nthat do not pay taxes here, and 73 percent of the foreign corporations \ndoing business in America pay zero taxes.\n  To close tax loopholes is somehow increasing taxes? No. We are \ntalking about big, fat, juicy tax breaks for some of the biggest \nenterprises in the world, and we are talking about closing them. Is \nthere anything wrong with that? I do not think so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 1 minute to acknowledge the departure of a truly great American.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this time not \nbe charged to either side, as we have been doing all afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5150-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PASSING OF ADM. MIKE BOORDA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I cannot begin to express how terribly \nsaddened I am by the news of Adm. Mike Boorda's death this afternoon. \nMy heart goes out to his wife, Bettie, and his children, Anna, Eddie, \nBobby, and David. I pray that God's love, and the memory of a wonderful \nhusband and father will comfort them in this moment of profound grief.\n  Mike Boorda was my friend of more than 20 years. He was an \nexceptional American, the first enlisted man to head the world's \ngreatest Navy. He dedicated his entire adult life to the security of \nour country. He was a great sailor who loved the Navy beyond measure. \nHe honored the uniform he was so proud to wear and the country he \nserved so well. Most of all, I am grateful for the honor he did me by \nblessing me with his friendship. We all shall miss him very much.\n  May God grant him the eternal peace he deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5157-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5157-S5158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think we should alert all--and I believe \nthe managers of the bill would agree--that we, most likely, will start \nvoting in about 5 minutes, is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Would the Senator mind if the first vote is 15 \nminutes, to be immediately followed by a 10-minute vote?\n  Mr. EXON. No. Let the Record show as the Senator from New Mexico \nindicated. We are going to start voting in about 5 minutes. The first \nvote will be a 15-minute vote, immediately following, without any \nintervention, by a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMissouri, and that will be a 10-minute vote.\n\n  Mr. President, let me wind up briefly within the time I have left. I \njust find it a little bit odd that the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Missouri continue to complain that the discretionary \nnumbers in the President's budget are too low. This has been mentioned \nby other Senators in debate, and I had this written down because I \nwanted to comment on it in closing.\n  Mr. President, if the President's appropriated savings are steep, \nthen the Republican appropriations savings are positively cataclysmic. \nThat is the point. Over the 6 years of the budget, the Republican \nbudget cuts $65 billion more from appropriations than does the \nPresident. And in the final year of the budget, 2002, the Republicans \ncut $13 billion more in appropriated spending in that 1 year than does \nthe President.\n  The Senator from Missouri knows that the Appropriations Committee \nwill distribute those cuts--not this resolution. Indeed, neither the \nRepublican budget, nor a Republican budget of any kind, contains \nprogram-by-program detail for appropriated accounts. The fairest \ncomparison of appropriations in the outyears, therefore, is to compare \ntotals of spending levels.\n  If I need additional time to close, I take it off of the time I have \non the amendment.\n  In sum and in closing, the Republicans want to cut projected spending \non the very poorest in the Nation. We want to plug some corporate \nloopholes that have been alluded to here and some specifics, and there \nare many more. We agree. We want to honor our veterans. That is the \nreason for this Democratic amendment. The real question is whether we \nwant to protect the disabled kids or the corporations who are moving \njobs overseas.\n  Mr. President, I yield any remaining time that I have. I believe the \nChair will confirm that we have previously\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nagreed to the yeas and nays on the Exon amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been approved for the Bond \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before we vote, let me ask Senator Exon a question.\n  According to our understanding, your side has the next amendment \nafter we vote on these two.\n  Mr. EXON. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we see that amendment during the vote?\n  Mr. EXON. We will provide that amendment to you during the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3973\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate just voted on an amendment by \nthe Senator from Nebraska to increase veterans health care funding by \nchanges in the Tax Code. Purportedly the revenue would be derived from \nclosing corporate tax loopholes, although there is no guarantee that's \nwhere the money would come from. Proponents of the amendment have \ncharacterized the amendment as cutting corporate welfare.\n  First, I want to say that I support additional funding for veterans \nhealth care. In fact, I voted for the Bond amendment to increase health \ncare spending by $13 billion.\n  Senator Exon's amendment also recommends a $13 billion increase. \nHowever, I want to address the issue of how the Senator from Nebraska \nintends to pay for the increase.\n  As my colleagues are aware I have been outspoken and active in the \neffort to cut inappropriate corporate subsidies. In fact, last year I \noffered an amendment to the reconciliation bill to cut over $50 billion \nin corporate pork spending. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated. \nI might note that the effort did not enjoy the support of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  In addition, I have authored bipartisan legislation to review and \neliminate corporate subsidies, including tax loopholes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska says the increase in veterans health care \nwould be paid for by filling corporate tax loopholes. That sounds good, \nMr. President, but the way that the amendment is written, that result \nis not guaranteed.\n  Moreover, even if we could be sure that loopholes were closed, I \nbelieve we owe it to the American people to dedicate the revenues \nderived from such reforms to reduce the tax burden on American families \nacross the board.\n  Simply stated we can and should pay for necessary increases in \nveterans health care by offsets in other Federal spending, not by \nincreasing the overall Federal tax burden.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand now the minority may have \nfound another way to offer the President's budget and they intend to do \nthat; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5157-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5158-S5159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE DEATH OF ADM. JEREMY MICHAEL BOORDA, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was informed this afternoon that Adm. \nMike Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, died today. I have little \nadditional information at this time on what happened or how; but I want \nto take a minute to acknowledge the passing of a fine naval officer who \nmade many extraordinary contributions to the Navy and to his country. I \nthink this is a tragic day for both the Navy and the Nation. We lost an \nindividual who was both a strong leader and a decent man.\n  Admiral Boorda enlisted in the Navy in 1956 and rose from seaman to \nadmiral. He was selected and confirmed as\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nthe 25th Chief of Naval Operations in April 1994. Prior to his \nconfirmation as Chief of Naval Operations, he commanded all United \nStates and NATO forces in Bosnia. As ranking minority and now Chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, I had the opportunity to work \nclosely with Adm. Mike Boorda on many occasions. I found him to be an \nofficer of great professional skill, who instilled confidence and stood \nas a model of what a dedicated and courageous officer and leader should \nbe.\n  Admiral Boorda took command of the Navy at a challenging time. His \nsteady hand and firm leadership during a period of great change, a \nturbulent period of declining force structure and personnel reductions, \nand his firm commitment to professionalism and operational readiness, \nhave kept the Navy on a steady course and sustained its excellence as a \nfighting force.\n  Particularly impressive was the empathy and concern that Adm. Mike \nBoorda had for those under his command. As a former enlisted sailor, he \nhad a keen appreciation of the hardships of service at sea and family \nseparation that are a part of a sailor's daily existence. He understood \ntheir sacrifice and worked extremely hard to ensure the welfare of \nnaval personnel. He never failed to advise me on conditions in the \nfleet during our frequent meetings. His concern for the quality of life \nof the men and women in the naval service was remarkable.\n  During more than 40 years of service to the Navy and to his country, \nAdm. Mike Boorda made many extraordinary contributions to his country. \nHe was man of great energy, vision, commitment, and patriotism. He was \na man who deserved our gratitude and respect for his service while he \nlived, and our praise and prayers now that he is gone. We will miss him \ngreatly.\n  Our thoughts are with his family, his wife Betty, his four children, \nand his nine grandchildren. They include two sons and one daughter-in-\nlaw on active duty in the Navy. We extend our sympathy to them and wish \nthem well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am saddened, as my colleagues are, by \nthe news we just received about Admiral Boorda's death. His loss is a \ntragedy for the Navy, the Armed Forces, and for the entire Nation.\n  Admiral Boorda was an outstanding leader and had the best possible \nqualifications to be Chief of Naval Operations because he rose through \nthe ranks. He entered the Navy as an enlisted man in 1956. He is the \nonly enlisted person ever to reach that high position.\n  As ranking member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower, I \nhad the privilege of working with Admiral Boorda for several years. I \nhad great admiration for his knowledge, skill, leadership and \ndedication. President Kennedy was a Navy man, too, and he said at the \nNaval Academy in 1962:\n\n       I can imagine a no more rewarding career of any man who may \n     be asked in this century what he did to make his life \n     worthwhile. I think I can respond with a good deal of pride \n     and satisfaction: I served in the U.S. Navy.\n\n  Admiral Boorda's life and career exemplify the best in that \ntradition. I join the Navy and the Nation in mourning its loss, and \nexpress my deepest condolences to his wife, Betty, and to his entire \nfamily.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, having just recently learned of the \ntragic death of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Boorda. Admiral \nBoorda was a native of Indiana and had a distinguished military career, \nrose to the very top as Chief of Naval Operations. As chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee, I had numerous discussions and meetings with \nhim, so I felt that I got to know him as well as you can in a busy \nWashington and all the busy activities we are involved in.\n  I was shocked by the news, deeply saddened by the news, and concerned \nfor his family. While we do not have all the details of his death, I \nthink we all feel the sense of grief that comes with this type of an \nannouncement.\n  Admiral Boorda came into leadership at a difficult time for the U.S. \nNavy. Many changes have taken place in the Navy that brought to his \ndesk a number of problems that were difficult problems to deal with. \nYet, he did so with skill and did so with great thoroughness and \ndetermination to seek a proper solution.\n  So, Mr. President, I intend to say more later about Admiral Boorda \nand his career and service to this Nation. But I join with those in \nsaying how shocked and saddened we are with this particular \nannouncement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I, too, want to join my Senate colleagues \nin expressing how profoundly saddened we are about the death of Adm. \nMike Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations. He was truly one of the most \nimpressive figures who has ever been selected to serve as Chief of \nNaval Operations. He rose from the ranks of the enlisted personnel to \nbecome an officer, and not only that, but the highest-ranking officer \nin the U.S. Navy. He brought to that job an enthusiasm for the work, a \nlove for the Navy, and a respect for everyone in the Navy that was \nunparalleled.\n  I recall very clearly a visit that I had the good fortune to make \nwith him to the Meridian Naval Air Station in Meridian, MS. He gone \ndown to our State and was visiting other States in the South looking at \nnaval installations. He visited the Pascagoula base on the gulf coast. \nI was with him in Meridian when, after a tour of the naval air station, \nhe wanted an opportunity to meet with everybody on the air station. So \na meeting was called and everyone was invited. All hands were invited \nto come see the Chief of Naval Operations in the gymnasium there on the \nbase.\n  He talked to everyone. He had a hand-held mike. He walked out in the \nmiddle of the gymnasium, as people were seated in the stands all \naround. After his remarks, without any notes at all, he took questions \nand he was asked questions about everything from pay allowance issues, \nto housing, to the status of some repair contracts on Navy fighter \naircraft, to the status of trainers, and how long they would remain in \nservice. He knew something about everything that he was asked\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\nthat day, and he handled the questions in a way that showed a genuine \nrespect for each person who asked the question, whether it was an \nofficer, a pilot of an airplane, or an enlisted personnel. He left that \nplace that day with everyone really endeared to him and totally \nimpressed with him as a person and proud to be in the U.S. Navy with \nhis being the highest ranking officer in that Navy.\n  So it is with deep regret and sadness that we heard today the tragic \nnews of his death. Our condolences go out to his family and to all of \nthose who worked closely with him, because they have to be deeply, \ndeeply saddened by this terrible event. But his legacy will be long \nremembered and appreciated as an enduring gift of unselfish public \nservice by a person who was a true patriot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5159-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5160-S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller is here. We are trying \nto move things along. He is ready to offer an amendment. We had a \ndiscussion here a few moments ago. As I understood it, the arrangement \nwould be that there would be no more votes before 8 o'clock, and that, \nin the meantime, we had agreed to set aside, temporarily, the Exon \namendment, which is before the body, to allow other amendments to be \noffered. I am pleased to see my friend from New Mexico here. Senator \nRockefeller is here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Exon amendment be temporarily set \naside for the purpose of other people offering amendments. I simply say \nthat, under the rules that are still in effect, it would be the \nRepublican's turn to offer an amendment. If there is no Republican here \nand ready to offer an amendment, with the approval of the chairman of \nthe committee, we could recognize Senator Rockefeller for his \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object. We have not seen Senator \nRockefeller's amendment. We do not know what it applies to, the \nunderlying bill, or what.\n  Mr. President, I have no objection. I will just ask, since we did \nthis for you last time, you can proceed with the Rockefeller amendment, \nand then we will have an amendment. Since we are entitled to go next--\n--\n  Mr. EXON. I guess I was wrong on that, Mr. President. I was ready to \noffer an amendment. I would have gone next. Out of deference to the \nagreement we made, I am not offering that. So I guess the slot really \nwould be on our side. I see nothing wrong if the Senator agrees that \nSenator Rockefeller will take the place of the Democratic slot I was \nprepared to take, and then the next amendment will be on your side. \nEventually, sometime tonight, we will get back to the Exon amendment \nthat is being temporarily set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield as much time as is necessary to the Senator from \nWest Virginia for the purpose of offering and explaining the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in order to offer an \namendment to restore $50 billion to the Medicare Program. This \namendment restores $50 billion by closing corporate loopholes and by \nextending expired tax provisions already included in the Republican \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, we are back again trying to make sure that the \nMedicare Program is not gutted to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. \nThis is where we were a year ago. This is where we are again now. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have tried to dress up their \nbudget. They are proposing all kinds of fancy maneuvers and 3 separate \nbudget packages. They are pretending their latest budget is somehow \nkinder and gentler. But there is really not much new here compared to \nwhat we had last year. They lost the budget battle last year with the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\npublic when the public realized that the drastic cuts in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs were going to be used to pay for tax breaks for \nthe wealthy.\n  Instead of going back, as I would have thought they would have done, \nto the drawing board and come up with some new ideas and better health \npolicies, they have merely changed the rhetoric. Instead of proposing \nways to strengthen the Medicare Program, they have come up with some \ncomplicated three-tiered reconciliation process so that they can send \nthree different bills to the President in a desperate attempt to score \nsome political points. Instead of working with Democrats and with \nPresident Clinton to actually enact a bipartisan balanced budget, the \nRepublicans continue to work behind closed doors.\n  The budget resolution before us has been preconferenced. I want my \ncolleagues to understand this. It has already been preconferenced \nbetween the House and Senate Budget Committees. I have only been here \n11\\1/2\\ years. I have never heard of that--a preconferenced bill \ninvolving something so massive as Medicare, for example. The deals have \nalready been worked out and they have shut the door on any serious \nattempt to reach an agreement on a balanced budget. It is either their \nway, with massive Medicare cuts to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, or \nit is no way at all.\n  Mr. President, last year the Finance Committee did not hold a single \nhearing on the so-called ``chairman's mark'' to cut Medicare by $270 \nbillion; totally different approach than the one that Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Kassebaum in their respective minority-majority positions \ntook in their committee. The Labor and Human Resources Committee has \ndone their legislation in a bipartisan, open-to-all, way. We did not do \nthat in Finance. We held hearings on the problems of the Medicare \nProgram earlier in the year. But not a single hearing was held on the \nRepublican's actual plan to cut $270 billion out of the Medicare \nProgram. Not a single hearing was held to figure out what the impact of \nthese really very radical cuts would be on the average Medicare \nbeneficiary who already spends, let my colleagues understand this, 21 \npercent of their budget on health care.\n  I wrote Dr. O'Neill, head of the Congressional Budget Office, last \nyear asking for estimates of what she thought this $270 billion might \nhave in the way of an impact on the average senior's pocketbook. \nNeedless to say, I never got a response.\n  It is no different this year, Mr. President. This year the Finance \nCommittee has failed to hold a single hearing on any aspect whatsoever \nof the Medicare Program--not one hearing. This budget resolution \nassumes enactment of the same type of radical policy changes without \neven preserving current law financial protection for seniors.\n  Mr. President, this debate is not about whether we should balance the \nbudget but how we should balance the budget. This Republican budget \nstill seeks the unprecedented cuts in the Medicare Program, just as it \ndid last year. Just as that was rejected by the American people, here \nwe are back again.\n  The President's budget achieves balance with $50 billion, or 44 \npercent, less in Medicare cuts.\n  If they both achieve balance, then it seems to me quite reasonable to \ntake the President's approach and simply restore $50 billion knowing \nthat the budget would then be in balance.\n  Mr. President, even the Congressional Quarterly wrote, ``This year's \nRepublican Medicare budget proposal looks a lot like last year's \nproposal.'' The same thing--a huge public outcry last year, and with a \nnew year out it comes once again.\n  On the surface, the Medicare cuts appear somewhat reduced. But a lot \nof the reduction can be attributed to CBO's revised Medicare baseline \nestimates and because this year's budget only includes 6 years worth of \ncuts rather than 7 years.\n  For hospitals, though, this year's budget resolution is much, much \nworse than last year's. The American Hospital Association estimates \nthat the projected hospital cuts in the budget are 20 percent greater \nthan the cuts in last year's proposed hospital budget cuts.\n  I have here a letter which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 16, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations \n     representing hospitals and health systems, we strongly urge \n     your support of any amendment to S. Con. Res. 57 (the FY 1997 \n     Budget Resolution) which lowers reductions to Medicare. We \n     cite in particular an amendment to be offered by Sen. Jay \n     Rockefeller (D-WV) to restore $50 billion to the Medicare \n     program.\n       While it appears that the overall Medicare budget \n     reductions of $165 billion included in S. Con. Res. 57 are \n     roughly the same as those in the last Republican offer in \n     January, the budget drastically changes how the reductions \n     would be allocated within the program. The FY 1997 budget \n     proposal achieves the total reduction by saving $124 billion \n     from Part A Medicare (the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund) and \n     $44 billion from Part B.\n       The net result is that in S. Con. Res. 57, the reductions \n     in Part A have increased by approximately $25 billion. Not \n     only are these unprecedented reductions, but they would have \n     a disproportionate adverse impact on hospitals. To achieve \n     reductions of this magnitude, Congress may need to adopt \n     policies that would freeze or actually reduce payment rates \n     per beneficiary.\n       Hospitals and health systems support a reasonable deficit \n     reduction package, and believe that changes in Medicare are \n     sorely needed to keep the Part A trust fund solvent. Many of \n     us have supported various proposals that achieve a balanced \n     budget with reductions in Medicare. However, we are gravely \n     concerned about the level of Medicare Part A reductions \n     proposed in S. Con. Res. 57.\n       Again, we ask you to support any amendments that temper the \n     level of reductions to Medicare Part A, including Sen. \n     Rockefeller's amendment to restore $50 billion to the \n     Medicare program, and seek a more balanced approach to \n     achieving savings.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Hospital Association, American Association of \n           Eye and Ear Hospitals, Association of American Medical \n           Colleges, Catholic Health Association, Federation of \n           American Health Systems, InterHealth, National \n           Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, \n           Premier, Inc., VHA Inc.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this letter is signed by the American \nHospital Association, the Catholic Health Association, the Federation \nof American Health Systems, and seven or eight others, in which they \nsay the budget drastically changes how the reductions would be \nallocated within the programs.\n  They refer to: ``Not only are these unprecedented reductions, but \nthey would have a disproportionate adverse impact on hospitals,'' and \nso on. It is a much more drastic cut for hospitals. That is something \nthat we all need to worry about.\n  The Prospective Payment Review Commission, ProPAC, a highly \nrespected, nonpartisan commission that advises Congress on hospital \npayment issues, has warned us in their March report that severe \nreductions in hospital payments could have a severe impact on \nhospitals. They go on to say, ``The required restraint on cost growth \nmay not be feasible, or desirable. Low updates over an extended period \ncould affect a hospital's financial health and compromise access and \ncompromise quality of care. They could also impede the diffusion of \nquality-enhancing technological advances.''\n  Mr. President, this is not a partisan conclusion reached by this \nSenator or the Clinton administration about the hospital cuts proposed \nin the Republican budget. This is a conclusion that has been reached by \na group of health care experts who have been advising Congress on the \nfinancial health of hospitals since 1983.\n  This budget truly ignores the heavy reliance of rural hospitals on \nthe Medicare Program. Small rural hospitals may have to shut their \ndoors. We have heard that before. But with this 20 percent greater \nimpact, it is far more dangerous.\n  Mr. President, in West Virginia one-half of all seniors live in rural \nareas. Well over half of our hospitals are rural and are, therefore, \nclearly and logically disproportionately dependent on the Medicare \nProgram for their payments.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will yet \nagain claim that they are proposing these massive reductions in \nMedicare to save the trust fund from insolvency.\n  Once again, I say this is nonsense. While the most recent Medicare \ntrustees' report showed the trust fund in somewhat worse shape than \nlast year,\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nthe variation falls within the typical margin of error. There is over \n$120 billion in that trust fund, and there is no imminent danger that \nclaims cannot or will not be paid.\n  During my almost 10 years' tenure on the Finance Committee, Mr. \nPresident, we have been faced with many of these situations, to be \nquite honest, with many scenarios of impending trust fund short-term \ninsolvency crises. You have not heard very much about them. The reason \nyou have not heard very much about them is that each time, except for \nthe last time, Finance Committee members worked together to enact \nMedicare payment reforms to extend short-term solvency to that one and \nsame trust fund. We have done it time and time again, maybe seven or \neight times over a period of 15 years.\n  We enacted major reforms in hospital payments in 1983 and followed up \nwith physician payment reform, something that Senator Durenberger and I \nwere closely involved in in 1989, as well, of course, as Senator \nKennedy. We made countless payment and policy adjustments to rein in \nMedicare spending and extend trust fund solvency, but we did it \ntogether. It was bipartisan. You heard very little, if anything, about \nit.\n  In fact, until very recently, the Medicare Program outperformed the \nprivate sector in containing its health care costs. The private sector \nis doing slightly better right now, but realize that the private sector \nis ensuring fewer and fewer people while Medicare's enrollment is \nincreasing. Medicare pays for home care services and skilled nursing \nhome care, types of services that are not normally covered by private \ninsurance policies, and Medicare pays for an older and sicker \npopulation.\n  So in spite of this, except for this year, they have held their costs \nbelow the rate of increase of the private sector. They have done very \nwell. As everybody knows, or hopefully knows by now, their \nadministrative costs are about 2 percent, which is virtually impossible \nto imagine but true.\n  At the beginning of the Clinton administration, the trust fund was \nprojected to be exhausted by 1999--not 2002 but 1999. The Democrats on \nthe Finance Committee were forced to work single-handedly in 1993 to \nextend the solvency of the trust fund by 3 more years, and I am aware \nof that because I negotiated the Medicare part of that.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, that we did not have a single \nRepublican vote. We did it, nevertheless. I did not hear one single \nconcern expressed by the current congressional majority about the \nsolvency of the trust fund back in 1993, which was not very long ago.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has certified that the balanced \nbudget proposed by the President would extend the solvency of the trust \nfund for 10 more years. That is about the same level of solvency \nachieved by the Republican budget. But the President's budget does so \nwithout damaging programmatic changes and drastic cuts that would \neventually cause the Medicare Program to, as one noted public servant \nsaid, ``wither on the vine.'' We can address the short-term solvency \nneeds of the trust fund without slashing and burning the Medicare \nProgram. We can extend short-term solvency without shifting huge new \ncosts to senior citizens. The President's budget proves that it can be \ndone.\n  The tougher issue, of course, is the long-term solvency of the trust \nfund, and about that we are all concerned. When the baby boomers begin \nto age into the Medicare Program, there will be a huge strain on the \ntrust fund. None of the balanced budget proposals deal with the issue \nof long-term solvency. The Democratic proposal does not. The \nPresident's proposal does not. The Republican proposal does not do \nthat.\n  Last year, I introduced legislation--which I believe is strongly \nsupported by Senator Dole; he said he strongly supports it--that would \nestablish a bipartisan Medicare commission. When people hear the word \n``commission,'' they say, ``Oh, yeah, one of those.'' Well, yes, one of \nthose was what solved the Social Security problem for a great many \nyears under President Reagan and Alan Greenspan back in 1981. The House \nand the Senate and the President, Republicans and Democrats, all went \nalong with that. Tough decisions were made. Bullets were bitten. The \nbill was passed, and Social Security is not the concern that it was at \nthat time.\n\n  None of the balanced budget proposals, as I indicated, deal with \nthis, and I think a Medicare commission to make recommendations to \nCongress on ways to deal with the long-term solvency of the Medicare \nProgram is the intelligent, rational way to go. If we adopted the \nPresident's proposal on Medicare, we would have plenty of time, plenty \nof time, to adopt a bipartisan solution that addresses this long-term \nsolvency.\n  It has always been a matter of some amusement to me; if it is solvent \nuntil the year 2002--the Medicare HI trust fund--and this is 1996, that \nis called 6 years.\n  The President could call this commission into being next year, if he \nis reelected, or, if Senator Dole is elected, then he could do it. He \nsays he is for it. It would meet for a period of 6 months or a year or \nwhatever it would be, and the problem, therefore, would be resolved and \nwe could vote on it in 1998, 4 years before the crisis even hit us. Six \nyears is ample time. Medicare is not in danger. Congress will not walk \naway from our responsibilities on Medicare. We simply will not do it.\n  So from my point of view, in concluding, the Republican budget is \ndesigned to raid, not save, the Medicare Program. Medicare's money is \ngoing to be used to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. It is that \nsimple. It has nothing to do with assuring long-term solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund. I find that abhorrent. It has nothing to do with \nmaking sure that Medicare programs continue to provide high-quality \nhealth care for our senior citizens and the disabled. It has everything \nto do with the Republican promises to balance the budget in 7 years and \nhand out tax cuts to the rich.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to the desk in \nthat there was a small error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 10 minutes to \nspeak to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia and I from time to time \nagree on things in the Chamber, and on this occasion we disagree on the \napproaches being taken to Medicare. Let me just begin by trying to put \nin context the magnitude of the problem which we confront. While it may \nbe true in the past there have been projections that Medicare, the part \nA trust fund was headed toward insolvency at some point in the future, \nwe have never come this close before in the following sense. We have \nnever before faced a situation where we actually were paying more \ndollars out of the trust fund than taxpayers were paying into the trust \nfund, but that, indeed, is where we are today.\n  Last April, the Clinton administration estimated that the trust fund \nbalance would increase by $4.7 billion in fiscal year 1995 and 1997 \nwould be the first fiscal year in which it would run a deficit. \nHowever, Department of Treasury figures indicate now that the Medicare \nProgram ran a deficit of $37 billion in fiscal year 1995, 2 years \nearlier than expected. CBO has projected that based on this change in \ncircumstance, Medicare is now likely to become insolvent as early as \nthe year 2000. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record at this \npoint a letter from the head of the CBO, June O'Neill, which indicates \ntheir projected timetable.\n  Mr. President, the concerns I think all of us have about the solvency \nof the part A trust fund are ones that need to be addressed. They need \nto be addressed decisively. I agree with the Senator from West Virginia \nthat we must confront the long-term population projections, the aging \nof the baby boom generation and the impact that will have on Medicare, \nbut I do not think we should postpone dealing with that problem until \ndown the road in some commission. I think we have to begin laying the \nfoundation for dealing with that problem now. That is what we are \ntrying to do with the Republican budget before the Senate here tonight.\n  New estimates, as I said, by the Congressional Budget Office post the \nyear 2001 as the likely point at which the trust fund part A will be \ninsolvent.\n  Matters seem to be getting worse. Last year, Republicans offered a \nsystemic change, an effort to try to create a competitive choice system \nfor Medicare recipients. We were able to get that through the Congress, \nbut, unfortunately, it was vetoed ultimately. But the direction we are \nmoving in is one that will try to address this problem both short term \nand long term. Contrary to some of the comments that have been made, \nthe Finance Committee has had, it is my understanding, 13 hearings \nalready on Medicare in this Congress.\n\n  But the fact remains that there are two basic choices for us to make \nhere in the U.S. Senate. The President has offered a proposal which \nessentially maintains the solvency of the part A trust fund by \nshifting, from the part A trust fund, vital programs, home health care, \nto the tune of approximately $50 billion, maybe a little bit more than \n$50 billion, and through that mechanism produces a greater solvency for \nthe trust fund.\n  We, on our side of the aisle, do not think that is the appropriate \nway to address the problem. Countless Americans depend on the part A \ntrust fund to provide those home health care services. Moving them out \nof the trust fund, moving them into the general account, making them, \ninstead, subject to congressional deliberation and imposing their costs \non the taxpayers, or to force those programs to be competitive with \nothers, is not the way to go.\n  If that is the solution we are going to take every time the trust \nfund approaches insolvency, if we say the answer is to move parts of \nthe programs under the trust fund out of the trust fund, I do not think \nthat is providing seniors with much security at all. In fact, I think \nfor any senior who is listening to this debate, I would warn them if we \nset the precedent saying the way we are going to address the pending \ninsolvency of the Medicare part A trust fund is by taking away services \nand putting them up for negotiation and debate in part B, or in some \nother way to be dealt with by the Congress, we are undermining the \nconfidence that seniors will have in Medicare, and it will continue in \nmy judgment.\n  So, instead of approaching it that way, what we have attempted to do \non the majority side is to provide what we think is a comprehensive \napproach to guaranteeing the solvency for 10 years of the part A trust \nfund. In addition, what we have done is to take the President's own \nnumber, which is $44 billion of savings in the part B Medicare portion \nof the budget. So what that means is that we are taking action that \nwill guarantee the solvency of part A for 10 years, through the year \n2006. That is, I think, a goal worthy of us and one that we should, I \nthink, accomplish for purposes of protecting the American people who \nare dependent on Medicare. And we are using the President's own \nprojected savings in part B of $44 billion to arrive at our Medicare \nobjective.\n  Now that may not be the approach that others support. They seem to \nfeel we need to try to increase the funding. But if we increase the \nfunding in Medicare we are only creating, I think, a more serious \ninsolvency problem. If we do not begin now to reform the programs to \ncreate the options and the choices for Americans so we can begin to \nreduce the rate of growth of the Medicare Program, we are inviting even \ngreater problems at a sooner point, in my judgment.\n  We strongly oppose the amendment that is being offered. We think that \nthe President's approach is not the proper way to go. We think that the \napproach of just spending more money without trying to reform the \nsystem is not the approach to take. Certainly we do not think the way \nto go is to have the usual solution around here of more taxes to fund \nprograms. We need to reform the programs themselves.\n  So, for those reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment. I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan in his reference to treatment of \nhome health care financing. I am addressing, in fact, the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan as the Presiding Officer.\n  It is complicated, but it is very important. I would like to take \njust a couple of minutes, if that is all right, outlining why this \nchange in home care financing does, in fact, make sense. And then also \nwhy, therefore, it is a legitimate way to improve the solvency of the \npart A trust fund.\n  A little history: Before 1980, financing of the home health care \nbenefit was divided between part A and part B, pre-1980. At that time \nonly the first 100 days of home visits after a 3-day hospital stay were \nfinanced from the part A fund. All other visits were financed by part \nB. The policy behind this was that Medicare part A was designed to pay \nfor short-term recuperative home care services. In 1980, Congress \nenacted legislation that improved Medicare's overall home health care \nbenefit by removing the 100-day visit limit and the prior \nhospitalization requirement, the so-called 3-day requirement. As a \nresult, financing of all home care services was shifted at that point \nto part A, even though part A was never intended to pay for long-term \nhome health care services. That is the rationale, and it makes sense.\n  The President's proposal restores financing of the home health care \nbenefit back to the original intent of Medicare, and that is what \nhappens in his proposal. It brings Medicare financing in line with use \npatterns that show home health care has evolved into two distinct \nbenefits: Care to persons recovering from an acute care hospitalization \nand care where there is no hospitalization but long-term care services \nare required. This proposal extends the solvency of the part A trust \nfund by capping part A financing of Medicare's home health benefit and \nsaves the trust fund almost $60 billion over 7 years.\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n  I just wanted to make that point. The Senator from Michigan, the \nPresiding Officer, had raised this point and I think it does bear \nexplanation on a policy basis.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was listening to the presentation of \nthe Senator from West Virginia and felt I had to respond in some \nparticulars. I appreciate the Presiding Officer giving me relief from \nthe chair so that I might do this.\n  I hear the Senator from West Virginia use the statement that we have \nheard many times on the floor, that the purpose of the Republican \nnumber for Medicare is to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. I say once \nagain, if these tax cuts are going to benefit the wealthy, the wealthy \nhave to have awfully big families because the tax cut is limited to \n$500 per child and I do not know anybody who is really wealthy who is \ngoing to make any money off of this at $500 per child. The people who \nneed this are the people who have low incomes and big families. Those \nare the people in my State who are getting a little tired of the \nrhetoric that this is a tax cut for the wealthy. I have heard the \nstatement made on the floor that this is going to mean $10,000 in tax \ncuts to some people. They have to have an awful lot of kids to get \n$10,000 at $500 per child.\n  Second, ``slash and burn'' is a phrase that was used, on the amount \nof money to be spent on Medicare; the incredible cuts. I was a Member \nof this body when the Senator from West Virginia cosponsored the \nClinton health care plan. In the Clinton health care plan, as explained \nin hearings before the Congress by Mrs. Clinton, the growth of Medicare \nspending was to be slowed. Mrs. Clinton made the very specific point, \nand some of us have seen that on videotape as it has been replayed, \nthat we are not cutting Medicare, she said, we are simply slowing its \ngrowth so that we can pay for all the things we need to do in health \ncare.\n  The bill that is before us slows the growth of Medicare less than the \namount proposed by Mrs. Clinton in the bill that she proposed, and \nwhich the Senator from West Virginia cosponsored.\n  I do not consider that it was slashing and burning Medicare when Mrs. \nClinton proposed it, and I do not think it is slashing and burning \nMedicare now. I hope we will stay with the numbers as they really are. \nWe are proposing increasing spending on Medicare, and the Republicans \nare proposing increasing spending on Medicare at a higher rate than \nMrs. Clinton proposed, and that was in the bill that the Senator from \nWest Virginia cosponsored.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has talked about the \nrepeated actions of the Finance Committee in dealing with short-term \nsolvency problems. An analogy sprang to my mind. We have watched the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia give us repeated short-term \nsolutions to their short-term solvency problems, and the long-term \nsolvency problem has gotten continually worse until finally the \nDistrict of Columbia is facing the crisis that it is.\n  I am not proud--I did not participate, so I was not involved--but I \nam not proud of the actions of the Finance Committee over the years in \nthe way they have solved the short-term solvency problem. I am not \nproud of administrations that I would call my administration--that is \nthe Bush administration--in the way it has addressed the short-term \nsolvency problem, because all they have done repeatedly is postpone the \nday of reckoning, and to say, ``Well, we've been able to do it on a \nbipartisan basis.''\n  All right, shame on both parties. But what happens again and again \nwhen you are faced with the short-term solvency problem in Medicare is, \nsay we are going to reduce the amount we will reimburse to the doctors \nand we will make those greedy doctors and hospitals pay by putting a \nlid on the amount they can charge. There is another word for that, Mr. \nPresident. It is called wage and price controls. We have been trying to \nsolve our inflation problems in this country with wage and price \ncontrols perhaps from the beginning of time. They have never worked in \nany other arena, and they have not worked in Medicare. Every time the \nFinance Committee or the administration puts wage and price controls on \nMedicare payments, the people who are faced with those wage and price \ncontrols find ways around them. Then the costs start going up again, so \nwe have to have another short-term fix with wage and price controls.\n  The only solution is to forget the pattern of the past and make \nsystemic changes in Medicare, and my party has had the courage to \nattempt that. The party of the Senator from West Virginia has said, \n``No, we will not attempt systemic changes in Medicare. Let's have a \ncommission.''\n  I would be happy to serve on such a commission and endorse such a \ncommission if the charge of that commission was to say that we are not \ngoing to do what we have historically done because it is what we have \nhistorically done that has brought us to the point we are today. We \nhave to face the fact that Medicare is a wonderful 1960's program \nfrozen in time by virtue of its having been made a Government monopoly. \nWe have to break the monopoly, open this thing up to free market \nforces, recognize that wage and price controls do not work, and start \nwith a clean sheet of paper. If we had that kind of circumstance, I \nwould be happy to do whatever is necessary to cooperate with the \nSenator from West Virginia in a bipartisan fashion. But more of the \nsame, a repeat of what we have done in the years that have gotten us to \nthis, is not the kind of call we need to deal with Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that I have opened a can of worms or a \nhornet's nest here, and I should return to the chair, but if the \nPresident will grant me the indulgence, I recognize that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is now on his feet and wants to defend himself, and \nI congratulate him for that. If I may be allowed to stay here and \ndefend myself and we have this debate, I think it will be a worthwhile \ncircumstance.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, in anticipation of \nhearing a rebuttal from my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. General reminders, perhaps, would be more \nappropriate in terms of the phrasing. I certainly listened to what my \ndistinguished friend said, and respect him. In fact, in all that he \nsays, because he has a particularly articulate, modified way of saying \nthings which I have long respected, which the Senator knows from our \nprevious conversations.\n\n  The Senator has brought up a number of points, such as wage and price \ncontrols, and this is something which is not necessarily totally \naccurate, but which I ask the Senator to contemplate. He talked about \nthe evils of wage and price controls. Let us leave wages out for the \nmoment--no, let us not leave wages out for the moment.\n  I submit to the Senator what we are now seeing increasingly in \nprivate sector managed care--you made reference to the Clinton health \ncare program which is long gone. It seems to me like the debate on \nhealth care reform was 10 years ago. Since it failed, there was this \nconvulsion in the marketplace, an extraordinary explosion of activity, \nand managed care took off. We have health maintenance organizations, \nHMO's, which are wonderful in their concept of paying a doctor so much \nto keep a patient healthy. Therefore, the incentive was to keep the \npatient healthy, and the incentive was always on the relationship \nbetween the doctor and the patient. Then we see the introduction of \nfor-profit HMO's, which are now sweeping the Nation. That introduces \nquite another concept, and that is the interest of the shareholder of \nthe company as opposed to, perhaps, in contrast to, in contradiction \nwith, perhaps, the relationship between the doctor and the patient.\n  I just wonder out loud if what we have seen, therefore, and the \nresulting kind of caps and limits, and ``this will be allowed and that \nwill not be allowed,'' is, in fact, a form of wage and price controls, \nbut under the guise of the private sector, therefore, we do not think \nof calling it as such. I just raise that as something for the Senator \nto think about.\n  Second, on the short-term basis aspect, the Senator expressed great \nconcern about having to do this all the time. I am in total agreement. \nI am in total agreement, and I think the reason that we have had all of \nthese short-\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nterm fixes is because we have not had to consider Medicare in a longer \nterm context.\n  The Senator made some correct observations. But that is why I think \nthat a commission, never before entered into, on Medicare, which has \ngrown enormously because Congress has added enormous new burdens on it, \nservices to be paid for, as well as the cost of health care and \neverything else, that it is, in fact, a long-term commission approach \nwhich is the answer to solidifying patterns, making adjustments, and \nbiting the bullet on some very difficult issues.\n  I think that the deal, so to speak, would be that the commission \nwould be so well balanced as to who was on it--experts, seniors, \nconsumers, et cetera, it would be fairly done and expertly done--that \nit would be voted through by the House, voted through by the Senate and \nsigned by the President almost without debate, like the Social Security \nCommission's recommendations were. It was an enormously controversial \nproblem. Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan were on that commission.\n  With respect to when the Senator talked about the old bromide, or \nwhatever it was, of Democrats talking about tax cuts for the rich, I \nhave to go by what people in the majority say, because we in the \nminority have to respond to that.\n  The Senate budget resolution would, and I quote, ``accommodate \nfurther tax reform or tax reductions, to be offset by the extension of \nexpired tax provisions or corporate and business tax reforms. Such tax \nreductions could include proposals such as economic growth, a capital \ngains tax reduction package, State tax reform, economic growth, fuel \nexcise taxes * * *.''\n  And on to the end of the quote.\n  So I have to believe that tax cuts for the wealthy are still very \nmuch in the mind of the Republicans. I cannot prove it, but I can point \nto the Republican budget resolution before us.\n  What am I to think as I see this?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do not have the figures in front of me, but I would be \nhappy to supply them to the Senator. If you take the total amount set \naside for tax cuts, you would find that the vast bulk, I think in the \nneighborhood of something like 80 percent of the value of the tax cut, \ngoes for the $500 tax credit for children. The taxes that the Senator \nis pointing out, in terms of the total impact, are relatively small and \ncan honestly be described as minor in their financial impact.\n  By far, the greatest bulk of the tax money is going for the $500 \nrebate for children. That is the expensive item in the tax cut bill. I \nam sure the Budget Committee would be happy to give the Senator those \ndetails.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We will see on all of this, because there is a very \nstrong predilection on the part of the majority party to make--when you \nare talking about inheritance taxes, you know, that is pretty heavy \nstuff. That would raise questions. The Senator who is speaking knows \nsomething about that.\n  The other thing I guess I want to say, if the Senator would further \nyield----\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This amendment is about restoring $50 billion that \nwas cut by the Republicans from Medicare. That is what my amendment is \nabout. That is kind of what I would like our discussion to be about.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his reasoned \nresponse. I remain unconvinced by it, but I appreciate the manner and \nthe tenor in which it is offered. May I make several comments, and then \nI will return to the chair, and perhaps this will pass on for those who \nwant to read about it in the Record.\n  The reference to wage and price controls and HMO's. Wage and price \ncontrols, by definition, are imposed by Government. Market conditions \nmay set prices elsewhere. One of the main things wrong with our whole \nhealth care system--and the Senator and I can have this discussion at \nlength at some other time--is the very fact that market forces do not \noperate here and cannot because of the Government's attempt to enforce \nwage and price controls.\n  We have a circumstance, I say to the Senator, where the user of the \nservice is not the purchaser of the service, and market conditions \ntherefore cannot operate.\n  If I, for example, am enrolled in an HMO I do not like, there is \nnothing I can do about it because the person who chooses that HMO is my \nemployer. It is the employer who purchases the service, pays for it and \nmakes the deal. It is I, the employee, who uses the service.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will yield in a moment.\n  I have been the chief executive officer of a company and, therefore, \nin a position to choose what kind of health care the employees will \nget. It will come as no surprise to say that I chose a program that I \nliked.\n  During the debate over the Clinton health care plan, people would say \nto me, ``Why don't you give us as good a health care plan as you have \nas a Member of Congress?'' My response was, ``I wish I had as good a \nhealth care plan as I had before I came to Congress,'' because the only \nhealth care plan I have now, as a Member of Congress, is that which the \nGovernment has decided to make available to Government employees. If \nyou want the same kind of health care plan I have, go get yourself a \nGovernment job. But if you want a different kind of health care plan, \ngo petition your employer.\n  That does not make sense. In any other circumstance, you make the \nchoices if you buy the service. But we have created a circumstance here \nin our country--frankly, we can debate the historical roots of it--\nwhere the employer makes the decision but the employee receives the \nservice. So whom does the HMO have to please? It has to please the \nhealth and human resources person at the employer's desk. If the \nemployee does not get what he wants, too bad. The employer has made the \nchoice.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator--and I apologize to my colleagues \nbecause we are no longer debating this amendment, which is about \nrestoring $50 billion in Republican cuts to Medicare. That is what will \nbe, hopefully, voted up later.\n  But when the Senator said, ``I ran a company, and I decided what my \nemployees were going to get. I made the decision''----\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is a very powerful statement. What that \nbasically says is that the employees were denied any choice as to \nwhether or not, for example, their doctor happened to be included in \nthat program or not.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Whether certain services were offered in that \nprogram or not.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct. The Senator is exactly right. He is \ndescribing the way health care works in this country.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I might then just go back for a moment to the \nthoroughly savaged Clinton health care plan on the floor this evening, \nwhich, as I indicated is now a part of history. One of the things that \nthe Senator is now able to do, if he in fact takes the trouble to do \nthis, under the so-called Government health insurance program, which I \nwould submit is hardly Government, because, for example, I have a Blue \nCross-Blue Shield card, and the last I heard Blue Cross-Blue Shield was \na private insurance company----\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator, the Government----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I could continue my point, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. By all means.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That the Senator and this Senator and all those who \nwork for the Federal Government have, in fact, between 25 and 29 \ndifferent plans that they can choose from every single year. I have \nwatched my daughter go through this process of spreading out the \ndifferent programs, sitting on the floor cross-legged, and just looking \nat all of these 29 different programs spread out before her, 29 \ndifferent options of health care which she gets to choose from. With \nBlue Cross-Blue Shield, through that arrangement, she pays them, she \ncan pick her doctor, she can pick her service. She can reject one thing \nfrom one year to another. But the choice is hers.\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n  The point I would like to loudly insert in this debate is that the \nSenator in mandating for his employees what they will have. And, \nindeed, it occurs to me that that is a mandate. That is an entirely \ndifferent situation from Federal employees, or those in the alliances \nthat were contemplated in the Clinton health care plan. Through their \njoint purchasing power, they could have in fact a great variety of \nprograms that would be spread before them. In fact, the Federal \nintervention that came in was from something called a Federal Quality \nBoard which was made up of medical experts who would certify that any \nhealth plans that were being offered to the public through alliances or \notherwise would have to be certified as being qualified and of high \nquality.\n\n  One of the great complaints one hears across the land today in \nAmerica from physicians, hospitals and persons conversant in health \ncare public policy is that the word ``quality'' is rapidly disappearing \nfrom the discussion, if not the practice of medicine.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we perhaps should end this. I hope it is \ninstructive. I am sure the Senator from West Virginia and I will \ncontinue this at another venue.\n  We clearly are not communicating here. He has outlined what I \nconsider to be a prime example of what I was talking about. The \nGovernment has decided that his daughter's choices will be limited to \nBlue Cross-Blue Shield. The Government has decided that the plan I was \nunder before coming to the Senate will not be available to me now that \nI am in the Senate. The Government has picked, yes, 29 different plans, \nand that is a lot, but that is not all that is available. I cannot take \nmy money that is being spent for health care, deducted from my pay, go \nout in the open market and buy something else with it. I can only use \nit within the framework that this commission that he has described has \nmade available to me.\n  Now, I will concede to him, absolutely, the commission he described \ndid a good job and most employees will find that in the choices the \nGovernment offers they will find something that covers their needs. The \npoint is that 29 choices is not the universe. If I want to make choice \nnumber 30, my employer--in this case the Government--has decreed that I \ncannot make choice number 30 with the money they are spending on my \nbehalf for health care.\n  That is another debate for another time. We can have it. But I wanted \nto introduce it into this circumstance because I think it addresses the \nbasic issue and goes back to the amendment that the Senator has \noffered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for a closing thought?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There were many more insurance plans than Blue \nCross-Blue Shield involved at that time.\n  I just ask the Senator to contemplate the difference between the 25 \nto 29--and yes, there might be 30 on the one hand--as compared to the \none that the Senator as president and chairman of the corporation which \nhe ran picked out on behalf of his employees.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This is not the place to get into these details. I say \nthe plan I chose had a number of choices within it so that the \nemployees could make, frankly, almost as many choices as Government \nemployees could make. Ultimately I had to make the decision as to what \nthe framework would be for our employees. I made a decision to a plan \nthat, in my opinion, was better than the one that is currently \navailable to me.\n  My employees, I think, were better served with that decision that I \nwas making than the Government employers and the decision you are \ntalking about. Those are not appropriate questions here. We can have \nthis discussion elsewhere. I think they go to the core of what has to \nbe addressed when we talk about fixing the health care system in this \ncountry.\n  To summarize, and then I will return to my duties in the chair, I \nhave always congratulated President Clinton on his leadership in \naddressing America's health care problems. I am one Republican who has \nbeen critical of my party's inability to exercise the proper leadership \nhere. President Clinton did a courageous thing in taking this issue on. \nI had congratulated him at the time. I congratulated him all the way \nthrough, even while disagreeing with him on the details of his plan. I \nhave congratulated him for his courage in being willing to face the \nfact that our health care system in this country is broken and badly \nneeds fixing. I just do not think his solution fixed it. In my opinion, \nhis solution made it worse.\n  I feel the same way about Medicare, that my party has had the courage \nto recognize that Medicare, to be handled as business as usual, is \nheaded for disaster, and it is headed for disaster quickly. We have \ntaken the political heat. We have taken the political rhetoric. We have \nbeen accused of slashing and burning. However, we have stood up to \nfacing the problem.\n  As the Washington Post has said in its editorials, the Republicans \ndeserve credit for telling the truth about Medicare and the Democrats \nhave slipped into the posture of ``Mediscare.'' That, in fact, does not \nadd and contribute to the debate.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia for the opportunity to have this \nexchange. I thank the Senator from Michigan for allowing me to escape \nthe enforced silence of the chair long enough to vent my feelings on \nthis issue, which I am sure will continue to provide opportunity for \nlots of dialog for lots of months and perhaps years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Rockefeller amendment on Medicare. The amendment restores $50 \nbillion to the Medicare Program. It keeps Medicare solvent. It honors \nour national commitment to seniors.\n  Haven't we been this way before? It's the same old story--big cuts in \nMedicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Yes, we must balance the \nbudget and keep Medicare solvent. But we can do that with the \nPresident's budget.\n  I will fight to protect health care for all seniors. Medicare pays \nfor medical care for almost 38 million seniors. Over 500,000 of these \nseniors live in my State of Maryland. In my travels to senior centers \nthroughout the State, I hear the same thing over and over. Seniors tell \nme they're afraid of losing their Medicare coverage. They fear they \nwon't be able to keep their own doctors. They are worried they will be \nforced into managed care plans.\n  Our seniors count on Medicare for their health care. I want to keep \nthe CARE in Medicare. This amendment will do that. It protects seniors \nfrom excessive premium increases and out-of-pocket costs. It lets \nseniors keep their own doctors. It attacks fraud and abuse. Doctors and \nhospitals won't be able to charge patients above the cost of Medicare. \nAnd seniors will have access to care because it prevents the closing of \nrural and urban hospitals.\n  There has been a lot in the news lately about Medicare going \nbankrupt. I am concerned about the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. \nWe owe it to what I like to call the GI Joe generation and future \ngenerations to keep Medicare solvent. The GI Joe generation is the \ngeneration that fought for freedom and democracy for the world during \nWorld War II. They didn't hesitate to serve. When the war was over, \nthey came home, raised their families, and contributed to the greatest \nprosperity this Nation has ever known. We would not be a nation much \nless a world power today if it weren't for the GI Joe generation. They \nhave worked hard all their lives and played by the rules. Now they need \nMedicare to be there for them. Promises made must be promises kept.\n  We can balance the budget with far fewer Medicare cuts. At the same \ntime, we can keep Medicare solvent and protect seniors from new costs. \nThe President's budget accomplishes these goals. Under his plan, the \nsolvency of the trust fund is extended for 10 years.\n  Medicare is one of the best health care systems in the world. Before \nMedicare was enacted 30 years ago, less than 50 percent of seniors had \nhealth insurance. Now 99 percent do. Let's not dismantle this \nsuccessful program.\n  I oppose increasing seniors' out-of-pocket costs. That's why I oppose \nbalance billing. This lets doctors and hospitals charge patients above \nthe cost of Medicare. It increases seniors out-of-pocket costs. Ninety-\nseven percent of Medicare funds are spent on recipients with incomes \nless than $50,000. Seniors\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\nalready spend 21 percent of their income on health care. They can't \nafford to spend more. Let's not hurt middle-income Americans. We need \nto renew our commitment to help those who help themselves.\n  The budget cuts Medicare part A by $98 billion. This part pays for \nhospitals and providers. We can't overlook the effect these drastic \ncuts will have on hospitals. What will happen to institutions like \nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Medical \nSchool under these cuts? Cuts this large will put some hospitals out of \nbusiness. It will cut down on the training of new doctors. And in the \nend, our seniors will be the ones hurt the most.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, do the right thing today. Don't balance \nthe budget on the backs of our seniors. Preserve the Medicare Program. \nLet's keep our commitment to senior citizens.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nRockefeller's amendment to reduce the size of the Medicare cuts to the \nlevel of the President's budget and to preserve the basic health care \nprotections this nation now provides for senior citizens.\n  Without Medicare, many and perhaps most of the 38 million Americans \nwho are Medicare beneficiaries would have inadequate health care and \ntreatment--or no treatment at all. This year's Republican budget would \ncut Medicare by $167 billion over 6 years, $50 billion more than the \nPresident's budget. This cut would reduce Medicare spending growth far \nbelow projected private sector growth rates, resulting in reduced \nquality and access to health care for millions of Americans.\n  This year's Republican Medicare cuts are all too similar to last \nyear's Medicare cuts. In their fiscal year 1996 budget, the Republicans \nwould have cut Medicare by $270 billion over a 7 year period to finance \na $245 billion tax cut primarily for America's wealthiest people. These \ncuts would have resulted in a $9.5 billion loss to Massachusetts alone \nover the next 7 years. These cuts, if allocated evenly among all \nbeneficiaries, would have cost each of the 900,000 seniors and disabled \npeople who depend on Medicare an additional $1,240 a year.\n  But this year's Republican cuts in Medicare are still too large and \nwill risk turning Medicare into a second-class system for seniors who \ncannot afford to opt out of the traditional Medicare Program through \nMedical Savings accounts. It is also amazing that Republicans still \nhave not disavowed their intention to increase premiums to pay for a \ntax cut. Our Nation's senior citizens, with an average annual income of \n$17,000, spend more than 20 percent of their incomes on health care. \nAdditional health care expenses would put an even greater burden on \nthis population.\n  I believe that Medicare can be reformed without totally dismantling \nthe fundamental security that the system provides. The President's \nbudget shows that premium increases, deep cuts, and damaging structural \nchanges are not necessary to balance the budget and guarantee the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund. By failing to identify and \neliminate corporate subsidies, and adamantly insisting on tax cuts for \nthe rich, the Republicans are forced to cut programs for middle-class \nAmericans far deeper than the President's plan, and the Medicare \nProgram is bearing the brunt of this attack.\n  Medicare is a part of Social Security, a contract between the \nGovernment and the people. People pay into the trust fund during their \nworking years and then receive good health care in their retirement \nyears. The Republicans would break this fundamental contract with the \nAmerican people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Senator \nRockefeller which I am proud to cosponsor. We must stop the Republicans \nfrom using the Medicare trust fund as a slush fund to pay for tax cuts. \nWe must carefully and responsibly reform Medicare for the sake of \npreserving and strengthening Medicare and those who depend on it. The \nRepublican budget really fails this test once again. In colloquial \nterms, Mr. President, ``They just don't get it.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, might I ask a question of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan? If this amendment which is about \ntrying to restore $50 billion to Medicare, is it the intention of the \nmajority that we will discuss but not vote or that we will vote \ntonight?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding, I say to Senator from West \nVirginia, we at least will not vote on anything before 8 o'clock. There \nis an agreement to not have any votes prior to that. At whatever point \ndebate on the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia ends, if \nthere is no further debate, I plan to speak briefly about it.\n  I am prepared to offer another amendment which, I think, would be in \norder, which will address Medicare and probably open up further \ndiscussion about the topic we have been discussing for the last half \nhour or so. Whatever point we decide there is no further debate on \nthis, I am prepared to bring another amendment for discussion. I do not \nbelieve there is an agreement on specifically when we would vote. My \nunderstanding is we would not vote on anything prior to 8 o'clock.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to my friend that is approximately 22 minutes \nfrom now. Medicare is a pretty important subject. There may be people \nwho want to speak. On the other hand, part of the deal around here is \nthat if you want to say something you have to be here.\n  Can I assume that maybe by 8:30 or 9 o'clock we could vote?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I say to the Senator, I do not know of any other people \nright now on our side who are prepared to speak. I have been told \nseveral Members were coming to the floor earlier, but I have not seen \nthem. I am not certain we will not have speakers. I have a few brief \ncomments to make on the amendment before us, and I am prepared to bring \nup another amendment discussing the topic of Medicare that I presume we \nwill debate for some period of time. I have received no further word \nfrom anyone on our side with an interest in speaking. I do not know \nwhether on your side there are others who plan to come down.\n  It is my understanding there are approximately 30 minutes left on \neach side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. And I can offer my amendment when we either exhaust the \ntime or it has been yielded back.\n  Mr. President, I will speak to the amendment for such time as I may \nneed at this point. I want to make a couple of points, following up on \nmy earlier statement. As you know, Mr. President, I expressed the \nconcern that we have on our side over the way the President has \nattempted to address the Medicare issue. Specifically, the provisions \nin his budgets which would transfer the home health care expenditures \nfrom the part A to the part B fund.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has indicated that the rationale from \na policy standpoint for doing this is the fact that some 16 years ago, \nor just prior to the year 1980, there was a limit on the duration of \npart A's coverage for home health care and a prerequisite of a previous \nhospitalization was necessary to trigger that part A coverage.\n  I only say this. If we are going to use as a standard for changes in \nMedicare the fact that at one time we did it differently, there would \ncertainly be plenty of other Medicare-related issues then that would \nfall under that policy justification. For example, last year, there was \na pretty significant debate here before the Senate over the question of \nthe percentage of part B premium that would be paid by the recipients, \nby the people in the Medicare Program, a debate on whether or not the \npercentage would be dropped from 31 to 25 percent. It was argued at \nthat time that we should not maintain a 31 percent, we should reduce \nit. That is a debate that has passed, but the fact is, there was a time \nin the program where the percentage of co-pay of the part B recipients \nwas much higher than 31 percent.\n  So I do not think it is at least a reasonable justification to say \nthat, because 17 years ago, the Medicare Program was structured a \ncertain way, that that alone, or in any sense, is a justification to \nreturn to that approach. The same, presumably, is true for a variety of \nother ratios, formulas, reimbursements, and so on, whether it is for \ndirect medical, education, or \n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nother components. Clearly, they have changed over the years. It just \nseems to me that to say we can move home health care out of part A \nbecause at one time it was structured differently does not reach the \nmost important element here, which is, by doing this, we are changing \ndramatically the expectations of part A Medicare recipients.\n  Those people believe that home health care is, in fact, part of that \ntrust program. It is, in fact, not subject to the availability of funds \nor the need to either increase taxes or find other spending cuts to \njustify payments for it. And that is why we feel the President's budget \ndoes not really meet the challenge for us.\n\n  I would like to say a couple of other things with respect to the \nspecifics of the amendment before us. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the President's Medicare proposal would not maintain \nsolvency of the part A Medicare trust fund for the full 10 years that \nwe want. In fact, the projection is that it would be insolvent by the \nyear 2005. Now, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate \nthe fact that, in the President's budget, the reductions in the \ngrowth--I will give the President the benefit of the doubt and not call \nit a cut. By reducing the growth by $116 billion, the President's \nbudget maintains solvency not for 10 years but for 9 years. If, in \nfact, the $50 billion that is proposed in this amendment were used to \nincrease the rate of growth of the Medicare Program, as proposed in our \nbudget, then the actual total net change under our budget would only be \n$108 billion over the period of time our budget covers, through 2002. \nIn other words, it would be less savings than in the President's \nbudget. So, in other words, if this amendment were to pass, Mr. \nPresident, then we would be, in fact, not ensuring the solvency of part \nA of the trust fund as long as the President even does, and we believe \non this side that the President's proposal to maintain solvency through \n2005 is not adequate.\n  So I think it is important for our colleagues to understand that, in \nsupporting this, they are in fact supporting an amendment that would \nbring about the insolvency even earlier than that which would be the \ncase under the President's budget, and certainly which would be the \ncase under our budget.\n  I also wanted to clear up one other point, Mr. President. In the tax \ncut provisions in the budget we are offering, the total amount of $122 \nbillion, I believe, is targeted--it does not, in fact, even cover fully \nthe $500-per-child tax credit. So there, in fact, would not be enough \nmoney to fund the other tax cuts beyond the $500 tax credit in the \nbudget which we have.\n  To summarize, we have several facts that I think need to be \nrevisited. First, the Medicare trust fund is going broke. At the \ncurrent rate of growth in spending, at the current rate of projection \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office, it will go broke in 2001. We \ncannot let that happen, Mr. President.\n  Second, I think we want to make sure that its solvency is not \nmaintained for a short duration of time--3, 4, 5, 6 years--but we want \nit to be solvent for 10 years. The President's budget would not \naccomplish that. If this amendment passes, our budget would not \naccomplish that either.\n  Finally, we on the majority side do not want to eliminate the home \nhealth care protections under the part A trust fund. The President's \nbudget would do that and, obviously, there is a sharp difference there.\n  So, in short, Mr. President, we are prepared and desire to fix and \nrepair the trust fund and maintain solvency for a decade. We think that \nis the least we can do to address this problem at this time. In our \njudgment, at least, anything short of that does not meet the mark, does \nnot provide our seniors with the protections they need, does not \nprovide the trust fund with the protection it needs.\n  We want to give families a chance to keep more of what they earn. \nThat is why we have the money in this budget for a tax cut. But it is \nnot connected to the Medicare issue at all. Once again, to portray it \nthat way is simply inaccurate. We have the Medicare part A trust fund \nheaded toward bankruptcy. For the first time, in 1995, it was actually \nspending more than it was taking in. The time has come to repair it for \na sufficient period of time, and to allow us to focus on a broader and \neven longer term fix, which is clearly needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON.

I thank my friend from Nebraska. I join my colleagues in \nbeing both shocked and deeply saddened by the sudden death of Adm. Mike \nBoorda, Chief of Naval Operations. Admiral Boorda had a truly \nremarkable career in the Navy. Many people do not recognize it and do \nnot realize it, but Mike Boorda rose from the lowest enlisted rank to \nbecome the most senior officer in the Navy. He never forgot where he \ncame from. The welfare of the men and women of the Navy were always \nforemost in his thoughts and in his actions. He never let us forget \nthat when he testified before the committee. The men and women of the \nNavy were first for him. He was always looking for additional ways to \nhelp the Navy families and, particularly, the people who served in the \nNavy and those who are directly affected by that service.\n\n  Admiral Boorda was well-known to Members of the Senate, and to the \nArmed Services Committee, for his devotion to the Navy and the ideals \nof military service. He was always available and helpful. Never have I \nasked a single question when he was not responsive immediately, if the \ninformation were available. I had the opportunity to work closely with \nMike Boorda over the years on a wide variety of projects and programs, \nparticularly during his service as Chief of Naval Personnel, as \ncommander of Joint Task Force Provide Promise, which was responsible \nfor the mission throughout the Balkans, and as Chief of Naval \nOperations. Many of us have been briefed by Admiral Boorda when he was \nhead of that task force in a very tough period during the Balkans \nproblems. I visited him overseas when he was planning the Bosnia \noperations, and I relied on his wise counsel many times.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about Mike Boorda. I will \nsummarize it by saying that he was a superb military commander and a \ntrue friend. Admiral Boorda was an inspiring leader and a man of \nvision. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Bettie, to his \nchildren, David, Edward, Anna and Robert, and to his many friends and \nadmirers in the Navy and throughout this great country.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5168-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5168-S5176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have had a good debate. I believe that \nboth the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from West Virginia are \nprepared to yield back the remainder of the time, and that would allow \nus to continue to go back to the Republican side for the next \namendment. I believe that amendment will be offered by the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  As I understand it, it is on the same subject that we have discussed \nquite thoroughly. Maybe we can cut back on the use of some of this \ntime. I would simply like to emphasize that while it may generally not \nbe understood in the Senate, it is not a disgrace to not use the whole \nhour on each side on all of these amendments. It is perfectly \nacceptable and it is certainly respectable to yield back time so that \nwe can move ahead on amendments.\n  Depending on what happens, as you know, we temporarily set aside, in \nagreement with the chairman of the committee, so that we could move \nahead. We are not going to have any votes before 8 o'clock. I would \nsimply suggest that if the two managers of the\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\nmeasure before us are ready to yield back this time and set the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia up for a vote when \nagreed to by the managers of the bill, then we could move to the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan and start debating that.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that all time has been yielded, I ask \nunanimous consent to lay aside temporarily the Rockefeller amendment \nand proceed with the next amendment that I understand under the \nagreement would be the one to be offered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer an \namendment for myself and Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Abraham), for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 3980.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the Appropriate Place in the Bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING CHANGES IN THE \n                   MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, in achieving the \n     spending levels specified in this resolution--\n       (1) the public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form'';\n       (2) the President has said his goal is to keep the medicare \n     hospital insurance trust fund solvent for more than a decade, \n     but his budget transfers $55 billion of home health spending \n     from medicare part A to medicare part B;\n       (3) the transfer of home health spending threatens the \n     delivery of home health services to 3.5 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries;\n       (4) such a transfer increases the burden on general \n     revenues, including income taxes paid by working Americans, \n     by $55 billion;\n       (5) such a transfer artificially inflates the solvency of \n     the medicare hospital insurance trust fund, misleading the \n     Congress, medicare beneficiaries, and working taxpayers;\n       (6) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \n     certified that, without such a transfer, the President's \n     budget extends the solvency of the hospital insurance trust \n     fund for only one additional year; and\n       (7) without misleading transfers, the President's budget \n     therefore fails to achieve his own stated goal for the \n     medicare hospital insurance trust fund.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that, in achieving the spending levels specified in this \n     resolution, the Congress assumes that the Congress would--\n       (1) keep the medicare hospital insurance trust fund solvent \n     for more than a decade, as recommended by the President; and\n       (2) accept the President's proposed level of medicare part \n     B savings of $44.1 billion over the period 1997 through 2002; \n     but would\n       (3) reject the President's proposal to transfer home health \n     spending from one part of medicare to another, which \n     threatens the delivery of home health care services to 3.5 \n     million Medicare beneficiaries, artificially inflates the \n     solvency of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund, and \n     increases the burden on general revenues, including income \n     taxes paid by working Americans, by $55 billion.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment that I have sent to the \ndesk is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding changes in the \nMedicare Program. It is certainly in keeping with the sentiments which \nhave been expressed by both the Senator from Michigan as well as the \ncurrent Presiding Officer when he was here on the floor a few minutes \nago.\n  Just to go through the salient points of the amendment, the \namendment, in achieving the spending levels specified in this \nresolution, says that the public trustees of Medicare have concluded \nthat the Medicare Program is currently unsustainable in its present \nform;\n  Two, the President said that it is his goal to keep the Medicare \nhospital trust fund solvent for more than a decade, but his budget \ntransfers $55 billion of home health care spending from part A to part \nB Medicare;\n  Three, that the transfer of home health spending threatens the \ndelivery of home health care services to some 3.5 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries;\n  Four, that such a transfer increases the burden on general revenues \nand income taxes paid by working Americans by $55 billion;\n  Five, that such a transfer artificially inflates the solvency of the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund, misleading the Congress, \nMedicare beneficiaries, and working taxpayers;\n  Six, that the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \ncertified that without such a transfer, the President's budget extends \nthe solvency of the hospital insurance trust fund for only 1 additional \nyear;\n  And, seven, that without transfers, the President's budget, \ntherefore, fails to achieve his own stated goal for the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund.\n  Therefore, it is our amendment's sense of the Congress that in \nachieving the spending levels specified in this resolution, the \nCongress assumes that the Congress would keep the Medicare hospital \ntrust fund solvent for more than a decade as recommended by the \nPresident and accept the President's proposed level of Medicare part B \nsavings of $44.1 billion over the period 1997 through 2002 but would \nreject the President's proposal to transfer home health spending from \none part of Medicare to the another, a transfer which would threaten \nthe delivery of home health care services to 3.5 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment incorporates much \nof what I have been talking about here tonight and much of what we \ndiscussed during our deliberations in the Budget Committee. It is our \ngoal on the majority side to try to achieve the two objectives that \nhave been set forth by the President, at least his stated objectives: \nOne, to make sure with the part A transfer of funds that Medicare \nremains solvent for a decade; and, two, achieve savings of \napproximately $44 billion in the part B portion of Medicare.\n  We just do not think that is the way to do this or that it is an \nappropriate way to accomplish this objective by transferring vital \nservices that have been covered by the trust fund into the part B \nportion of Medicare, the area that is not covered by the trust fund. We \nbelieve it is essential that the Congress be on record clearly as \nstating that.\n  So, for those reasons, we offer this sense-of-the-Congress amendment \nhere tonight. We hope that our colleagues will support it. We feel, as \nI have been talking for the last hour, and others, the Presiding \nOfficer as well, that we are headed, with respect to the part A trust \nfund, in a direction of insolvency far sooner than anticipated, that, \nin fact, with the trust fund now operating at a deficit for the first \ntime in history, we are waiting for the new projections, but the day of \nreckoning is much closer at hand.\n  We do not think it is appropriate to stand by while the trust fund \nmoves quickly toward insolvency. We recognize the need to act now, and \nact decisively. It is not inappropriate to act decisively by \nrestraining the growth in the ways we are recommending. We are doing \nwhat is necessary to protect the fund from going bankrupt and making \nsure that protection extends for a decade.\n\n  Similarly, we accept the President's proposal to try to reduce the \npart B expenses in the growth of Medicare by $44 billion under this \nbudget. We think that is the most appropriate way to address the \nMedicare problems at this time. We would strongly urge our colleagues \nto reject the previous amendment at the proper time, when we come to \nvote, and to instead support our sense-of-the-Congress resolution which \nembodies much of what is in our budget as presented to the Senate here \nthis evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in responding, first of all, I say to \nmy friend from Michigan, this is a resolution of the Congress as \nopposed to hard law. This is, I think, something by which the Senator \nis trying to express his views.\n  Just a few moments ago I went through the policy aspects of why this \nhad all happened. As the Senator from Michigan indicated, before 1980 \nit was divided between part A and part B, and then I described the \nconditions at that time. I described what the Congress did after that \nto improve Medicare's home health care benefit--remove the 100-day \nlimit and the 3-day hospitalization requirement, and, as a result, \nfinancing of all home health care services were shipped into part A. \nThen I said, even though part A was never intended to pay for long-term \nhome health care benefits, and then I went on to say that the \nPresident's proposal restores the financing of the home health care \nbenefit back to the Congress' original intent.\n  So much for the policy. I think, frankly, that it is all right to \ntalk about the politics of this issue.\n  Mr. President, we did not hear anything about this issue last year. I \nguess that is because back then the Republicans were proposing it. In \nfact, every single House Republican who voted for last year's \nRepublican budget voted in favor of a very similar transfer of funding \nfor home health care. I am talking about the politics because I am \ntrying to question the underlying meaning of this resolution.\n  So the Republicans now say that the home health care financing shift \nis a shell game. But they have played the game themselves. I have been \ntalking about the House. The Senate Republicans also voted in favor of \nshifting money between part B and part A to improve the solvency of the \nhospital trust fund.\n  In fact, during markup in the Finance Committee, Senator Nickles \noffered an amendment which the Republicans adopted that deposited part \nB money into part A trust funds to improve the solvency of the part A \ntrust fund. The only policy behind Senator Nickles' proposal was to \nprovide political cover, if I may say so, in that they were trying to \nhide that they were using Medicare money to pay for tax cuts for the \nwealthy, but the public, as I indicated, saw through that aspect of it.\n  Mr. President, last year, the Republicans said that they wanted the \nPresident to submit a budget that was certified by the CBO as being in \nbalance after 7 years. The President has done that. In addition, Dr. \nJune O'Neill, as I said a moment ago, has certified that the \nPresident's plan extends solvency of the trust fund to the year 2005. \nSo there is no difference. It achieves the same level of solvency but \nwithout the drastic hospital cuts that the Republicans are proposing.\n  I believe the President's policy has merit. So did the Republicans \nlast year. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nnecessary. I wish to make a few comments about the situation here at \nhand.\n  I want to take people to Nebraska, which is a very typical State in \nthe Midwest part of our great country. It is very typical from the \nstandpoint of being a substantial rural State with lots of rural, small \ncommunities and is also typical of the Great Plains States and some of \nthe other States of the Union.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my colleague \nfrom West Virginia. I am a cosponsor of that amendment. The Medicare \nreductions in this budget are too large and are not required to balance \nthe budget and extend the life of the Medicare hospital insurance trust \nfund through at least the year 2005. I am particularly concerned about \nthe deep and disproportionate cuts that will be borne by hospitals, \nparticularly rural hospitals. The Senate Budget Committee said its $170 \nbillion in reductions and spending growth would include a $123 billion \nreduction in Medicare part A. This will threaten the quality and the \nfinancial viability of hospitals, particularly the rural and inner-city \nhospitals. Previous Republican budgets slowed the rate of growth in \nhospital payments, but under this year's plan the Congress may need to \nadopt policies that would actually reduce payments, not simply reduce \nthe rate of increase in these payments. Under any definition, that \nrepresents a true cut in spending. So we will not have to get into all \nthat argument that we continually get into about what is a cut.\n  What I am talking about is it appears to me from some of the other \ninformation that I will furnish the Senate during these remarks that \nwhat we are threatened with is a real cut. That means less dollars, \nless dollars and cents than last year, and by any definition that is a \ncut.\n  I recently received a letter from Harlan Heald that I will read. \nHarlan Heald is an acquaintance of many, many years way back to the \ntime when I was Governor of Nebraska, and if there is a Mr. Rural \nHospital in Nebraska, it is Mr. Heald. Mr. Heald is President of the \nNebraska Association of Hospital and Health Systems. They are not a \npolitical organization. They are an organization that devotes time, \ntalent and effort to represent the people who provide hospital services \nin rural Nebraska primarily.\n  According to Mr. Heald's analysis, a reduction of $50 billion would \nhave a devastating impact on Nebraska hospitals. Mr. Heald writes, and \nI quote:\n\n       Sixty-five rural hospitals would lose $69.1 million over 7 \n     years and 12 large rural hospitals would lose $100 million. \n     Thirty out of Nebraska's 65 small rural hospitals would lose \n     money in providing care.\n\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. \nHeald's letter be placed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, \nafter I read that letter, because there are so many interesting factual \nand true statements in it, not from a political standpoint but from \nwhat the Republican effort and the Republican bill will do to rural \nNebraska. If it is going to do something to rural Nebraska, it is going \nto do it to rural North Dakota and rural South Dakota and rural Kansas, \nand rural Oklahoma, and every rural State in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  These are the consequences of the $50 billion reduction over 7 years. \nWhat would be the impact then of a $123 billion reduction over 6 years \nthat we are now faced with? A loss of this magnitude in a State where \nMedicare patients account for 60 to 70 percent of hospital admissions \nclearly threatens the health care system on which all of us depend. \nSeveral hospitals in my State are teetering on the brink of insolvency \nwhile we are here talking about the bankruptcy of Medicare.\n  This latest Republican proposal will very likely drive them over the \nedge.\n  Mr. President, I wish to read from the letter that I have just \nreferenced. This letter is dated May 14, 1996, addressed to me.\n\n       Dear Senator Exon: I have reviewed a summary of the current \n     fiscal year 1997 House and Senate Budget Committee proposal \n     with respect to the Medicare Program. On behalf of the 94 \n     acute care hospitals in Nebraska, I wish to call your \n     attention to a very serious potential problem.\n       While it appears that the overall Medicare budget \n     reductions of $158 billion are roughly the same as those in \n     the last Republican proposal in January, the budget \n     committees have significantly altered the allocation of \n     reductions within the program, reducing part A spending by \n     $123 billion versus the $77.5 billion proposed in January.\n       We have been told on numerous occasions that the reductions \n     are not cuts--\n\n  This is not in the letter. I just want to add here, how many times \nhave we heard that here? Back to the letter.\n\n     but are reductions in the rate of spending over a 6-year \n     period. The current budget resolution includes lower budget \n     reductions in part B of Medicare, while the reductions in \n     part A have been significantly increased since the January \n     proposal. The larger Medicare Part A reductions in the \n     current proposal means hospitals will experience actual \n     reductions in payments--not merely a reduction in the rate \n     of payment increase.\n\n  We are talking about real cuts here. I am away from the letter. We \nare talking about real cuts here, when every time we talk about cuts, \npeople stand up and say, Oh, only in Washington, DC, is an increase a \ncut. I have always said we must legislate to real needs, what the costs \nare going to be.\n  Another editorial comment before I go on with reading this letter \nfrom an expert on the subject in Nebraska, and that, Mr. President, is \nsimply this: I\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nam convinced that the reductions in the amount for real needs that the \nRepublicans have been espousing are below the projected costs and rises \nin health care over the next 6 years.\n  Putting that another way, what I am saying is that the Republicans \nhave been saying, ``Oh, well, this is not a cut, this is just a slowing \ndown of the growth.'' Time and time again that has been used on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Heald brings us back to reality by saying \nwhat I indicated when I first started talking on this subject, that \nthese cuts are not simply a reduction in the growth. They are cuts, \ndollars and cents, below what hospitals have received before. Back to \nthe letter:\n\n       Although I have not received enough detail to permit me to \n     make an analysis of the impact of the proposed reduction in \n     Medicaid Part A spending, I do have information from an \n     earlier proposal last fall that looked at Part A reductions \n     of about $50 billion out of the total reductions over a \n     seven-year period. Although it is a ``crude'' approximation, \n     the impact on Nebraska hospitals looks like this:\n       Sixty-five small rural hospitals would lose an aggregate of \n     $69.1 million during the seven-year period of 1996 to 2002. \n     Twelve large rural hospitals would lose a total of $100.4 \n     million, and 11 metropolitan (Lincoln and Omaha) hospitals \n     would lose $337.4 million, during the seven-year period. \n     Note--In 1994, 30 hospitals out of Nebraska's 65 small rural \n     hospitals lost money providing care.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       In 1994, 30 hospitals out of Nebraska's 65 small rural \n     hospitals lost money providing care.\n       Again, this is based on a Part A reduction of about $50 \n     billion over a 7-year period. I hate to think what these \n     numbers might resemble under the current proposal with \n     Medicare Part A targeted for a $123 billion hit.\n       Reimbursement reductions of this magnitude in a state with \n     a disproportionate share of the elderly population, a state \n     in which Medicare patients account for 60 to 70 percent of \n     hospital admissions, clearly threatens the health care system \n     upon which all of us depend.\n       Medicare needs to be fixed. There is an opportunity for \n     Congress to change Medicare, but the change must be driven by \n     sound health care policy, not budgetary or political \n     imperatives. The proposed Medicare reductions would crush \n     Nebraska hospitals.\n       As always, Nebraska hospitals look to your leadership.\n\n  Mr. President, I also would like to read a letter from the following \ngroups: The American Association of Eye and Ear Hospitals, the American \nHospital Association, the American Osteopathic Healthcare Association, \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges, Catholic Health \nAssociation, Federation of American Health Systems, InterHealth, \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals, National Association of \nPublic Hospitals and Health Systems, and Premier. This letter is dated \nMay 10, and it is addressed by those organizations I just read, to the \nHonorable William Roth, chairman, Committee on Finance.\n\n       Dear Chairman Roth: The undersigned organizations \n     representing hospitals and health care systems have reviewed \n     the Fiscal Year 1997 House and Senate Budget Committee \n     proposal, particularly with respect to Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       While it appears that the overall Medicare budget \n     reductions of $167 billion are roughly the same as those in \n     the Republican offer in January, the Budget Committees have \n     significantly changed the allocation of reductions within the \n     program.\n\n  The letter goes on and essentially makes the same exact points made \nby the letter that I read, by Harlan Heald.\n  So the professionals know what is going on. We know what is going on \nhere. I must continue to make the point that Nebraska is not unique in \nthis. But if you have a hospital, because of the aging population in \nrural areas of America in toto, where 60 to 70 percent, and some places \nhigher, have their beds dedicated to people who are eligible and \nreceive Medicare, and for many of them that is the only health care \nsystem available to them, and you compare that with a hospital, for \nexample in Lincoln or Omaha or other more metropolitan areas that have \ntheir patients coming in only about 20 to 25 percent seniors, you \nquickly understand that what we are doing here is socking it right \nbetween the eyes of the rural hospitals in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent both of the letters I have \nreferenced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Nebraska Association of\n\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                                     May 14, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: I have reviewed a summary of the current \n     Fiscal Year 1997 (FY '97) House and Senate Budget Committee \n     proposal with respect to the Medicare program. On behalf of \n     the 94 acute care hospitals in Nebraska, I wish to call your \n     attention to a serious potential problem.\n       While it appears that the overall Medicare budget \n     reductions of $158 billion are roughly the same as those in \n     the last Republican proposal in January, the Budget \n     Committees have significantly altered the allocation of \n     reductions within the program, reducing Medicare Part A \n     spending by $123 billion vs. $77.5 billion proposed in \n     January.\n       We have been told on numerous occasions that the reductions \n     are not cuts, but are reductions in the rate of spending over \n     the six-year period. The current budget resolution includes \n     lower budget reductions in Part B of Medicare, while the \n     reductions in Part A have been significantly increased since \n     the January proposal. The larger Medicare Part A reductions \n     in the current proposal mean hospitals will experience actual \n     reductions in payments--not merely a reduction in the rate of \n     payment increase.\n       Although I have not received enough detail to permit me to \n     make an analysis of the impact of the proposed reduction in \n     Medicare Part A spending, I do have information from an \n     earlier proposal last fall that looked at Part A reductions \n     of about $50 billion out of total reductions over a seven-\n     year period.

William Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: The undersigned organizations \n     representing hospitals and health systems have reviewed the \n     Fiscal Year 1997 (FY 97) House and Senate Budget Committee \n     proposal, particularly with respect to the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs.\n       While it appears that the overall Medicare budget \n     reductions of $167 billion are roughly the same as those in \n     the last Republican offer in January, the Budget Committees \n     have significantly changed the allocation of reductions \n     within the program. While it is difficult to assess the \n     overall impact of the budget resolution in the absence of \n     greater detail, now larger Medicare Part A reductions mean \n     hospitals are likely to experience actual reductions in \n     payment rates under the committees' proposal.\n       The budget resolution now includes lower budget reductions \n     in Part B of Medicare, while the reductions in Part A have \n     increased by approximately $25 billion since the January \n     offer. While the FY 97 budget resolution offers a milder \n     overall approach to deficit reduction compared to last year's \n     resolution, its impact on hospitals appears worse. To achieve \n     reductions of this magnitude, Congress may need to adopt \n     policies resulting in payment rates per beneficiary that \n     would be frozen or actually reduced.\n        We also have serious concerns about the Budget Committees' \n     Medicaid reductions. We would like to take this opportunity \n     to reiterate our support for maintaining the entitlement \n     nature of the Medicaid program to ensure that those who have \n     coverage today will continue to have coverage tomorrow. \n     Furthermore, we support maintaining current law provider \n     assessment restrictions and Boren amendment payment \n     safeguards. While the overall reductions are somewhat lower \n     than the January offer, if combined with corresponding state \n     reductions through lower state matching requirements or new \n     provider assessments, these reductions could be quite \n     significant for providers.\n       Hospitals and health systems support the need to adopt a \n     reasonable deficit reduction package, and believe that \n     changes in Medicare are needed to keep the Part A trust fund \n     solvent. Many of us have supported various proposals that \n     achieve a balanced budget with reductions in Medicare and \n     Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n     However, we are gravely concerned about the level of \n     reductions proposed by the Budget Committees in these \n     programs.\n       We strongly urge you to reconsider both the overall level \n     of Medicare and Medicaid reductions included in the budget \n     resolution and, in your capacity as chairman of the \n     authorizing committee, adjust the allocation between Parts A \n     and B proposed by the Budget Committees.\n         American Association of Eye and Ear Hospitals, American \n           Hospital Association, American Osteopathic Healthcare \n           Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, \n           Catholic Health Association, Federation of American \n           Health Systems, InterHealth, National Association of \n           Children's Hospitals, National Association of Public \n           Hospitals and Health Systems, Premier.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non or in relation to the Rockefeller amendment, to be followed by a \nvote on or in relation to the Abraham amendment, beginning at 8:30 p.m. \nthis evening, with the first vote being the standard 15-minute vote, \nthe following vote being limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I do not want to object \nbecause the Senator knows I have been waiting for quite a while. I \nwould like to ask if we could have debate on the Boxer Medicaid \namendment immediately following the vote, so we can get that done. \nThere are Senators who wish to speak to it. I will be glad to agree to \na reasonable time agreement.\n  But it is very important to this Senator because this is the time I \ncan debate. I want to make sure I can get it done tonight.\n  Mr. EXON. Let me respond to the Senator from my perspective, and I \ncannot speak for the majority. We are now considering the Abraham \namendment. We will vote on that. If this unanimous consent request is \nagreed to--and if I agree to it, I must say--immediately following \nthat, we would be up for consideration of an amendment from the \nDemocratic side. I have indicated to my friend from California that she \nwould be first up with her amendment.\n  So I will simply say, after the vote, you would, as far as I am \nconcerned, be recognized to offer your amendment. If it is possible--\nobviously it is not between now and the scheduled vote at 8:30--I would \ncertainly recommend to Chairman Domenici that we proceed with the order \nwhich would allow you to follow the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sure that then there would be a Democratic \namendment; is that part of the agreement, immediately following the \nvote on the Abraham amendment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We have not agreed to that at this point. Let me just \nstate for the benefit of all our colleagues, it is also my \nunderstanding there is an interest on both sides to proceed at some \npoint to a vote on the President's budget tonight. I think, as I \nunderstand, the Senator from California would like to have debate on \nher amendment tonight, not necessarily a final vote tonight.\n  So I think we can work out something else: A vote on the President's \nbudget can take place in a way that would allow those Members who have \nother obligations to fulfill them this evening and still accommodate \nyour desire to have the debate, for the next amendment to be yours. But \nI do not think we have worked those two parts out. I think on your side \nthere is an interest in making both of those things happen. I guess we \njust have not proceeded to the point of having that agreement worked \nout. This is as far as we were able to, basically, negotiate.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield, I am reassured by the \nconversation of the two managers. I feel comfortable that sometime this \nevening--and I am willing to stay here as late as necessary--I will \nhave an opportunity to do that. With that verbal assurance, I withdraw \nmy objection.\n  Mr. EXON. I say to my friend from California, there has been one or \ntwo attempts previously to include what would follow in a unanimous \nconsent agreement. We have shied away from that and not made that kind \nof commitment at all. I suspect we will not be able to at this time.\n  I simply say that I think there is every likelihood that we may, if \nwe can break the logjam, get a vote on the President's budget that this \nSenator has been trying to accomplish since 11 o'clock this morning. \nThat may happen before the debate on your amendment, but I think there \nis every likelihood that you will have an opportunity to offer your \namendment and engage in a debate, whether that is at 10 o'clock or 1 \na.m. tomorrow morning, sometime in that general timeframe.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am gratefully reassured. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to get an \nindication of how much time has been used on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has used about 39\\1/\n2\\ minutes. That is how much time is remaining in the debate.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Approximately 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has used approximately 20 minutes, and the \nSenator from Michigan has used approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am wondering in light of that--we have Senator Frist \nwho has been hoping to have a chance to speak to this. There are only \nabout 5 minutes left. Can we agree to let him finish the debate to the \npoint that the vote has been agreed to? With that, I yield to the \nSenator from Tennessee until the vote is at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \napproximately 6 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the sense-of-the-Congress \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Michigan. Just to bring it \nback, because we have been traveling a great deal over the last hour, \nthat particular amendment says that the Congress assumes that Congress \nwould keep the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund solvent for more \nthan a decade, as recommended by the President; No. 2, accepts the \nPresident's proposed level of Medicare part B savings; and No. 3 and \nmost important, what I would like to speak to is reject the President's \nproposal to transfer home health spending from one part of Medicare to \nanother which threatens the delivery of home health care services to \n3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, it was exactly 13, almost 14, months ago that we all \nreceived the status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs which \nwas compiled and written by six trustees, three of whom were from \nPresident Clinton's Cabinet. In that, they use very simple words. And, \nagain, this is 14 months ago. We are waiting for the April edition--it \nis a month, a month and a half late now--of this so-called Medicare \ntrustees' report.\n  The very first page says:\n\n       The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays \n     inpatient hospital expenses--\n\n  Which I should add is part A--\n\n     will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years and is \n     severely out of financial balance in the long range.\n\n  Mr. President, it continues to say that:\n\n       The trustees believe prompt, effective and decisive action \n     is necessary.\n\n  Last year, we took that action. We passed in this body a proposal \nthat would save and preserve Medicare. It was sent to the President of \nthe United States and it was vetoed.\n  The Medicare trustees' report basically said this. This is 1995 and \nthe year 2000. This is bankruptcy on this line. This is the Medicare \npart A trust fund. Last year, the report said we would be going \nbankrupt in 7 years, the blue line.\n  What we have found happen over the last 14 months is that things are \nmuch worse than we had even anticipated at the time. Without doing \nanything over the last year and a half, in large part because of scare \ntactics put on television to scare our senior citizens away from change \nwhich will preserve this program, we now find that Medicare is going to \nbe going bankrupt almost a year and a half earlier unless we act. It is \n1996. We have about 5 years before Medicare goes bankrupt.\n\n  That is part A. Medicare part A is hospitals, part B physicians. Part \nA is\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\ngoing bankrupt much quicker than we ever anticipated. The President's \nanswer to that is,\n\n       Let's take the fastest growing part, the home health care \n     out of part A and transfer it elsewhere and then we can say \n     part A is solvent long term and we'll feel good about that.\n\n  That is more gimmickry. That is more smoke and mirrors. It is really \ndeceptive to the American people. We need to make part A truly solvent. \nTo make it truly solvent, we need to address the real problem. This is \nthe amount of deficit spending. We began deficit spending last year. \nThe trustee report said it would be next year. It actually began last \nyear.\n  A report from the monthly Treasury statement, the highlight of fiscal \nyear 1996 through March 31, tells that for the first 6 months of this \nyear, we are running a $4 billion deficit. We are on our way to \nbankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, the problem that we have today in this transfer of \nhome health care is this: If we transfer this $55 billion of assets out \nof the part A trust fund and put it elsewhere, yes, we can say part A \nis solvent for 10 years, but the overall Medicare Program is not, and \nunless the overall Medicare Program is solvent, we cannot deliver care \nto those 37 million Americans out there. More smoke and mirrors. Let us \nsay we do not transfer that $55 billion of home health care out, then \nwhat happens to the solvency of the trust fund? You can see that it is \ngoing to go bankrupt between the year 2000 and the year 2001. \nTherefore, we must act and we must act decisively.\n  How do we respond? In the balanced budget resolution proposal which \nis before us, we can see that we have solvency out to the year 2006. \nThis is 1996, 2006, this line is solvency. Current law, if we do \nnothing, we are bankrupt in the year 2001.\n  Under the President's proposal, we extend that 1 year--only 1 year. \nThat will scare seniors once they know that. We need to look at that \nbalanced budget proposal, look what we do by opening it up, allowing \nsome competition, slowing the growth from 10 percent down to 6 percent, \nand that is not a cut. We are slowing the growth from 10 to 6.1 \npercent. We are going to increase spending from $4,800 in 1995 to \n$7,000 a year in the year 2002. That is not a cut.\n  Mr. President, by supporting this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we \ndo reject the President's proposal to transfer home health spending. \nWhy? Because it is more gimmickry, it does not assure long-term \nsolvency of the Medicare trust funds. I urge all my colleagues to vote \nto support this amendment.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3979\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in accordance with the earlier unanimous \nconsent agreement, at this time I move to table the Rockefeller \namendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the motion to lay \non the table the Rockefeller amendment. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 117 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kassebaum\n     Pryor\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3979) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the vote to table the Rockefeller \namendment, I supported the budget resolution, which is moderate and \nmaintains the solvency of Medicare.\n  Contrary to the argument that there are Medicare cuts, the fact is \nthat Medicare expenditures increase by an average of 6.1 percent \nannually with the following total expenditures each year: 1996, $196 \nbillion; 1997, $209 billion; 1998, $224 billion; 1999, $236 billion; \n2000, $249 billion; 2001, $263 billion; 2002, $279 billion.\n  On the 1996 budget resolution, I voted to increase Medicare \nexpenditures when the rate of increase was reduced by $268 billion and \nthere was a tax cut of $245 billion. In this budget resolution, the tax \ncut is limited to $122 billion to cover a child tax credit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table on the ``Chairman's Mark \nBudget Aggregates'' be printed in the Record together with the \n``Medicare Fact Sheet.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                            CHAIRMAN'S MARK BUDGET AGGREGATES                                                           \n                                                                  [Dollars in billions]                                                                 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                 6-year \n                                                                     1996       1997       1998       1999       2000       2001       2002      total  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary:                                                                                                                                          \n    Defense.....................................................        265        265        263        266        269        268        268       1599\n    Nondefense..................................................        271        271        264        260        256        250        249       1551\n                                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal discretionary..................................        536        536        527        526        526        518        516       3150\n                                                                 =======================================================================================\nMandatory:                                                                                                                                              \n    Social Security.............................................        348        365        383        402        422        444        467       2484\n    Medicare....................................................        196        209        224        236        249        263        279       1459\n    Medicaid....................................................         96        105        111        117        126        133        139        731\n    Welfare programs............................................         85         89         89        102        100         98        106        583\n    EITC (outlays)..............................................         16         18         18         19         20         20         21        116\n    Other mandatory.............................................         57         62         82         71         83         84         82        464\nNet interest....................................................        240        242        244        243        240        238        236       1444\n                                                                 =======================================================================================\n      Total outlays.............................................       1575       1626       1678       1717       1764       1798       1846      10430\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\n                                                                                                                                                        \nRevenues........................................................       1431       1471       1532       1600       1675       1755       1846       9879\nResulting deficit/surplus.......................................       -147       -155       -146       -117        -89        -43          0  .........\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I understand the next vote is going to \nbe on the Abraham-Domenici amendment. Have the yeas and nays been \nordered on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the third \nvote in this voting sequence be on or in relation to the Exon amendment \nNo. 3965, the so-called President's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So that will follow the Abraham-Domenici. I think that \nwill be the last vote tonight.\n  Has this been ordered for 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been ordered for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes on the \nExon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Exon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think I should announce that while we \nare going to try to stay on after this vote to see what we can do to \nnegotiate and get some consent----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We cannot hear you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Perhaps if some of you would not talk so much you could \nhear me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Chamber, please.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not running for anything around here. That is why \nyou do not pay attention.\n  Could we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we have order in the Chamber, please?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to convene tomorrow morning \nat 9:30. We cannot tell you yet whether there are going to be votes. We \nthink there will be. Certainly tomorrow we are going to work a long \ntime trying to get amendments up. If Senators have amendments and can \nbe here tomorrow, they ought to be here. We are going to use a lot of \ntime on this budget resolution tomorrow. If we can get an orderly \nsequencing of amendments, we might not have to stay here and vote. If \nwe can just get started in the morning to let us see where we are, but \nfor now you ought to be here because we may have votes early in the \nmorning.\n  Is that a fair statement, Mr. Minority Leader?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Are there additional votes tonight?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are no additional votes tonight--I have already \nannounced that--after the two remaining ones.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, could I add one thing that I think should be \ndriven home? If we are going to expedite this process, we are going to \nhave to have people who are on the list to come and offer their \namendments on Friday, or on Monday and not leave here tonight and \nassume that they are home free until sometime on Tuesday because, if we \nall do that, then Tuesday is going to be a much worse day than it is \ndestined to be in any event. So I hope people listened to what Senator \nDomenici said and be here tomorrow to offer amendments, and not just \nassume, and then everybody flock in here as they usually do at 2:30 on \nTuesday afternoon and say, ``Why can't I have 2 hours on my \namendment?'' It will not be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I want to repeat what I \nsaid. I have been asked by the majority leader to indicate to all of \nyou that we are trying to finish this budget resolution Tuesday night. \nIf that means at 12 o'clock on Wednesday morning at 1 or 2, that is \nincluded in the definition of Tuesday. It may be Wednesday, or Tuesday \nmorning at 4 a.m. But we are going to try. If you can start offering \namendments tomorrow, we may have an agreement that on Monday there will \nnot be any votes. If we get a sequencing of amendments where you offer \n10 or 15 amendments and offer them on Monday, then we may, indeed, be \nable to give some of you the opportunity to not have to be here on \nFriday and Monday. But we need cooperation before we do that.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I add one other thing? I ask the \nDemocrats before they leave here tonight and the Republicans before \nthey leave here tonight to come to our desks and tell us when you will \nbe here tomorrow, or want to be here tomorrow, or Monday with regard to \noffering your amendments. If you will do that, and we will be working \nback and forth as best we can on amendments as we have been, then we \nmight be able to reach some kind of a agreement that, yes. You want to \nbe here at 10, maybe not 10, or 10:30, we might be able to get an \norderly process going because otherwise Tuesday is going to be \nunbelievably bad.\n\n  So please drop by if you can be here on Friday like you are supposed \nto be, and tell us when you will be here, and we will be glad to \naccommodate you as best we can on timing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3980\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\n On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3965\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the President's fiscal year 1997 budget \nbuilds on the immense economic success of his 1993 budget.\n  Since the enactment of that historic deficit reduction package, the \nFederal deficit has been cut in half--from $290 billion to a projected \n$144 billion in 1996, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The \ndeficit as a share of the economy is down from 4.7 percent in 1992 to \n2.3 percent today. Last week CBO projected the 1996 deficit may be even \nlower--down to $130 billion.\n  These favorable reports serve as testament both to the effectiveness \nof the 1993 deficit reduction package and a strong Clinton economy. \nActual total deficit reduction achieved by the 1993 budget package is \nnow estimated by CBO to be approximately $800 billion over 5 years. All \nthis progress has come from a deficit reduction package that was \nenacted without a single Republican vote.\n  Although most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \npredicted the 1993 package would bring about job loss and recession, \neconomic indicators have improved vastly since the Bush recession. \nUnemployment is down from 7.3 percent in January 1993 to 5.4 percent in \nApril 1996. Inflation has been remarkably low during these times of \nsustained economic growth, with the consumer price index increasing \nless than 3 percent in each of the last 3 years. Since January 1993, \n8.5 million jobs have been created, and more than 90 percent of those \nwere private sector jobs.\n  Interest rates--responding to sound fiscal policies--have fallen well \nbelow the levels of 3 years ago, with the 30-year average rate dropping \nfrom 7.67 percent in 1992 to about 7 percent today. Business investment \nin equipment is up 11 percent per year in real dollars since the fourth \nquarter of 1992. And corporate profits are up to a 13-percent annual \nrate since fourth quarter of 1992.\n  The economy is strong. But the new Clinton budget is sensitive to the \nunderlying anxiety and apprehension of America's working families. This \nbudget secures the integrity of the Medicare trust fund through 2005, \nand it does so without ravaging Medicare. In contrast, the Republican \nbudget cuts $50 billion more.\n  The President's budget maintains guaranteed health care for nursing \nhome seniors and poor children under Medicaid. In contrast, the \nRepublican budget could cut as much as $250 billion in Medicaid.\n  The President's budget maintains America's investment in education \nand job training--Head Start, Basic Education Assistance (title 1), and \nJob Training for Dislocated Workers. In contrast, the Republican budget \ncuts $60 billion from these priorities.\n  The President's budget does not raise taxes on working Americans. In \ncontrast, the Republican budget cuts $20 billion from the earned income \ntax Credit, raising taxes on 6 to 10 million hard-pressed working \nfamilies.\n  The President's budget protects the environment. In contrast, the \nRepublican budget cuts EPA operating programs by 11 percent in 1997 and \nby 23 percent in 2002.\n  The President's budget does not offer tax breaks for the rich at the \nexpense of Medicare and education. In contrast, and contrary to the \nrepresentations made by some of my colleagues, the Republican budget \nprovides $180 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans over \nthe next 6 years.\n  Mr. President, the President's budget would balance the budget by \n2002 using CBO economic assumptions. But, unlike the Republican budget, \nit would balance the budget without abandoning America's priorities. It \nwould preserve paycheck security, health security, and retirement \nsecurity for America's working people.\n  The spending cuts in the President's budget are significant, yet they \nare made in the right places. The President's budget would achieve more \nthan $600 billion in spending cuts by 2002. It would reduce the size of \nthe Federal Government work force by 200,000, making it the smallest it \nhas been in 30 years.\n  Finally, the President's budget would provide targeted tax relief for \nworking families and for families trying to send their children to \ncollege.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the President's budget is a \nbudget that reflects the priorities of the American people. In \ncontrast, the Republican budget is the same extreme proposal the \nAmerican people rejected last year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 3965, \nas amended, offered by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon].

Mr. President, yesterday, during debate on an amendment \nto cut defense levels in the budget resolution, the senior Senator from \nIowa cited certain statements contained in my recent paper on military \nreadiness. I have great respect and friendship for my colleague. \nHowever, I must point out that those quotations were taken out of \ncontext and were used to give the impression that I supported the \nSenator's amendment to reduce the defense spending level in the pending \nresolution.\n  I want to take this opportunity once again to state very clearly my \nstrong opposition to the Grassley amendment.\n  First, I strongly oppose any amendments to reduce the level of \ndefense spending in the pending resolution. Last year, I was at the \nforefront of efforts in the Senate to add funding to the President's \ndefense budget. Ultimately, the Congress added $7 billion, most of \nwhich was allocated to modernization programs.\n  And I strongly supported the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nbipartisan letter to the Senate Budget Committee requesting a \nsignificant increase in the Defense budget. The pending resolution \nincludes the increase we requested.\n  Second, President Clinton's defense budget request for the coming \nfiscal year seriously neglects future readiness, putting at risk the \nability of our military forces to prevail in future conflicts. Our \nhighest ranking military officers, including the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, cited the need for increased procurement funding to \nensure a modern, ready force in the future. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee recently reported to the Senate a Defense authorization bill \nfor the coming fiscal year that includes significant increases in the \nprocurement and research and development accounts for future \nmodernization.\n  Third, the statements cited yesterday by the Senator from Iowa were \ntaken completely out of the full context of my paper. The Senator \nshould re-read the paper in its entirety, in which it is clearly stated \nthat funding for our Nation's military is far too little to fully meet \nour vital national security needs.\n  I do believe, as the Senator quoted, that we must look for ways to do \nmore with less. That statement is based both on an acknowledgment of \nfiscal reality as well as a sense of responsibility to the taxpayers. \nRegardless of whether we increase the top line of the Defense budget, \nwe have a responsibility to the American people to spend their tax \ndollars wisely. Every dollar of defense spending should be spent \ncarefully and for programs which enhance the ability of our service men \nand women to do their jobs, whether they are assigned to combat units, \nsupport units, or the Reserve components.\n  I also believe, as the Senator quoted, that eliminating excess \ninfrastructure is necessary and would free up funds for military \nmodernization. The Department of Defense, with the help of Congress, \nmust continue its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and improve \nefficiency by eliminating wasteful spending and practices. The Senator \nfrom Iowa has been active in promoting financial and other reform \nefforts in the Department of Defense, and I commend him for his \nefforts.\n  However, the Senator seems to have missed the larger point of my \npaper.\n  On page 19 of the paper, I clearly stated, as follows:\n\n       There are many approaches to streamlining defense \n     operations and activities that could result in cost savings \n     and which should be done to ensure the best value to the \n     American taxpayer. However, the magnitude of savings from \n     these efficiencies is negligible in comparison to the funding \n     required to modernize and maintain a ready military force.\n\n  Finally, let me note this clear concluding statement:\n\n       In all of the decisions we face about our future defense \n     requirements, we must not allow fiscal considerations to be \n     the single, dominant factor. Instead, we must focus on the \n     most cost-effective means of maintaining the military \n     capabilities necessary to ensure our future security. We must \n     pay what it costs for a military force capable of deterring \n     aggression and achieving success in any future conflict. In \n     short, we must be prepared to accept the cost of being a \n     world power.\n\nThese statements clearly represent the full context of my paper, which \nfocused principally on a proposal to reform the military readiness \nsystem, but also repeatedly cited the need for additional funding for \nmilitary modernization. I am sorry the Senator from Iowa seems to have \nmissed the point of my paper.\n  Just like the quotations from my paper, the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa missed the mark. His amendment would have done nothing to \nencourage the Department of Defense to operate more efficiently, if \nthat was his intention. His amendment did not even address alleged \nPentagon waste and mismanagement, which would be permitted to continue \nunabated even if his amendment had been adopted. Instead, his amendment \nwould have cut needed funding for the military modernization programs \nadded by the Senate Armed Services Committee in the recently reported \nDefense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 1997.\n  I voted against the Grassley amendment, which failed by a vote of 57 \nto 42. I intend to vote against other such amendments to cut the \ndefense function.\n\n\n                      unanimous-consent agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments that \nwill be in order to Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, and that all other \nprovisions of the Budget Act remain in effect, provided that the \namendments may be offered by a designee.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                            Republican List\n\n       Chafee/Breaux--alternative budget.\n       Simpson--SOS accurate inflation index.\n       Brown/Simpson--CPI.\n       Brown/Simpson--SOS eligibility ages.\n       Lott--U.N.\n       Campbell--at risk youth.\n       Thompson--delete Presidential check off.\n       Hutchison--SOS homemaker IRA.\n       Faircloth--SOS national debt.\n       Faircloth--welfare.\n       Kyl--LIHEP.\n       Kyl--SOS tax limitation.\n       Kyl--Americorp.\n       Murkowski--relevant.\n       Domenici/Gorton--Medicare Part A.\n       Domenici--Spectrum.\n       Snowe--SOS tax cut sunsets.\n       Ashcroft--payroll taxes.\n       Gramm--SOS Soc.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will consider the budget resolution on Friday and Monday. Since \na large number of Senators have indicated they will be available to \noffer their amendments, no votes will occur either Friday or Monday. \nSenators who have amendments must offer and debate their amendments \neither Friday or Monday. It will be the intention of the leadership to \nconclude the budget resolution by the close of business on Tuesday, if \nat all possible.\n  As an example of Senators that have already indicated they will work \nwith their amendments, let me state on Friday--this is not binding in \nany order--but Senator Wellstone will be here at 9:30, Senator Moseley-\nBraun, somewhere around 10 o'clock, Senator Byrd somewhere around 11 \no'clock, Senator Simpson around noon, Senator Kerry has two amendments, \nsomewhere around 1:30, Senator Lott in the afternoon, Senator Kyl in \nthe afternoon, Senator Gramm in the afternoon, Senator Dorgan, and \nSenator Kennedy, sometime tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. We had worked out on this side an opportunity for the \nSenator from Washington, Senator Murray, to be somewhere between noon \nand 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will put that in between Senator Kerry and Senator \nLott, who would go later. Senator Murray could be somewhere after \nSenator Kerry.\n  Mr. FORD. We would like to reverse that, Senator, and put Senator \nMurray before Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would have Senator Murray coming ahead of Senator \nKerry, with his two amendments.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, was putting Senator Murray ahead of Senator \nKerry cleared with Senator Kerry?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes, and Senator Murray will be speaking in favor of the \namendment of Senator Kerry. She has an amendment also. It would work \nout for her travel plans. We agreed the 12 to 2 o'clock period she \ncould introduce her amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. This timing is getting rather complicated. Senator Kerry is \nmaking a special trip back from Boston and will be in Pittsburgh then \nhe has to go back. He told me he would be here hopefully between 2 \no'clock and 3 o'clock. He will be very strapped for time to meet the \nconnection. I simply say as nearly as possible I hope we can \naccommodate Senator Kerry when he shows up, maybe put him before or \nafter. I did not know about Senator Murray.\n  Mr. FORD. It is somewhere before 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. EXON. All right. We will do our best to accommodate everyone. I \nthink we have that general understanding.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I continue. On all the amendments that the \nSenator from New Mexico just listed, this is not a unanimous consent \nrequest, this is a bona fide effort to indicate that these Senators \nwill offer their amendments tomorrow, in somewhat of the order I have \ndescribed.\n  Now, Senators are going to be accommodated. We will stay until they \nare accommodated, and try to use a substantial amount of time. I will \nnot be here after 3:30 but there will be someone here so we get this \nfinished.\n  Now on Monday, I told the Senators we are doing well on Friday, and \non Monday we are doing better. We do not have to have votes because we \nwill have a lot of amendments and stack them in an orderly matter. \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Kyl, Senator Harkin, Senator Bumpers, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Baucus, Senator Levin, Senator Simon, Senator Snowe. \nSenator Chafee and Senator Breaux, the full substitute, they will take \n3 hours on Monday afternoon and then they will wrap it up with 1 hour \non Tuesday when we sequence them into a voting pattern.\n  Mr. EXON. What is the time allowed for that amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A total of 4 hours equally divided, 3 hours on Monday, \nand wrap it up with 1 hour on Tuesday.\n  Then we have Senators Brown and Simpson who will also be ready \nMonday, Senator Ashcroft will be ready Monday. Feingold is for Monday.\n  The last list, starting with Senator Harkin and ending with Senator \nAshcroft, are Monday amendments in some kind of sequencing related to \nwhat I have just described.\n  Again, nobody is bound to a time but I am really urging and my friend \nSenator Exon is, and the whip and the minority leader, that we appear \nand offer them, because that means we will be well on our way to a \nmanageable schedule on Tuesday.\n  Mr. EXON. I agree. I think it can and will work.\n  Mr. FORD. May I ask one more question? I apologize for taking so \nlong, but would Senator Domenici advise me about the amendment by \nSenator Nunn on long-term entitlement reform. It seems to me he and \nSenator Brown may have a joint amendment. I wanted to be sure that \nSenator Nunn was accommodated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is known as the Brown-Simpson-Nunn \namendment.\n  Mr. FORD. That will be sometime late Monday?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It looks like it is close to 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. FORD. That would be ideal, sometime around 5 o'clock or after.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5177-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5177-S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued the consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions contained \n     in this budget resolution assume Medicaid reforms shall--\n       (1) maintain the guarantees in current law for Medicaid \n     coverage of seniors, children, pregnant women, and persons \n     with disabilities.\n       (2) preserve current laws protecting spouses and adult \n     children from the risk of impoverishment to pay for long-term \n     nursing home care;\n       (3) maintain the current Federal nursing home quality and \n     enforcement standards;\n       (4) protect states from unanticipated program costs \n     resulting from economic fluctuations in the business cycle, \n     changing demographics, and natural disasters;\n       (5) maintain the successful Federal-State partnership and \n     protect the Federal Treasury against practices that allow \n     States to decrease their fair share of Medicaid funding; and,\n       (6) continue to provide coverage of Medicare premiums and \n     cost-sharing payments for low-income Medicare beneficiaries, \n     consistent with current law.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored and pleased to be able to \noffer the Boxer-Graham-Dorgan-Kennedy amendment regarding Medicaid. The \npurpose of this amendment is really quite simple and straightforward.\n  First, my amendment restores the $18 billion in excess cuts made by \nthe Republican budget, and it will be offset by closing corporate tax \nloopholes.\n  Second, my amendment contains a sense of the Senate that any reforms \nmade to Medicaid maintain six particular principles, and I will outline \nthose principles briefly.\n  But before I do, I think it is important to ask the question, Who \ndoes Medicaid really help in this everyday world? Who are the people \nout there who depend on Medicaid?\n  First of all, 2 million senior citizens who are in nursing homes are \non Medicaid and depend on Medicaid. Two out of every three residents in \nnursing homes depend on Medicaid.\n  We also know there are 18 million children who depend on Medicaid--\nchildren. It is their lifeline. Half of these children live in working \nfamilies where their families work very hard. They are the working \npoor, and their children rely on Medicaid.\n  The disabled--6 million of our citizens who are disabled rely on \nMedicaid and perhaps up to 1 million pregnant women rely on Medicaid. \nOf our children between the ages of 13 and 18, there are 2.5 million.\n  So millions and millions of Americans rely on Medicaid, and, \ntherefore, this amendment, I think--and I am so pleased that it has \nbroad support on this side of the aisle--is really key to real people.\n  So the first part of the amendment is that we restore $18 billion \nthat has been cut, what we call excess cuts. Second, we have a sense of \nthe Senate on six principles. They are as follows: First, maintain \nMedicaid coverage for low-income seniors, children up to 18 years of \nage, pregnant women, and the disabled; second, maintain current \nprotection against the impoverishment of spouses and adult children \nwhose family member is in a nursing home; third, maintain Federal \nnursing home standards; fourth, protect States from unanticipated \nincreases in enrollment, which can occur as a result of economic \nfluctuations such as recessions, changing demographics or natural \ndisasters; fifth, maintain the successful Federal-State partnership and \nprotect our Federal Treasury against practices that may allow States to \ndecrease their fair share of Medicaid funding; and sixth, continue to \nprovide Medicare premiums and cost-sharing payments for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries that are consistent with current law.\n  I would like to make this point, Mr. President. All of these six \nprinciples that are outlined in this amendment are contained in the \nPresident's budget, as well as in the Chafee-Breaux budget proposal; \nhowever, they are not maintained or referenced in the Republican \nbudget.\n  So of the budgets that we will be looking at, namely, the President's \nbudget, the Republican budget, and the Chafee-Breaux budget, we find \nthe Republican budget does not address these six principles. Frankly, \nwe feel it is very important that these principles be adhered to.\n  Why do I say that? I think the backbone of all the other principles \nis the guarantee of coverage that exists in current Medicaid law for \nseniors, children, pregnant women, and persons with disabilities. We \nknow this is a real problem because in the reconciliation bill we saw \nthat there was a walking away from this commitment.\n  We also believe that a person with certain disabilities in one State \nmight not be considered disabled in another State under this budget. We \nwant to make sure that does not happen. Some States could decide to \ndefine disability in such a way that it will not cover many serious \ndisabilities.\n  So we think it is very important that the people who are now covered \nremain covered. We do not have that assurance at all in this budget. As \na matter of fact, the plans that the Republicans have talked about \nwould allow the States to decide these questions. I think it is very \nimportant that it be a national standard here as to who is disabled and \nwho should definitely have coverage.\n  I want to talk about the guarantee to children. We have no certainty \nin this Republican budget that children from the ages of 13 to 18 would \nbe covered. Let me tell you the problem. It would mean that a low-\nincome teenage girl, the only way she could get health coverage, if the \nState decided to cut her\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\noff, is to get pregnant. This is not a message that we want to send to \nour young people. We should cover children until they turn 18. I think \nwe owe them that.\n  I want to talk a minute about the other principle, the spouses and \nadult children who are at risk of impoverishment if one of their family \nmembers winds up in a nursing home. Remember, there are 2 million \nsenior citizens in nursing homes, and two out of three of them are on \nMedicaid. We passed a very important law, when I was over in the House \nof Representatives, that said we will not drive the adult children of \nnursing home residents and we will not drive the spouse of a nursing \nhome resident into the poor house simply because their family member is \nin a nursing home.\n  I am very fearful that without saying something affirmative in this \nbudget, we could repeal this very important spousal impoverishment \nprovision. We should not be forcing spouses or adult children to be \nthrust into poverty.\n  Why do I say that? The average cost for nursing home care, Mr. \nPresident, is about $36,000 a year. Clearly, how many of our people \ncould really pay that?\n  I think it is crucial that we protect spouses and the adult children \nof nursing home residents. I think if we do not pass this amendment, \nour amendment that we have worked on here, that could happen.\n\n  Nursing home quality standards. Very clearly we ought to say that we \nbelieve there ought to be national standards. Why do I say this? \nBecause we know what can happen. We saw what happened in the 1980's. \nThere were nursing home scandals. We know that our senior citizens were \nbeing mistreated, abused. Some of the stories are hair-raising. I will \nnot go into them because time does not permit it. But they were \ndrugged, they were put into baths that were scalding.\n  What happened? We decided we would have standards and enforcement. \nNow we have absolutely no assurance in this particular budget that is \nbefore us that this will happen. That is why we hope we can get \nbipartisan support for this particular amendment that I am offering. So \nit is key to save those nursing home national standards.\n  One senior citizen in Nebraska is as important as a senior citizen in \nNew York or Ohio or Wyoming or Montana. We want to treat our grandmas \nand grandpas and our great grandmas and great grandpas with respect. We \nshould have national standards and not back away from them.\n  We protect the States from unanticipated program costs in the sense \nof the Senate. We say that, in fact, when you have a natural disaster \nsuch as my State of California, or there is an unanticipated cost from \na recession, that we will help the States meet their Medicaid burdens.\n  Finally, an issue that I know Senator Graham is going to speak to \nbecause he was a Governor of the great State of Florida. We want to \nmaintain the successful Federal-State partnership involving Medicaid. \nWe also want to make sure there are no scams in the States, that, in \nfact, the States do not abuse the Medicaid program.\n  So, Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I know that Senators \nKennedy and Graham would like to speak.\n  I would like at this time to yield them some time, if that is \nagreeable.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts and then to \nthe Senator from Florida. We have had a little bit of intervening \ndebate and I just want to remind everyone what we are talking about \nhere are the people in our country who need us to stand with them: The \nseniors in the nursing homes, the children with disabilities, the \npregnant women, the working poor, the people who are working very hard \nto stay afloat and need us not to abandon them. I think this amendment \nwe are presenting to you will give them that reassurance that they will \nnot be abandoned.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Florida will \naddress the Senate on an extremely important aspect of this whole issue \nof the cutback in Medicaid. I will try to be to the point but also \nspeak about the importance of this particular amendment.\n  First of all, I want to thank the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, for being the leader on this particular issue as she has been on \nso many of the issues involving working families, children, and their \nparents and the disabled. All of us are grateful to her for her \nleadership on this issue of restoring some $18 billion in the Medicaid \nProgram over the next 6 years.\n  Now, I think Members can ask whether this $18 billion we see under \nthe Republican program, the reduction of $72 billion, I think it is \nimportant as we commence this debate to understand where that serious \ncut will come from in the Republican budget and the benefits that this \nprogram reaches in terms of children, the disabled and the elderly. The \nimportance of this amendment of the Senator from California is that \nwith the acceptance of some cuts in the Medicaid, those cuts basically \nwill be out of what we call the disproportionate share payments, which \ngo not to the individual reduction in benefits, but are basically funds \nthat go to the State generally. It is extremely important to understand \nthat every dollar in the Senate's program is a dollar that will make a \ndifference in the quality of life of children and seniors.\n  The second point which is an enormous part of the Senator's amendment \nwhich I know that the Senator from Florida will cover is the \nsignificance of the Republican budget cuts, which will mean $250 \nbillion in reduced payments of benefits over the period of the next 6 \nyears because of the changing of the formula in terms of what is \nrequired by the States.\n  This is a very, very dramatic reduction and cut in who will be \naffected by this. The people that will be affected by this, as the \nSenator has pointed out, will be the children, the elderly people, \nnursing homes, and the disabled in our country.\n  The further point I want to make this evening is that it is important \nthat we had the earlier vote on the Medicare and now on the Medicaid \nbecause to a great extent we are talking about the same populations. We \nare seeing the reductions in the Medicare programs that will affect our \nseniors, and this is another significant reduction in services for our \nelderly people as well as the children.\n  So if you look at the reductions in the Medicare Program, and you \nlook at the reductions in the Medicaid Program, you are finding those \ncuts, together, are going to be an extremely heavy burden on the most \nvulnerable in our society--the children, the frail elderly, and the \ndisabled in our community.\n  Medicaid is the companion program to Medicare, and the Republican \nassault on Medicaid is just as misguided and unfair as their assault on \nMedicare. The Republican plan would cut Federal Medicaid payments by \n$72 billion over the next 6 years--but that is only the tip of the \niceberg. Under the Republican plan, total Medicaid spending would be \ncut by a staggering $250 billion--and States will be allowed to spend \nFederal Medicaid dollars on roads, bridges, and political patronage \nrather than health care services.\n  In large measure, the Republican cuts in Medicaid will strike another \nheavy blow at the same groups hurt by the Republican cuts in Medicare--\nsenior citizens and the disabled. Ten million elderly and disabled \nindividuals are enrolled in Medicaid. Seventy percent of all spending \nunder the program is for these two groups--much of it for long-term \nnursing home care.\n  Another group will also be injured by the Republican plan--America's \nchildren. Seventy percent of those who rely on Medicaid are children \nand their parents--a total of 18 million children. One in every five \nchildren in America depends on Medicaid. One in every three children \nborn in this country depend on Medicaid to cover their prenatal care \nand delivery.\n  Every child deserves a healthy start in life. Under the Republican \nplan millions of children who have adequate medical care today will be \nforced to do without it tomorrow.\n  Medicaid provides good coverage to children today. They are \nguaranteed prenatal care, immunizations, regular checkups, \ndevelopmental screenings, and both chronic and intensive physician and \nhospital care.\n  The great bulk of Medicaid-covered children are in families with \nworking parents. Most of these parents work\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nfull time--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but all their hard work \ndoes not buy them health care for their children, because their \nemployer does not provide it and they cannot afford it.\n  Even with Medicaid, over 10 million children are uninsured, and each \nday the number rises. Soon, less than half of all children will be \ncovered by employer-based health insurance. We tried to address this \nproblem in the last Congress--but the Republicans said no. Today, they \nare trying to undermine the only place that families can turn without \nemployer-provided coverage.\n  Last year, the Republicans proposed to eliminate all guarantees of \ncoverage for children. This year, it is ``only''--only--poor children \n13 to 18 who will lose their coverage. In addition, children of all \nages--even babies--will lose their current guarantee that all medically \nnecessary treatments will be covered.\n  The 6 million disabled who depend on Medicaid are even less \nfortunate. The Republican plan repeals all Federal standards for \ncoverage of the disabled.\n  States are also free to set any limits on scope and duration of \nservices that they choose. If a State budget is tight this year, why \nnot limit the sick to shorter hospital stays. If they need a week to \nrecover from serious illness or surgery--too bad. That's somebody \nelse's problem--if the Republican plan is adopted.\n  In a very real way, Medicaid is a lifeline for children and families \nwho have nowhere else to turn. Without access to Medicaid, many healthy \nchildren will become sick and many sick children will die. It is wrong \nto put children at risk to pay for tax breaks and special favors for \nthe wealthy and powerful. Greed is not a family value.\n  Under the Republican plan, senior citizens and the disabled suffer a \none-two punch. Deep Medicare cuts, and even deeper cuts in Medicaid. \nMany will lose their Medicaid coverage or see their benefits cut back. \nBut they will also be victimized by one of the harshest parts of the \nRepublican plan--the elimination of Federal enforcement of quality \nstandards for nursing homes.\n  Strong quality standards for nursing homes were enacted by Congress \nwith solid bipartisan support in 1987, after a series of investigations \nrevealed appalling conditions in such homes throughout the Nation and \nshocking abuse of senior citizens and the disabled.\n\n  Elderly patients were often allowed to go uncleaned for days, lying \nin their own excrement. They were tied to wheelchairs and beds under \nconditions that would not be tolerated in any prison in America. \nDeliberate abuse and violence were used against helpless senior \ncitizens by callous or sadistic attendants. Painful, untreated, and \ncompletely avoidable bedsores were widespread. Patients were scalded to \ndeath in hot baths and showers. Others were sedated to the point of \nunconsciousness, or isolated from all aspects of normal life by fly-by-\nnight nursing home operators bent on profiteering from the misery of \ntheir patients.\n  These conditions, once revealed, shocked the conscience of the \nNation. The Federal standards enacted by Congress ended much of this \nunconscionable abuse and achieved substantial improvement in the \nquality of care for nursing home residents.\n  Last year, the Republican proposal eliminated these standards \naltogether. When the public outcry was too great, they weakened the \nstandards instead. This year, they claim to leave them unchanged--but \nthey are proposing to leave enforcement to the States, even though it \nwas the States' failure to protect senior citizens that necessitated \npassing the 1987 law in the first place.\n  Whatever the formal rules and regulations say, the Republican cuts in \nMedicaid are so deep that even conscientious nursing home operators who \nwant to maintain high quality care will be hard-pressed to afford the \nstaff and equipment necessary to provide it.\n  It is difficult to believe that anyone, no matter how extreme their \nideology, would take us back to the harsh conditions before 1987. But \nthat is what the Republican plan will do.\n  Further, the Republican plan victimizes not only the elderly but \ntheir families as well. Last year, the Republicans proposed to repeal \nthe spousal impoverishment protections that protected the husband or \nwife of a nursing home resident against the double loss of a loved one \nand the chance to maintain even a modest standard of living. They \nproposed to repeal protections that have been in place since the \nMedicaid program was enacted against adult children being required to \nimpoverish themselves to pay for the care of an aged parent.\n  Again, the public outcry was so great that the Republicans were \nforced to modify their plan--but they left the fine print in place. \nSpousal impoverishment provisions were supposedly retained--but they \nwere rendered meaningless by other parts of the Republican plan.\n  Without a guarantee of coverage, a protection against spousal \nimpoverishment is useless for those who can no longer qualify for \nassistance in the first place. The plan allowed nursing homes to add \nextra charges that Medicaid did not cover, and require families to make \nlarge up-front deposits before a patient is admitted. Adult children \nwere protected--but only if their income was below the median. Families \nwhose total income is less than the cost of a year in a nursing home \nwould still be liable for the cost of care for their elderly family \nmember.\n  Republicans claim their new plan avoids this last set of abuses, but \nthe American people should read the fine print.\n  The Republican plan for Medicaid is an outrage. It says that our \nsociety does not care about the most vulnerable groups in our country--\npeople with disabilities, senior citizens, and children.\n  These Republican proposals are too harsh and too extreme. They are \nnot what the American people voted for in the last election. They \nshould be rejected out of hand by the Congress, and the American people \nshould reject their sponsors in the next election.\n  I thank the Senator from California. I yield back whatever time \nremains.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts. \nBefore he leaves, I think we have a chance to win this amendment, I say \nto my friend, because, actually, the Democratic budget addresses these \nissues. This amendment gives us a chance, those of us who supported \nthat budget, to vote in favor of it. The Chafee-Breaux budget actually \nthat will be presented to us does, in fact, make these commitments. So \nif everyone who voted for Chafee-Breaux, who voted for the Democratic \nbudget, votes aye on this amendment, I say to my friend that maybe we \nwill have some better luck in the outcome.\n  My friend talked about turning our backs on those who need us the \nmost. I was present for a hearing that we held when we were doing the \nhealth care bill in which we had disabled children who were relying on \nMedicaid come into the Congress with their caregivers. Usually it was \ntheir mom or dad. Just looking at those kids with spina bifida, with \nkidney problems, with muscular dystrophy, or with multiple sclerosis, \ntrying to live their life with some dignity, relying completely on \nthese payments, it seems to me, I say to my colleagues at this late \nhour, even if it is late, this is a little sacrifice to make when we \nthink of those children and the sacrifices that they make every day of \ntheir lives and the sacrifices that their families make every day of \ntheir lives. It is shameful that we would walk away from these \nchildren. It is shameful.\n  Nobody needs to hear a lecture from one Senator to another. I do not \nmean at all to sound that way, because I do not think that anyone who \nvotes against this amendment wants to hurt those children. But I do \nthink, in the end, that is what will happen.\n  I yield 15 minutes to my friend from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague from California.\n  Mr. President, this debate should commence with one fundamental \ntruth: The Medicaid Program for the last 30 years has been a great \nAmerican success. The Medicaid Program has been a great American \nsuccess. Let me give you a few examples of that success.\n  In the early 1980's, in many parts of this country--I can speak \nspecifically for the American South--the rate of infant mortality was a \ndisgrace, rates of infant mortality that were close to those that would \nbe found in some of the less-developed nations of the world.\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\n In that period, leaders in the South decided that they wanted to have \na different legacy for the future.\n\n  So under the leadership of Governors such as Lamar Alexander of \nTennessee, Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Governor Dick Riley of South \nCarolina, who was designated to be the chair of a task force in the \nSouth on the children of the South, Governor Riley made a series of \nrecommendations which were adopted by most of the Southern States. But \nthe keystone recommendation was that the South should take steps to \nreduce its infant mortality by substantial increases in its commitment \nto appropriate prenatal care, care for pregnant women, care for \ninfants, and care for children in those critical early days of life.\n  The effect of that program 10 years later has been a dramatic \nreduction in infant mortality in the South, and because of that, a \nsignificant reduction in infant mortality in the United States, \napproximately a 20-percent reduction in the number of children who were \nborn without life or with a life that was less than it might have been.\n  Mr. President, Medicaid was an absolutely critical component of that \neffort to reduce infant mortality in our Nation, and because of it, \nthere are literally hundreds of thousands of boys and girls who are \nalive today, living lives that have great promise and opportunity.\n  Medicare is an American success story. Medicaid has also allowed \nolder Americans to live a life of dignity and respect when otherwise \nthey would have been consigned to the same condition of their parents \nand grandparents. To get old in America and to be poor in America was \nto be without dignity and respect.\n  You say, ``Why is this true of Medicaid? I thought it was Medicare \nthat provided services for older Americans.'' The fact is the two \nprograms work in a very compatible manner. Medicaid, for those elderly \nwho are unable to pay their premiums for Medicare, pays those premiums. \nIt allows the indigent elderly to continue to have access to Medicare \nphysician services. For those indigent elderly who cannot pay their \nprescription medication, Medicaid pays for their prescriptions so that \nthey can have access to the modern miracles that make life possible and \nmake a quality of life possible.\n  For many Americans, it is Medicaid which provides access to long-term \ncare, whether that be in a community setting or in an institutional \nsetting such as a nursing home. As the Senator from California has \npointed out, most Americans who are in nursing homes today--over two \nout of three--receive their nursing home monthly payments through the \nMedicaid Program.\n\n  Medicaid is an American success story for older Americans. Medicaid \nis an American success story because it has served as the fundamental \nsafety net under millions of poor children who without Medicaid would \nbe without any financing for their health care.\n  In 1980, of all Americans who were employed, approximately 65 to 70 \npercent were employed in a workplace which provided health care \ncoverage for themselves and for their families. That was part of what \nwe thought was the American dream, that if you worked hard and you \nsupported your family, you would have access to and the capacity to \nafford to acquire health care. We in Congress promoted that by \nproviding very favorable tax treatment for employer-provided health \ncare benefits. But since 1980, there has been a precipitous decline in \nthe percentage of Americans who are covered at this point of employment \nwith health care. Today that number is below 60 percent, and the \nestimate is that in the foreseeable future it will drop below 50 \npercent. Less than half of the Americans who are working will be \nsecuring their health care through their place of employment.\n  The result of this has been literally millions of low-income, not \nonly the employees themselves but even more the dependents of those \nemployees, their spouses and their children, without health care \ncoverage.\n  What has happened is that as these people fell into medical \nindigency, it was Medicaid which came to their rescue, and it has \nprovided them with access to health care coverage. If it had not been \nfor Medicaid, we would not be a nation today with some almost 40 \nmillion Americans without access to health care financing; we would be \na nation with 45 to 50 million Americans without access because persons \nwho had lost their coverage are able, and particularly their dependents \nare able, to get it through the Medicaid Program.\n  So the Medicaid Program has been an American success story. Because \nof that we should not be talking, as is suggested in the Republican \nproposal of 1996, as it was in the Republican proposal of 1995, about \nan amputation of Medicaid. Rather, we should be talking about \nthoughtful reforms that will preserve the fundamental values of the \nsystem while making it stronger and better and more adapted to some of \nthe current changes in health care delivery.\n  What are some of the fundamental issues in that reform of Medicaid? \nOne is, should we maintain the basic national partnership between the \nFederal Government and the State governments in the financing and \ndelivery of Medicaid services?\n  There are those who would suggest that that partnership is an \nanachronism, that it has had its day, but now we should amputate it, \ncut it off. Let us look for some new mutation to take its place, and \nthat new mutation is going to be some form of block grants where the \nFederal Government's role is essentially consigned to that of being a \ncheck writer that on the October 1 will write 50 checks, send them off \nto the State capitals of America and with very little involvement wash \nits hands of the Medicaid Program.\n  The irony of this proposal, Mr. President, is that the very people \nwho make it with such ardor frequently on other issues look, as one of \ntheir political North Stars, to former President Ronald Reagan and \nsuggest that he is in many ways the father of modern conservative \npolitical thought.\n  Would Ronald Reagan have supported a program of block grants to the \nStates for Medicaid? As my colleague from California, who no doubt had \nan opportunity to observe former Governor and then President Reagan \nover a number of years, will certainly know, the answer is no, because \nwhat President Reagan proposed was that rather than Balkanize Medicaid, \nMedicaid should be federalized.\n\n  He had a couple of compelling reasons why he thought that should be \nthe case. The first was that as a Californian he recognized the fact \nthat if you had differentials in standards, there was a tendency for a \nmobile population of poor people to seek out those communities that had \nthe most generous standards. In the 1960's and 1970's California had \namong the most generous standards in the country and therefore served \nas a magnet for persons to come in the State in order to access those \nstandards. So one rationale of President Reagan was that we needed to \nhave greater uniformity in order to avoid this inducement to move.\n  A second rationale which I think is extremely relevant today is that \nPresident Reagan recognized that Medicaid, which had started as being \nprimarily a program for poor children and their families, was \nincreasingly becoming a program for the frail elderly. In my State \ntoday about 60 to 70 percent of the Medicaid funding is spent on people \nover 65, a very high percentage spent on people over 85. So President \nReagan felt that we needed to relook at both Medicare, the health care \nfinancing program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the program for the \nindigent, and attempt to rationalize, harmonize, knit those two \nprograms more effectively together, and that that knitting together \nwould occur with more likelihood if Medicaid was a Federal program than \nif it were distributed to the States.\n  Mr. President, I think those two reasons of President Reagan were \ncompelling in the 1980's and, if anything, they are even more \ncompelling today. So it is somewhat of a shock now to see that the \ndescendents of the philosophy of Ronald Reagan want to go exactly in \nthe opposite direction from his advice, and that is to remove the \nFederal Government as a continuing partner in this national program of \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator from Florida yield for a \nquestion for a second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Florida is close to being through, and \nat the conclusion of my remarks, I will be pleased to yield.\n  The second point is that the Medicaid Program requires a base of \nfinancing in\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\norder to meet its current needs and to be able to assume the new \nresponsibilities which clearly lie just over the horizon. As the \nSenator from Massachusetts pointed out, the proposal of the Republicans \nwill reduce the total funds available for Medicaid over the next 7 \nyears not just by the some $70 to $80 billion that will be eliminated \nat the Federal level but by a figure of close to $250 billion because \nthe amount that will be asked of the States in their contribution to \nparticipate in the Medicaid Program will be so reduced.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not believe any serious analysis of the \nchallenges facing Medicaid could come to the conclusion that we can \nmeet the health care needs of Americans with a $250 billion reduction \nin funds available in the fundamental safety net program of our \nnational health care system, Medicaid. In fact, there are a number of \nfactors that are going to put Medicaid under greater pressure. One of \nthose factors is the fact that we have a growing number of children and \nadolescents in our population.\n  To give just one statistic, last year America graduated approximately \n2.5 million students from its high schools. Within less than 9 years, \nwe will be graduating over 3 million children from our high schools, as \nan indication of this surge of youth that is coming through our \nsociety, who in addition to having education needs will also have \nhealth care needs which Medicaid would be the principal instrument for \nmeeting.\n  I ask the Senator from California if she could yield an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Also, there will continue, unfortunately, to be a decline \nin the number of children covered by the health insurance of their \nparents at a point of employment. The population will continue to age. \nMore people will be in the advanced ages, which is the greatest source \nof additional cost to the Medicaid Program. We are making some policy \ndecisions such as those embedded in our recent vote on the immigration \nbill that are going to result in greater demands on the Medicaid \nsystem.\n  So there is no basis for the proposition that we can meet all of \nthese challenges to the Nation's health care system and sustain a $250 \nbillion cut in the Medicaid Program, most of it being a cut at the \nState level, not at the Federal level.\n  Finally, in the Medicaid system, one area of reform that cries out is \nto treat all States fairly. Today we have extreme disparities in terms \nof the funding that is provided for the poor child, the poor frail \nelderly, and the disabled from one State to the next. Those disparities \nare a function of history, the fact that we have built up a practice of \ninducing States to come into expanded Medicaid services by the Federal \nGovernment, matching or more than matching those State commitments. \nThose States that had a sufficient level of affluence to afford a more \nluxurious system have developed that, and, therefore, that has led to \nsubstantially higher amounts of Federal support for their Medicaid \nprograms than for the less affluent States.\n\n  We also have the situation in which certain States severely abused a \nprogram that had a good purpose: to recognize the special cost of \nhospitals that served large numbers of indigent Americans. Those \nhospitals were to be recognized by getting a disproportionate share of \nMedicaid funds in order to pick up some of that cost that was otherwise \nuncompensated. Unfortunately, that program was severely abused by a \nhandful of States and resulted in extreme distortions in where Federal \nMedicaid money went, State to State.\n  The proposal we have before us would largely freeze those past \ninequities into place and would make us live with them for the \nforeseeable future. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia represents a clarion voice for reform and fair treatment in \nthat all Americans should be assured that they will be treated equally \nby their National Government in terms of their access to quality health \ncare.\n  Those are some of the fundamental issues we are dealing with. Are we \ngoing to maintain the Federal-State partnership which has served us so \nwell in reducing infant mortality, providing dignity for older \nAmericans, providing a safety net under an increasingly frayed system \nof employer-based health insurance? Are we going to maintain an \nadequate funding basis at both the Federal and the State level to meet \nincreasing demands on our Medicaid Program? And are we going to treat \nall Americans, wherever they live, fairly?\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from California meets \nthose tests of fundamental fairness and vision for the future of \nAmerica. The underlying proposal fails on all of those tests.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. Boxer addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida, the former \nGovernor and distinguished U.S. Senator. He is on this floor with, I \nthink, very important advice for Senators. It is fiscally responsible. \nHe understands that when you help people who are trying to help \nthemselves, when you help people who deserve help, people who have such \nproblems, disabilities, infirmities, that in fact you are doing the \nright thing. I thank him very much for his leadership on this.\n\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee, that concludes our discussion of \nthis amendment. I will be very happy to yield the floor at this time \nfor him if he wishes to rebut. But I again urge my colleagues to look \ncarefully at the Democratic budget, at the Breaux-Chafee budget--or \nChafee-Breaux budget, as it is called--and the Republican budget. You \nwill see that two out of three of these budgets believe in this \namendment, believe strongly in this amendment. I hope those who support \nboth the Democratic proposal and the Chafee-Breaux budget proposal will \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Does the distinguished Senator from California yield back \nthe remainder of her time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend is going to speak and wishes to debate this, \nI have no need to take any amount of time other than to rebut, perhaps, \nsome of his comments if I feel I need to do so. It is not my intention \nto prolong this debate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from California for a number of reasons. Fundamentally, this \nparticular amendment results in more taxation and more spending. The \ncase I would like to lay out is that that increased taxation and \nincreased spending is unnecessary. It is unnecessary.\n  Let me say at the outset, we have heard a lot from people who care \nvery much about this Medicaid Program. The Medicaid Program is \nsomething that I, too, care very much about. I have worked with Members \non both sides of the aisle to guarantee that we preserve what is a very \ngood program that has served millions of people, both today and over \ntime.\n  My role as a public servant, as a U.S. Senator, is one hat that I \nwear, but in addition to that perspective, I wear the hat of a \nphysician who has taken care of the very people that we have heard \ntalked about tonight. It hurts me when people use words like ``walk \naway from children.'' I have dedicated my entire adult life to helping \nchildren, one on one, as a physician, and to have words like that used \non either side of the aisle hurts a great deal.\n  About 35 percent of the patients I have treated over the last 18 \nyears of my life are Medicaid recipients. Night after night I have sat \nat the bedside of children, of mothers, of fathers, of people who have \nbenefited from a program that served as a very important safety net for \npeople who otherwise might not have access to care. It is to those \npeople I say, to hear this accusation, it is not medagoguery, but it is \nclose, when we have these accusations of walking away. Again, I am not \nsure it is intended that way, but the fact we are talking about the \ncase of individuals, of children, with accusations elevated to that \npolitical--rhetorical, I think--level hurts.\n\n  When we heard here words about cut, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts used cut again and again and again, and that is \nassociated\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nwith the comments made about walking away from children and the \namputation of programs--the growth rate in our proposal is 6.5 percent \nnext year, the year after that, and the year after that--6.5 percent \nannual growth rate. That means an increase, not a cut, year after year \nover the next 6 years.\n  I think, finally, the public at large understands this is not a cut. \nIt was President Clinton who, 3 years ago, in 1993, in an AARP meeting \nout on the west coast, said what we need to do for this program, \nMedicaid, is slow the growth from about 10 to 11 percent down to two \ntimes inflation. That is what we have done. A program that gives \nflexibility to States, that covers the people who need to be covered--\nand I will come to that shortly--we have slowed the growth to exactly \nwhat the President said 3 years ago, down to more than two times the \nrate of inflation. Anybody who has taken time to read what we proposed, \nit is 6.5 percent growth, year after year.\n  The President's plan is 7.1 percent. I guess we can debate whether it \nshould be 7.1 or 6.5, but to say we are walking away from children and \nwe are cutting or amputating programs, it is not true and the American \npeople are going to see through that.\n  I do want to restate the ideas behind the Medicaid reforms and the \nquestion I was going to ask earlier of my colleague from Florida, \nbecause he kept saying this is a block grant to the States. It is not a \nblock grant. It is not even close to a block grant.\n  No. 2, he talked about the dissolution, what is no longer a joint \nFederal-State partnership. It is just not true. It is not true. If you \nread what our assumptions are in the concurrent budget resolution, it \nis real simple. It basically says the committee's recommendation \nassumes implementation of a bipartisan--bipartisan--Medicaid reform \nplan approved by 48 Governors in early February. It was the unanimous \nconsent of 48 Governors, who put together the plan, which is the basis, \nthe foundation for the assumptions which resulted in our proposal.\n\n  It is important to say that, because the second half of the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from California lists six principles. Let me \nsay at the outset that I agree with most all of those principles. I \nthink that is important. I do not agree we have to increase spending by \n$18 billion to accomplish that, and I will come back to it.\n  But let me say what our plan--the assumptions in the 48 Governors' \nunanimous consent bipartisan plan which is the foundation, the verbatim \nfoundation for our proposal--does. It is not a cut, it is an increase. \nI have said that. It is not a block grant, it is a Federal-State \npartnership.\n  It is not walking away from children. We cover the same populations, \nand I will come back to that. We guarantee coverage in this plan of \nlow-income children who I have taken care of; and of pregnant women who \nI have taken care of in the past; and of the senior citizens who I have \ntaken care of; and the individuals with disabilities for whom I am an \nadvocate. We guarantee coverage. Period.\n  No. 2, we maintain the Medicaid Program as a matching program. \nMatching, that means Federal and that means State; a partnership; hand \nin hand; money comes from both. It is not a block grant to the States.\n  No. 3, we continue the Federal minimum standards for nursing homes, \nwhich were brought out in the principles of my colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  No. 4, we continue Federal rules that prevent wives or husbands from \nbeing required to impoverish themselves just to keep and obtain \nMedicaid benefits for their spouses, requiring nursing home care. We \ncontinue those Federal rules. Period.\n  No. 5, we provide coverage of Medicare premiums and cost sharing \npayments for low-income seniors consistent with the unanimous 48 \nGovernors'--at the National Governors Association--Medicaid policy. \nThat is what we do. Let us strip away the rhetoric.\n  The fundamental problem with Medicaid, because we do have a problem \nwith the program that does serve over 30 million people--we do have a \nproblem. Let us step away and look at the numbers, because we have the \nbudget. We have the assumptions I just talked about, but let us go back \nto the numbers for one second.\n  The problem: Federal spending on Medicaid has doubled over the last 5 \nyears; $90 billion in 1995. It is 20 percent of the State budget. That \nmeans if you are a Governor today, anywhere from 18 to as high as 23 \npercent of all the money in your budget is going to Medicaid. You can \nsay, ``Should it be 20 percent? Should it be 15 percent? Should it be \n25 percent?'' None of us can really answer that question. But what we \ndo know, if you have 20 percent of your budget and the other 80 percent \nis being spent on crime and the environment and education and roads and \npolice, that if you let that 20 percent grow to 25 percent or 30 \npercent or 35 percent, what suffers? Education, environment, crime, \npolice, roads.\n\n  So at some point, the Governors have to sit back and say, ``We have \nto do something about a program that is one-fifth of our budget that is \nskyrocketing year after year at the Federal level,'' and by definition \nat the State level, is doubling at least every 5 years. If you do not, \nschools are going to get even worse, our environmental protection is \ngoing to get worse, there are going to be fewer police on the streets.\n  So we have a problem. We all know it is a problem. We are all trying \nto work together, in a bipartisan way--at least the Governors are, 48 \nof them--in addressing that problem.\n  This is why you do not have to raise taxes $18 billion in this \namendment that has been put on the table. You do not have to. Excessive \nregulation results in waste.\n  What has happened over the last 30 years in this program is that with \nour good intentions in this body, Washington, DC, inside the beltway, \nwe want to help people. How do we do that? We do that by coming to this \nfloor and passing a layer of regulations, and the next year, another \nlayer of regulations put on that, and then another layer of \nregulations, to where you get to 1996 and you have a program with \n50,000 regulations telling you how to spend a health care dollar, which \nis the taxpayers' dollar, in taking care of that child who I had to do \na transplant on or do a heart operation on back at Vanderbilt Medical \nCenter where I was 3 years ago before I came here.\n  That taxpayer dollar gets eaten up, literally eaten up by the time it \ngets down to the doctor-patient relationship, and that is the problem \nwe have. It is excessive regulation and waste.\n  Somebody else has realized that. It is not just us. Governor Bill \nClinton, before the House Government Operations Committee, December 8, \n1990, I think said it much better than I can. He has been at this a lot \nlonger than I have. He knows how to say things, I think, pretty well. \nHe used the right words:\n\n       Medicaid used to be a program with a lot of options and few \n     mandates.\n\n  We are the ones who do the mandates.\n\n       Now it's just the opposite.\n\n  Let us face the facts. He had it right back in 1990, and in this \nproposal we have today, we have it right. It is not perfect, but it is \na lot better than what we have today.\n  Why do we have to spend another $18 billion, increase spending $18 \nbillion, increase taxes $18 billion, which is what this amendment \nimplies we have to do? Our contention, and the contention of the \nGovernors, is that if you strip away the regulations, if you strip away \nthe requirements of dictating that doctor-patient relationship, what \ngoes on, eligibility, out of Washington, DC, if you strip away those \n50,000 regulations and you give much of that responsibility back to \nStates and give them the flexibility to run their programs, you can \nsave money.\n  You do not have to cut, you can still allow Medicaid to grow over 6 \npercent, over twice inflation, which is what we do, but you do not have \nto let it grow at 15 to 17 percent a year.\n  Let me turn to this one chart just to show you. Tennessee--and we \nhave had discussions on both sides of the aisle of what are called \n1115(a) waivers. It is hard to get these 1115(a) waivers. I can tell \nyou, before I came to this Senate, I went through that process with \nTennessee and it ain't easy.\n  The 1115(a) waiver says, in essence, we will let you, as a State, run \na program how you see best; we will give you the flexibility, instead \nof mandating how you run it out of Washington, DC, and let us see what \nyou do.\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\n  Tennessee applied for a waiver, received that waiver and let me just \nshow you--it is not a perfect program, and I am not going to be here \ndefending everything about the program--but let me show you just the \ndollars and cents of what can be done if you give those Governors the \nresponsibility, let them design an appropriate program over time.\n  This is the Medicaid expenditure growth in the State of Tennessee. \nThis starts in fiscal year 1986, 1987, continues to 1992, 1993, and \n1994. The yellow bars are the percentage change in increased \nexpenditures in a State, the overall program, joint State and Federal \nmatch.\n  You can see in fiscal year 1986, the Medicaid Program in Tennessee \nwas growing at 21 percent, and it has happened in all of our States at \nvarying levels. In 1987, it grew at 16 percent; in 1988, it grew at 21 \npercent; in 1989, a pretty good year, it grew at 14 percent; it grew at \n20 percent; 20 percent; 1993, 13 percent; 1992, 34 percent.\n  Think, if you are a Governor and have a program growing on average \nabout 20 percent, which is this red line, each and every year and you \nhave your budget, 20 percent a year, that part of your budget is \ngrowing, all of a sudden, you have to start saying, I can't spend as \nmuch on education, I can't spend as much on fighting crime, on putting \npolice on the streets, because we're growing at 20 percent per year.\n  In Tennessee, for the same amount of money being spent, both at the \nState and Federal level, by having these 50,000 regulations stripped \naway, growth in 1994 was right at 1 percent --1 percent. That overall \nbudget about $2.5 billion did not grow over the course of 1 year. That \nshows what can be done. It can be done if you give States that \nflexibility.\n  That is why I oppose this amendment. You do not have to charge it; \n$18 billion more in increased taxes and increased spending.\n  Let me go back to one other chart just to demonstrate what that \nactually means. Again, we are talking dollars right now. I am coming \nback to the eligibility.\n  This is TennCare in yellow. This is Medicaid in red, which is what \nwould have been projected if we had to still live under the Federal \nregulations in the State of Tennessee, which other States have to live \nunder. This is in 1994 when the program started. If you look over time \nwith TennCare, you can see that cost and expenditures are controlled, \nincreasing, ironically, at a rate of about 6.5 percent a year in the \nState of Tennessee.\n  Look what it would have increased to if we had to live under those \nexcessive, burdensome regulations. President Clinton said it best back \nin 1990.\n  Someone might say, Well, I bet you did it in Tennessee by not \ncovering as many people. You are not doing as good a job. In some way \nyou are cutting back on benefits and cutting back on services. The \nbeauty is we do not have to let taxes grow, and at 20 percent of \nexpenditures. In 1993, 89 percent of the population was covered. This \nis not very good. This is, of the entire population, 89 percent of all \nTennesseans were covered.\n  By giving States the right to look at their own programs, strip away \ntheir regulations, for the same amount of money, for the same amount of \nmoney for controlled growth, we were able to cover 94 percent of the \npopulation. It is ironic; 89 percent was probably in the lower 10 or 15 \nof all States of people covered.\n  In 1994, Tennessee was the No. 1 State in the country in terms of \nnumbers of people covered. Why? Because we were able to cover more \npeople for the same amount of money by stripping away these excessive \nGovernment regulations. What? This proposal? We heard a lot of things. \nA lot of it has been rhetoric.\n  What is actually in our proposal? I have said, we are going to \nincrease Medicaid spending more than two times inflation, at a rate of \nan average annual growth of 6.5 percent. Is that a cut? That is not a \ncut. We are going to spend, in fact, $54 billion more than in last \nyear's budget resolution.\n  So we have moved from the resolution last year. The President's plan, \nas I said, is 7.1 percent growth. The big thing, I think, is that all \nof our assumptions, all of our savings, are based on the Governors' \nMedicaid proposal. I think this was missed in all of the earlier \ncomments when we talked about block grants, we talked about no nursing \nhome standards, we talked about lack of eligibility.\n\n  Let me just tell you what the Governors' Medicaid proposal says.\n  Restructuring Medicaid. These are our assumptions.\n  Eligibility. It is guaranteed for pregnant women up to 133 percent of \npoverty. It is guaranteed for children to age 6 to 133 percent of \npoverty; age 6 through 12 to 100 percent of poverty. It is guaranteed \nfor the elderly who meet SSI income and resource standards. It is \nguaranteed for individuals with disabilities.\n  Benefits. The following benefits are spelled out by the National \nGovernors' Association recommendation, which was accepted. We based all \nour assumptions on adopting this plan. The benefits remain guaranteed \nfor in-patient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, \nprenatal care, nursing facility services, home health care, family \nplanning services and supplies, laboratory and x-ray services, \npediatric and family nurse practitioner services, nurse midwife \nservices, and early and periodic screening and diagnosis treatment \nservices.\n  Nursing home reforms. Again, let me say that in terms of the \nprinciples outlined in the amendment under discussion, I agree with \nmany of those principles.\n  Nursing home reforms. What is in the Governors' plan which is our \nplan? States will abide by the OBRA '87 standards for nursing homes. \nStates will have the flexibility to determine enforcement strategies \nfor nursing home standards and will include them in their State plans.\n  Financing. We heard this statement that this was a block grant to the \nStates. Each State will have a maximum Federal allocation that provides \nthe State with the Federal capacity to cover Medicaid enrollees. The \nmatch will continue.\n  We also have in that plan an insurance umbrella. The insurance \numbrella is designed to ensure that States will get access to \nadditional funds for certain populations if, because of unanticipated \nconsequences, the growth factor fails to accurately estimate the growth \nin the populations. Funds are guaranteed on a per beneficiary basis for \nthose described below who are not included in the estimates of their \nbase and their group.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. I have made the \npoint that we do not need to spend and tax $18 billion or more to \naccomplish the goals that are laid out. I have shown, in fact, how one \nState required zero percent growth, not 10, 15, 20 percent growth, and \nwas able to treat, was able to cover more individuals. We do not need \nto tax more and we do not need to spend more.\n\n  We heard of the amputation of programs. We heard of walking away from \nchildren. I do hope we can stay away from that rhetoric because I, as a \nphysician--I am a Senator for awhile, but basically I am a physician. I \nhave taken an oath, and I have lived my life in the service of \nindividuals, again, with about a third of that population being \nMedicaid recipients.\n  I want it there. I understand the value of it to be there. I \nunderstand the importance of this program and feel that I, in a \nbipartisan way, with 48 Governors who put their proposal on the table, \ncan achieve the goals that we all want, and that is to provide a safety \nnet for this population, for all three populations who need Medicaid \nover time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not intend to take a great deal of time at all, but \nI just want to make certain points in response to my friend from \nTennessee.\n  He said it hurt him to hear Senators on this side--and I guess he was \nquoting me--say their budget, the Republican budget, is walking away \nfrom children and poor seniors. When I made that remark, I said \nspecifically, I know no one intends that to be the case. I just happen \nto believe it is the case. I do not think anyone intends to hurt a \nchild. To hurt a child with spina bifida, to hurt a child in a \nwheelchair, to hurt a senior citizen who depends on others in nursing \nhomes--no one would ever want to hurt those people.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n  I just happen to believe that is the outcome. I am not alone in this. \nI am not alone in this. I am going to talk a little bit about who on \nthe Republican side of the aisle would like to add even more back than \nSenators Graham, Kennedy, Dorgan, and I are adding back.\n  So when I say I think this Republican budget, in terms of its \nMedicare cuts--I call them excessive cuts--walks away from kids, I do \nnot mean it to hurt any Senators. I am saying it because I think in \npragmatic terms it is going to hurt kids and people who are quite \nvulnerable.\n  I heard the Senator say that he is proud of the Governors and that \nthey decided they would cover children and they would cover the seniors \nwho are disabled and they would cover pregnant women. I am very glad \nthat they want to. But I would have to take it another step. If the \nSenator believes it so important to cover pregnant women, if the \nSenator believes it is so important to cover the disabled and the \nseniors in nursing homes, then why do we not do it as Americans, as a \nnational Government, and not leave it up to 50 States? Because, let me \nsay this, States can say one thing today. They could be hit with a \nnatural disaster tomorrow, and simply not have the wherewithal to do \nthe job.\n  You know, when States want to get block grant funding, they may say \none thing, and a few years later, change their mind. Why does the \nSenator think we have Federal nursing home standards? It is simply \nbecause the States set the standard, and there was scandal after \nscandal after scandal. And there were hearings.\n  I do not know what condition the Senator's State was in, but I can \ntell you in my home State, there were scandals. Seniors were scalded in \nbath tubs and were drugged. I know the Senator from Oregon, who has \nbeen a champion for senior citizens, knows about those stories. We saw \nspouses becoming impoverished. We saw adult children of those nursing \nhome residents becoming impoverished. We worked hard over in the House, \nhe and I, with Henry Waxman--and I remember it well--and Barbara \nMikulski over here on this side. We said never again will that happen.\n\n  Now the Senator from Tennessee says, is it not great that Governors \ncare. I believe that Governors care. But so do I. I happen to be a U.S. \nSenator. He happens to be a U.S. Senator. We have a chance in the U.S. \nSenate to say it is important to have Federal nursing home standards \nand enforcement.\n  I also would like to say this. My friend says this is a very \nexpensive proposal, $18 billion. Does he know that Breaux-Chafee, a \nbipartisan proposal in this U.S. Senate, adds $31 billion more to the \nRepublican budget? Does he think those people are spendthrifts? Does he \nthink Senator Bennett, Senator Bond, Senator Brown, Senator Chafee, \nSenator Cohen, Senator Gorton, Senator Jeffords, Senator Specter, \nSenator Simpson, Senator Snowe, his colleagues on the Republican side \nof the aisle are spendthrifts and do not care about fiscal \nresponsibility? I am sure that he agrees with me that they do care. Yet \nthey are going to be $31 billion over the Republican budget.\n  In conclusion, I say this: This is not about rhetoric. This is about \nadding back $18 billion, when Breaux-Chafee with all these Republican \nSenators want to spend $31 billion more in that same time period.\n  My friend talks about bipartisanship. My goodness, our amendment is \nless than their budget in terms of Medicaid. Clearly, there are three \nproposals out here dealing with Medicaid: The Republican proposal, the \nDemocratic proposal, and Breaux-Chafee. The one, in my opinion, that \nhurts children, and I do not mean to hurt the Senator when I say this, \nI just think it is a result of his priority, that hurts seniors, that \nhurts the disabled, happens to be the Republican budget. That is why I \nhope we can join hands together, all of us, and support this amendment.\n  I know the hour is late and I thank my colleague from Florida, my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, my colleague from Oregon for his \npatience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I disagree on the \nclosing that this proposal hurts children. It is a statement, but there \nis no data, evidence, or suggestion given that it hurts children. I \nsaid eligibility covered children to age 6 through 12 to 100 percent of \npoverty. This is a National Governors' assumption, proposals.\n  I guess we could say it hurts children, but there is no evidence and \nno data that it hurts children. I see nothing, having taken care of \nchildren with my hands in a Medicaid Program, I see nothing, nothing, \nin this proposal that hurts children. Walk away from kids, hurting \nchildren--I guess we will just disagree on that.\n  The Senator from California did strike--I think, again, this is a \ndifference we will not agree upon, but when she has argued that it \ntakes a national program, a National Government, to be able to protect \nchildren----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  I said national standards, not a national program. I said national \nstandards.\n  Mr. FRIST. If the statement was national standards, let me just say \nthat the standards in the Governors' proposal are basically standards \nthat will be carried out by every State. That is part of the \nassumption. If it is just national standards, we are OK.\n  My feeling was at a national level it took us to best decide how to \ntake care of people in Tennessee or in Washington State or in Alabama \nor Mississippi. That is a fundamental difference, I believe. I think \nthe more we can do at the State level and at the local level, the \nbetter. That is where accountability will rest.\n  I argue strongly that this body, Washington Government, Washington, \nDC, is not the body that can best cover children or protect children or \nprevent people from hurting children. I argue it is the people closest \nto home, that it is the Governors, it is the local governments that can \nbest watch after our children. That is a fundamental difference.\n  Third, on the Chafee-Breaux, Breaux-Chafee proposal, we have not had \nthat presented yet. I do not know what the dollar figures will be. \nThere are some assumptions that it might be that reform is delayed a \nyear. I have heard that mentioned in these particular proposals. I \ncannot comment. I do not know the fact that they spend more makes it a \nbetter program. I argue that increasing at 6 percent a year based on \nwhat we have seen in at least one State, in Tennessee, we can \naccomplish all of our goals without this radical increase in taxation, \nmore taxation and more spending.\n  Last, we will come back to the word ``bipartisan.'' I have already \nmentioned from where we were in the budget resolution last year, we \nhave shifted $54 billion already. I will say what we have endorsed is a \nbipartisan plan that Governors together came and endorsed. That is 100 \npercent of the assumptions we put in our budget. That is bipartisan. We \nhave endorsed that. That is the basis of our assumptions.\n  With that, I hope when we do vote on this amendment, again, agreeing \nwith many of those principles laid out, but arguing that many, if not \nmost of those proposals are spelled out in this very document which we \nhave endorsed, that we do not need that increased spending. It is \nunnecessary.\n  Mr. President, could I ask my colleague from California if she is \nwilling to yield back her time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield back all my time on this. I assume, I \nsay to my friend, that we will be voting on this amendment on Tuesday. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand it will be stacked on Tuesday.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also ask unanimous consent that each side be allowed 1 \nminute before the vote to explain the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside so the Senator from Oregon can offer an amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield back all my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3984\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 3984.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Corporations and individuals have clear responsibility \n     to adhere to environmental laws. When they do not, and \n     environmental damage results, the federal and state \n     governments may impose fines and penalties, and assess \n     polluters for the cost of remediation.\n       (2) Assessment of these costs is important in the \n     enforcement process. They appropriately penalize wrongdoing. \n     They discourage future environmental damage. They ensure that \n     taxpayers do not bear the financial brunt of cleaning up \n     after damages done by polluters.\n       (3) In the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in \n     Prince William Sound, Alaska, for example, the corporate \n     settlement with the federal government totaled $900 million.\n       (4) The tax code, however, currently allows polluters to \n     fully deduct all expenses, including penalties and fines \n     associated with these settlements. In the case of the Exxon \n     Valdez disaster, deductibility on that settlement at the \n     current corporate tax rate will result in $300 million in \n     losses to federal tax collections . . . losses which will \n     have to be made up through increased collections from \n     taxation of average American families.\n       (5) Additionally, these losses also will make it more \n     difficult to move aggressively and successfully toward a \n     balanced federal budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--assumptions in this resolution assume that revenues \n     will be increased by a minimum of $100 million per year \n     through legislation that will not allow deductions for fines, \n     penalties and damages arising from a failure to comply with \n     federal or state environmental or health protection laws.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment which I offer tonight with \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts would put the U.S. Senate on record as \nsaying that it is time to end tax writeoffs under our Tax Code for \npolluters.\n  We know our country wants the Senate to get serious about balancing \nthe budget. I know this has been a slow moving exercise in the past. \nThey want a serious sprint to balancing the budget. I believe it is \npossible to make real progress in balancing the budget. I said in my \ncampaign that I believe you can balance the budget, just the way Oregon \nfamilies have to balance their budget.\n  Under the proposal that I offer tonight, if it had been law over the \nlast 6 years, about $500 million would have gone to reducing the \ndeficit simply by ending tax writeoffs for those who pollute in our \ncountry.\n  What happens today, even though we want a polluter-pay philosophy \nwith respect to environmental protection, what we do is under the tax \nlaw provide a Macy's basement discount for those who actually have to \npay penalties.\n  So what I am proposing tonight with Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, \nis basic tax fairness. Under our amendment, no longer would average \nworking families pay more on their taxes just because the polluter has \nreceived a writeoff on their tax return. What we propose is to put the \nSenate on record that all revenues collected, when you have the kind of \ncurrent tax treatment for these penalties, would go back to the \nTreasury. It would not go into the pockets of the polluter.\n  Let me talk, for a moment, about the way it works today under our tax \nlaws. If you have a polluter who violates the Safe Drinking Water Act, \na statute that assures that the water our kids drink is safe, they then \nhave to pay a penalty. But under the Federal tax laws, they get a tax \nbreak for that penalty that they would be paying.\n  The Clean Air Act assures that the air our families breathe is pure. \nBut if a polluter violates it and pays a penalty, they get another tax \nbreak when they violate that important environmental law.\n  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act protects our communities \nagainst hazardous waste. When a polluter violates that statute, they \nhave to pay a penalty under the law, but they get a tax break under the \nTax Code when they do so.\n  The CERCLA Act is the one designed to clean up our Nation's Superfund \nsites, some of the most hazardous and dangerous waste in our country. \nWhen a polluter violates those laws, they pay penalties, and, again, \nget tax writeoffs.\n  The Oil Pollution Act is a particularly important example of why this \nchange Senator Kerry and I propose tonight is needed. The Oil Pollution \nAct seeks to guard against devastating oil spills like the Exxon \nValdez. In the case of the Exxon Valdez disaster in Prince William \nSound, the polluter agreed to a settlement of approximately $900 \nmillion. The defendant in that case took an immediate $150 million tax \ndeduction. Over the course of that 10-year payout on that particular \nsettlement, you have a polluter that is going to be able to write off \nnearly $300 million of the total cost.\n  Now, some are going to argue that it makes sense to provide a tax \ndeduction as an incentive for polluters to somehow settle these damage \nsuits. I argue that the knowledge that these polluters are going to pay \nthe full freight of their damage is a lot more than incentive for them \nto comply with the environmental laws and get serious about cleanup. I \ndo not think it provides any real incentive if you allow people to \nwrite off on their taxes when they violate the environmental laws and \nhave to pay penalties. I think it erodes the fairness of the Tax Code \nwhen you provide almost unlimited deductibility arrangements for the \npolluters, where they get a discount of everything they pay up to 34 \npercent.\n\n  Now, the fact is, Mr. President, that all of the major environmental \norganizations are in support of this particular amendment. They have \nsaid this is one of their priorities with respect to the environment \nand this budget resolution.\n  Every Member of this body who cares about tax fairness ought to \nsupport this amendment. I do not see how a Member can go and stand up \nat a community meeting, a town hall meeting in their own home State, \nand justify, at a time when we are seeing pressure for deficit \nreduction and many valuable programs cut, allowing a tax writeoff of up \nto 34 percent when you have somebody violating environmental laws and \npaying a penalty as a result.\n  So, Mr. President, if the manager for the majority is prepared to \nyield back time on the amendment, I am prepared to yield back time, as \nwell. Let me see what the desire of the majority is.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield back my time, as well.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5177-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Jeremy Boorda showed an incredible dedication to \nserving his country. After joining the Navy at the age of 17, Jeremy \nBoorda became the first enlisted man to rise through the enlisted ranks \nto become the Navy's top uniformed officer. His outstanding record of \nservice and achievement should be remembered by all of those who are \ncalled on to defend their nation and will stand as an outstanding \nexample of how a man through dedication and sacrifice can achieve great \nthings. My wife and I had the pleasure of knowing the admiral and I \nsend my condolences to his wife Bettie and their four children in this \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5186-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5186-S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ADM. MIKE BOORDA\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life of \nAdmiral Mike Boorda. He was one of our Nation's finest military \nofficers. He was also a friend, whose counsel and advice I often \nsought--and always respected. I send my deepest sympathy to his wife \nBettie and their children. They are in my prayers.\n  One of my strongest memories of Admiral Boorda is from my visit to \nBosnia. The admiral was called away from dinner because of the terrible \nbombing of the market place in Sarajevo. I went with him to the \noperations\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\ncenter where he monitored intelligence reports and oversaw the American \nresponse. I was so impressed with his courage and professionalism. I \nsaw first hand that our Navy was in good hands.\n  Admiral Boorda was the first sailor to rise through the ranks from \nenlisted sailor to four star admiral. Going from seaman to Chief of \nNaval Operations was an extraordinary accomplishment that served as an \ninspiration for young sailors in the fleet.\n  He learned a lot along the way. He cared about the welfare of every \nman and woman in our Armed Forces and he cared deeply about the United \nStates Navy.\n  We have all heard stories about how he cut through redtape to help \nimprove the lives of individual sailors. I remember one story in \nparticular. A young sailor said he needed to be reassigned so that his \nchild could receive proper medical care. Admiral Boorda saw that it was \ndone immediately.\n  He also cared deeply about the honor and integrity of the United \nStates Navy. Perhaps more than anyone else, he helped the Navy to \nchange--to provide real opportunity and dignity for women and \nminorities. I worked closely with him after the Tailhook scandal shook \nthe Navy. He made sure that there wasn't a whitewash or a witch hunt. \nHe displayed the kind of honor that is a model for all of us.\n  Admiral Boorda's death is a tragedy. But his life was a triumph. His \ncontributions to our Nation will live on forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5186-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BUDDY ZAIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all know the adage, that one is never \ntoo old to learn. I would like to call attention to a very special \nVermonter, Buddy Zais, who embodies this truism.\n  Last Saturday, May 11, Buddy was one of the 203 students to graduate \nfrom Trinity College of Vermont. What makes Buddy stand out in this \ncrowd is that he is receiving his bachelor of arts degree in philosophy \n63 years after attending his first year of college at Boston \nUniversity.\n  At the age of 80 years old, Buddy is the oldest person ever to \ngraduate from Trinity College. In true form, Buddy graduated with magna \ncum laude honors. Now that he has his bachelors degree behind him, he \nis looking ahead to the next challenge he will undertake. I wish Buddy \nmuch luck in his next endeavor. I've been his friend for over 30 years \nand I'm so proud of him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Burlington Free \nPress celebrating Buddy's graduation be printed in the Record.\n  On a final note, I must add that it comes as no surprise to me that \nSister Janice Ryan, the president of Trinity College of Vermont, was \none of the forces behind getting Buddy started back on his degree. \nSister Janice has been a good friend for many years. Buddy and I know \nonly too well that once she sets her sights on something she makes sure \nit happens.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 12, 1996]\n\n                   One Trinity Grad Magna Cum Lately\n\n                            (By Tamara Lush)\n\n       It took starting a business, raising a family and the death \n     of his wife before Bernard ``Buddy'' Zais decided to return \n     to college.\n       Now, after 63 years, Zais has finally gotten his college \n     degree.\n       The 80-year-old Zais was one of 203 Trinity College \n     graduates Saturday at the school's 71st commencement \n     ceremony. Zais received his bachelor of arts degree in \n     philosophy, and after the ceremony, had a few wise words of \n     his own.\n       ``I figured before I check out, I ought to have a college \n     degree,'' said Zais, pausing to hug other graduates old \n     enough to be his great-grandchildren.\n       As Zais--the oldest person to graduate from Trinity--was \n     handed his diploma, he received a standing ovation from the \n     hundreds of people who attended the ceremony at the Patrick \n     Gymnasium.\n       Zais said he was prodded into going back to school by \n     Trinity College President Sister Janice Ryan, who marked her \n     final commencement speech Saturday, following 17 years as the \n     college's top administrator. Ryan is stepping down from her \n     post this summer.\n       Shortly after his wife Mary died in 1992, Ryan asked Zais \n     how he and his family were doing. Zais reported his two \n     grandchildren had just gotten their college degrees. ``That \n     means that all three of my grandchildren, and my two \n     children, and Mary, had a degree, and I was the only one in \n     the family without one,'' he said.\n       So Ryan asked Zais to apply to the school, and even had an \n     admissions counselor contact him.\n       Zais, who formed a company called Health Insurance of \n     Vermont and had been an insurance agent his entire working \n     life, decided to study philosophy with a concentration on the \n     Greek philosophers.\n       He received credit for the one year he had gone to \n     college--in 1933, he went to Boston University and studied \n     journalism.\n       Going back to school and spending time with young people \n     was one of Zais' best life experiences. ``It was the most \n     satisfying, gratifying experience of my life, other than \n     raising my family,'' he said. ``It was much important than my \n     business life, much more important than selling insurance.''\n       And Zais, who graduate magna cum laude, isn't going to stop \n     at one degree.\n       He is considering attending school for his master's and \n     possibly his doctorate in philosophy. To do that, he said, he \n     might have to go out of state because no Vermont school \n     offers those degrees in philosophy. ``I'll have to go to \n     Albany, Boston or McGill University,'' he said. ``Will I do \n     it? Probably.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5187-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5187-S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FDR MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, thousands of people come to Washington, DC, \neach year to learn about the history of our country and the legacy left \nto us by the great men and women that have built the strongest, most \npowerful nation the world has ever known--the United States of America.\n  Our country's finest hours have been ones where prejudice and \ndiscrimination have been acknowledged and addressed. The key to our \novercoming and addressing discrimination has been education and \nunderstanding.\n  The most recent debate over the FDR Memorial is an opportunity for \nour country to once again beat back discrimination. Discrimination is \nnot always blatant. Discrimination also includes exclusion.\n  I strongly believe that portraying FDR in a wheelchair in one of the \nthree statues that are being built as part of the memorial would be an \nincredibly powerful statement to all who visit this tribute to a great, \nvibrant, forceful leader. The fact that FDR had polio and spent most of \nhis waking hours as President working in his wheelchair does not change \nany of these truths. In fact, FDR's disability was a great source of \nhis strength.\n  A main tenet of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was to \nensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing \nthe standards established in the act on behalf of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  In this effort, I hope that the FDR Memorial Commission will depict \nPresident Roosevelt as he was--a great, courageous man who had polio \nand still led our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New York Times and \na letter from eight of FDR's grandchildren to Michael Deland and Alan \nReich of the National Organization on Disability be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 12, 1996]\n\n                         The Airbrush of Power\n\n       Most Americans are aware, if sometimes vaguely, that \n     Franklin Roosevelt was stricken by polio in 1921 and was \n     unable thereafter to stand unassisted. Yet there will be no \n     visual reminder of this fact in the F.D.R. memorial due to be \n     dedicated in Washington next spring. On the contrary, he is \n     to be shown standing tall in one of three sculptures planned \n     for the seven-acre site on the banks of the Potomac.\n       This fiction, however benign, is being protested by the \n     National Organization on Disability, whose chairman, Michael \n     Deland, urges that at least one bronze image depict F.D.R. as \n     he often was, in a wheelchair. Logic and sentiment support \n     Mr. Deland. But alas, the leaden weight of tradition stands \n     all too squarely behind the memorial commission's penchant \n     for make-believe.\n       Through the ages, rulers of every stripe, male and female, \n     have sought to improve upon or alter nature. The Egyptians \n     led the way. Ramses II was not content to show himself mowing \n     down adversaries in scores of battle friezes. His artists had \n     to depict him twice as big as everyone else. Going further, \n     Queen Hatshepsut, the first great female ruler known to \n     history, had herself replicated in stone with a false beard, \n     thus visually changing her sex.\n       Roman emperors and their wives were tidied up in marble and \n     bronze, their faces deftly nipped and tucked on imperial \n     coins. European rulers in the Middle Ages invoked theology to \n     justify the lies of art. Every monarch, it was said, is at \n     once mortal and incorporeal, so that in a higher realm all \n     were immune to the blemishes of the flesh.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n     On their death, an image was carved delineating their \n     idealized features.\n       We learn through written records, not portraits, of Richard \n     III's crookback and Henry VIII's terminal corpulence. In art, \n     Elizabeth I is always the same iconic virgin queen; in life, \n     she banish mirrors from her palaces as her hair thinned and \n     her cheeks hollowed. In the same spirit, Elizabeth II, who \n     has turned 70, has firmly resisted suggestions that she \n     permit an updating on coins of her youthful profile, as \n     Queen. Victoria did after her Jubilee in 1887.\n       By contrast, the Puritan regicide Oliver Cromwell is said \n     to have told the artist Lely: ``Flatter me not at all. But \n     remark all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything \n     as you see me. Otherwise I will not pay a farthing for it.'' \n     Yet this splendid story was printed long after Cromwell's \n     death and may be apocryphal, according to his biographer, \n     Anotonia Fraser. More characteristic was Winston Churchill's \n     response to an unflattering portrait by Graham Sutherland. he \n     hid it away, Dorian Gray fashion. Some years later his widow, \n     Clementine, apparently burned it.\n       Presidential portraits in the White House are a study in \n     illusionist brushwork. Richard Nixon resembles a scoutmaster, \n     Lyndon Johnson everybody's kindly uncle, and John Kennedy a \n     saintly matinee idol. Interestingly, a dark and gloomy \n     portrait of Lincoln is tucked from sight in the Lincoln \n     bedroom. It was painted in 1930 by Douglas Volk, whose \n     father, Leonard, once sculpted Lincoln from life. The son's \n     haunting portrait, or a copy of it, turns up in Oliver \n     Stone's film about Nixon, who at one point talks to the \n     painting.\n       Official art, in real life, rarely speaks truth to power. \n     It would indeed be refreshing, even liberating, for the \n     memorial to show F.D.R. as he was. According to Mr. Deland, \n     who uses a wheelchair himself, only two photographs are known \n     to survive showing Roosevelt in the same device. This is the \n     result of an unwritten protective rule among White House \n     photographers. Like the kings of old, and most sitting \n     politicians today, F.D.R. wanted his incorporeal self to \n     linger in posterity's memory.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Anne Roosevelt,\n\n                                                   April 29, 1996.\n       Dear Messrs. Deland and Reich, Franklin Delano Roosevelt \n     looms large in the hearts and minds of many, including his \n     grandchildren who now survive. Some of us knew him \n     personally, but most of us did not. We hold him in memory, as \n     families will, as a whole person whose life touched a nation \n     and whose affection still reaches us. We want him to be \n     remembered as he was, in all his strength, courage and \n     humanity.\n       It is quite clear that FDR developed his strength of \n     character, determination and discipline most distinctly as a \n     result of his having polio. He also became a more sympathetic \n     and modest person. He made a political decision to downplay \n     his disability because of his understanding of the role of \n     public perception and the norms of the day. At times he did \n     not.\n       But when it came to inspiring and encouraging others who \n     were disabled--such as at his beloved Warm Springs, Georgia, \n     or with amputees and wounded soldiers in wartime hospitals--\n     he freely showed himself in wheelchairs or on crutches, with \n     braces. He was in no way embarrassed by his disability. Life \n     was bigger than that.\n       Were he alive today we are convinced that he would wish to \n     have the people of this country and the world understand his \n     disability. He would be comfortable, possibly eager, in light \n     of current increased understanding of disability issues, to \n     share awareness of his and other types of disabilities and \n     others. We firmly believe that more factual knowledge, \n     particularly about and from public leaders, encourages and \n     inspires those without disability to accept and support all \n     people, including people with disabilities to live full, \n     productive and joyful lives.\n       FDR's commitment to leadership, to excellence and to life, \n     with a disability not well understood by many, nor accepted \n     by some, sustained him and the Nation through one of the most \n     challenging periods in American history. There is no better \n     memorial than a complete picture of who he was.\n       While we wish no delay in the construction of the proposed \n     memorial we urge an adequate inclusion of all facets of the \n     man as he was, not as some think he ought to have been.\n           Sincerely,\n         Anne Roosevelt, on behalf of Chandler Roosevelt Lindsley, \n           Christopher D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves, \n           Franklin Roosevelt III, Kate Roosevelt Whitney, Nina \n           Roosevelt Gibson, James Roosevelt, Esquire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5187-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, during National Nursing Home Week, May 12-\n18, we celebrate the more than 100,000 people in Massachusetts who live \nand work in our State's 590 nursing facilities.\n  Nursing facilities have become an integral part of our health care \ndelivery system, providing rehabilitative care for individuals who \nexpect to return home as well as long-term care for the chronically \nill. Currently, about a quarter of all Massachusetts residents 85 years \nof age and older need nursing facility care. Approximately half of \nthese individuals suffer from Alzheimer's disease. In addition, nursing \nfacilities also care for many younger people, including severely \ndisabled children, individuals who have suffered traumatic head \ninjuries, and those who depend on ventilators to live.\n  Nursing facilities also make an important contribution to the \nMassachusetts economy by providing jobs for more than 55,000 people and \nadding more than $2 billion to the local economy through wages and the \npurchase of goods and services.\n  As our population ages and nursing facilities assume an even more \nimportant role, it is critical that we maintain the quality of care \nprovided by these facilities. Recent proposals to dramatically reduce \nFederal Medicare and Medicaid spending would have a devastating impact \non elderly and disabled people in nursing facilities, 80 percent of \nwhom rely on these two programs to pay for their care. In addition, we \nmust maintain the protections contained in the 1987 nursing home reform \nlaw, which have helped nursing facilities to improve the quality of \nservices they provide to the Nation's 1.5 million nursing facility \nresidents.\n  National Nursing Home Week should mark a renewal of our commitment \nnot only to the 55,000 elders and disabled people who live in our \nState's nursing facilities, but also to the 55,000 nursing facility \nemployees who have dedicated their lives to caring for our most \nvulnerable citizens. In honor of this week, I salute all these \nemployees whose contributions are so important to the well-being of so \nmany in Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5188-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5188-S5189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REQUEST FOR REFERRAL OF S. 1718\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

This report is submitted pursuant to \nsection 204 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c). This report covers events through March 1, 1996. My \nlast report, dated November 28, 1995, covered events through September \n29, 1995.\n  1. Effective March 1, 1996, the Department of the Treasury's Office \nof Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') amended the Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 535 (``IACR''), to reflect changes in the \nstatus of litigation brought by Iran against close relatives of the \nformer Shah of Iran seeking the return of property alleged to belong to \nIran (61 Fed. Reg. 8216, March 4, 1996). In 1991, Shams Pahlavi, sister \nof the former Shah of Iran, was identified in section 535.217(b) of the \nIACR as a person whose assets were blocked based on proof of service \nupon her in litigation of the type described in section 535.217(a). \nPursuant to that provision, all property and assets located in the \nUnited States within the possession or control of Shams Pahlavi were \nblocked until all pertinent litigation against her was finally \nterminated. Because the litigation has been finally terminated, \nreference to Shams Pahlavi has been deleted from section 535.217(b). A \ncopy of the amendment is attached to this report.\n  2. The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, established at The Hague pursuant \nto the Algiers Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the \nclaims before it. Since my last report, the Tribunal has rendered one \naward, bringing the total number to 567. The majority of those awards \nhave been in favor of U.S. claimants. As of March 1996, the value of \nawards to successful U.S. claimants from the Security Account held by \nthe NV Settlement Bank was $2,376,010,041.91.\n  In February 1996, Iran deposited funds into the Security Account, \nestablished by the Algiers Accords to ensure payment of awards to \nsuccessful U.S. claimants for the first time since October 8, 1992. The \nAccount was credited $15 million on February 22, 1996. However, the \nAccount has remained continuously below the $500 million balance \nrequired by the Algiers Accords since November 5, 1992. As of March 1, \n1996, the total amount in the Security Account was $195,370,127.71, and \nthe total amount in the Interest Account was $37,055,050.92.\n  Therefore, the United States continues to pursue Case A/28, filed in \nSeptember 1993, to require Iran to meet its obligations under the \nAlgiers Accords to replenish the Security Account. Iran filed its \nStatement of Defense in that case on August 30, 1995. The United States \nfiled a Reply on December 4, 1995. Iran is scheduled to file its \nRejoinder on June 4, 1996.\n  3. The Department of State continues to present other United States \nGovernment claims against Iran and to respond to claims brought against \nthe United States by Iran, in coordination with concerned government \nagencies.\n  In November 1995, Iran filed its latest Response concerning the \nUnited States Request to Dismiss Certain Claims from Case B/61. The \nUnited States had filed its Request to Dismiss in August 1995 as part \nof its consolidated submission on the merits. Iran had previously filed \nits initial response in July 1995, and the United States filed a reply \nin August 1995. Case B/61 involves a claim by Iran for compensation \nwith respect to primarily military equipment that Iran alleges it did \nnot receive. Iran had sought to purchase or repair the equipment \npursuant to commercial contracts with more than 50 private American \ncompanies. Iran alleges that it suffered direct losses and \nconsequential damages in excess of $2 billion in total because of the \nUnited States Government refusal to allow the export of the equipment \nafter January 19, 1981, in alleged contravention of the Algiers \nAccords. Iran's November 1995 filing failed to show why the Tribunal \nshould not dismiss immediately certain duplicative or otherwise \nimproperly pleaded claims from Case B/61.\n\n  In December 1995, the Department of State represented the United \nStates in hearings before the Tribunal on two government-to-government \nclaims. In the first, Chamber Two heard oral arguments in Case B/36, \nthe U.S. claim against Iran for its failure to honor debt obligations \ncreated by the sale of military surplus property to Iran shortly after \nthe Second World War. In the second, also before Chamber Two, the \nDepartment of State presented the U.S. defense in Case B/58, Iran's \nclaim that the United States is liable for damage caused to the Iranian \nState Railways during the Second World War.\n  In January 1996, in Case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran filed its Rebuttal \nMemorial Concerning Responsibility for Termination Costs, along with 20 \nvolumes of exhibits and affidavits. In this briefing stream, the \nTribunal is asked to decide whether Iran or the United States is liable \nfor the costs arising from the termination of the U.S.-Iran Foreign \nMilitary Sales program after Iran's default and its subsequent seizure \nof the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979. The United States is currently \npreparing a comprehensive response to Iran's brief.\n  In February 1996, the Departments of State and Justice represented \nthe United States in a hearing before the full Tribunal in a \ngovernment-to-government claim filed by Iran. Case A/27 is an \ninterpretive dispute in which Iran claims that the United States is \nliable under the Algiers Accords for Tribunal awards issued in favor of \nIran against U.S. nationals. The United States maintains that its \nobligation under the Algiers Accords is satisfied by the availability \nof domestic judicial procedures through which Iran can enforce awards \nin its favor.\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\n  Also in February 1996, Iran and the United States settled Iran's \nclaims against the United States filed before the International Court \nof Justice concerning the July 3, 1988, downing of Iran Air 655 and \ncertain of Iran's claims against the United States filed before the \nIran-United States Tribunal concerning certain banking matters. The \ncases in question were dismissed from the International Court of \nJustice and the Iran-United States Tribunal on February 22, 1996. The \nsettlement, inter alia, fulfills President Reagan's 1988 offer to make \nex gratia payments to the survivors of the victims of the Iran Air \nshootdown. The survivors of each victim of the Iran Air shootdown will \nbe paid $300,000 (for wage-earning victims) or $150,000 (for non-wage-\nearning victims). For this purpose, $61 million was deposited with the \nUnion Bank of Switzerland in Zurich in an account jointly held by the \nNew York Federal Reserve Rank, acting as fiscal agent of the United \nStates, and Bank Markazi, the central bank of Iran. Of an additional \n$70 million in the settlement package, $15 million was deposited in the \nSecurity Account established as part of the Algiers Accords. The \nremaining $55 million was deposited in an account at the New York \nFederal Reserve Bank, from which funds can be drawn only (1) for \ndeposits into the Security Account used to pay Tribunal awards to \nAmerican claimants or for the payment of Iran's share of the operating \nexpenses of the Tribunal, or (2) to pay debts incurred before the date \nof settlement and owed by Iranian banks to U.S. nationals. Under the \nterms of the settlement, no money will be paid to the Government of \nIran.\n  4. Since my last report, the Tribunal has issued one important award \nin favor of a U.S. national considered a dual U.S.-Iranian national by \nthe Tribunal. On November 7, 1995, Chamber Three issued a significant \ndecision in Claim No. 213, Dadras Int'l and Per-Am Construction Corp. \nv. The Islamic Republic of Iran, awarding a dual national claimant $3.1 \nmillion plus interest for architectural work performed for an Iranian \ngovernment agency developing a housing complex outside Tehran, Iran.\n\n  The Tribunal held hearings in four large private claims. On October \n23-27, 1995, Chamber One held a hearing in Claim No. 432, Brown & Root, \nInc. v. The Iranian Navy, involving contract amounts owed in connection \nwith the construction of the Iranian Navy Chahbahar and Bandar Projects \nin Iran. On January 18-19, 1996, Chamber One held a second hearing in \nclaim Nos. 842, 843, and 844, Vera Aryeh, et al. v. The Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, in which allegations of fraud and forgery were \nconsidered. Finally, the United States Government filed a Memorial on \nthe Application of the Treaty of Amity to Dual United States-Iranian \nNationals in three private claims before the Tribunal: Claim No. 485, \nRiahi v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, in Chamber One on January 29, \n1996; Claim No. 953, Hakim v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, in Chamber \nTwo on February 27, 1996; and Claim No. 266, Aryeh, et al. v. The \nIslamic Republic of Iran, in Chamber Three on February 29, 1996. The \nMemorial argues that a good faith interpretation of the ordinary \nmeaning of the 1955 Treaty of Amity leads to the conclusion that it \nprotects all persons deemed to be U.S. nationals under U.S. laws when \nthey undertake activities in Iran, regardless of whether they also \npossess another nationality.\n  5. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an unusual challenge to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to \nplay an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in \nenabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. I \nshall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on \nsignificant developments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Utah School and Lands Improvement Act of \n1993 to provide for lands for the Goshute Indian Reservation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     the goshute indian reservation boundary adjustment act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to amend the 1993 \nUtah School and Lands Improvement Act, Public Law 103-93. The purpose \nof this legislation is to correct boundary problems on the Goshute \nIndian Reservation in Utah.\n  The Goshute Tribe is a federally recognized tribe whose reservation \nis located on the western border of Utah. Approximately one-half of the \nGoshute Reservation is in Utah, the other half is in Nevada. This \nlegislation would transfer about 8,000 acres of state land to the Tribe \nalong with about 400 acres of public land administered by the BLM.\n  The public law to be amended by this bill was enacted without \nopposition in 1993. This law transferred approximately 200,000 acres of \nUtah state lands to the federal government with the understanding that \nthe federal government would compensate the state in an amount equal to \nthe appraised value of the transferred land. When the law was passed, \nit was done so with the understanding that state lands located within \nthe reservation boundaries of both the Navajo and Goshute Tribes would \nbe transferred to the United States to be held in trust for the \nrespective tribes.\n  At that time, the Goshute tribe requested that the Utah delegation \naddress a boundary issue on the reservation. After some initial \nnegotiation, the Tribe agreed to withdraw their request to address the \nboundary issue, contingent upon a commitment that we would resolve the \nissue at a later date. Mr. President, I want to follow through on that \ncommitment now.\n  The ``southern boundary issue'' refers to a block of land which \nconsists of 8,000 acres in a very irregular shape. Because of the \nremoteness and the configuration of the tract of land, it is almost \nimpossible to properly manage and as a result, there have been several \ninstances of poaching and trespassing. This legislation seeks to create \na much clearer and more definitive boundary. The lands would be held in \ntrust by the Federal Government for the benefit of the Goshute Tribe, \nwhich with the help of the BIA will be able to regulate grazing and \nother uses in the area. The Tribe has agreed to be responsible for the \ncost of appraisal of the additional lands in the bill. This is quite a \ncommitment, given the limited resources of the Tribe. I appreciate \ntheir willingness to assume such a commitment.\n  The legislation is supported by the State of Utah, Juab County, and \nthe Board of Trustees of the School and Institutional Trust Lands \nAdministration. From what I understand, the Department of Interior does \nnot oppose the bill. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Utah Wilderness \nCoalition does not oppose it either. The Goshute Tribe has met at \nlength with representatives from this very vocal group and have \nobtained their support.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support me in this effort to \nassist the Goshute Tribe in creating a more manageable border to their \nreservation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1767. A bill to harmonize the application of the antitrust laws to \nprofessional sports, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                 the professional sports protection act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I like almost all Americans, am a fan of \nprofessional sports. We all enjoy following the competition on the \nfield and on the hardwood and watching the performances of our favorite \nplayers. Even as I make this statement today, my fingers are crossed \nfor the Utah Jazz in this evening's playoff game.\n\n  But professional sports is not just a game, it is a business, and it \nis the future of professional sports as a business that my bill, the \nProfessional Sports Protection Act, seeks to address. I am afraid that \nthe current rash of franchise relocations is only the symptom of larger \neconomic trends in professional sports. If these trends are allowed to \ncontinue, we will see the same fan disaffection that has occurred in \nMajor League baseball, with the result that professional sports--one of \nour growing national industries--will suffer.\n  My bill will protect professional sports by permitting the leagues--\nthe National Football League, the National Basketball Association, and \nthe National Hockey League--to review and, if necessary block, \nfranchise relocation decisions. Under some interpretations of the \nantitrust laws, the professional sports leagues may be liable for \ntreble damages for blocking franchise relocations. This prevents \nleagues from preventing moves that are not in the best long-term \neconomic interests of the sport because they have the threat of \nbillions of dollars in damages hanging over them.\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am concerned about sports \nnot just because I am a sports fan, but because I want to make sure \nthat the antitrust laws are properly applied to professional sports--\njust as they should be to any other business--to ensure healthy \ncompetition and economic growth. I am concerned that the current \nambiguous application of the antitrust laws to franchise relocation \ndecisions actually may suppress the healthy competition and economic \ngrowth that has characterized professional sports in our nation. My \nbill will permit leagues to make these franchise relocation decisions--\nwhich seem to me to be, in this case, the decisions of a single joint \nventure rather than of economic competitors--without fear of antitrust \nliability.\n  I understand that some fear that the leagues might use their \nantitrust immunity in franchise relocation as leverage in other, \nunrelated areas. Some think that the leagues might block a franchise \nmove unless the franchise favors certain policies and decisions in, \nsay, revenue sharing. I have addressed this concern by providing for \nspecific standards that leagues are to consider when reviewing a \nfranchise move. If a league considers a factor that is unrelated to the \nfranchise move, then it will be in violation of the law, and it will \nnot receive antitrust protection. My bill also provides for judicial \nreview of these decisions, with proper deference given to the league's \nbusiness decisions, to ensure that the league has not used the \nantitrust immunity to abuse its authority.\n  Let me be clear that this is a narrow bill. It does not contain \nseveral provisions that were included in a House bill reported out of \nthe House Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. In particular, I am \nopposed to any provisions that would force the sports league to create \nnew expansion franchises to replace teams that relocate. I do not \nbelieve that the Federal Government should nationalize professional \nsports, and I do not believe that it is in the national interest to \ntake such intrusive steps into the internal operations of an industry \nsuch as professional sports. My bill intends only to codify what I \nbelieve is the proper interpretation of existing antitrust law: that \nfranchise relocation decisions are not violations of the antitrust \nlaws, but instead are the decisions of team owners who are \ncollaborating in the joint venture of a sports league.\n  Some might question why Congress needs to turn to this subject. \nShouldn't we concern ourselves in Congress with more important matters? \nProfessional sports is important to our nation. According to some \nestimates, the professional sports leagues, in the form of Major League \nBaseball, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and \nthe National Basketball Association, generate more than $5 billion in \nannual revenues in the United States. There are literally tens of \nthousands of people whose jobs depend on professional sports. \nProfessional sports is one of America's fastest growing industries, \nwith numerous teams being established in new cities, both in the United \nStates and overseas. Professional sports also generates billions of \ndollars in revenue for other industries, such as \nadvertising, telecommunications, construction, and sports equipment. \nAnd let us not forget the fun and pleasure healthy professional sports \nleagues bring to millions of fans both in America and abroad.\n\n  But the improper application of Federal antitrust law to franchise \nrelocation may end the rapid economic growth in professional sports. I \nhave held hearings on this issue, as has my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Thurmond of South Carolina. According to the league officials, \nsports agents and businessmen, economists and law professors who \ntestified, a potentially destructive economic dynamic is behind the \nrecent spate of team moves. In order to win games, teams must hire the \nbest players. Because of the salary cap structure in football, for \nexample, the only way to attract the top players is to offer large \nbonuses and financial incentives. The only way some teams feel they can \npay these salaries is to move to new cities, in return for generous \nstadium revenues and tax packages. This financial imperative is fed by \nthe desire of new, up and coming cities that want the prestige and the \nfinancial benefits of having a major sports franchise located in their \narea. This is ironic because some economic studies indicate that major \nleague teams do not bring a significant economic benefit to their new \ncities.\n  Congress must address this dynamic because it will injure interests \nof the industry and of the fans. I was convinced during my hearings \nthat short-sighted franchise relocations eventually will hurt \nprofessional sports. Professional sports, after all, is a product that \nis consumed by all of us, the sports fans. If teams move around too \noften, the fans will lose their enthusiasm and support for their teams. \nIf the fans lose interest, eventually the overall economic pie created \nby the sports will begin to decrease. Fewer fans will attend the games \nor watch them on television; fewer fans will purchase merchandise; \nfewer children will want to play the sport.\n  We have already seen a similar phenomenon occur in major league \nbaseball. After the strike, which canceled the World Series and \nshortened the following season, fans began to lose interest in \nbaseball. Much of this was the result of the owners, whose actions \nagainst the players during collective bargaining have shown an utter \ndisregard for the best interests of the game and of the fans. The \nowners were able to engage in their practices in part because they \nbenefit from a judicially created immunity from the antitrust laws that \nhas no basis in the law. Accordingly, I have introduced legislation, \nwhich has passed the Judiciary Committee, to remove baseball's \nantitrust exemption, except in regard to franchise relocation.\n  I intend that this bill will not move forward until the problems in \nbaseball are addressed. Since it appears that the same economic trends \nare affecting all of the professional sports, then it makes sense to \nprovide the same antitrust standard to all of the leagues. It also \nmakes no sense for the other leagues to operate under the rules of the \nantitrust laws, while baseball can operate in an anticompetitive \nfashion free from the rule of law. The antitrust exemption for baseball \nhas been an embarrassing anomaly in antitrust law--one that has led to \nprofound distortions in the sport. In the near future, I will take \naction to ensure that baseball and the other professional sports \nleagues receive the same treatment. Either this bill must be merged \nwith my baseball legislation, or baseball legislation must be added to \nthis bill. Either way, the professional sports soon will operate under \na uniform antitrust standard.\n  I believe that the time for Congress to act is now. We have already \nseen several teams move in recent years, and even more moves--the \nCleveland NFL franchise to Baltimore being the most noteworthy \nexample--are planned. Professional sports should not be a game of \nmusical chairs, and fans deserve better than to have their loyalties \ntreated with disrespect. As importantly, the sports industry deserves \nthe right to have a say in its destiny. Congress has the chance now to \naddress this problem in its early stages, before even greater \ndislocation, fan unhappiness, and industry losses, occur. For this \nreason, Congress should pass the Professional Sports Protection Act in \n1996, not years from now when it may be too late.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN:\n  S. 1768. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain fatty acid \nesters.\n\n\n  legislation to suspend the duty on imports of certain methyl esters\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ntemporarily suspend the duty on imports of certain methyl esters. These \nmethyl esters are used by Procter & Gamble in the production of shampoo \nand other personal care products. Formerly, these products were \neligible for the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] program. \nHowever, as of January 1, 1997 Malaysia will no longer be eligible for \nGSP.\n  My legislation is drafted very narrowly to cover only those very \nspecific methyl ester mixtures which P & G imports from Malaysia. P & \nG's methyl ester imports are produced by a relatively recent joint \nventure. The first full year of the joint venture's production was \n1994. The fact that there was duty free treatment under GSP was an \nimportant part of the decision to undertake the joint venture. The \njoint\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nventure located production at the source of the raw material (palm \nkernel oil) and results in a cost efficient production process.\n  While there are several companies in the U.S. that manufacture \nrelatively small amounts of similar methyl esters, this production is \nalmost entirely consumed in the manufacture of their own personal care \nproducts. Hence no opposition to the proposed duty suspension is \nanticipated.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dole, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Helms and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 1770. A bill for the relief of Wayne T. Alderson; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\n                       Private Relief Legislation\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill and \nsubmitting a concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 59, \nthat are identical to legislation I introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives in both the 102d and 103d Congresses. As this \nparticular issue remains unresolved, I again urge my colleagues' \nconsideration and support.\n  The legislation I introduce today is an effort to secure the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for a Pennsylvania resident, Mr. Wayne T. \nAlderson. The legislation itself speaks to the background and \nexperiences of Wayne Alderson and equally to the need and merit in \nextending the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  As you can see from a review of the bill, Mr. Alderson acted \nmeritoriously in the line of duty as a private in Germany during World \nWar II and was recommended by his commander for a Medal of Honor. \nUnfortunately, his papers were destroyed in a fire. The Department of \nDefense has said that since the statute of limitations expired in 1952, \nand that without a statement from one of Mr. Alderson's commanders, \nthey cannot award him the medal. An affidavit by Pfc. Daniel Parisi, \nwhich verifies that Mr. Alderson's commanders did indeed recommend him \nfor the medal, was not considered by the Department as sufficient for \nthem to act.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today that Mr. Alderson \nshould receive a Medal of Honor. I am joined by several of my \ncolleagues in calling for the extension of congressional recognition to \nWayne for his service, valor, and commitment to defending our country \nin time of war and acting meritoriously in the line of duty. I \nappreciate Senators Specter, Dole, Craig, Helms, and Thurmond joining \nwith me as sponsors of this legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and consideration of this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5191-3", "month": "05", "year":

referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 59\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n       Whereas Wayne T. Alderson served as a private first class \n     in the United States Army in Germany during World War II;\n       Whereas, during the Rhineland Campaign of such war, which \n     was 4 days of close, fierce combat from March 15 to March 18, \n     1945, Private First Class Alderson singlehandedly killed 43 \n     enemy soldiers;\n       Whereas, according to The History of the Third Infantry \n     Division, Private First Class Alderson was the 1st soldier \n     from the United States to cross into Germany on March 15, \n     1945;\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\n       Whereas, on March 15, 1945, Company B of the 7th Infantry \n     Regiment, led by Private First Class Alderson, crossed into \n     Germany 1 mile south of Utweiler to surprise the enemy troops \n     and advanced through heavy, armed resistance, machine gun \n     crossfire, and a German mine field;\n       Whereas, during such advancement, Private First Class \n     Alderson spotted and bypassed a German bunker and machine gun \n     nest and entered into a close fire fight, killing 6 enemy \n     soldiers;\n       Whereas, when a 2d enemy machine gun impeded such \n     advancement, Private First Class Alderson volunteered to \n     advance alone, forged a stream, and waged a singlehanded \n     assault on the German machine gun crew, killing all 5 of the \n     crew as Second Lieutenant Barbour and Private First Class \n     Preston, along with the other soldiers of Company B, arrived \n     to force the German enemy soldiers to withdraw;\n       Whereas, Company B continued to advance toward the town of \n     Erching, where Private First Class Alderson killed 2 enemy \n     snipers who were impeding the advance, and the town was \n     captured as the enemy troops retreated;\n       Whereas, Second Lieutenant Barbour and Lieutenant Colonel \n     Wallace stated that they intended to recommend Private First \n     Class Alderson for high military decoration;\n       Whereas, on March 16 and 17, 1945, as Company B continued \n     to attack and advance toward the Siegfried Line, Private \n     First Class Alderson killed 4 enemy soldiers in close house-\n     to-house fighting, captured 3 German prisoners, and led the \n     prisoners, at great risk to himself, past enemy positions to \n     the headquarters of Company B, where vital information \n     concerning the defenses of the Siegfried Line was obtained \n     from the prisoners;\n       Whereas, on March 18, 1945, Private First Class Alderson \n     led Company B into its 4th consecutive day of battle at the \n     Siegfried Line but then was cut off from the company;\n       Whereas, after Private First Class Alderson was cut off \n     from Company B, he was unable to find safe cover and charged \n     forward, killing 6 enemy soldiers in a close fire fight, then \n     attacked the main entrance of a German trench, killing 4 \n     enemy defenders before capturing the front end of the \n     trench;\n       Whereas, when the remnant of Company B, which was in the \n     front portion of the trench under the command of Captain \n     James Rich and without radio contact, was about to be overrun \n     by a German counterattack, Private First Class Alderson again \n     volunteered to be first scout;\n       Whereas Private First Class Alderson immediately killed 4 \n     advancing enemy soldiers in bitter combat as he moved down \n     the trench and engaged a large German force that was \n     advancing in an adjoining and interlocking trench;\n       Whereas Private First Class Alderson, who was fully exposed \n     and vastly outnumbered, charged the enemy forces and entered \n     into a fierce fire fight with them at close range, killing 12 \n     enemy soldiers as the German counterattack was repelled and \n     the enemy forces withdrew;\n       Whereas, in such action, Private First Class Alderson \n     received a serious head wound from shrapnel when a Germany \n     grenade landed at his feet and exploded in his face;\n       Whereas the life of Private First Class Alderson was saved \n     by the valorous action of Private First Class Preston, who \n     covered the body of Private First Class Alderson with his own \n     body and was fatally wounded in the head by the bullet of a \n     sniper;\n       Whereas Private First Class Alderson, while he fought to \n     remain conscious, crawled back along the trench to brief \n     Captain Rich on the events that had occurred in the other end \n     of the trench;\n       Whereas Captain Rich stated his intention to recommend to \n     Colonel Heintges, the commander of the 7th Infantry Regiment, \n     that Private First Class Alderson receive a medal of honor;\n       Whereas such recommendation has been verified by \n     independent affidavit; and\n       Whereas Private First Class Alderson has been waiting for \n     more than 47 years to receive the medal of honor for which he \n     was recommended and which he so richly deserves: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should award a medal of honor to Wayne T. Alderson \n     in recognition of acts performed at the risk of his life and \n     beyond the call of duty while serving as a private first \n     class in the United States Army in Germany during World War \n     II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5193-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5194-S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  EXON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3965\n\n  Mr. EXON (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry) proposed \nan amendment to the concurrent resolution (S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF BUDGETARY \n                   SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in August of 1994, the Bipartisan Commission on \n     Entitlement and Tax Reform issued an Interim Report to the \n     President, which found that, ``To ensure that today's debt \n     and spending commitments do not unfairly burden America's \n     children, the Government must act now. A bipartisan coalition \n     of Congress, led by the President, must resolve the long-term \n     imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and \n     the funds it will have available to pay for them'';\n       (2) unless the Congress and the President act together in a \n     bipartisan way, overall Federal spending is projected by the \n     Commission to rise from the current level of slightly over 22 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States \n     (hereafter in this section referred as ``GDP'') to over 37 \n     percent of GDP by the year 2030;\n       (3) the source of that growth is not domestic discretionary \n     spending, which is approximately the same portion of GDP now \n     as it was in 1969, the last time at which the Federal budget \n     was in balance;\n       (4) mandatory spending was only 29.6 percent of the Federal \n     budget in 1963, but is estimated to account for 72 percent of \n     the Federal budget in the year 2003;\n       (5) social security, medicare and medicaid, together with \n     interest on the national debt, are the largest sources of the \n     growth of mandatory spending;\n       (6) ensuring the long-term future of the social security \n     system is essential to protecting the retirement security of \n     the American people.\n       (7) The Social Security Trust Fund is projected to begin \n     spending more than it takes in by approximately the year \n     2013, with Federal budget deficits rising rapidly thereafter \n     unless appropriate policy changes are made;\n       (8) ensuring the future of medicare and medicaid is \n     essential to protecting access to high-quality health care \n     for senior citizens and poor women and children;\n       (9) Federal health care expenses have been rising at double \n     digit rates, and are projected to triple to 11 percent of GDP \n     by the year 2030 unless appropriate policy changes are made; \n     and\n       (10) due to demographic factors, Federal health care \n     expenses are projected to double by the year 2030, even if \n     health care cost inflation is restrained after 1999, so that \n     costs for each person of a given age grow no faster than the \n     economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--If the sense of the Senate that \n     budget savings in the mandatory spending area should be \n     used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens and poor Americans by ensuring the long-term \n     future of medicare and medicaid; and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline, to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 2967\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KYL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nconcurrent resolution (S.

COMMON SENSE BUDGETING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) President Clinton proposed in his fiscal year 1997 \n     budget submission immediate downward adjustments to \n     discretionary caps after the year 2000 if the Congressional \n     Budget Office projected that his budget would not balance in \n     2002;\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated \n     that President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget submission \n     will incur a deficit of $84,000,000,000 in 2002;\n       (3) as a result of CBO's projected deficit in fiscal year \n     2002, the President's budget would trigger drastic reductions \n     in discretionary spending in 2001 and 2002 to reach balance;\n       (4) these drastic reductions would have to occur in \n     nondefense programs such as education, environment, crime \n     control, science, veterans, and other human resource \n     programs;\n       (5) 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary cuts in the \n     President's budget occur in 2001 and 2002; and\n       (6) the inclusion in a budget submission of triggers to \n     make immediate, drastic reductions in discretionary spending \n     is inconsistent with sound budgeting practices and should be \n     recognized as a ``budgetary gimmick'' that is antithetical to \n     legitimate efforts to achieve balance in 2002.\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the discretionary spending caps should not include triggers \n     that would--\n       (1) result in 100 percent of the nondefense discretionary \n     reductions occurring in fiscal years 2001 and 2002; and\n       (2) make drastic reductions in nondefense discretionary \n     spending in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (the last 2 years of \n     the budget) for the purpose of achieving a balanced budget in \n     fiscal year 2002.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                FEINGOLD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3969\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Robb) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 57; supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 6, increase the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 8, increase the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 16, increase the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 13, decrease the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 14, decrease the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 15, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 16, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 17, decrease the amount by $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 18, decrease the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 51, beginning with line 6 strike all through line \n     17.\n       On page 55, beginning with line 18 strike all through page \n     56, line 20.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      FAIRCLOTH AMENDMENT NO. 3970\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto Senate Concurrent Resolution 57; supra, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Corporations and individuals have clear responsibility \n     to adhere to environmental laws. When they do not, and \n     environmental damage results, the Federal and State \n     governments my impose fines and penalties, and assess \n     polluters for the cost of remediation.\n       (2) Assessment of these costs is important in the \n     enforcement process. They appropriately penalize wrongdoing. \n     They discourage future environmental damage. They ensure that \n     taxpayers do not bear the financial brunt of cleaning up \n     after damages done by polluters.\n       (3) In the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in \n     Prince William Sound, Alaska, for example, the corporate \n     settlement with the Federal Government totaled $900 million.\n       (4) The Tax Code, however, currently allows polluters to \n     fully deduct all expenses, including penalties and fines \n     associated with these settlements. In the case of the Exxon \n     Valdez disaster, deductibility on that settlement at the \n     current corporate tax rate will result in $300 million in \n     losses to Federal tax collections . . . losses which will \n     have to be made up through increased collections from \n     taxation of average American families.\n       (5) Additionally, these losses also will make it more \n     difficult to move aggressively and successfully toward a \n     balanced Federal budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--assumptions in this resolution assume that revenues \n     will be increased by a minimum of $100 million per year \n     through legislation that will not allow deductions for fines, \n     penalties and damages arising from a failure to comply with \n     Federal or State environmental or health protection laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5203-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                       special committee on aging\n\n  Mr. COHEN.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in today's \nRecord an unusually clear article on the complex subject of school \nvouchers. Ms. Claudia Smith Brinson at the State newspaper in Columbia, \nSC, has made the case eloquently that the choice of taxpayer funding \nfor private and religious schools is a bad one. Specifically, she \npoints out its history as a means of minimizing desegregation, its lack \nof results, and its lack of promise compared to other proven education \nreforms. I commend her for her eloquence and hope my colleagues will \nbenefit from her column.\n  The column follows:\n\n                     [From the State, May 15, 1996]\n\n          Let's Decide Just Exactly What School Choice' Means\n\n                       (By Claudia Smith Brinson)\n\n       The concept of school choice has been around a long time. \n     In the '60s, it was promoted in the South as a means of \n     minimizing court-ordered desegregation. In the '70s, \n     economist Milton Friedman talked up what he called the \n     ``free-choice'' model. In the '80s and early '90s, as \n     dissatisfaction with public schools grew, experimentation \n     kicked in.\n       School choice covers an enormous range. At its most basic, \n     parents exercise choice when they buy a house in a certain \n     neighborhood. When a school provides school-within-a-school \n     options, choice is offered. When a school district provides \n     alternative or magnet schools, choice is offered. Some \n     districts allow parents with a need for flexibility regarding \n     work or child care to use intra-district choice.\n       While, in this state, we have few magnet schools, half of \n     our school districts offer alternative schools or second-\n     chance programs; more than half allow high-school students to \n     take college courses; almost two-thirds permit inter-district \n     transfers. Our governor's schools for arts and mathematics \n     and science increase choice statewide for our brightest \n     students.\n       Nationwide, choice is often employed to help with the urban \n     suburban desegregation issue. In St. Louis, Mo., inner-city \n     children can apply to attend mostly white suburban schools. \n     To improve schooling for Hispanic students in San Antonio, \n     the Multilingual Program provides a language and cultural \n     focus for academically successful students. In Montgomery \n     County, Md., a magnet school program was introduced to \n     improve integration. In Moniclair, N.J., all schools are \n     magnet schools, and transportation is provided.\n       In Cambridge, Mass., parents can choose, with the help of \n     an information center, any public school in the district. \n     In Minnesota, the whole state allows open enrollment, \n     although students must supply transportation.\n       Charter schools, in which parents and teachers contract \n     with the state to provide a particular kind of education, are \n     another option. Just over 100 charter schools are in \n     operation nationwide. Here, the House has passed legislation \n     allowing charter schools; a Senate subcommittee is discussing \n     it.\n       Vouchers are rare. In Milwaukee, to desegregate schools and \n     improve urban children's schooling, low-income parents were \n     invited to apply for public funds to send their children to \n     private or public suburban schools. An attempt to add church \n     schools is on hold because the state Supreme Court deadlocked \n     on its constitutionality. In Boston, private money is used to \n     send low-income children to parochial schools. In San Antonio \n     and Indianapolis, private businesses pay low-income students' \n     tuition at private schools.\n       The favorite arguments for using vouchers (sending public \n     money through parents) for private schools rest on three \n     faulty premises. The first is that children make great \n     academic strides in private and parochial schools. When you \n     take out those oh-so-important factors such as parents' \n     income and education, what remains is a very small advantage \n     in scores for parochial and private school students.\n       The second faulty premise is that education can be compared \n     to car-making. The premise goes like this: Education is just \n     another manufacturing process; vouchers will create \n     competition; competition will automatically improve product \n     quality. But children and learning are far more complicated \n     than autos and welding. Education is a service, and public \n     education is a service with important democratic goals, such \n     as preparing children for full citizenship, minimizing social \n     inequities and promoting cultural unity.\n       It's not much better an analogy, but compare education, \n     instead, to a service like public hospitals. No one in need \n     is turned away, and yes, those who can afford to do so shop \n     around. However, the patient (both consumer and product, like \n     our students) cannot be cured at any location if destructive \n     behaviors persist. Even with some of the magical pills our \n     technology has created, radical changes in lifestyle are \n     often required. Likewise, poverty, parental disengagement, \n     behavior or discipline problems that many of our children \n     bring into the schoolhouse cannot be quickly and \n     permanently cured by shifting locale. (In Milwaukee, where \n     vouchers are being tried, academic scores haven't improved \n     and attrition remains high.)\n       So vouchers are not a miracle cure. And that is the third \n     faulty premise, that any one new step, such as increased \n     choice or vouchers, will suddenly remake education. The \n     funding equity issue, raised by 40 of our districts, has yet \n     to be ruled on in court. How much good would intra-district \n     choice currently serve in some of the suing, impoverished \n     counties such as Clarendon, Lee, Williamsburg or Jasper? How \n     much help is a $1,700 voucher to an impoverished family in a \n     rural community without transportation or in an urban \n     community where private schools cost $6,000-plus a year? What \n     happens then is not that parents are offered more choice, but \n     that private schools are.\n       If our community, and our Legislature, want to consider \n     choice, first the conversation has to get honest. It can be a \n     legitimate discussion given public dissatisfaction with \n     public schools and a universal desire by parents to do the \n     best possible for their children.\n       But if we're going to talk about choice, what are we \n     talking about? Increasing variety? Or resegregating? If our \n     state and national constitutions forbid public money \n     supporting church schools, why on Earth is our conversation \n     about choice starting in forbidden territory?\n       In a state with limited funds, why begin with vouchers when \n     encouragement for more magnet schools, school-within-a school \n     programs and inter- and intra-district transfers would offer \n     more choices to more children at no extra cost? With limited \n     funds, why not start small and emulate programs that work, \n     like the language option in San Antonio or the controlled-\n     choice program in Cambridge? Why take giant, expensive leaps \n     into ideas, such as vouchers, that have barely been tested \n     anywhere?\n       We have a summer to think this out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5204-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5204-S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ASTRONAUT RICK LINNEHAN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nextraordinary accomplishments of Astronaut Rick Linnehan, who will be a \nmission specialist on the space shuttle Columbia, scheduled to leave \nCape Canaveral, FL in June.\n  In 1975, Rick graduated from Pelham High School in Pelham, NH and \nproceeded to earn a bachelor of science degree in animal science and \nmicrobiology at the University of New Hampshire. Later, Rick denied his \nacceptance to the U.S. Air Force for pilot training and instead opted \nto attend the Ohio State University College of Medicine to earn his \nveterinary degree. While Rick's heartening desire to fly was \ntemporarily delayed, his dream never died. Upon finishing his \nveterinary degree in 1985, Rick applied for NASA's astronaut training \nprogram. With the 1986 Challenger disaster stalling the program, Rick's \ndream of space flight was once again put on hold. During this time, \nRick worked as a veterinarian before joining an internship with the \nBaltimore Zoo and Johns Hopkins University from 1986 to 1988. He then \njoined the military as a captain in the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps, and \nended up as chief clinical veterinarian with the Navy's Marine Mammal \nproject in San Diego, CA.\n  Despite Rick's success in his field of study, he still held on to his \ndream of one day becoming an astronaut. In 1991, Rick again applied for \nthe astronaut program and was selected along with 18 others out of \nnearly 3,000 applicants.\n  After 4 years of dedicated training, Rick will embark on his first \njourney into space this summer as a crewmember of NASA's Life Sciences \nand Micro-gravity Spacelab mission. During the 16-day flight, Rick will \nbe part of a medical team that will be checking fellow crewmembers for \nthe effects of prolonged space flight as part of NASA's testing program \nfor the space station.\n  In memory of another New Hampshire astronaut, Christa McAuliffe,\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\nRick will carry a lapel pin with him into space from the Concord \nplanetarium. Rick will also bring a New Hampshire flag from the State \nLegislature, which will be returned to fly in our State House, as well \nas a banner for the University of New Hampshire, and some personal \nitems for relatives and friends.\n  New Hampshire is very proud of Rick's extraordinary commitment and \nhard work to achieve his boyhood dream of space flight. America needs \nmore visionaries like Rick, who not only hold on to their dreams but \nwork hard to achieve them. I congratulate Rick on this outstanding \nhonor and am proud to have him represent us in the final \nfrontier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5204-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CALIFORNIA CITIES ACT TO BAN JUNK GUNS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last month I introduced legislation \nwith Senators John Chafee and Bill Bradley to prohibit the manufacture \nand sale of junk guns--or as they are also called, Saturday night \nspecials. We believe that these cheap, poorly constructed, easily \nconcealable firearms pose such a great threat to public safety that \ntheir sale and manufacture should be prohibited.\n  Nearly 20 years ago, Congress prohibited the importation of junk \nguns, but allowed their domestic manufacture to soar virtually \nunchecked. Today, 7 of the 10 firearms most frequently traced at crime \nscenes are junk guns that cannot legally be imported. My view is that \nif a gun represents such a threat to public safety that it should not \nbe imported, its domestic manufacture should also be restricted. A \nfirearm's point of origin is irrelevant.\n  Earlier this year, the City of West Hollywood prohibited the sale of \njunk guns within the city limit. Shortly thereafter, I introduced my \nbill, which would ban junk guns nationwide. Since then, California \ncities have made progress that exceeded my expectations. Once again, \nCalifornia is at the leading edge of a nationwide movement.\n  This week, the Oakland City Council, with the support of the mayor \nand the police chief, voted to ban the sale of junk guns. San Francisco \nis expected to follow shortly. And the city of San Jose is also \nconsidering enacting a junk gun ban. The police chiefs of these three \ncities have all endorsed my bill to ban junk guns nationwide.\n  I am very proud that these California cities are acting responsibly \nto take these dangerous firearms off our streets. This momentum is \ngrowing into an unstoppable force. The current junk gun double standard \ncannot be maintained. It is simply a matter of time before Congress \nacts to apply the same standards to domestically produced junk guns are \ncurrently applied to imports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5205-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VERNON J. BAKER\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is indeed a pleasure and a \nprivilege for me to speak today about the accomplishments of one of my \nfellow Idahoans, Vernon J. Baker. Vernon Baker is one of seven African-\nAmericans whose heroic actions in World War II are being belatedly \nrecognized. Vernon has been nominated for this Nation's highest award--\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  When 1st Lt. Vernon Baker awoke on the morning of April 5, 1945, I am \nconfident he did not begin the day thinking, ``Today, I am going to be \na hero.'' I am more confident he began that morning thinking, ``Lord, \ngive me the strength to get me and my men through another day.''\n  In the smokey grayness of predawn, artillery rained on the German \nmountain stronghold called ``Hill X'' near Castle Aghinolfi, Italy. \nFirst Lieutenant Baker was a platoon leader of 25 men and a recent \ngraduate of Officer Candidate School. Standing five foot five and \nweighing in at 139 pounds, he led his men to the south side of the \ndraw, within 250 yards of the castle. Seeing a telescope pointing out \nof the narrow slit of the bunker, he ordered his men to stay down and \nhe crawled to the opening, stuck in his M-1 and fired until the rifle \nwas empty. When he looked inside, one of the two dead Germans was still \nslumped in his chair. Baker then stumbled upon a camouflaged machine \ngun nest where he killed two more Germans.\n  As he reported to his company commander, Captain John Runyan, who \nlike all his superiors was white, he was hit in the head by a ``potato \nmasher'' hand grenade. It failed to explode and Baker quickly shot and \nkilled the German who had thrown the grenade. While his unit was under \nheavy fire, he continued into the canyon alone. Discovering a hidden \nentrance to another dugout, he blasted it open with a grenade and \ndashed inside, killing two more German soldiers with a discarded \nmachine gun he had picked up off the ground.\n  Captain Runyan ordered a withdrawal of the unit and told Baker he was \ngoing for reinforcements. That was the last time Lieutenant Baker saw \nCaptain Runyan. The reinforcements never arrived. At the end of the \nbattle, Baker regrouped the seven survivors of the 25 man platoon. The \nunit had killed 26 Germans, destroyed six machine gun nests, two \nobserver posts, and four dugouts.\n  Vernon Baker was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on July 4, \n1945, for his actions that day. The Distinguished Service Cross is the \nNation's second highest military award. On the citation for the award, \nBaker is cited for ``outstanding courage'' and ``daring leadership.''\n  Nearly 50 years later, during an Army review of medals awarded during \nWorld War II, the absence of a single African-American from the list of \nCongressional Medal of Honor winners was duly noted. This began the \nprocess to determine if African-Americans had not received the Nation's \nhighest award merely because of racial bias rather than military record \nunder fire. Seven Distinguished Service Medal awards were reevaluated \nand have now been recommended for upgrade to the Congressional Medal of \nHonor. Vernon J. Baker is the only surviving nominee from this \nillustrious group.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of a grateful nation, I once more want to \nthank Vernon J. Baker for his courageous actions, on that April day so \nlong ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5205-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JANET COOPER\n\nMr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, Mark Stasik and Daryl Miller, of \nTalkeetna, recently achieved a great distinction in our State of \nAlaska--they endured a 45 day, 350 mile circumnavigation of the Denali \nand Foraker massifs, in Winter, on foot. Along the way, the men crossed \nfour remote mountain passes, traveled approximately 100 miles on 16 \nglaciers, 80 miles on rugged and diverse, high mountainous terrain, 115 \nmiles on frozen rivers, creeks, and lakes, and 55 miles amidst dense \nboreal forest. There was an estimated elevation gain and loss of 60,000 \nfeet, the equivalent of two Mt. Everests. The two men also encountered \ntemperatures as low as 60 degrees below zero and winds up to 100 mph, \nwhile carrying 150 pounds of gear per person.\n  This expedition not only shows the personal strength and perseverance \nof these Alaskans, but it also provided scientific and educational data \nfor the Denali National Park. This was the first expedition of this \nkind. I am sure the family and friends of Mark and Daryl are very proud \nof their achievement.\n   Mr. President, I ask that an article entitled ``Off The Couch'' from \nthe Climbing Magazine be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From Climbing Magazine, June 15-Aug. 1, 1995]\n\n    Off the Couch--Talkeetna Locals Complete Grand Circumnavigation\n\n       Leaving from their couches in downtown Talkeetna, the \n     Alaska Range veterans Mark Stasik and Daryl Miller endured a \n     45-day, 350 mile circumnavigation of the Denali and Foraker \n     massifs--a first in winter. Calculating an elevation gain/\n     loss of 60,000 feet for the trip, Stasik and Miller \n     experienced expectedly horrendous conditions, including 60-\n     below temperatures and 100 mph winds. They also weathered a \n     tent fire, a fall through river ice, the loss of their maps, \n     and three days of travel without food or fuel. The \n     routefinding involved crossing four remote mountain passes, \n     100 miles over 16 glaciers, 115 miles along (usually) frozen \n     rivers, creeks, and lakes, 80 miles of rugged mountain \n     terrain, and 55 miles of dense boreal forest undergrowth--all \n     while toting sleds and packs weighing in at 150 pounds per \n     person. The extremes of terrain and conditions savaged their \n     equipment: Miller broke two ski bindings, and then his skis, \n     then both of his snowshoes, before borrowing Stasik's backup \n     pair. ``It was a product tester's wet dream,'' says Stasik.\n       Stasik and Miller share a great deal of Alaskan experience, \n     with 14 Denali expeditions between them, numerous other \n     backcountry trips, and involvement in search-and-rescue \n     operations. Having seen the yearly circus of climbers on \n     Denali, many unprepared for and disrespectful of the dangers, \n     Stasik and Miller hope to make a statement with their \n     expedition. ``It was important for us to strip down to the \n     rawest elements, to show how locals could do it, on foot, off \n     the couch, and out the back door, to assimilate the \n     experience into an everyday frame of reference, without it \n     needing to become a Spandex production,'' says Stasik. ``All \n     this hype and lionization of climbing has gotten to be a tad \n     much.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5206-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ``THE GRAND OL' LADY'' OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, MABEL RICHARDSON\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mabel \nRichardson, a truly dedicated and respected New Hampshire public \nservant who passed away this week. Mabel, who was known to many as the \nMountain Lady and the Grand Ol' Lady, served as a Republican lawmaker \nin the New Hampshire House of Representatives for 34 years. She was a \nrole model for me and many other New Hampshire elected officials.\n  While Mabel may no longer be with us, she has left behind remarkable \npolitical legacy. From 1946 to 1980, she served as a State \nrepresentative, was a strong advocate of public education and helped \nestablish the New Hampshire Vocational-Technical College in Berlin. She \nwas also a delegate to the National Republican Convention in the 1970's \nand was Chairman of the Order of Women Legislators and the State \nRepublican Party. On her 90th birthday in 1986, then-Governor, John \nSununu, read a proclamation of appreciation for her 34 years as a \nrepresentative, and 4 years later then-Governor, Judd Gregg, named her \nRepublican of the Year. She retired from politics when she was 83 years \nold.\n  Mabel lived a long, happy life of 99 years. She was born in Randolph, \nNH, raised on a farm and educated in a one-room schoolhouse. In 1960, \nshe and her husband Herbert Randall Richardson became directors of the \nOdd Fellows' Old Folks Home in Concord, and before that they managed \nthe Androscoggin Valley Country Club.\n  Many people in New Hampshire called Mabel the Mountain Lady because \nof her love of the White Mountains, where she had led many mountain \nclimbs while working with the youth extension program.\n  I am amazed at the stamina and energy this lady had even in the later \nyears of her life. As a representative in the New Hampshire \nLegislature, she was devoted to improving the lives of New Hampshire \ncitizens. Undoubtedly, she will be missed by the many people who were \ntouched by her devotion and hard work. I have always admired this \nwoman, who gave so much to her State. She was truly a New Hampshire \nlandmark, and her memory will live on--as solid as the White Mountains \nthat she loved for her century-long life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5206-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5206-S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 15TH ANNUAL PEACE OFFICERS' MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this week is National Peace \nOfficers' Week, and the 15th Annual Peace Officers' Memorial Service is \noccurring today on the West Front of the Capitol.\n  We Americans go about our daily routines with the comfort that we can \ndo so safety. We tend to forget that this comfort is the result of the \nefforts of thousands of dedicated peace officers around the country who \nare working to protect us from crime 24 hours a day.\n  While we are resting comfortably at home in the twilight hours of \nearly morning, many peace officers are protecting our neighborhoods, \npatrolling our streets, and often putting themselves in harm's way. \nTheir efforts are not without sacrifices. Police work does not always \nlend itself to family schedules. There are times when the children's \nweekend soccer matches are missed, when dinner is enjoyed in a patrol \ncar, and when officers do not have the opportunity to tuck their \nchildren into bed. And, there is always the lingering anxiety of the \nspouse, worrying if tragedy will strike.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of Senator Kempthorne's Senate \nResolution 251, a resolution commemorating and acknowledging the \ndedication and sacrifices of the men and women who have lost their \nlives while serving as law enforcement officers.\n  A preliminary report of the National Association of Police Chiefs \nnoted that 145 law officers died in the line of duty in 1995, including \n13 in the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  While I am pleased to report that Alaska did not lose any peace \nofficers in 1995, Alaska has lost 28 peace officers in the line of duty \nsince statehood.\n  Today, we honor the memory of all fallen peace officers, and grieve \nfor their families. In particular, I honor the memory of the 28 \nAlaskans who paid the ultimate price.\n  I will read the names of those 28 Alaskan peace officers and ask that \ntheir names be inserted in the Record of today's Senate proceedings. \nThey are: Doris Wayne Barber, Earl Ray Hoggard, Dennis Finbar Cronin, \nHarry Edward Kier, Jimmy Earl Kennedy, Louie Gordon Mizelle, Ignatius \nJohn Charlie, Donald Thomas Dull, Karl William Reishus, Benjamin \nFranklin\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nStrong, Thomas Charles Dillon, Johnathon Paul Flora, Richard James \nAdair, Troy Lynn Duncan, Roland Edgar Chevalier, Jr., David Cameron \nHarris, Anthony Crawford Jones, Kenneth Grant Nauska, Gary George \nWohfiel, Frank Stuart Rodman, Larry Robert Carr, John David Stimson, \nGordon Brewster Bartel, Harry Biddington Hanson, Jr., Ronald Eugene \nZimin, Robert Lee Bittick, Leroy Garvin Bohuslov, and Claude Everett \nSwackhammer.\n  Mr. President, in closing I bring to the attention of my colleagues \nthe Blue Ribbon Campaign organized by Concerns of Police Survivors, \nInc., also known as COPS.\n  Blue ribbons are being flown this week from patrol antennas \nnationwide to ask communities to support law enforcement, and to \nremember those officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. \nYou can see them flying proudly from our Capitol Hill Police patrol \ncars.\n  In keeping with this sign of support and remembrance, I urge all \nAlaskans to fly blue ribbons from their car antennas this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5206-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2066, just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2066) to amend the National School Lunch Act \n     to provide greater flexibility to schools to meet the dietary \n     guidelines for Americans under the school lunch and school \n     breakfast programs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the bill before us today amends the \nNational School Lunch Act to provide greater flexibility to school food \nservice authorities to meet the USDA dietary guidelines for Americans. \nIt is a positive step in providing healthy meals for our Nation's \nschool children.\n  As I have stated on numerous occasions, the National School Lunch and \nBreakfast Programs work. School food service authorities have worked \nfor nearly 50 years feeding millions of children each school day \nhealthy meals. In recent years they have worked even harder to reduce \nthe fat and sodium in the meals. I support these changes made by school \nfood authorities to improve the nutritional profile of school meals; \nand I believe it is important to provide them adequate flexibility to \nserve meals that meet the USDA dietary guidelines for Americans and the \nrecommended dietary allowances.\n  The purpose of the bill, which is similar to one introduced by the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, is not to \ndelete or postpone the implementation of the dietary guidelines as \ncontained in the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994. It \nis, however, to provide needed flexibility and clarity to meet these \nrequirements in a cost efficient manner. Guidelines issued by the \nDepartment of Agriculture to assist schools in meeting nutrition \nrequirements should reflect the intent of the bill and should not \nrequire intensive paperwork or sophisticated nutrient analysis of meals \nprior to food service.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently issued a policy statement \nrevising the instructions for crediting grains and breads in the \nNational School Lunch Program. The policy statement is complicated and \npotentially costly to schools. While I support the philosophy of the \nDepartment to assist schools in meeting the dietary guidelines, I \nquestion the need for such an explicit policy statement. It is my hope \nthat this legislation, along with assistance from the Department of \nAgriculture, will help school food service authorities serve meals that \nmeet the nutritional requirements and children will eat.\n  This legislation has strong support from the Indiana School Food \nService Association and the American School Food Service Association. \nIt is also supported by the Clinton administration.\n  I urge Senators to support the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering H.R. \n2066, a bill that is virtually the same as S.\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\n1613, which I introduced in the Senate earlier this year.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to amend the National School Lunch \nAct to provide greater flexibility to schools to meet the dietary \nguidelines for Americans contained in Public Law 103-448, the Healthy \nMeals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994. This bill does not postpone or \nreduce in any way the statutory requirement that schools have to meet \nthese dietary guidelines.\n  The National School Lunch Program currently operates in over 92,000 \nschools and serves approximately 26 million children each day. In my \nState of Mississippi approximately 7 out of 10 children participate in \nthe School Lunch Program.\n  The Secretary should take measures to ensure accountability, but \nshould ensure those measures do not reduce the flexibility in this \nbill. It is not the intent of this bill for the Secretary to require \nschool food authorities to provide detailed information about recipes, \nmenus, nutrients, or nutrient analyses in order to receive approval to \nuse a menu-planning method other than the three prescribed by USDA. \nLimitations on staff time and resources could make it extremely \ndifficult for many school food authorities to provide such information. \nSchools that desire to use the 1994-95 food-based meal policies are \nentitled to do so under this legislation without preapproval. This \nlegislation will also allow schools to consider local and regional \npreferences when preparing meals.\n  This bill has received wide support from school representatives at \nboth the local and national level and from the administration. Earlier \nthis week the other body passed this bill by unanimous consent. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2066, which \nis identical to S. 1613, a bill which I cosponsored. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to provide commonsense flexibility to schools in \nmeeting the statutory requirement of serving meals that meet the \ndietary guidelines for Americans under the school lunch and breakfast \nprograms.\n  The dietary guidelines for Americans were first issued jointly by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human \nServices in 1980, and have been revised several times since to reflect \ndevelopments in scientific opinion. They present reasonable suggestions \nfor how healthy Americans should eat to help them stay healthy. \nCongress has required that the school lunch and breakfast programs meet \nstandards outlined in the dietary guidelines beginning with the 1996-97 \nschool year.\n  Local school food service personnel have been working hard to improve \nthe nutritional quality of school meals so that the dietary guidelines \nwould be met. Good progress has been underway in virtually all schools, \nand many schools have met the dietary guidelines for a number of years \nusing the existing food-based meal pattern. Unfortunately, recent \nregulatory efforts by the Department of Agriculture seem to have been \nundertaken with such good-intentioned zeal that local school food \nservice personnel found themselves being micromanaged from Washington. \nMr. President, there are relatively few things that work out well when \nmandated in detail from Washington and then implemented without \nreasonable discretion across the country. In school lunches and \nbreakfasts, that is a recipe for disaster.\n  This legislation makes crystal clear that the regulations, policies, \nand guidelines in effect in 1994-95 school year are to be available to \nschools as one of the reasonable means of meeting the dietary \nguidelines. This legislation reaches beyond the regulations to the \ninformal policy guidance documents. For example, the Department of \nAgriculture has issued a new policy regarding bread serving sizes that \ncould have been issued under the 1994-95 food plan regulations, but was \nnot. This new policy specifies, among other things, various sizes for \nmuffins that must be served to meet the new policy. The sizes depend on \nthe ingredients, and in some cases, the size of muffins would have to \ndouble. This legislation provides that the previous bread policy is \navailable to schools in serving a food-based menu plan. This \nlegislation is not to be construed as permitting new mandates or \noverly-clever interpretations in informal policy statements with the \neffect of defeating flexibility for local schools. This is just the \nsort of micromanagement from Washington our schools do not need.\n  Mr. President, I know and appreciate the work of school food service \npersonnel. They work day in and day out to provide the best possible \nmeals for the children of their school. Often, they are preparing meals \nfor their own children. The Department of Agriculture should not again \nlose sight of that commitment by local school personnel. Instead of \ndetailed mandates that prove to be unworkable, USDA should strive to \nwork with the local food service personnel who feed our children each \nschool day.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2066) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/16/senate-section/article/S5207-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5208-S5214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PUBLIC BUILDINGS REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today the Senate is considering my bill, \nthe Public Buildings Reform Act. Let me start by expressing my thanks \nto the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nChafee, and the Chairman of the relevant Subcommittee, Senator Warner, \nfor their support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Public Buildings Reform Act will go a long way to \nhelping Congress make wise decisions on public buildings construction. \nIt will help Congress achieve some discipline with respect to the cost \nof new federal buildings and courthouses. Specifically, the bill will \nbring some sanity to the courthouse construction program.\n  I have been working on the courthouse construction program for quite \nsome time. And the more I have learned about the program, the more \nconcerned I have become. It is very important that we reform the \ncourthouse construction program and this bill will do that.\n  Why? Because the budget requests for new courthouses get larger and \nlarger each year. Let me give examples from the last five years of \nbudget requests--in FY 1993, the courthouse construction program \nrequest was $132 million or 22 percent of the GSA budget request; in FY \n1994, the courthouse construction program request was $566 million or \n76 percent of GSA's budget request; in FY 1995, courthouse requests \nwere $419 million or 87 percent; in FY 1996, courthouse requests were \n$639 million or 63 percent and this year, FY 1997, courthouse requests \nare $632 million or 88 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is a lot of money. And we need to spend it wisely \nand only on those courthouse projects that are truly needed.\n  The Public Buildings Reform Act will help us do just that. It \naccomplishes two major goals--prioritization of courthouse projects; \nand gaining control of the Courthouse construction Design Guide.\n  Let me briefly summarize the major provisions of the bill.\n  First, the bill will require the General Services Administration \n(GSA) each year to submit a three-year plan to Congress. This triennial \nplan will prioritize courthouse and non-courthouse projects.\n  The first year of the three-year plan will contain the projects \nrequested for authorization or appropriation. The second and third \nyears of the three-year plan will be informational lists of projects \nexpected to be requested in the future. Each year, the projects must be \nlisted in a priority order.\n  All of this information will help Congress determine which projects \nare truly necessary--which is more important than ever as we work to \nbalance the federal budget. As part of the three-year plan, GSA must \nalso submit a five-year strategic capital asset management plan--which \nis a long-term plan of projects.\n  GAO has stated that the lack of long-term planning has created a \nsituation where ``absent this information, Congress has little \npractical choice but to consider projects individually. And since there \nis no articulated rationale or justification in a long-term strategic \ncontext for GSA's proposed projects, other projects can seem just as \ndefensible.''\n  Now I must tell the Senate that this year, the Administrative Office \nof the Courts has heard our calls for a prioritized list of \ncourthouses. And they submitted a list of projects to the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. This is a good step and I commend the \nCourts. But this bill will take us the next logical step and give \nCongress a preview of impending projects.\n  In addition to the priority list, the bill will require GSA to submit \nadditional information to the Environment and Public Works Committee to \njustify project requests. For courthouse projects, this will include \nthe projected number of judges to be housed in the new courthouse; the \nyear when the current courthouse met or will meet its maximum capacity; \nthe level of security risk at the current courthouse;\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nand the expiration date of any current leases housing the courts. This \ninformation will enable the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nthe Congress to do a better job in assessing the need for new \ncourthouses.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the bill will solve what I see \nas a major problem with the courthouse construction program. That is, \nthe standards for courthouse design seem to be ever changing. And, of \ncourse, the changes always seem to lead to more expensive projects, not \ncheaper ones.\n  To fix that problem, this bill will require GSA, along with the \nCourts, to rewrite the courthouse construction Design Guide and develop \nfair, responsible standards for courthouse construction. GSA then will \nbe in charge of making sure that all courthouses constructed in this \ncountry do not deviate from the standards contained in the Design \nGuide.\n  Why should this be done? One reason was cited by the GSA Inspector \nGeneral in a report issued on September 27, 1995. The report said the \n``Courts Design Guide is a document which provides specifications, \nrequirements, and standards for constructing and outfitting \ncourthouses. It has evolved over the years and has produced larger, \nmore grandly appointed courtrooms and chambers. As a result, costs \nrelated to implementing the design standards written by and interpreted \nby the Courts have escalated. The language and requirements in the \nCourts Design Guide help explain some of the perceived excesses in new \ncourthouse projects.''\n  This does not mean courthouses will be drab--they will continue to be \nappropriate to the dignity of the Courts. But they will not be palaces. \nIt means that we will have an effective checks and balances on the \ndesign of courthouses.\n  Mr. President, it is important for judges to understand that this is \nnot their money. It is the taxpayers money. And the taxpayers demand \nand deserve to know that their tax dollars are not being thrown away on \nextravagances like marble floors and brass doorknobs.\n  In Montana, our judges do not have palatial courthouses. In fact, \nmany of our judges are not even housed in a federally-owned \ncourthouse--they are in leased space. But they are able to provide due \nprocess of the law without these extras.\n  As Congress looks to make deep cuts in many important social and \ndomestic programs, it is only fair that we make sure that tax dollars \nare not needlessly wasted in the construction of federal buildings.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank Senators Chafee  and Warner for their \nsupport of this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider S. 1005, \nthe Public Building Reform Act of 1996. This legislation, which will \nimprove the way we construct, acquire and lease public buildings, was \nintroduced on June 29, 1995. It is cosponsored by Senators Warner and \nBaucus, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The \nfull committee approved S. 1005, with amendments, on December 19, 1995.\n  Before I go on, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the efforts \nof Senator Baucus and Senator Warner. They have worked together over \nthe last year on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee to \nshape this important and necessary set of reforms.\n  As I will discuss further in my remarks today, the issue of Federal \nbuilding and courthouse construction has received a tremendous amount \nof critical commentary in the media and here on Capitol Hill. I believe \nthat S. 1005 responds to the important problems in a thoughtful and \nmeasured way.\n  Over the last three to four years, we have witnessed an endless \nstream of General Accounting Office (GAO) reports, newspaper stories \nand congressional investigations citing excessive General Services \nAdministration (GSA) spending for Federal building projects.\n  These reports and investigations have discussed management failures \nat GSA, insufficient project prioritization, the inclusion of unneeded \nand ``luxurious'' facility features, and inappropriate congressional \ninfluence upon the selection of projects as causes for wasteful and \nexcessive spending. The courthouse construction projects, in \nparticular, have been a source of great controversy.\n  Members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works have worked \nhard over the last three years, in particular to reform the public \nbuildings process and to achieve significant taxpayer savings. Some \nhere might recall that in the fiscal year 1996 Concurrent Resolution on \nthe Budget, the Congress called for a 30 percent reduction in new \nconstruction funding at GSA over seven years.\n  Last year, in the first year of the seven-year period, we achieved \nthat budget goal, The Committee cut a number of new construction \nprojects and authorized less than 70 percent of the $1.022 billion \nrequested by the administration. The Committee has recently received \nand is reviewing the administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request. \nLike last year, we will be looking to authorize an overall funding \nlevel that is significantly below the levels authorized in previous \nyears.\n  While thorough review of the annual project requests must and will \ncontinue, there is also the need for fundamental reform of the process \nby which these new construction projects are identified, designed, \nsubmitted to the Congress, authorized and finally approved for funding. \nWe believe that the reforms contained in S. 1005 will: improve the \nquality of the projects submitted for congressional approval; improve \nand enhance congressional oversight; and ultimately, save the taxpayers \nmillions of dollars.\n  The bill addresses four major issues. The first issue is priority-\nsetting. As I stated previously, the fiscal year 1996 Budget Resolution \ncalled for a 30 percent reduction in GSA construction funding over \nseven years.\n  To achieve this target in a reasonable fashion, we must be aware of \nwhat GSA and its tenant agencies consider to be the top priorities. S. \n1005 requires a clear prioritization of all GSA projects submitted to \nthe Congress for approval. With regard to courthouse projects, I might \nnote that the Judiciary and GSA have already begun to comply with this \nimportant requirement.\n  Next is the issue of long-range planning. The idea here is to know, \nin advance, what projects are likely to be requested in future years. \nOur experience has been that too many worthwhile projects--which have \ngone through all of the steps--get bumped out of GSA's annual request \nto accommodate other projects which are politically driven.\n  This legislation requires GSA to submit to Congress--as part of its \nannual authorization requests--a list of the projects it intends to \nrequest for the subsequent two years. This way, the Congress will be \nable to identify and plainly judge the merit of projects which might \nhave been ``hurried through the process.''\n  The third major issue addressed by the bill is the need for specific \ninformation on project requests. If GSA is to establish project \nrankings or ``priorities'' under this bill, they must do so after \nfollowing a sensible set of criteria. When did the project reach its \nmaximum space capacity? Are there time-sensitive lease circumstances \nassociated with the project request?\n  In the case of courthouse projects; how many judgeships are \nauthorized and what is the appropriate number of courtrooms? Or, what \nis the security situation? The bill requires that all of this essential \ninformation be included in the prospectuses sent to Congress.\n  Again, with respect to courthouses, this legislation addresses the \nissue of design standards. While the Congress cannot and should not \ndictate the exact parameters of courtroom ceiling heights and judges' \nchambers--I am convinced that we need a consistent set of guidelines or \nstandards. The bill before us establishes a partnership between GSA and \nthe Judiciary on design guidelines. It is my hope that these two \nentities can work together to establish design guidelines which will \nput an end to the controversy that has followed some of these projects.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that I am glad to be a part of \nthis reform effort and wish to again commend Senators Baucus and Warner \nfor their leadership. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nsensible reform measure.\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3983\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction.)\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
