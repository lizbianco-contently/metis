Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n3230, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3230) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1997 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 30, 1996.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate on this conference report \nwill be limited to 4 hours equally divided in the usual form, with 1 \nhour under the control of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nconference agreement on the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1997. This agreement continues the work we began last year \nto keep the Department of Defense on a steady course as it heads into \nthe 21st century. The legislation sends a signal that we remain \nstrongly committed to support our men and women in uniform through \nfunding for modernization and training as well as for quality-of-life \nprograms for our military and their families.\n  This year, the Senate chaired the conference with the House. I am \nproud\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\nto say that we developed a responsible agreement after less than 20 \nworking days. This agreement resulted from the bipartisan cooperation \nof House Members and Senators, Republicans and Democrats, working \ntogether on issues affecting our national security.\n  During my tenure in the Senate and my nearly 40 years as a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, I have fought hard to ensure that \nthe security of our Nation is an issue that unifies rather than divides \nus. The best national security policy is developed and implemented when \nwe act in a bipartisan spirit. It is my sincere hope that we can make \nthis an even stronger feature of the process we use to craft future \nnational security legislation.\n  The conference report recommends an increase of $11.2 billion above \nthe President's budget request of $254 billion for fiscal year 1997. \nThe funding level authorized for the new budget authority is $265.6 \nbillion, which is the same level approved by the full Senate on July \n10. This amount is still $7.4 billion below the inflation-adjusted \nfiscal year 1996 level of spending.\n\n  To improve the quality of life of our military personnel and their \nfamilies, the conference agreement includes a 3-percent pay raise for \nmilitary members and a 4.6-percent increase in the basic allowance for \nquarters. The conference report also includes an increase of $850.0 \nmillion above the administration's request for military construction \nfunding. Approximately 60 percent of this increase is dedicated to \nquality of life programs, especially military housing.\n  The conference agreement addresses some of the most serious \nmodernization concerns we have identified, while maintaining a balance \nbetween current and future readiness.\n  The agreement provides for an increase of approximately $900 million \nfor ballistic missile defense programs. This increase will support \naggressive developments for national missile defense, Navy Upper Tier, \nand the theater high-altitude area defense system.\n  The conference report does not include any legislative provision \nconcerning theater missile defense demarcation. During conference, the \nPresident's National Security Adviser informed the conferees that the \nadministration had already concluded that the tentatively agreed-upon \nTMD demarcation agreement constitutes a substantive change to the ABM \nTreaty. Given that the Constitution and existing law require any \nsubstantive change to the ABM Treaty to be submitted to the Senate for \nadvice and consent, the conferees agreed that additional legislation on \nthis matter is not required.\n  With regard to the ABM Treaty succession issue, the conference report \nalso does not include any legislative provision. The statement of \nmanagers clearly expresses the view that any agreement to \nmultilateralize the ABM Treaty would constitute a substantive change \nrequiring Senate advice and consent. In order to avoid a confrontation \nover this issue that would lead to a veto of the Defense Authorization \nAct, the conferees agreed that this matter should be considered \nseparately from the Defense Authorization Act.\n  We addressed modernization shortfalls in this bill by including \nincreases for sealift and airlift programs, and robust funding for the \nconstruction of new warships, such as the Seawolf submarine and the \nArleigh Burke class destroyers. The conference contains a number of \nfunding increases to bring advanced technologies to the battlefield and \nto support the increasing variety of missions our military men and \nwomen are being ordered to carry out around the world. We have \nauthorized increases for additional JSTARS aircraft, greater numbers of \ncritical night vision equipment, as well as providing funds to \naccelerate the development of the Army's Comanche helicopter and \nnonlethal weapons programs.\n\n  Mr. President, I want again to express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues, especially the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, \nfor working together to reach this responsible conference agreement so \nexpeditiously. I note with sadness that this is the last authorization \nconference during which the committee will benefit from the friendship, \nknowledge, and wisdom of Senator Sam Nunn, Senator Bill Cohen, and \nSenator Jim Exon. Senator Cohen has been a leader in the cause of \nreforming the acquisition process and has managed the process of \nrecapitalizing our Navy's fleet in a constrained fiscal environment. \nDuring his tenure on the committee, Senator Exon has been a dedicated \nadvocate of a strong, affordable defense.\n  Senator Nunn has worked tirelessly to help us put together \nlegislation that reflects the broadest possible bipartisan consensus. I \nam personally grateful to him, and the entire Nation owes him a debt of \ngratitude for the work he has put in on this bill and the many other \npieces of national security legislation in which he has played such a \nvital role over the years, including the landmark Goldwater-Nichols \nReorganization Act of 1986.\n  Mr. President, we would not have been able to complete work on this \nconference agreement had it not been for the ceaseless work of our \nmajority and minority staffs. Our two staff directors, Les Brownlee and \nArnold Punaro did an outstanding job directing the process and keeping \nour staffs focused on responsible outcomes.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the committee staff associated \nwith this bill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, finally, I want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, the chairman and \nranking member of the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations, for their \nwillingness to work with us in a spirit of unprecedented cooperation \nthrough our process this year. I believe that both of our committee's \nbills have benefitted from this relationship.\n  With the attacks against Iraq this week, we are reminded again of the \nvital role our military is fulfilling around the world. Many of the \nSenators who have expressed concern about the funding levels in this \nbill have also gone on record in support of the President's recent \nactions in Iraq as well as his earlier decision to send our troops to \nBosnia. These deployments are costly. They require continuing \ninvestments in weapons modernization, spare parts support, and training \nin order to ensure that our men and women in uniform are well led and \ncan perform such operations efficiently and with a minimum of risk. As \nSenators consider their votes on this vital legislation, they should be \nmindful of our obligation to support the men and women in our Armed \nForces and the need to maintain an adequate level of funding for these \nforces that we so frequently call upon to go into harm's way.\n  It is my hope that this conference agreement will receive the \nresounding support of the Senate. The agreement is supported by a \nbipartisan consensus and represents a responsible and sustainable \napproach to national security. It sends the strongest signal to our men \nand women in uniform that we appreciate their daily sacrifices, and \nthat we are committed to supporting their families and their mission \ninto the next century.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues that President Clinton has already indicated in his radio \naddress on Saturday that he intends to sign this legislation. I believe \nthat this is a strong reflection of the bipartisan spirit which has \ncharacterized this bill from the very beginning.\n  With that in mind, I believe all Senators should be able to vote for \nthis bill, and I urge them to do so.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE MAJORITY STAFF\n\n       Les Brownlee, Staff Director, Charles S.

Mr. President, I join Senator Thurmond in urging our \ncolleagues to adopt this conference report on H.R. 3230, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. I also join him in \ncommending the staff. Les Brownlee, George Lauffer, and Jon Etherton on \nthe majority side have led a very capable majority staff. Arnold \nPunaro, David Lyles, and Andy Effron, now Judge Effron, did the same on \nour side. They have worked together in a splendid fashion.\n  This truly is a bipartisan bill. As Senator Thurmond has said, \nPresident Clinton has indicated he plans to sign this bill, and that is \na reflection that the bill is solid for national security. This also \nreflects the kind of leadership we saw this year under Senator \nThurmond. He made sure this was a bill that did reflect not only his \nstrong concern and continued commitment for a national security, but \nalso a bill that could be signed into law.\n  I commend him on his leadership, and I thank Senator Thurmond for his \nvery thoughtful and kind remarks about my career in the Senate, \nparticularly my involvement in the national security arena.\n  I also would like to join Senator Thurmond in being one of those who \ncan testify in the first person about the tremendous role that Senator \nExon and Senator Cohen have played as members of this committee.\n  Senator Cohen and I have joined in numerous national security matters \nover the years, including the creation of a special forces command, the \nbuilddown proposal, and moving away from MIRV'd warheads. I can think \nof numerous proposals that he and I jointly championed. He has been a \nstalwart of national security. He has made an outstanding record, not \nonly in this area but in others. I certainly share the very strong \nstatements made by Senator Thurmond in terms of praise for Senator \nCohen.\n  I also would like to add very loud applause for Senator Exon who has \nchaired the Strategic Subcommittee for a number of years. Every year \nwhen I was chairman, Senator Exon chaired the subcommittee. That is not \nonly where the controversy was, that is where the money was.\n  We had one matter after another that had to be handled, both in terms \nof strategic weapons and in terms of overall arms control concerns. \nSenator Exon has been a stalwart leader. He has been a person who could \nfind a light of agreement and mold together a consensus in very \ndifficult circumstances. He has been steadfast in his support for a \nstrong and sensible national security. He has been my partner time and \ntime again in crucial matters, and he will be sorely missed. Senator \nExon also has been a leader and a champion of moving toward a balanced \nbudget in his leadership on the Budget Committee. He will be missed in \nthat area as well.\n  Mr. President, this budget that we have before us increases the \nPresident's budget on national security, and it does so in a way that \nis going to boost the funds for procurement, research and development, \nand, as Senator Thurmond said, quality of life for our military forces. \nI think everyone should keep in mind, even with the substantial \nincrease over President Clinton's budget, this budget remains a \nreduction from last year in real terms. When we hear over and over \nagain ``the very large increases in the defense budget,'' those \nincreases are relative to the proposals made by the Clinton \nadministration but do not accurately reflect that the trend continues \ndownward in national security.\n  Many of these cuts that have taken place over the last 8 or 10 years \nwere needed and necessary. This drawdown has been the most successful, \nin terms of personnel policy, we have ever had in the U.S. military \nafter a major mission or, in this case, the end of the cold war. We \nhave been able to maintain the quality and the qualifications of the \nmen and women who serve in our military. This is a very difficult and \nchallenging task, and none of us should diminish the importance of it. \nIf we had not been able to accomplish this successful drawdown, we \nwould be reading all sorts of horror stories about readiness and horror \nstories about our military being demoralized. We are not reading those \nstories because we have had a very successful drawdown.\n  I think our committee and our counterparts in the House deserve some \ncredit for this. We have come up with new, innovative ways to ease into \nthis transition and to take care of the personnel, not only those that \nwere leaving but those that are staying, and their families.\n  I also think the leadership of Dr. Perry has been outstanding in this \nregard, and I believe the leadership of the services has been \noutstanding. The U.S. Army, in particular, has been able to manage a \nvery, very substantial drawdown of forces and reduction in the size of \nthe Army. The Army has moved forces from parts of the world back home \nin an unprecedented and very skillful way.\n  Mr. President, the Senate passed this bill in early July. Under the \nleadership of Senator Thurmond, the House and Senate conferees \ncompleted a very difficult conference on this large and very important \nbill in 4 weeks. I congratulate Senator Thurmond for his leadership of \nthis conference and the bipartisan manner in which it was conducted. He \nkept all of us in harness and told us we had to finish this conference \nbefore we left for the August recess. Without that leadership, without \nthat push, we would not have this bill before us today.\n  Again, I thank Senator Thurmond, not only for his work on this bill, \nbut for his stalwart leadership on national security issues during the \nentire time I have been in the U.S. Senate. I thank him most of all for \nhis friendship and for being a man of integrity and a man who \nabsolutely places the security of our country above partisan interests \nand above parochial interests. I thank him for that. I think our Nation \nis, indeed, indebted to him for that kind of leadership. I am indebted \nto him for his personal friendship.\n  I thank our House counterparts, Chairman Spence, who was determined \nto get a bill this year and who exercised leadership time and time \nagain, along with my good friend, Congressman Ron Dellums, who is the \nranking Democrat. They were determined to get a bill. They were \ndetermined to make changes and display flexibility where flexibility \nwas absolutely required if we were going to see a bill signed into law. \nI commend them for their leadership, as well as all the House conferees \nand all of our Senate conferees for their cooperation in bringing this \nconference to a successful conclusion. I also would like to thank, as \nSenator Thurmond did, the chairman and ranking members of each of our \nsubcommittees. These members played such a key role on the Senate \ncommittee in getting this legislation passed.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the last defense authorization conference \nreport of my Senate career. I want to express my deep appreciation to \nthe staff of the Armed Services Committee, not only this year but over \nthe years that I have served on the Committee. They have provided \ntremendous support during this conference and throughout this year: Les \nBrownlee, John Etherton, Arnold Punaro, David S. Lyles, and Andy \nEffron. I mention them again because without them this bill would \nsimply not be possible. Arnold Punaro and all of the members of the \nminority staff have continued to provide the outstanding assistance to \nme and to other members on the Democratic side. This support has been \ntheir trademark for many years. More importantly, both Les Brownlee and \nArnold Punaro have the confidence of the entire committee. They make \ncontributions, as do their staffs, to the analysis and thinking of the \ncommittee members on both sides.\n  Mr. President, Senator Thurmond has already summarized the major \nfeatures of this conference report. I endorse those statements he has \nmade, but I would emphasize a few others, which I think are very \nnotable provisions in this conference report.\n  I am pleased the House conferees agreed to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nDefense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, which the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\nadopted unanimously, both in this bill and in the appropriations bill. \nThis legislation is a critical step in addressing our Nation's ability \nto deal with the threats from the proliferation of chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear weapons with special emphasis on \ncombating domestic terrorism. I, too, thank Senators Stevens and Inouye \nfor supporting this legislation, both on the floor and in conference in \nthe appropriations bill. I also thank them for their splendid \nleadership in the national security arena.\n  This legislation authorizes $201 billion for the Departments of \nHealth, Human Services, and Energy to address the threat of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This includes $65 million \nfor the Defense Department to conduct a program to train, equip, and \nassist local first responders in dealing with incidents involving \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and related materials. Within \nthis $65 million, $10.5 million is specifically earmarked for DOD \nassistance to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in forming \nemergency medical response teams capable of dealing with the \nconsequences of the use of these materials.\n  A total of $30 million is authorized for DOD to provide equipment and \nassistance to the U.S. Customs Service and to help train custom \nservices in the former Soviet Union, the Baltic States, and Eastern \nEurope in an effort to improve our ability to detect and interdict \nthese materials before they can reach the hands of terrorists in the \nUnited States. Of course, a partnership between the United States and \nthese other customs services is absolutely essential for our own \nsecurity.\n  An additional $27 million is provided to the Department of Defense \nand to the Department of Energy for efforts to research and develop \nimproved detection technologies, which are badly needed. I will not go \ninto detail, but that was one of the most important lessons learned at \nthe Olympics in Atlanta. All elements of our law enforcement need to \nlearn to detect more thoroughly, with a broader area and with more \nconfidence, the presence of a chemical or biological weapon, if one is \nreleased. This area needs attention in the research field.\n  Finally, this conference report authorizes additional funding to \naddress the threat of proliferation, as we have done in the past, at \nits source. In addition to fully authorizing the administration's \nrequest of $327.9 million for the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, this legislation authorizes $37 million for DOD projects \ndesigned to destroy, dismantle, and improve controls over the former \nSoviet Union's stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. DOE is being \nprovided $40 million for its program in this area.\n\n  I must commend our colleague, Senator Domenici, for his outstanding \nleadership in developing, implementing, following through, and \nproviding the funding for this legislation.\n  This legislation also calls for the creation of a senior level \ncoordinator to improve the coordination among Federal departments and \nagencies dealing with the threat of proliferation, and to improve \ncoordination between the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments and emergency response agencies.\n  Mr. President, the threat of attack on American cities and towns by \nterrorists, malcontents, or representatives of hostile powers using \nradiological, chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons is one of the \nmost serious national security threats we face today. I put it right at \nthe top of the list. Too many experts have said it is not a question of \n``if'' but only of ``when'' terrorists will use chemical, biological--\nor even nuclear--weapons in the United States. The legislation in this \nconference report is a major step forward and will significantly \nimprove our ability at the local level and State level and all over \nthis country to deal with this threat--a threat which today we are \nclearly not prepared for. I anticipate that the National Guard, if they \nchoose and if the administration moves in that direction, will be able \nto play a major role in this area.\n  We have Guard forces in every community of any real size in America. \nEvery Governor has Guard forces that are available if an emergency \ncomes at on the State level. A number of these units are trained in the \nchemical and biological area. I think it is a natural fit because Guard \nforces are on the scene and also enjoy a great deal of confidence by \nour citizens. I would like to see, as one of the originators of this \nentire legislation, it move in the direction of the Guard.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees agreed to the Senate provision \ngiving the Secretary of Defense discretionary authority to waive some \nof the existing buy-America limitations for defense procurement. I \njoined Senator McCain in sponsoring this provision in committee and in \nconference. I commend Senator McCain for his leadership in this \nrespect.\n  Mr. President, this waiver authority is essential if we are to live \nup to our commitments to our allies to work for free and open \ncompetition for defense procurement. If we do not buy from them in a \nfair way, they are not going to buy from us. We enjoy an advantage on \nthe sale of defense articles. It is a favorable part of our trade \nbalance. This is a very important step for those who sell defense \nequipment to our allies.\n  Two of the most difficult issues in this conference and in this whole \nbill, Mr. President, were the multilateralization of the ABM Treaty and \nthe demarcation between theater missile defense systems and ABM \nsystems.\n  The House bill contained provisions on each of these issues which the \nadministration vigorously opposed as infringements on the President's \ntreaty-making powers under the Constitution. The Senate bill reported \nby the committee contained similar language, but both provisions were \nmodified on the Senate floor. The administration was prepared to accept \nthe two provisions in the bill that passed the Senate.\n  Again this year, a majority of the conferees decided to drop all the \nprovisions on these two issues, rather than accept the bipartisan \nprovisions contained in the Senate bill. This same course was followed \nlast year with respect to language on national missile defenses, with \nthe end result that the Congress provided some $800 million for \nnational missile defense for the current fiscal year without any \nguidance to the Department of Defense as to how to spend it.\n  Mr. President, I commend the House conferees on their willingness to \ndrop their language. I have never understood why the language adopted \nin the Senate, both last year and this year, was not acceptable.\n  After removing all of the bill language regarding \nboth multilateralization and theater missile defense demarcation this \nyear, a majority of the conferees endorsed the statement of managers \nlanguage on both issues. That, of course, is the right of the \nconferees. This statement of managers language was not endorsed by all \nof the conferees. In fact, some of my colleagues on the minority side \nof our committee decided not to sign the statement of managers \naccompanying the conference report, in large part because of their \ndisagreement with this statement of managers language.\n\n  While I signed the conference report and statement of managers \nbecause of my overall support for this bill, I want to make clear my \nconcerns with the statement of managers language on both \nmultilateralization of the ABM Treaty and on theater missile defense \ndemarcation.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that Congress remains deeply divided \non missile defense issues. We may have a debate on issues relating to \nmissile defense in the next 2 or 3 weeks before we adjourn this \nsession. For one thing, I think a debate would be healthy. I think this \nsubject needs to be debated. I think it needs more understanding, both \nin the media and in the main body of the American people, as well as \nhere in the Congress.\n  We are in sort of a gridlock in the DOD's management of missile \ndefense programs, which is not helpful for program execution. In each \nof the past 2 years, the Senate has reached a bipartisan consensus on \nmissile defense language that has had overwhelming support, only to see \nthis consensus language dropped from the final conference report. While \nthe Senate seems to be able to develop, at least under pressure when \nrequired, a consensus, the House and Senate have not been able to see \neye to eye on this issue.\n  Mr. President, another difficult issue in this conference was whether \nto allow\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\nincreased privatization of depot-level maintenance currently performed \nby Government employees at DOD facilities. The Senate bill contained a \nseries of provisions concerning DOD depot-level maintenance of \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to take too much time discussing this \nissue. I have a few more minutes, but if Senator Thurmond has anything \nhe would like to say at this point or wants to interrupt me at any \npoint, I welcome that.\n  Mr. President, the House bill basically supported the so-called 60/40 \nrule in current law, which requires that at least 60 percent of DOD's \ndepot-level maintenance be performed in Government facilities. The \nstatute, however, has been interpreted by the Air Force to exclude \ncontractor logistics support from the definition of depot-level \nmaintenance. While you have a 60/40 requirement in law, interpretation \nby the Air Force excludes contractor logistics support from the \ndefinition of depot level maintenance. Therefore, under current law, \nthe Government could move away from the depots simply by reclassifying \nit as contractor logistics support.\n  The Senate bill would have changed the 60/40 formula, giving the \nadministration and DOD more flexibility, so that 50 percent of DOD's \ndepot-level maintenance would be performed in Government depots, while \nthe balance could be performed in the private sector. At the same time, \nthe Senate bill would have created a common definition of depot \nmaintenance for all the military services that would have included all \ndepot maintenance, including contractor logistics support.\n  The Senate bill would also have prohibited privatization of the depot \nmaintenance work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases unless there \nwas a competition open to all public and private sector competitors. We \non the Senate side certainly are not opposed to Kelly and McClellan \ncompeting. We felt there should be a competition, not simply an \nassignment.\n  After vigorous discussions in conference, the conferees determined \nthat there were too many issues in dispute to permit development of a \nlong-term solution to this question at this time. The House was \ninsistent on sticking with the 60/40 rule, but it did not have the \ndefinitions which I think are important. As a result, the conferees \ndropped all the relevant provisions in both bills relating to depot \nmaintenance and decided to retain current law. I believe this outcome \nis unfortunate. The issues have been the subject of a lot of debate and \ndiscussion in recent years. I think the Senate provisions were a good, \nlong-term compromise that would have provided flexibility to put in \nplace clear definitions and a well-defined policy that would have given \ngreater predictability and stability for both DOD depots and private-\nsector interests.\n\n  Turning to the area of personnel policy, the House bill contained a \nprovision that would have required the mandatory separation of HIV-\npositive service members who have less than 15 years of service. Under \nthe House provision, these individuals would have had to be separated \nwithin 2 months of their having been determined to be HIV positive.\n  The Senate bill contained a provision that would have required the \nSecretary of Defense to prescribe uniform regulations concerning the \nretention of service members who cannot be deployed worldwide for \nmedical reasons. These regulations would have not only applied to \nmembers affected by HIV but by all other diseases that may affect the \nability for these personnel to be deployed.\n  Under this provision, the policies governing the retention of service \nmembers who are nondeployable because of medical conditions like \nasthma, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease would be the same as those \npolicies governing the retention of service members determined to be \nnondeployable because of their being HIV positive.\n  Mr. President, I will not go into detail today, but the House \nprovision would have imposed a very severe hardship on people found to \nhave HIV and to their families. These are people who have gotten into \nthis situation through no fault of their own. It would have been very \nunfair. There are very few people in this category. We can state that \nthe conferees dropped the House provision, and the report includes no \nchanges to current law. I think that is the right result.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton indicated over the weekend that he \nwould sign this bill, so this is the last defense authorization bill \nthat I will have the privilege of voting on during my Senate career. I \nam glad about that. I did not want the bill to be vetoed, and I did not \nwant an encore here. I am delighted we were able to finish this \nconference.\n  This will be the last Defense authorization bill that I will have the \nprivilege of voting on and working on. I joined the Armed Services \nCommittee when I came to the Senate in 1973. It was one of the real \nreasons I ran for the Senate. I wanted to be on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I wanted to be involved in international security. I had \nit in my heart and mind. Being able to work with the men and women who \nserve our Nation on the Armed Services Committee has been one of the \ntrue highlights of my entire life and my Senate career. It has been the \nhighlight of my tenure here in the Senate.\n  Every year that I have been in the Senate this committee has brought \na Defense authorization bill to the floor, and every year it has been \nsigned into law. Occasionally, we had to have a bill vetoed first, but \nwe have always managed to enact an authorization bill. I hope that will \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, the hallmark of the Armed Services Committee has \nalways been a deep and unwavering commitment to the national security \nof the United States and particularly to the welfare of the men and \nwomen who so capably and bravely serve us. This service is not without \nsacrifice throughout this country and the world. The people in uniform \nare remarkable. This commitment has been completely bipartisan, and I \nam proud of the fact that over the years, with a few exceptions here \nand there, we have managed to conduct our business with a minimum of \npartisanship.\n  It has been a real privilege for me and a great honor to serve on the \ncommittee under the leadership of some of the giants of the U.S. \nSenate. Of course, my predecessor, Richard Russell, was an outstanding \nchairman of this committee and the Appropriations Committee for many \nyears. I followed his career before I came to the U.S. Senate. My great \nuncle, Carl Vinson, chaired the Naval Affairs Committee and then the \nHouse Armed Services Committee for many years during his 50 years of \nservice in the House of Representatives. I have been deeply honored to \nserve with the giants, who have chaired and been ranking members of the \nArmed Services Committee. I am not going to try to name every one that \nI have served with because they have all been friends and colleagues.\n  However, I have to list Senator John Stennis, a giant in the U.S. \nSenate; Senator Barry Goldwater, my partner in numerous legislative \nundertakings, as Senator Thurmond has said, particularly in the \nlegislation known as the Goldwater-Nichols legislation; Senator John \nTower, a colleague and very strong chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee; and, of course, now, my colleague and friend, Senator Strom \nThurmond, who has been a great chairman and ranking member when he was \nin the minority of the Armed Services Committee. I must add that \nSenator Thurmond was a pillar of strength in his own service in the \nU.S. military. He was a stalwart leader during World War II. All of us \nwho went to Normandy were able to recount that history and understand \nthe remarkable role Senator Thurmond played there. Again, we are \nimpressed and indebted to him for his service.\n  I have to mention Senator ``Scoop'' Jackson, a man I admired deeply \nbefore I came to the U.S. Senate. I felt a great privilege in knowing \nand working with him, both in military and national security, foreign \npolicy matters, as well as on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. I was his vice chairman, and while he was engaging in \nhis run for Presidency in 1976, I was the acting chairman under his \ndirection of that investigative subcommittee. I must mention Senator \nJohn Warner, who has been my partner on many different ventures \ninvolving military foreign policy matters. He served as a ranking \nminority member of the committee during my chairmanship. He has been a \npillar of support for the men\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\nand women in uniform and for our national security. I have thoroughly \nenjoyed my association with him. I have learned a tremendous amount \nfrom all of these Senators.\n\n  I remember Senator Dewey Bartlett, now departed, Republican from \nOklahoma. Senator Bartlett and I went to NATO in the mid-1970's and \nworked together on a NATO report which we think had some effect on \nstrengthening our overall NATO positions. He was a very close friend of \nmine. He died a few years ago. Certainly, the recent book that has come \nout on Senator Bartlett is on my ``must read'' file. He was a wonderful \nSenator. I remember him with great fondness.\n  Then there are Senators Cohen and Levin. I have already mentioned \nSenator Cohen and the remarkable role he played in all the things we \nhave undertaken together. Senator Levin, Senator Exon, and I have \nworked together as partners on many, many, different matters. Senator \nLevin will be the chairman of this committee if the Democrats are in \ncontrol next year and will be the ranking Democrat if the Republicans \nretain control. In either role, I am confident that he will continue \nhis diligence and his dedication to the men and women in our military \nand to our Nation's security.\n  Senator Bingaman has been a champion and our real leader in \ntechnology issues. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him as well \nas every member of the committee. Senator Byrd as majority-minority \nleader, a member of this committee, and a leader in the Appropriations \nCommittee has been one of my most greatest friends and has helped me \nevery step of the way in everything I have undertaken on this committee \nand in the Senate.\n  I will not try to name all the people, but Senator Kennedy has done a \ngreat job in his work. Senator Glenn and I have been great friends and \nhave worked together on many different matters, including the \ndeployment of our forces in Korea and helping to convince President \nCarter to change his mind on withdrawal of the forces from Korea in a \ncritical time.\n  Senator McCain is certainly not only a war hero but also a leader for \nnational security. Senator Coats and Senator Kempthorne are newer \nmembers of the committee, but they both have done remarkable jobs. \nSenator Smith and others are going to be increasingly heard from on the \nArmed Services Committee in the years ahead.\n  I leave with a great sense of feeling that the Armed Services \nCommittee is going to be in strong hands on both sides of the aisle in \nthe years ahead. I will follow these issues with a great deal of \ninterest in the future. I am sure that I will continue to be involved \nin one way or another in national security issues. I leave the Senate \nwith a great feeling of confidence that the men and women who serve in \nthe military have stalwart champions of our national security policy \nand the quality of life for the people who serve our Nation so well.\n  Mr. President, in closing, the Armed Services Committee has been \nfortunate to have the service of some extraordinarily talented and \ndedicated staff members during my service on the committee--staff \ndirectors and the staff who serve under them. I wish I could name \neveryone who served so well on this committee as a member of the staff. \nThey all know of my deep admiration for them, and they all know that I \nrelied on them every day that I have been in a leadership position on \nthis committee.\n  We have had staff directors like Ed Braswell, Frank Sullivan, Rhett \nDawson, Jim Roche, Jim McGovern, Carl Smith, Pat Tucker, Dick Reynard, \nLes Brownlee, and, of course, Arnold Punaro, who has been my right arm \non national security issues for over 20 years. Arnold and Les both have \nhad outstanding military careers and have accorded themselves with \ngreat valor on the field of battle.\n  Mr. President, these staff directors and those who serve with them \nare truly the unsung heroes of our American military forces. I will \ncontinue to be indebted to them.\n  I am indebted to the current minority staff committee, who worked so \nhard on this bill and on countless other issues. In addition to Arnold \nPunaro, Andy Effron, and David Lyles. David, who is on the floor today, \nleft the committee for a while and has come back. I hope he will be on \nthe committee staff for a long time to come.\n  Andy Effron left the committee last month to take a position on the \nbench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Nobody will do \na better job as a judge affecting our military forces than Andy Effron, \nand we all know that.\n  Rick DeBobes is an outstanding lawyer and Navy captain who worked \nwith Admiral Crowe. He has been my right arm on numerous foreign policy \nissues and is always available to the majority leader and minority \nleader in working out difficult foreign policy matters on behalf of \nthis committee.\n  I thank Creighton Greene, P.T. Henry, and Bill Hoehn, who has been \nwith me a long time. Creighton and P.T. have all done a tremendous job. \nBill Hoehn has made remarkable contributions to national security at \nthe Rand Corp., as a DOD official in the Reagan administration, and on \nour committee. Mike McCord is a genius with budget numbers and has been \nour mainstay in so much of the analysis that is critical for our \ncommittee.\n  Frank Norton has done a wonderful job on military construction. Julie \nRief is a true professional on construction and family housing issues. \nChris Cowart, who runs the committee and tolerates Arnold Punaro. Chris \ncan hear him all across the Capitol, wherever he is, and she has done \nso much for our committee day in and day out. I thank Jan Gordon, \nJennifer Lambert, Danny Ginsberg, Jay Thompson for their hard work. \nMaurice Hutchinson and DeNeige (Denny) Watson, who have come out \ntemporarily, Maurice from the Department of Defense and Denny from the \nexecutive branch, to help me personally and our entire committee in \nanalyzing key developments in Asia and the former Soviet Union. Maurice \nwas involved in Asia and Denny with the former Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, I would like to have a chance to thank everybody who I \nhave served with on staff. I will not name them all today. Generally \nspeaking, without any doubt, we could not prepare any bill, let alone a \nbill of this size, without their help. They do the hard work under a \ngreat deal of pressure and with impossible deadlines. They stay up all \nnight many times. The taxpayers of this Nation are well-served. All of \nthem are underpaid, in terms of not only the hours they work, but in \nterms of what they could earn if they were out in the private sector. \nThey, like our men and women in uniform, make sacrifices for our \nnational security. I think that should be said.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I thank the Democratic floor staff. I will \nnot try to name all of them. They are absolutely remarkable people. We \ntake them for granted because they are so good. The floor staff here on \nthe Democratic side--and I am sure the same is true on the Republican \nside--are terrific. We appreciate their help in every step we take to \nget our bills and legislation through.\n  In closing, this is a good conference report. I congratulate Senator \nThurmond, all of our staff, members of the committee, and the \nconferees. Again, I thank Senator Thurmond for his leadership. This \nlegislation will improve our national security, and that is what we are \nall about. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FORD. Will Senator Nunn yield me a few minutes?\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we're here today to vote on the conference \nreport to the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill. But before I \nbegin my remarks on this legislation I want to take a moment to commend \nmy good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, Sam \nNunn.\n  Today, the Senate will see the last Defense conference report handled \nby my colleague, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who is already \nfeeling the tremendous loss.\n  Both as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and its \nranking member, Senator Nunn gained a reputation for working with \nmembers on both sides of the aisle. His ability to forge compromises in \nthe best interest of the Nation has made Senator Nunn\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\nnot only a skilled legislator, but also a true leader.\n  In addition to thanking the committee, the chairman, and the ranking \nmember, I also want to give special thanks to Senator Coats for his \ntireless effort to preserve our language to assist the Navy's \nprivatization efforts at the Louisville Naval Ordnance Station and the \nIndianapolis Naval Surface Warfare Center.\n  I want to turn now to the 1997 fiscal year Defense authorization \nbill's conference report. I was very pleased to see the conferees \nretained my funding for the Urban Combat Training Center at Ft Knox, \nalong with my language to protect the pensions of certain employees \naffected by the BRAC privatization effort and on impact aid. However, \nI'm very disappointed that the conferees dropped my language on the \nchemical demilitarization program.\n  While the final bill language is a compromise from the legislation \nSenators Coats, Lugar, Hutchison, and I introduced a few months ago, it \naccomplishes our goal of providing a deferred annuity for those \nDepartment of Defense employees targeted for privatization as directed \nby the Base Closure Commission and who consequently, will lose their \nbenefits under the Civil Service Retirement System.\n  This 2-year pilot program: Requires the GAO to evaluate and report to \nCongress on the successes or failures of the program; leaves the \nSecretaries of the military services the discretion of implementing a \nprogram; and indexes a deferred annuity.\n  In their report on the Senate Defense authorization bill, CBO \nestimates that the civilian retirement annuities, section 1121, \nproposal would reduce spending by $362 million by the year 2003.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan outline of what this provision does and why it was needed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   BRAC Privatization: The CSRS Issue\n\n       Issue: The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission \n     has recommended the privatization of certain military \n     facilities. For privatization to succeed, the maintenance of \n     an experienced workforce is critical. Retirement benefits \n     have become recognized as a major impediment to the \n     privatization of the Louisville and Indianapolis Navy \n     facilities and other Department of Defense (DOD) facilities.\n       In the absence of legislation to protect their retirement \n     benefits, many employees will--and are--transferring to other \n     Federal positions to maintain and protect their retirement \n     benefits under the Civil Service Retiement System (CSRS).\n       If a large number of key employees transfer within the \n     government rather than work for a private sector contractor, \n     privatization savings to the the government may not be fully \n     realized. The Department of the Navy estimates that \n     privatization of Louisville and Indianapolis would provide up \n     to $390 million in ``cost avoidance'' to the government.\n       Unlike other Base closings, the cost to the Federal \n     government to close and move the work at Louisville and \n     Indianapolis is far greater than the cost of privatization. \n     The retention of the Federal employees at these facilities is \n     essential to the private contractor.\n       Background: The 1995 BRAC Commission directed privatization \n     of two Navy facilities with a large Federal workforce--the \n     Naval Surface Warfare Center, Louisville, Kentucky, and the \n     Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indianapolis, Indiana (the 1993 \n     Commission directed the Air Force to privatize Newark Air \n     Force Base in Ohio).\n       These Federal employees are different from other employees \n     adversely affected by downsizing--the key difference is that \n     these employees are not being separated because their \n     services are no longer needed or because the work they \n     accomplished is redundant or unnecessary. Under the BRAC \n     ``Close and Move'' scenario these employees would have been \n     eligible to continue their Federal employment (and qualify \n     for an annuity) at another Federal installation. These \n     employees are expected to continue accomplishing the same \n     mission as before, but they will be working as private sector \n     employees.\n       Most Federal employees hired before 1984 currently \n     participate in the CSRS; those workers hired after 1984 \n     participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System \n     (FERS). FERS is different than CSRS because it is a portable \n     plan in that it allows a Federal employee to move between \n     Federal and non-Federal employment. In doing so, the accrual \n     of Federal benefits is not significantly penalized.\n       However, employees under CSRS have no portability because \n     it is a single component defined benefit plan. Therefore, \n     when CSRS covered workers are forced to separate from Federal \n     employment before they are eligible for an immediate annuity, \n     their retirement benefits lost considerable value. Employees \n     who lose their Federal position and withdraw their retirement \n     contribution early forfeit all benefits from the Federal \n     government and thereby are not eligible for a pension.\n       Employees with the most experience tend to be covered under \n     CSRS. These are the employees the contractor taking over the \n     work at a government facility considers to be very valuable. \n     For example, 46% of the employees at the Louisville Naval \n     Surface Warfare Center are covered by CSRS and are not \n     eligible for retirement. Many of these employees, who are \n     highly skilled, are seeking to transfer to other Federal \n     positions. Some are even accepting lower paid positions \n     within DOD, so that they may maintain their CSRS retirement \n     benefits. As a result, there is little incentive for CSRS \n     employees to accept positions with the private contractor. \n     Therefore, the privatization of Federal facilities could fail \n     at a significant cost to the Government and the U.S. \n     taxpayers.\n\n\n                           Legislative Remedy\n\n       To rectify the CSRS issue, the legislation proposes to \n     index a deferred annuity for DOD CSRS Employees. It would be \n     a pilot program for two years with a requirement that the GAO \n     report to Congress its evaluation on the success or problems \n     with the program. It is discretionary with the Secretary of \n     the military service to implement a program and the Service \n     would have to pay into CSRS the annual pay raises for the \n     indexed annuity (this is similar to what Congress established \n     for the postal employees). The legislation would address the \n     issue of CSRS employees receiving a retirement benefit by:\n       Indexing the average pay on which the annuity is computed, \n     and allowing a Federal deferred annuity to be paid to \n     specific CSRS employees at the individual's optional \n     retirement age, and the employees must forego their Federal \n     severance pay.\n       The legislation will apply only to Transferred Employees of \n     the Department of Defense. A Transferred Employee is one \n     whose job is privatized pursuant to a decision of the BRAC \n     Commission. This indexed, deferred annuity will be available \n     only to individuals participating in CSRS, and not to those \n     participating in FERS. The legislation will apply to only \n     those CSRS employees who are ineligible to retire and who \n     accept work with the private contractor.\n       Reasons for legislation:\n       At this time there are no administrative remedies.\n       Treats employees equitably and thus stabilizes the \n     workforce for privatization.\n       Is acceptable to contractors.\n       Is easy to administer.\n       Understandable; makes sense.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I'm also very pleased that conferees kept my \namendment on impact aid in the final bill. Since the Truman \nadministration, the Federal Government has acknowledged its \nresponsibility in assisting school districts educate federally \nconnected children through the Impact Aid Program.\n  In 1994, Congress made a change to this program and said that if a \nschool district which provides an education to children whose parents \nare civilian and work on Federal property does not enroll 2,000 of \nthese students and this does not impact a school district by 15 percent \nthen the school district would not be able to count these children for \npayment.\n  With this change, we drew a line in the sand which was arbitrary and \nunfair. We ignored the fact that a school district may be heavily \nimpacted, but may not enroll 2,000 of these students in it school \ndistrict. The end result was that our rural school districts were \npenalized unfairly because of their size. But, these students have as \nmuch of an impact on smaller school districts as they do on any of the \nlarger school districts.\n  I am pleased to see that the provision I offered lowering this \nthreshold to 1,000 students or 10 percent impact, has been retained. \nThis has been a difficult change to make, and I'm pleased and thankful \nfor the support this amendment has received from my colleagues, \nespecially Senator Warner and other members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. We can all be proud that we corrected an error that \nwould have caused school districts in 42 States unjust hardships.\n  Despite being very pleased to see the Coats-Ford pension changes and \nmy impact aid language included in the final bill, I'm very \ndisappointed the conferees dropped language Senator Brown and I had \nincluded on chemical weapons demilitarization.\n  Maybe we ought to treat this conference report like a crime scene. \nLet's dust for fingerprints and see just who it was who ripped the \nFord-Brown language out. While we're at it let's find out what their \nmotives could have possibly been.\n  For those who decided to play behind-the-scenes politics with this \ndeadly issue let me remind you that it only\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\ntakes one drop of a nerve agent like sarin to kill a person. A major \nrelease would kill 1 in 10 people within a 40-mile radius according to \nsome projections.\n  Their decision seems even more imprudent with the news of a nerve gas \nleak in Utah. I find it amazing that the Army remains as hard as a \nbull's head on this issue despite having to literally shut down \noperations in Utah almost as soon as they started because of a leak. \nWith all their big talk about advanced technology, it took just one \nleaky gasket to close up shop.\n  That's why the Ford-Brown language had the support of the President, \nwho expressed his satisfaction that an agreement had been reached on \nsuch a critical issue. I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated \nJuly 17 from the President be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FORD. In his letter, President Clinton wrote:\n\n       . . . I realize that technology is changing rapidly and \n     that it is our responsibility to explore all alternative \n     means of destruction. . . .\n\n  He continues:\n\n       . . . As we go forward with our program to dispose of these \n     dangerous weapons, we will not pass on an opportunity \n     simultaneously to look for alternatives to incineration. I \n     urge the House-Senate Conference to act favorably on this \n     amendment . . .\n\n  But today the American public is seeing what can happen when policy \nis made behind closed doors. I can only hope that those responsible for \nthis irresponsible action simply didn't understand the impact of \nleaving us with language that is much, much weaker. If that's the case \nlet me tell you as clearly as I can that your actions essentially leave \nus emptyhanded.\n\n  Because of this indiscretion we won't have a chance to discover if \nthere's an alternative to the baseline incineration program. Instead, \nthe conferees have chosen to spend $12 billion on a program which the \naffected citizens haven't accepted--and with good reason--as a safe \nmethod of destroying chemical weapons.\n  Recent reports of the nerve gas leak in Utah further underscore just \nhow much is at stake. As Craig Williams, a spokesman for the Chemical \nWeapons Working Group put it, ``This program is 12 years behind \nschedule and 700 percent over budget. They are desperately trying to \nkeep it afloat.''\n  I'm outraged that back room deals in the Senate have not only made us \na silent partner in the Army's efforts, but will essentially lock in \nthe baseline incineration program. This was done despite a letter from \nthe President supporting the Ford-Brown language and despite the \noverwhelming evidence that safer alternatives exist.\n  This change causes delays of at least a year in the commencement of \nan alternative pilot program and gives the Secretary of Defense \nauthority not to conduct a pilot program based upon a paper assessment. \nThose responsible for this are fooling themselves if they think I'm the \nonly one who will recognize what a sham this language makes of our \nefforts and our constituents' concerns.\n  I wonder if you've considered the whole transportation issue? Did you \nrealize that we have to transport neutralized chemical agent and \nresidual materials to a central facility for incineration? What will \nyou tell the site that becomes the dumping ground for all other sites? \nThat's a real possibility since the language doesn't limit shipment of \nneutralized chemical agent and residual material to the chemical \ndemilitarization sites. Thanks to this new conference language, any \nState that has a permit to burn hazardous waste may be a potential \nshipment point.\n  Mr. President, this language puts the alternative program under the \ncurrent chemical demilitarization management--exactly opposite from the \nFord-Brown amendment. Their justification for doing this is that ``the \nconferees are concerned that a divided program under separate managers \nwould result in duplication of effort and increased costs and would \njeopardize safety.''\n  The Ford-Brown language resolved many of the problems that have \nbrought us to this point today. Not only would it have set out a 3-year \ndeadline for completion, but our language stipulated that no funds were \nto be expended for the purchase of long lead materials that are \nincineration specific. It also gave the Secretary of Defense latitude \nto appoint the best individual for the program, even if this person \ncame from another agency. By making the Secretary accountable, we could \nhave ensured the pilot program wasn't compromised.\n  Our amendment would have allowed the Department of Defense to \ntransfer funds to other parties within the Federal Government to ensure \nthat this project would be completed in an efficient and timely manner \nand again, so that there would be an independent review and analysis of \nalternative technologies. It also required accountability with a report \nto be filed with Congress each year on the progress of the program.\n  So whether you're talking about accountability or effectiveness, this \nconference report language flat out fails the affected communities. In \nfact, it biases the program in such a way that no one in the effected \ncommunities will believe anything that comes out of the Army Chemical \nDemilitarization Program.\n  We already know that lawsuits have and will be filed in other States \nwho are opposed to the baseline incineration program. This situation \ncould be avoided if the conferees had stayed with the Ford-Brown \nlanguage. And more important, it could have been avoided if those \npeople working behind-the-scenes to kill our provision remembered that \nthey ultimately answer to the American people, not to the National \nResearch Council or those running the Army chemical demilitarization \nshow.\n  While the conference report isn't amendable, I haven't given up on \nthis and will be doing everything I can to reverse this grave policy \nerror.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Wendell: I am pleased that we were able to reach an \n     agreement on the Ford-Brown chemical weapons demilitarization \n     amendment to the Defense Authorization Act that the Senate \n     adopted on June 26 during debate on S. 1745. The National \n     Academy of Sciences (NAS) concluded in its 1994 study that \n     the continued storage of these obsolete and dangerous weapons \n     poses severe environmental and safety problems for workers \n     and communities. I am dedicated to ensuring that these \n     weapons are destroyed as quickly and safely as possible.\n       I am also committed to going the extra mile to explore \n     whether there may be safer and more environmentally sound \n     alternatives to the Army's baseline incineration system, even \n     though the 1994 NAS study concluded that the baseline system \n     has been demonstrated as a safe and effective disposal \n     process for the stockpile. I continue to believe that a well-\n     designed incineration system can be a safe and \n     environmentally acceptable means of destroying these weapons \n     and that any potential decrease in disposal risks through \n     alternative approaches must be balanced against the increased \n     risk of storage by delaying destruction. Still, I realize \n     that technology is changing rapidly and that it is our \n     responsibility to explore all alternative means of \n     destruction. My Administration will work very hard to ensure \n     that all Americans have a safe and healthy environment. As we \n     go forward with our program to dispose of these dangerous \n     weapons, we will not pass on an opportunity simultaneously to \n     look for alternatives to incineration.\n       I urge the House-Senate Conference Committee to act \n     favorably on this amendment. I am asking the Secretary of \n     Defense to work with the Congress to ensure that this pilot \n     project receives the highest priority in the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Program. I commend you for seeking \n     alternative solutions to this very difficult problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference on the Fiscal Year 1997 \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill has been concluded. In many \nrespects, the bill has been improved in conference over both the House- \nand Senate-passed versions. Policy provisions have been dropped that \nmight have led us into needless conflict with Russia and that might \nhave jeopardized strategic arms reductions which make the whole world \nsafer. I commend the conferees, under the able leadership of Senator \nThurmond and Senator Nunn, for these changes. I would note also that \nthis is Senator Nunn's last defense conference. I congratulate him on \nthe selfless and dedicated service he has given to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, to the Senate, to the people of\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\nGeorgia, and to the Nation. I shall miss his thoughtful analysis and \ncogent arguments of security threats facing this nation.\n  Although action was taken on the floor to bring the bill into line \nwith the Budget Resolution, at $265.6 billion, it is still $11 billion \nover the administration's request of $254.3 billion. It is hard to \nimagine that $254.3 billion is not sufficient to maintain our nation's \nmilitary forces, but it was adjudged to be too little to maintain our \ndefense establishment.\n  I earlier expressed my hope that the amount might be reduced in \nconference, but it has not been. As I have stated previously, I did not \nvote for the Budget Resolution because I did not agree with the choice \nmade to add funds to defense while cutting other critical non-defense \ndomestic discretionary accounts. The Fiscal Year 1997 defense \nauthorization and appropriations bills hew to the path that was set \nforth in the Budget Resolution. I cannot blame the managers of these \nbills for playing the card they were dealt, and spending the money in \nthe most effective manner possible, but I cannot follow the same path. \nRegretfully, for I believe the conference has improved its content, I \nmust vote against this bill.\n  A strong defense is all well and good, Mr. President, but other \nthings are also important. A nation's strength is measured not only in \nmilitary strength, but in the strength of its infrastructure, its \neconomy, and its people. I think we need a better balance between our \nspending on defense and our spending on other programs. Recent events \nin Atlanta and the tragic and unexplained loss of TWA flight 800 have \nraised fears of terrorism to new levels, and have added priority as \nwell as funding to anti-terrorism and counterproliferation efforts. \nAmericans have prepared themselves for the inconvenience and drag on \nproductivity that greater security measures will impose. But what about \nthe loss of life and loss of productivity created by the imbalance in \nfunding between defense and non-defense discretionary programs that has \nbeen accentuated by the congressional budget process? How high does the \nilliteracy rate have to climb before we stop cutting funds for \neducation, teachers, and books? How many airline crashes must occur \nbefore the FAA gets funds for more inspectors? When will we add funds \nfor programs to keep aircraft and passengers safe, rather than add \nfunds for far-fetched and technologically risky plans to stop incoming \nballistic missiles? This conference agreed to add $350 million to the \nadministration's already generous request of $508.4 million for \nnational missile defense.\n\n  How many children must die from contaminated hamburgers before we \nfind more funds for food inspectors? How many sick people must die \nbefore the Food and Drug Administration gets more funds to speed the \nreview of new medicines and other treatments? These are the choices we \nmake when we add money to defense. The pot is only so big; the more \nthat gets ladled into the defense bowl, the less there remains to dole \nout to defense against illiteracy, unsafe conditions, and disease.\n  There is much talk of readiness, of funds being needed to prepare for \nmilitary contingencies. That is what some of these added funds are \nmeant to address. But, while we are willing to prepare for and to wage \nwar, we must also be prepared to pay the wages of war. I offered an \namendment to provide $10 million for independent scientific research \ninto the possible link between chemical warfare agent exposure and the \nGulf War syndrome being suffered by large numbers of Gulf War veterans. \nMy amendment would also have provided health care for the children of \nthese veterans who have birth defects or catastrophic illnesses that \nmay be related to their parents' wartime exposures.\n  I am glad that the conferees agreed to designate the funds from \nwithin the $9 billion Defense Health Program for this research. It has \nbeen five years since the Gulf War, and no such research has been \nconducted, despite veterans' concerns that this exposure may be at the \nroot of their illnesses and at the root of their childrens' tragic \nconditions. A recent Department of Defense admission that chemical \nweapons were among Iraqi ammunition stores that were blown up over U.S. \ntroops have reignited concerns about chemical warfare agent exposure. I \nam glad that this research may now be conducted, and I hope that the \nDepartment of Defense will move quickly to get the research started.\n  In the interim, I had hoped that the conferees would agree with my \nproposal to provide health care for the affected children. Their \nsituations are truly tragic, and are financially devastating to their \nfamilies. I asked that these children, the likely victims of an \nincreasingly toxic battlefield, be given the benefit of the doubt until \nscientific research establishes evidence of a link between their \nparents' exposure and their conditions. Sadly, the conferees were not \nprepared to be that compassionate. Out of a $265.6 billion defense \nbudget, not $30 million could be found to provide for these children \nwhile appropriate scientific research is conducted. Instead, the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs have been \ndirected to develop a plan to provide care only after these birth \ndefects and catastrophic illnesses have been proven to a reasonable \nscientific certainty to be linked to their parents' wartime exposures. \nI urgently hope that the research moves fast enough to convince my \ncolleagues before these children and their families pay too high a wage \nfor their participation in our Nation's wars.\n\n\n                     EA-6B reactive jammer program\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, airborne electronic warfare has been an \nitem of special interest for the Committee on Armed Services for \nseveral years now, not only because of its importance in strike warfare \nbut also because of the Department of Defense's checkered record of \nproviding substantial programs and clear direction in this area. In \nfact, I believe it was when Senator Nunn chaired the committee in 1992, \nthat the committee urged the Defense Department to merge electronic \nwarfare programs to provide a more cost-effective, and indeed, a more \neffective EW capability.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for bringing up this \nissue. It is true that the committee proposed to merge the Air Force's \nand the Navy's requirements into one electronic warfare aircraft \nprogram that could be pursued aggressively, but the Department of \nDefense responded that it needed two separate robustly funded jamming \naircraft programs. Now it has one program that limps along without the \nbenefit of any real capability upgrades.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Nunn and believe \nthis year's bill is designed to move forward with this very important \nprogram. Section 123 of the Conference Report contains a prohibition on \nthe obligation of funds for modifications or upgrades for EA-6B \naircraft until funds have been obligated for a reactive jammer program, \na report has been received, and 30 days have elapsed from the date of \nthe receipt of the report. Specifically, section 123(a) prohibits the \nobligation of funds for modifications to EA-6B aircraft until a \ncertification that some or all of such funds have been obligated for a \nreactive jammer program for EA-6B aircraft. Only research and \ndevelopment funds have been authorized and appropriated for the \nreactive jammer program and, as I understand it, the funds mentioned in \nthis section refer to those research and development funds for \ninitiation of a reactive jammer program. Does the Senator from Georgia \ninterpret the section as I do?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from South \nCarolina's interpretation. The mention of ``some or all of such funds'' \ndoes indeed refer to research and development funds, not to procurement \nfunds. The intent of the conference is that the prohibition is on the \nobligation of procurement funds until some or all of the research and \ndevelopment funds are obligated for a reactive jammer program.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, thank you for providing me the \nopportunity to clarify this section of the conference report.\n\n\n         SECTION 3154 OF H.R. 3230, DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased the conference report \ncontains section 3154, which requires the Department of Energy [DOE] to \ncarry out a study to determine the extent and valuation of natural \nresource damages at DOE sites. I authored this provision as chairman of \nthe Senate Energy\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\nCommittee's Subcommittee on Oversight. Frankly, I was shocked to find \nthat the Department had not yet done their own study of this \npotentially huge future liability, and that is why I introduced this \namendment.\n  It is vital that the Department of Energy obtain comprehensive and \naccurate information regarding the extent and valuation of natural \nresource damages at DOE sites. This is especially important if we are \nto make realistic budget assumptions today and set realistic budget \ngoals for the future. Unfortunately, there has not been a reliable \nstudy done on this issue to date.\n  During the course of Superfund hearings held in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, significant questions have been raised about \nthe Department of Energy's liability for natural resource damages at \ntheir Superfund sites. Department officials first estimated liability \nin the hundreds of billions of dollars. Since that time, GAO has looked \nat the situation, as has CEQ. However, the CEQ and GAO estimates are \nquite different. GAO estimates a high range of $15 billion while CEQ \nsays the high range is $500 million. The disparity between these two \nstudies is troubling, as is the fact that DOE has never done their own \nstudy.\n  This amendment directs DOE to conduct their own study, to use \nrealistic assumptions about liability based on the real world \nexperience private parties have already had, and to report to the \nCongress 90 days after enactment. This real world experience is the \nmethods in the current natural resource damages assessment regulations, \nand should be consistent with the position asserted by public trustees \nin suits against private parties and with the position supported by the \nadministration pertaining to damages against private parties. While I \nwould be happy to work with DOE to ensure they have enough time to do a \ncredible job, it is important that they complete their work before we \nmove to reauthorize the Superfund program next year and before next \nyear's appropriations cycle.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that the intent of this section is \npurely for oversight functions. This section in no way should be \ninterpreted as a reflection of support for the current operation of the \nnatural resource damages provisions of CERCLA. I in no way endorse the \nmethodologies used by public trustees under the current natural \nresource damages regulations. I simply believe that if private parties \nface these regulations today, and if the Department of Energy is the \nsingle largest potentially responsible party in the country, then we \nought to use the same standard in estimating DOE liability at these \nsites. I look forward to receiving this study and to possible future \nhearings on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn for \ntheir help on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10027-6", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10036-S10047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CABLE TELEVISION PROVISION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I would like to engage the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on section 833 of the conference \nbill, relating to cable television franchise agreements on military \nbases. That section implements an advisory opinion of the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims, which found that cable television franchise agreements \non military bases are contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation [FAR].\n  As chairman of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee, I believe \nthat when negotiating the settlement ordered by section 833(3), the \nparties should give due consideration to the fair compensation of cable \noperators terminated for the convenience of the Government in \naccordance with part 49 of the FAR. Factors to be considered may \ninclude, to the extent provided in the FAR, interest on capital \nexpenditures, settlement preparation costs, and other expenses \nreasonably incurred by such operators in connection with constructing \ntheir cable systems or obtaining fair compensation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I agree with the statement of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. NUNN. I also agree with the statement of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n\n\n                           Submarine Language\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in section 121 of the conference report \nI read that funds in this bill are:\n\n       * * *available for contracts with Electric Boat Division \n     and Newport News Shipbuilding to carry out the provisions of \n     the ``Memorandum of Agreement among the Department of the \n     Navy, Electric Boat Corporation (EB) and Newport News \n     Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (NNS) concerning the New \n     Attack Submarine'' dated April 5, 1996, relating to design \n     data transfer, design improvements, integrated process teams, \n     and update design base.\n\n  Further, in the bill, under subsection (g) Design Responsibility, I \nread,\n\n       The Secretary shall ensure that both shipbuilders have full \n     and open access to all design data concerning the design of \n     the submarine previously designated by the Navy as the New \n     Attack Submarine.\n\n  Mr. President, reading a portion of the aforementioned memorandum of \nagreement, a copy of which I am submitting for the record, NNS is to \n``be provided design deliverable information in a manner and scope that \nis generally consistent with that provided in the latest submarine \nprogram (SeaWolf). Design data transfer will be conducted in the most \ncost effective manner to support construction of follow-on ships at \nNNS.'' My interpretation of subsection (g)(1) of section 121 is that \nthis subsection does not require the transfer of any design data \nbetween the shipyards which are not required by the memorandum of \nagreement. Am I correct in my interpretation of the intent of the \nconferees?\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would say that the Senator from \nConnecticut is correct in his interpretation of the language in the \nbill regarding the transfer of design data between the two shipyards. \nIt was the intent of the conferees to reaffirm last year's requirement \nrequiring the transfer of design data regarding the new attack \nsubmarine to Newport News Shipbuilding. It was not the intent of the \nconferees to change the terms of the memorandum of agreement. Further, \nit was the intent of the conferees that the appropriate US Navy \nofficial resolve differences of opinion about what information is \nrequired to be transferred under the MOA.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I say that I fully agree with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee on this point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues interpretation \nof this important subsection of the conference report.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, thank you for providing me the \nopportunity to clarify this most important section of the conference \nreport.\n\n\n    Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, after a truly heroic effort by both members \nand staff, before the recess we completed action on a conference \nagreement on the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill. I hope \nthis agreement will be voted on by the Senate soon. I wanted to take a \nfew moments to highlight one provision in that bill which relates \nspecifically to a recent tragic incident that has hit all of us in our \nhearts and homes. The incident to which I refer is the terrorist pipe \nbomb that went off in Centennial Park--the heart of the Olympic \ncelebration in Atlanta--in July, which killed 1, caused the death of \nanother, and injured over 100 people.\n  But, Mr. President, at this point in history, we have to ask \nourselves, ``What if?'' What if this hadn't been a crude pipe bomb? \nWhat if the individual who planted this terrorist device had used \ninformation readily available on the Internet and materials readily and \nlegally available to concoct a chemical weapon? Or, worse, suppose he \nhad concocted a biological weapon?\n  The answer seems too terrible to consider, but consider it we must. \nAnd that is precisely why Senator Lugar, Senator Domenici, and I \ncosponsored the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, an \namendment--adopted by a unanimous vote in the Senate--to the Defense \nauthorization bill that addresses this very threat. I am pleased to say \nthat our colleagues in the House of Representatives also accepted this \namendment in the conference report virtually as it passed the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction \nProgram, now title XIV of the Defense authorization bill, provides $201 \nmillion--$144 million to the Department of Defense and $57 million to \nthe Department of\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nEnergy--to address the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  DOD is being given $65 million to conduct a program to train, equip, \nand assist local first responders in dealing with incidents involving \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and related materials; $10.5 \nmillion of this funding is specifically earmarked for DOD assistance to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services in forming emergency medical \nresponse teams capable of dealing with these materials.\n  DOD is also being given $30 million both to provide equipment and \nassistance to the United States Customs Service and to help train \ncustoms services in the former Soviet Union, the Baltic States, and \nEastern Europe in an effort to improve our ability to detect and \ninterdict these materials before they reach the hands of terrorists in \nthe United States. An additional $27 million is provided to DOD and DOE \nfor research and development of improved detection technologies, which \nare badly needed.\n\n  Finally, DOD and DOE are provided additional funding to address the \nthreat of proliferation at its source. In addition to being fully \nfunded at the administration's request of $327.9 million, DOD's \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program is being provided $37 million for \nprojects designed to destroy, dismantle, and improve controls over the \nformer Soviet Union's stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. DOE is \nbeing provided $40 million for its programs in this area.\n  The provision also calls for the creation of a senior level \ncoordinator to improve the Federal Government's efforts in dealing with \nthe threat of proliferation and to coordinate Federal, State, and local \nplans and training. Some $2 million is provided for the coordinator to \nuse in focusing research efforts on improved planning, coordination, \nand training efforts.\n  Mr. President, the threat of attack on American cities and towns by \nterrorists, malcontents, or representatives of hostile powers using \nradiological, chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons is one of the \nmost serious national security threats we face today.\n  This threat is very different than the threat of nuclear annihilation \nwith which our Nation and the world dealt during the cold war.\n  During the cold war both we and the Soviet Union recognized that \neither side could destroy the other within an hour, but only at the \nprice of its own destruction.\n  I have heard too many experts, whose opinions and credentials I \nrespect, tell me that it is not a question of if but only of when \nterrorists will use chemical or biological--or even nuclear--weapons in \nthe United States.\n  In July, the Commission on America's National Interests, cochaired by \nAndrew Goodpaster, Robert Ellsworth, and Rita Hauser, released a study \nthat concluded that the No. 1 vital U.S. national interest today is to \nprevent, deter, and reduce the threat of nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons attacks on the United States. The report also \nidentified preventing the loss of control of nuclear weapons and \nnuclear weapons-usable materials, and the containment of biological and \nchemical weapons proliferation as one of five cardinal challenges for \nthe next U.S. President.\n\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee held a series of hearings over the last year on the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, at which representatives \nof the intelligence and law enforcement communities, the Defense \nDepartment, private industry, State and local governments, academia, \nand foreign officials described a threat that we cannot ignore, but for \nwhich we are virtually totally unprepared.\n  CIA Director John Deutch, for one, candidly observed ``We've been \nlucky so far.''\n  And, in fact, we have already received at least three loud warning \nbells. First was the release of deadly sarin gas in the Tokyo subway \nsystem. Second was the truck bomb which went off in the garage of the \nWorld Trade Center in New York City--a bomb that the trial judge \nbelieved the killers intended to be a chemical weapon which, had it \ndeployed as intended, would have killed thousands. Third was the \nbombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The \npipe bomb in July in Atlanta serves as yet another warning that we must \nimprove our preparedness for terrorist attacks in this country.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will significantly improve our \nability to deal with this threat--an ability which today is clearly not \nup to the challenge. We have heard testimony in recent months at \nhearings held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that \nspeaks clearly to the remarkable lack of domestic preparedness for an \nincident involving nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological \nmaterials.\n  Fire chiefs said that they cannot plan on Federal emergency \nassistance to help in an emergency of this nature as it is simply too \nlong in coming.\n  Local emergency first-responders--policemen, firemen, medical \ntechnicians--grimly said over and over again that they were incapable \nof dealing with a chemical or, especially, biological weapon or \nincident.\n  By providing funding and a mandate for DOD and DOE to share their \nexperience, expertise, and equipment dealing with nuclear, \nradiological, chemical, and biological weapons and materials, we can \naddress critical shortfalls in our domestic preparedness that have been \nspecifically and repeatedly noted in congressional testimony and \ndocumentation.\n  Several modest exercises have been held to test how Federal, State, \nand local emergency responders would deal with a nuclear, radiological, \nchemical, or biological attack.\n  In one large exercise, the first 100 or so emergency response \npersonnel--police, firemen, medical personnel--arriving at the scene of \na mock chemical weapon disaster rushed headlong into the emergency \nscene, and were promptly declared ``dead'' by the referees.\n  In a second exercise featuring both chemical and biological weapons, \ncontaminated casualties brought to the nearest hospital were handled so \ncarelessly by hospital personnel that, within hours, most of the \nhospital staff were judged to have been killed or incapacitated by \nspreading contamination.\n  In addition, a report recently forwarded by the Secretaries of \nDefense and Energy to Congress on our preparedness for a nuclear, \nradiological, chemical, or biological terrorist attack noted that, \n``response personnel are relatively few in number and pieces of \nequipment necessary to provide adequate support to an NBC event are in \nsome cases one of a kind.''\n  I still remain fully convinced that the best way to prevent the use \nof these terrible weapons and materials on American soil is by stopping \nthem before they get here. For this reason, this legislation provides \nadditional resources and impetus for enhancing our ability here at home \nto detect and interdict nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and \nrelated materials before they get into the hands of terrorists or \nmalcontents.\n  An extensive study by Arnaud de Borchgrave, Judge William Webster, \nformer Director of the FBI and CIA, Congressman Bill McCollum, and \nothers, published earlier this year by the respected Center for \nStrategic & International Studies [CSIS], concluded that ``there are \nfew opportunities for detecting, interdicting, and neutralizing these \nmaterials once they are beyond the source site. * * * Attention and \nresources must be directed toward post-theft measures as well.''\n  Mr. President, the single best way to deal with this threat is by \npreventing proliferation at its source, as far away from the United \nStates as possible. That is why this legislation also bolsters the \noriginal concept introduced by Senator Lugar and myself in 1991, which \naims at helping the states of the former Soviet Union to improve their \nsafeguards and controls over existing stockpiles of deadly materials.\n  The CSIS de Borchgrave-Webster study also found that:\n\n       The most serious national security threat facing the United \n     States, its allies, and its interests is the theft of \n     nuclear weapons or weapons-usable materials from the \n     former Soviet Union. The consequences of such a theft--\n     measured in terms of politics, economics, diplomacy, \n     military response, and public health and safety--would be \n     catastrophic.\n  de Borchgrave himself stated at a press conference that: ``We have \nconcluded that we're faced now with as big\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\na threat as any we faced during the cold war, when the balance of \nterror kept the peace for almost half a century.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation attempts to improve the \noverall coordination of how we deal with the broad threat to our Nation \nposed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  There are currently dozens of government agencies that deal with the \nvarious aspects of this threat, with overlapping authorities and \nprograms, but with serious gaps.\n  Testimony provided in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nrevealed that coordination between Federal agencies is seriously \nlacking, and that there is virtually no effective coordination or \ncommunication between the Federal Government and State and local \nagencies and organizations. This appears to be changing, at least in \nthe case of the Olympic games in Atlanta.\n  I visited Atlanta during the Olympics and received a briefing by a \ngroup of representatives from various Federal agencies that were \nworking together to provide security for the Olympic games. I strongly \ncommend their joint efforts, but, this must become the pattern all over \nthe country. We must build from this experience, improve in areas where \nwe have weaknesses, and make this kind of interagency cooperative \neffort the norm.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation, while only a beginning, \nresponds to a very urgent national security concern of our Nation. I \ncommend all of the Defense authorization conferees for their swift \nactions in approving the inclusion of the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense \nAgainst Weapons of Mass Destruction Act in the conference agreement, \nand I look forward to the President signing this legislation into law.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill. I want to \ntake this opportunity to commend the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for putting together an \noutstanding bill. Senator Thurmond worked tirelessly to conclude the \nconference quickly and efficiently, and the product is a bill that we \ncan all be proud of.\n  I also want to pay tribute to the ranking member, Senator Nunn. \nSenator Nunn has served on the Armed Services Committee with \ndistinction for 23 years. Throughout that time, he has been steadfast \nin his support for a strong, capable, and highly prepared military. \nThis will be Senator Nunn's final Defense authorization bill, and I \nwant to take this opportunity to thank Senator Nunn for his outstanding \nwork on behalf of the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us includes a much-needed increase of \n$11.2 billion from the President's budget request for national defense. \nI want to emphasize that even with this increase the total level of \nDefense spending remains $7.4 billion below last year's level when \nadjusted for inflation. We are in the 12th straight year of decline in \nDefense spending.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I want to briefly summarize some of \nthe highlights of this conference bill. The bill before us includes a 3 \npercent pay raise and a 4.6 percent increase in the basic allowance for \nquarters for our Armed Forces.\n  It directs the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services \nto prepare and implement a demonstration program enabling Medicare-\neligible beneficiaries to enroll in the Tricare, the DOD health care \nprogram.\n  The bill approves $10 million in additional research funding to \nexamine the relationship between service of our men and women in the \nGulf war and the incidence of congenital birth defects and illnesses \namong their children.\n  It also includes $201 million to carry out the Defense Against \nWeapons of Mass Destruction Act which addresses the Nation's ability to \ndeal with threatened or actual use of nuclear, chemical, or biological \nweapons against American cities.\n  The bill provides $40 million to complete development and testing of \nthe Patriot Anti-Cruise Missile Upgrade Program.\n  It authorizes $32 million for reactive jamming upgrades to the Navy's \nfleet of EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft.\n  It includes a $24.5 million increase for night vision goggles and \n$9.1 million for infra-red aiming lights.\n  It also directs that the Navy conduct a competitive evaluation of the \nATD-111 and Magic Lantern Lidar systems to determine which system to \nacquire under the Airborne Laser Mine Detection Program.\n  It provides an increase of $914 million for the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization, and $134 million specifically for the space and \nmissile tracking system.\n  Last, it approves an increase of roughly $300 million for \nconventional delivery enhancements for the B-1 and B-2 bombers.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, I would like to briefly summarize some \nof the initiatives contained under the acquisition and technology \nsection of this bill. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Acquisition \nand Technology, I have been troubled by the failure of the \nadministration to adequately invest in long-term technology \ndevelopment. Modernization is the key to long-term readiness, and \nwithout effective investment in the technology base, we will be unable \nto preserve the technological edge that we enjoy today.\n  The bill before us includes a number of important initiatives to \nsupport efforts of the services to develop advanced operational \nconcepts and technologies, to increase the use of commercial \ntechnologies for defense applications, and to make defense programs \nmore affordable. For instance, the bill provides $40 million to fund \nthe Marine Corps' Sea Dragon experiments to develop new operational \nconcepts that leverage technology and innovation; authorizes $20 \nmillion for a joint services research and development program for \nnonlethal weapons and technologies; provides $85 million for the dual \nuse applications program; authorizes $61 million for the manufacturing \ntechnology programs of the Army, Navy and Air Force; provides an \nincrease of $12 million to continue the procurement technical \nassistance program; and includes a provision to streamline the Defense \nDepartment's requirements for assessing the capabilities of the \nnational defense technology and industrial bases, including cases of \nunacceptable reliance on foreign sources.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the many critically important \ninitiatives contained in this bill. I would emphasize that these \ninitiatives address the priorities established by the service chiefs \nand will directly enhance our national security.\n  I also want to emphasize that each of the issues that President \nClinton's advisors indicated may trigger a Presidential veto have been \nresolved to the satisfaction of the administration. Thus, this bill \nenjoys strong bipartisan support and the indications are that the \nPresident will sign it.\n  Again, I want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nfor their outstanding work in formulating a conference bill that \nenhances national security and reflects the vast majority of the \nSenate's priorities for defense. They have rendered an invaluable \nservice to the Nation, and I am proud to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the conference report, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                   chemical weapons demilitarization\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, I listened to my \ncolleague from Kentucky with great interest as he expressed our mutual \nconcern about the action taken by the conferees on the chemical \ndemilitarization program. I share his disappointment that language \nwhich would have guaranteed an alternative technology program so \nclearly in the interests of our constituents was deleted in conference.\n  Let me review for a moment how we ended up in this situation and how \nI hope we can correct course. Several months ago, staff representing \nall of the Members who have chemical demilitarization facilities met in \nSenator Ford's office to review the status of demilitarization at each \nsite. At the time, Senator Ford offered a proposal which required the \nDepartment of Energy, in conjunction with the Army office which \ncurrently manages the incineration program, to develop alternatives to \nincineration. Although I strongly supported the idea of alternative \ntechnologies, the Department of\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\nEnergy had no demonstrated experience with chemical weapons. Given the \ndanger involves with this aging stockpile, appointing an agency which, \nin effect, would have to undergo on-the-job training did not seem a \nsafe or suitable option.\n  As Senator Ford mentioned, both the Congress and the communities \naffected by these facilities have had serious problems with the Army \noffice responsible for the baseline program. They have been adamantly \nopposed to considering any credible alternatives to incineration. This \nled me to the conclusion that assigning them any role for an \nalternative program was counterproductive so I found I was also unable \nto support this provision in Senator Ford's draft bill.\n  Being uncertain about two of the key provisions in Senator Ford's \nproposal I decided to pursue my concerns through the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. Unlike the Armed Services Committee, the \nAppropriations Committee has an unusual number of Members with chemical \nweapons sites in their States. In addition to the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee, Senator Hatfield and the ranking member on \nthe Defense Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, Senators Bennett, Nighthorse \nCampbell, Shelby, Bumpers and Mikulski each have an installation of \ngrave concern to their constituents. As a result, Senator Stevens was \nvery responsive to our common interest in holding a hearing to consider \nthe status of the Army's incineration program as well as the viability \nof alternatives.\n  In discussion following the June 4 hearing, Senator Stevens agreed to \ninclude a provisions in the chairman's draft of the Defense \nappropriations bill which addressed my concerns. The language which \npassed the Senate and is now in conference, provides $40 million for \nthe initiation of a pilot program to identify and demonstrate not less \nthan two alternative technologies to the baseline incineration process. \nThe Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology is \ndirected to assign a program officer to pursue this effort. The report \nlanguage which accompanied the bill explicitly stated.\n\n       Under no circumstances shall the Under Secretary appoint a \n     program executive officer who is, or has ever been, in direct \n     or indirect control of the baseline reverse assembly \n     incineration process.\n\n  Finally, the bill prohibits the obligation of funds to initiate \nconstruction in Kentucky or Colorado until 180 days after the Under \nSecretary has reported back on the pilot program.\n  It is my understanding that the amendment that Senator Ford offered \nwhich was accepted on a voice vote just before final passage of the \nDefense Authorization bill has been modified so that it was compatible \nwith the language already included in the Defense appropriations bill. \nThis final version of Senator Ford's proposal was clearly on the right \ntrack and I share his disappointment about the outcome. I also agree \nwith his assessment that the substitute language is in fact worse than \nthe status quo in that it postpones serious consideration of \nalternative technologies and gives the managers of the current \nincineration program both the responsibility for studying alternative \noptions as well as the right to veto any new ideas.\n  I have discussed Senator Ford's and my concerns with both the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Since the Defense Subcommittee \nwill begin conference tomorrow, it is my hope that we can reach a \nfavorable solution to this unfortunate turn of events.\n  I am grateful to the sound guidance I have received from Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye. Both have extensive experience and a \nthorough understanding of the complexities of this issue and both I and \nmy constituents will look to their leadership and count on their \ncontinued good advice.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, title XXXI, subtitle F of the 1997 Defense \nAuthorization Act is an amendment I sponsored in the Senate to clear up \nseveral unnecessary and delaying bureaucratic requirements that \ncurrently exist in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal \nAct--Public Law 102-579-WIPP. This title will allow the WIPP facility \nto open, meet a major environmental objective, and save the taxpayer \nmoney.\n  The purpose of the WIPP is to provide for the safe disposal of \ntransuranic [TRU] radioactive and mixed wastes resulting from defense \nactivities and programs of the United States. These materials are \ncurrently stored at temporary facilities, and until WIPP is opened, \nlittle can be done to clean up and close these temporary storage sites.\n  Idaho currently stores the largest amount of TRU waste of any State \nin the union, but Idaho is not alone. Washington, Colorado, South \nCarolina, and New Mexico also store TRU waste.\n  The agreement recently negotiated between the State of Idaho, the DOE \nand the U.S. Navy states that the TRU currently located in Idaho will \nbegin to be shipped to WIPP by April 30, 1999. This legislation will \nassure this commitment is fulfilled by clearly stating that it is the \nintent of Congress that the Secretary of Energy will complete all \nactions needed to commence emplacement of TRU waste at WIPP no later \nthan November 30, 1997. The opening of the WIPP will solve a nagging \nand ongoing problem at the INEL--what to do with this nuclear waste \nthat has accumulated over the years at the Idaho site.\n  We cannot solve the environmental problems at sites such as the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory, Rocky Flats Weapons Facility, Savannah \nRiver and others without WIPP. The reason is obvious. Without a place \nto dispose of the waste, cleanup is impossible, and without cleanup, \nfurther site decommissioning can not occur.\n  The goal of this bill is simple: To deliver on Congress' longstanding \ncommitment to open WIPP by 1998.\n  This bill amends the Waste Isolation Land Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal \nAct of 1992 in several very significant ways.\n  It deletes obsolete language in the 1992 act. Of particular \nimportance is the reference and requirements for test phase activities. \nSince the enactment of the 1992 act, the Department of Energy [DOE] has \nabandoned the test phase that called for underground testing in favor \nof above-ground laboratory test programs. Thus the test phase no longer \nexists as defined in the 1992 law and needs to be removed so it does \nnot complicate the ongoing WIPP process.\n  Most important, this amendment will streamline the process, remove \nduplicative regulations, save taxpayers dollars--currently, the costs \nof simply watching over WIPP exceed $20 million per month.\n  This bill does not remove EPA as the DOE regulator of the WIPP. DOE \nhas stated numerous times that it does not want to self-regulate. The \nDepartment believes that having EPA as the regulator will instill \nadditional public confidence in the certification process and the \nfacility itself, once it opens.\n  I am skeptical regarding EPA. EPA has a poor record of meeting \ndeadlines. The WIPP, as a facility, is ready to operate now and is \nbasically waiting on EPA's final approval. The schedule DOE has \nestablished to meet the opening dates is an aggressive timetable. It is \nsuccessful only if EPA can accomplish its tasks on time. I strongly \nencourage them to do so.\n  Idaho and the Nation need to have the WIPP opened sooner rather than \nlater. Each day of delay is costly (nearly $1 million per day in \ntaxpayers' dollars), and the potential dangers to the environment and \nhuman health resulting from the temporary storage of this waste \ncontinue.\n  It is time to act. We must, if we are to clean up sites such as the \nIdaho National Engineering Laboratory. We must act to dispose of this \nnuclear waste permanently and safely for future generations. The \npassage of this Defense authorization bill clears the way for that to \nhappen.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for the \nfiscal year 1997 Defense authorization conference report. The conferees \nhave done an admirable job of crafting a well-balanced bill that will \nensure our national defense needs are met in the coming fiscal year.\n  At $265.6 billion for fiscal year 1997, the conference report is \n$11.2 billion above the President's budget request. Much of the \nadditional funds will go toward much-needed weapons modernization, with \n$6 billion more for procurement and $3 billion more for research and \ndevelopment. Despite the increase over the budget request, however, the \nbill is actually $7.4 billion below the\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nfiscal year 1996 spending level for Defense in real terms. The \nconference report authorizes a responsible level of defense spending \ngiven the threats to our national security which exist in the post-cold \nwar era.\n  The conference report preserves our readiness to respond quickly to \nmilitary emergencies like the one precipitated within the past 2 weeks \nby Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It emphasizes modernization and new weapons \nprocurement in an effort to begin turning around the steep 71 percent \ndecline in funding for military procurement over the last 10 years. It \nalso continues crucial research and development of promising new \ndefense technologies. These programs include the design of an effective \nballistic missile defense system, quieter submarines, and multi-use \nfighter aircraft.\n  While effective and state-of-the-art military hardware are crucial to \nmaintaining our defense advantage, the best military equipment in the \nworld is of little value without the highly-trained and hard-working \nservice men and women on whom the success of our national defense \nultimately depends. I am therefore pleased that the conference report \nauthorizes a number of initiatives directly benefiting military \npersonnel, retirees, and their families. Among these are a 3-percent \nmilitary pay raise, a 4.6-percent increase in the basic allowance for \nquarters, $466 million for new housing, and a dental insurance plan for \nretired service members and their families. My one regret is that the \nconference agreement dropped the Murray-Snowe amendment adopted by the \nSenate which would have repealed the ban on abortions at overseas \nmilitary hospitals.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the conference report \nsupports a strong and efficient Aegis destroyer program. Bath Iron \nWorks of Maine is one of two private shipyards which build this \nimportant Navy ship. The conference report authorizes $3.4 billion for \nfour guided-missile Aegis destroyers in fiscal year 1997 and $520 \nmillion in advanced procurement for an additional Aegis destroyer in \nfiscal year 1998. I am particularly gratified that the conference \nreport includes approval for the Navy to implement a stable three-ship-\nper-year procurement plan for the Aegis from 1998 through 2001. The \nplan will result in efficiencies that will save $1 billion in \nconstruction costs for the Aegis destroyer.\n  The end of the cold war has uncapped a host of long-simmering \nregional conflicts around the globe, some of which have threatened \nimportant U.S. interests. Combined with the proliferation of nuclear \nand missile technology as well as chemical and biological weapons, \nthese limited conflicts carry the potential for far wider consequences. \nI am pleased that the conference report includes $122 million to \nstrengthen our domestic preparedness against the use of nuclear, \nchemical, or biological weapons. We must recognize that the world is \nstill a dangerous place and that maintaining a high level of military \npreparedness must continue to be a national priority.\n  The fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization conference report will \nmaintain the strength of our national defense forces for the coming \nyear. I urge that it be adopted.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I commend the fine leadership of Chairman \nStrom Thurmond of South Carolina and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. \nTogether, they worked to achieve strong bipartisan support of this \nyear's Defense authorization bill.\n  The conference bill before us provides for an $11.2 billion increase \nto the President's Defense budget request. The increase, when adjusted \nfor inflation, is still $7.4 billion less than last year's Defense \nbudget. I wish to stress this point because the trend toward lower \ndefense spending is an issue that concerns me. Given the uncertainties \nand adversaries our Nation will continue to face, slashing defense \nspending or force structure without a coherent military strategy is not \nthe answer to preserving our military superiority into the 21st \ncentury. By the same token, the familiar path of the past--as \nconvenient as it may be--will be less likely to lead us to the future \nwe hope to shape. In that regard, I believe much debate remains in \naddressing the future of our national defense.\n  This bill addresses many of the fundamental concerns of our military. \nIt will improve the quality of life of our Armed Forces by increasing \ntheir pay and authorizing the construction of new barracks and military \nfamily housing. It also moves to address the critical modernization \nissues our military's senior leadership raised during their testimony \nbefore Congress this year. In that regard, the bill supports the Army's \nefforts toward battlefield digitization, modernization of tactical \naircraft for the Air Force and Navy, and funds the modernization of our \nNational Guard and Reserves.\n  Also included in this bill is what I consider to be a major step \nforward in the debate over the future of our Armed Forces in meeting \nthe national security requirements of our Nation. The Military Force \nStructure Review Act of 1996 is a provision I cosponsored with Senator \nLieberman, Senator McCain, Senator Robb, and many other distinguished \ncolleagues in the Senate. This act will establish an independent \nnonpartisan, nine-member National Defense Panel that will conduct a \nlong-range assessment of future threats, military force structure, and \noperational concepts in support of our national security strategy. It \nis our hope that this panel will challenge the Defense Department to be \nmore forward thinking as it moves beyond the Bottom-Up Review, and \ndevelops a strategic construct to guide our military forces into the \nnext century.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us addresses critical issues facing \nour men and women in uniform--improving readiness, their quality of \nlife, and their need to modernize weapons systems in order to keep pace \nwith rapid technological changes. As recent events have demonstrated, \nour military must be ready and capable of responding to myriad, \nuncertain threats. We must be willing to provide our military with the \nfunding they need today, and tomorrow, to prepare for these unforeseen \ncontingencies. I urge the final passage of the Defense authorization \nconference bill for 1997.\n\n\n         Amendment to Prohibit Criminal Bomb-Making Instruction\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my great concern and \ndisappointment with the conferees named by the other body who insisted \non striking section 1088 of the Senate's DOD authorization bill. \nSection 1088, an amendment by Senator Biden and myself would have \nprohibited teaching bombmaking for criminal purposes.\n  As my colleagues will recall, this amendment was accepted in the \nSenate as part of the antiterrorism bill last summer in addition to \nbeing part of the Senate DOD authorization bill. Regrettably, as \nhappened this time, the other body dropped it from the bill.\n  The bombing in Centennial Olympic Park is only the most recent pipe \nbombing. In just 10 days, from July 21 to July 31, my staff found seven \nnewspaper accounts of bombing incidents.\n  A 15-year-old boy, in Irving, TX, blew off three fingers with a bomb \nhe learned to make using the Anarchist's Cookbook from the Internet.--\nDallas Morning News, July 26, 1996.\n  A high school student from Providence, RI, assembled a foot-long bomb \nafter obtaining instructions from the Internet.--Newsday, July 28, \n1996.\n  A 16-year-old boy from Plainview, TX, lost a finger when a homemade \nbomb exploded. The Bomb was made using information from the Internet.--\nNewsday, July 28, 1969.\n  In Pennsylvania, three teenagers carrying a list of 20 ingredients \nneeded to build a bomb were arrested after breaking into the Penncrest \nHigh School chemistry lab. They downloaded this list from the \nInternet.--Chicago Tribune, July 23, 1996.\n  In Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, sheriff's officials believe information \navailable over the Internet was used in a series of pipe bombings which \ndestroyed four mailboxes, a guard shack and a car. Four teenagers were \narrested in this case.--Los Angeles Times, July 27, 1996.\n  In Orange County, CA, police believe four teenagers used the Internet \nto get instructions on building acid-filled bottle bombs. One of those \nbombs burned a 5-year-old boy at a school playground in April.--Los \nAngeles Times, July 27, 1996.\n  A 23-year old man, from Torrance, CA, used a 10-inch-long pipe bomb \nwhich blew out three windows in his home. He obtained the bomb making \ninstructions from a manual on homemade bombs.--Los Angeles Times, July \n27, 1996.\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\n  In addition to the explicit explanations on how to make all sorts of \nbombs, the Terrorist's Handbook, downloaded by my staff from the \nInternet, also encourages criminal behavior. Let me read a section \nentitled, ``Checklist for Raids on Labs.''\n\n       In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize \n     that if he/she wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or \n     she will have to steal the chemicals to make the explosive \n     from a lab.\n\n  This section ends with the needed lists of solid and liquid chemicals \nneeded to make most bombs.\n  This amendment would have prohibited the teaching of bomb making if a \nperson intends or knows that the bomb will be used for a criminal \npurpose. Additionally, the amendment prohibits the distribution of \ninformation on how to make a bomb if a person intends or knows that the \ninformation will be used for a criminal purpose.\n  This information is not something that one would use for a legitimate \npurpose or information that can be found in a chemistry textbook on the \nback shelf of a university library.\n  What my amendment targets is detailed information that is made \navailable to any would-be criminal or terrorist, with the intended \npurpose of teaching someone how to blow things up in the commission of \na serious and violent crime--to kill, injure, or destroy property.\n  This provision could give law enforcement another tool in the war \nagainst terrorism--to combat the flow of information that is used to \nteach terrorist and other criminals how to build bombs.\n  Some question the constitutionality of this provision. Common sense \nshould tell us that the first amendment does not give someone the right \nto teach someone how to kill other people.\n  The right to free speech in the first amendment is not absolute. \nThere are several well known exceptions to the first amendment which \nlimit free speech. These include: Obscenity; child pornography; clear \nand present dangers; commercial speech; defamation; speech harmful to \nchildren; time, place and manner restrictions; incidental restrictions; \nand radio and television broadcasting.\n  I do not for 1 minute believe that the Framers of the Constitution \nmeant for the first amendment to be used to protect the teaching of \nmethods to injure and kill.\n  However, knowing that there would be concern over the first \namendment, I carefully crafted this amendment with constitutional \nscholars. I'd like to read you some of what they said about this \namendment.\n\n       I think the language . . . is about as tight as it could be \n     . . . the reasonable-knowledge, explosive materials, and \n     furtherance-of-a-criminal purpose language is all clear \n     enough; these are legal terms of art and unlikely to be found \n     void for vagueness.--Richard Delgado, University of Colorado \n     at Boulder.\n       The rigorously-protected talk anticipated by the first \n     amendment is, in brief, political discourse, in the widest \n     sense of that term. This kind of talk does not include \n     routine commercial speech (including advertisements), \n     pornography and obscenity, planning for criminal activity, \n     and related forms of expression. Commonsense distinctions \n     should be apparent here. These distinctions would rule out \n     anyone's instructing others in how to make explosives, \n     especially when it is known to the instructor that the \n     explosives being talked about are to be made and used by his \n     students as part of an illegal enterprise.--George \n     Anastaplo, Loyola University of Chicago.\n       Some civil libertarians attempt to immunize virtually all \n     talk from government regulation, but a stable community would \n     be difficult if not impossible if this should ever become the \n     rule. Others have gone so far as to justify actions, \n     including some violent actions, as forms of expression that \n     are entitled to freedom-of-speech protection. But even these \n     theorists are reluctant to argue that blowing up public \n     buildings should be considered a form of expression protected \n     by the First Amendment.--George Anastaplo, Loyola University \n     of Chicago.\n\n  In today's day and age when violent crimes, bombings and terrorist \nattacks are becoming too frequent, and when technology allows for the \ndistribution of bombmaking material over computers to millions of \npeople across the country in a matter of seconds, some restrictions are \nappropriate. Specifically, I believe that restricting the availability \nof bombmaking information, if there is intent or knowledge that the \ninformation will be used for a criminal purpose, is both appropriate \nand required in today's day and age.\n  My amendment to this bill was an important, balanced measure to \nconfront the problems presented by today's rapid growth in technology, \nand I am extremely disappointed that it was removed during conference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1997 has the principal goal of funding our Armed Forces \nto keep them the best-trained, best-equipped, best led, and most ready \nmilitary in the world. In large measure, the bill is well-designed to \nachieve this goal, and I support it.\n  Nonetheless, I am concerned about the inclusion in this bill of over \n$11 billion in spending authority above the amount requested by the \nPresident. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ntestified that the budget presented by the President is enough to \nprovide fully for the defense needs of the Nation during the next \nfiscal year. The $11.3 billion added to the budget far exceeds those \nneeds. The authorized level is a ceiling, and I urge the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense to exercise their authority to spend at a \nlower level than provided in this bill.\n  On arms control, the conference took an important step by refusing to \nadopt provisions that would have infringed on the President's \nconstitutional treaty-making authority, and that would also have \nundermined the ABM Treaty, the cornerstone of nuclear arms control. The \nHouse provisions would have undermined U.S. leadership at the very \nmoment when we stand on the threshold of achieving the most important \nnuclear arms control agreement of the post-cold-war era, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The bill also authorizes $365 million for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Programs, under which the United States works with the \nStates of the former Soviet Union to reduce the nuclear threat to all \nnations. It also provides funds for new programs to improve our ability \nto prevent attacks using weapons of mass destruction.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees rejected several objectionable \nprovisions contained in the House version of the authorization bill. \nOne House provision would have required the mandatory discharge of all \nservice members who are HIV-positive. This discriminatory provision \nwould have singled out HIV-positive men and women from among the much \nlarger pool of service members who suffer from chronic medical \nconditions, yet who can still serve in many worthwhile capacities. The \nHouse provision was motivated by bigotry, and the conferees treated it \nappropriately by dropping it from the conference report.\n  The conference report also excludes the House repeal of the \nDepartment's don't ask/don't tell policy on gays in the military. This \nprovision would have reinstated the practice of antigay witch hunts \nabolished by the Clinton administration. In this instance too, the \nconferees were right to drop the House provision.\n  Despite these positive elements, there are two other objectionable \naspects to this bill that cannot be overlooked.\n  First, the conference report does not adopt the Senate provision \nrepealing the current ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. \nmilitary facilities overseas. This provision would ensure that women in \nthe armed forces serving overseas can exercise their constitutional \nright to choose safe abortion procedures.\n  Our servicewomen should not lose rights granted by the Constitution \nwhen they serve their country in foreign lands. This is a basic issue \nof fairness. Women in the armed forces serve on military bases around \nthe world to protect our freedoms. But they are denied access to the \nsame range and quality of health services that they could obtain in the \nUnited States. In many countries where our forces serve, adequate care \nis difficult to obtain in the best of circumstances, and in many cases \nit is not available at all.\n  Without adequate care, abortion can be a life-threatening or \npermanently disabling procedure. We can easily avoid such risks by \nmaking the health facilities at U.S. overseas bases available for this \nprocedure and it is irresponsible not to do so.\n  In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there are \ntravel costs, delays, and privacy violations that women serving in the \nUnited States do not have to endure and should not have to endure while \nserving overseas.\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n  A woman's decision to seek an abortion is difficult and personal. It \nis unfair and unreasonable to continue to make this decision even more \ndifficult and dangerous for women who serve our country overseas. \nCongress should be protecting constitutional rights of women in the \narmed forces, not turning them into second class citizens.\n  Finally, I commend Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn for their \nleadership in achieving this bill. This is Senator Nunn's last Defense \nAuthorization Act. We have served together on the Armed Services \nCommittee for 14 years, and it is obvious that his reputation for \nfairness and integrity, and as the Senate's preeminent expert on \nnational defense is eminently deserved. The entire Senate, the entire \nNation, and the entire free world will miss him.\n  In addition, our colleagues, Senator Exon and Senator Cohen will be \nending their long, outstanding service on the committee at the end of \nthis season. Senator Exon, as ranking member, and formerly chairman, of \nthe Strategic Forces Subcommittee, has worked to defend our Nation \nagainst nuclear threats. In particular, his leadership on achieving a \nnuclear testing moratorium and support for a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty have brought us to the threshold of an international treaty to \nban nuclear explosions.\n  As ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have had the honor \nto work closely with Chairman Cohen. He is an able leader on defense \nissues, resourceful, and has worked tirelessly to ensure a strong \nnational defense. I commend him for his leadership and commitment, and \nI wish him well in his career beyond the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, since both sides are using this quorum \nto their advantage, I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally \ndivided to each side when we are in a quorum so no one side will be \nunduly punished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the able Senator from Oklahoma \nsuch time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for \nyielding to me and for the fine job that he has done in preparation on \nhis committee of the Department of Defense authorization bill. It has \nbeen a very difficult and arduous time that we have had in trying to \nget this done with objections from the White House every step of the \nway.\n  Since the beginning of our country's history, national security has \nbeen our Government's most solemn obligation to its citizens. In order \nto honor this obligation, sufficient resources must be given to the \nforces that protect us. These forces do not ask much of us for their \nservice. But they do need a certain amount of support from their \nGovernment in order to carry out their duties and protect the security \nof the United States as well as maintain our status as the world's \npreeminent military power.\n  In order to allow our military to honor their sworn duty, we have to \nprovide them with the means to do many things. We must give them the \nauthority to retain ample manpower in the form of adequate end \nstrengths. Our military must have the means to recruit high-quality \npersonnel to carry us into the 21st century. In addition, in order to \nkeep our high-quality personnel, and protect the high quality of life \nwhich is so important in maintaining morale, we must provide them with \nequitable pay and benefits--including a 3-percent pay raise to protect \nagainst inflation--and appropriate levels of funding for the \nconstruction and maintenance of troop billets and military family \nhousing.\n  We must keep the sword sharp by providing enough resources to \nmaintain current readiness, and to continue modernization efforts to \nprovide the capabilities needed for future wars. Our military must also \nbe given the means to field the type and quantity of weapons systems \nand equipment needed to fight and win battles decisively, with minimal \nrisk to our troops, just as they did in the gulf war.\n  An important lesson learned in the gulf war was that we need to be \nable to protect our troops from ballistic missiles, missiles that are \ncapable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Whether it is \nnuclear, chemical, or biological, we must protect our forces while they \nare in the field and we must protect their families at home. The way we \ndo this is through the development and deployment of missile defense \nsystems: land- and sea-based theater missile defense systems, which can \nprotect U.S. and allied forces against cruise and ballistic missiles \nwhile deployed in the field; and a national missile defense system to \ndefend America itself.\n  The missile defense funding authorized in this bill is not sufficient \nto put in place the robust system I would like to see. It is a life \nsupport program, designed to keep as much of our program viable until a \nRepublican President is elected. At that point, we will be able to move \nmore aggressively toward building a national missile defense system, \njust as the American people expect us to.\n  We know that most Americans think we have a missile defense \ncapability, and we know that they are outraged and frightened when they \nlearn that we do not. They hear the administration cite intelligence \nestimates to justify waiting and waiting on missile defense. But any \nAmerican who witnessed Pearl Harbor in 1941, or the invasion of South \nKorea in 1950, or the invasion of Kuwait in 1990--and that's most of \nus, Mr. President--knows that intelligence estimates are wrong as often \nas they are right, and that even good intelligence gets misread by \npolitical leaders. I would rather have a defense and hope my \nintelligence was correct than have complete faith in intelligence; the \nClinton administration apparently disagrees.\n  I am particularly concerned by this emphasis on future threats \nbecause the administration uses it to justify doing nothing. They say \nthat the missile threat isn't here yet. But isn't defense all about \ngetting out in front of threats? And what about the technology that \nthreatens us today? Russia and China have missiles--in the case of \nRussia, thousands of missiles--which could be accidentally fired at us \ntoday.\n  More than 20 other nations are developing the technology. Terrorists \nand rogue nations, with enough money and some perseverance, will buy \ntheir way into the nuclear club. And until we get a missile defense \nsystem in place, there will be nothing we can do about it.\n  Missile defense is complex. Sophisticated defense technology is \nseldom produced precisely on schedule. This is why we need to start \nnow. We will have a national missile defense system; the question is \nwhether or not it will be before or after the first time we need it.\n  I have spoken about what we must provide for our military. I would \nalso like to point out what burdens we should remove from them. We can \neliminate defense spending that does not contribute directly to the \nnational security of the United States; such as policing of the Olympic \ngames. More importantly, we should stand back and evaluate U.S. \ninvolvement in nontraditional military operations, and its impact on \ncombat readiness, budgeting, and our national interests. Bosnia, \nSomalia, and Haiti; these and other police actions--some of them going \non today--drain defense funds and put a strain on personnel who are \nalready being stretched beyond their breaking point.\n  In this part of our foreign policy, mistakes have certainly been \nbipartisan. George Bush, a Republican President, began the Somalia \ncommitment. It took a humiliating defeat and the\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\ndeaths of 18 Rangers in Mogadishu for us to learn about the limits of \nthat humanitarian operation. Operations in Bosnia will have cost \nAmerican taxpayers more than $3.5 billion in defense dollars if our \ntroops leave by December. I say ``if'' because neither I nor anyone \nelse in this body believes we will be out of Bosnia by December. The \nAmerican people were truly deceived by the administration on this \ncommitment.\n  I went to Bosnia last November, before the IFOR mission began, and I \nwatched experienced U.N. and NATO leaders laugh at the idea that we \nwould be through in Bosnia after 1 year. One U.N. commander, General \nHuakland of Norway, said that involvement in Bosnia was like putting \nyour hand in water--when you take it out, nothing is different. If the \nadministration intends to keep troops in Bosnia longer, they owe it to \nus and to the American people to say so before our Presidential \nelection. But I do not expect them to shoot straight on this, either.\n  Some people, it seems, never seem to see a breaking point for our \nmilitary. They say we are spending enough on defense. I have criticized \nthe administration's defense priorities, but I am also dismayed by some \nof the voices I have heard in this chamber. I cannot believe that some \nof my colleagues believe their own antidefense rhetoric. Let me examine \nsome of the most common attacks on this responsible defense budget that \nI've heard recently, four arguments that we hear over and over and over \nagain:\n  First: ``This is money the Pentagon has not asked for.'' My liberal \nfriends make this statement as if they believe that the defense budget \nrequest is decided by admirals and generals based on what they need to \nfight and win wars.  In fact, because each of the services and the \nDepartment of Defense itself is run by administration-appointed \ncivilians, the Pentagon's budget request is based on the \nadministration's priorities. It is then modified by Congress, just like \nevery other Government agency's budget.\n  It is the Congress' constitutional responsibility to review and \neither increase or decrease this and all department budgets based on \nour view of the Nation's needs. Congress never blindly accepts the \nPentagon budget request. When the Reagan administration asked for \nincreases in the defense budget in the 1980's, my liberal colleagues \nnever suggested that the Congress accept them without argument. That \nis exactly the kind of argument we're having today--the President \nthinks we should continue to cut defense sharply, and we disagree. It \nis our view that military spending has been cut too deeply and is well \nbelow the minimum required for a sound national defense.\n\n  The fact is that the real Pentagon agrees with us. This year the four \nservice chiefs, in a public repudiation of the administration, made it \nclear that they need $20 billion a year more in procurement funding \nthan what the Clinton administration has requested. Each warned of the \ndire consequences of the continued aging of their weapons and \nequipment. So when we consider ``what the Pentagon asked for,'' I \nintend to listen to the chiefs who have made a career of preparing for \nwar, not the President's political appointees.\n  Second: ``This budget focuses on the wrong threats.'' Of course there \nare growing unconventional threats to the United States and her \ncitizens, including terrorism and information warfare. In fact, some of \nour additional spending on R & D is going toward programs such as \ncounter proliferation support and chemical and biological defense. But \nwe should not be forced to choose which threat to remain exposed to--as \nwe address these new threats, we have to still be prepared for \nconventional warfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that defense spending is not an \ninvestment, but an insurance policy. And we need different kinds of \ninsurance. Their odds of having a car accident may be far greater than \nthe odds that their house will burn down, but most Americans have both \ncar and fire insurance. This same logic underlies our continued \nreadiness on conventional threats even as we prepare for the \nunconventional threats of the future.\n  Third: ``Why buy advanced weapons when American weapons are already \nthe best in the world?'' It is true that American weapons are the best \nin the world today. But as threats evolve and weapons technology \nthroughout the world improves, we must stay ahead. When we go to war, \nwe don't want a fair fight--we want to overwhelm the enemy with speed, \nstealth, and lethality. This costs money, but what is our alternative? \nTo ask our troops to get closer to the enemy, to expose themselves more \nto enemy fire, to fight longer and harder in order to win?\n  We need look no further than the gulf war. We sent a half-million \ntroops to the other side of the world, where they won a major land war \nin less than 100 hours of ground combat. We suffered 146 killed and 354 \nwounded in that war, and mourned each and every one of them. But how \nmany more would we have lost if we had not invested billions in the \n1980's in stealthy aircraft, cruise missiles, Aegis ships, and advanced \nland combat systems? We bought those weapons in the 1980's at a time \nwhen we also had the most technologically advanced force in the world, \nand many opponents of the Reagan budgets criticized those purchases. In \nthe end, I would argue that President Bush was very lucky to fight his \nwar with Ronald Reagan's military. I often wonder how a future \nPresident will feel about fighting a war with Bill Clinton's military.\n  Fourth: ``We spend far more on defense than other countries.'' Of \ncourse we spend more money on defense than other countries. But there \nare two problems with this comparison: it assumes that all countries \nare equal, and it suggests that the comparison between how much the \nUnited States spends versus other nations, accurately predicts which \nside will prevail in conflict.\n  But because of geography, all things aren't equal. We are separated \nfrom our potential enemies by two great oceans. And rather than \nfighting wars in our own backyard, Americans prefer to fight over \nthere. Because we prefer to fight abroad, it will naturally cost us \nmuch more than it costs our enemies to field the same force, since we \nhave to transport, sustain, and operate our fighting force in a place \nwhere the enemy already is.\n\n  Each of these activities--moving, sustaining, and fighting far away--\nincreases the cost of our military without significantly changing the \nfriendly-to-enemy force ratio. This cost is raised further if we want \nto field a force that is not just equivalent to our enemy's, but one \nthat can defeat his force with minimal casualties, just as we did in \nthe gulf war. The question, therefore, is not whether we will be paying \nmore for our Armed Forces than our enemy does, but rather how much more \nwe must pay. Is the right number three times as much, as with Russia, \nor more?\n  More than 2,000 years ago, Sun Tzu said you should have five times \nthe strength of an enemy to assure success. Well, there have been some \nchanges in warfare since Sun Tzu's time. We now have tanks, and planes, \nand submarines, so the ratio has changed a little. And we can stand \nhere and argue until we are blue in the face over what the proper force \nlevel is; two times, three times, five times as much as the other guy. \nBut the cost of our unique geography makes any comparison between what \nwe pay and what our enemies pay irrelevant. The point is: if you want \nto fight over there, and win, decisively, with minimal losses, then you \ncan expect to pay many times what the enemy pays for his military. So \nthis argument is cruel and invalid.\n  Now, the people who make these and other statements about this \ndefense bill are smart. They know that we must cross our oceans to \nfight. They know that what we consider defense spending may not be what \nour enemies consider defense spending: First, there is the high cost of \nour high-quality volunteer military: recruiting, paying, providing \nmedical care, and retirement. Many people don't realize it, but two-\nthirds of our defense budget is spent on paying people. Then there is \nthe cost of supporting our world-wide surveillance network, our nuclear \ndeterrent and so on. They know these costs are unique to the United \nStates but they choose to ignore it in their arguments. Why? Because it \nsupports their view of proper levels of defense spending. We can \ndisagree about what it takes to field a given capability, but we should \ndrop these invalid comparisons and deal with the facts.\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\n  As we prepare to vote on the fiscal year 1997 Defense bill, I am \ntruly concerned about the effects that decreasing levels of defense \nspending have had upon our armed forces. If the general public fully \nunderstood the severity of defense cuts under the Clinton \nadministration, they would be outraged. In my State of Oklahoma, I have \nheard this message already. We can see the cuts all around us and it is \ntime to put these reckless defense cuts to an end. History has \ndemonstrated that superpower status cannot be sustained cheaply, nor \ncan it be sustained by budget requests which do not provide for \nadequate funding of our forces. I am committed to maintaining America's \nsuperpower status, just as I am convinced that the Clinton \nadministration is not.\n  I was deeply disappointed by the administration's fiscal year 1997 \nbudget request for defense spending. The administration's fiscal year \n1997 budget request was $18.6 billion less in real terms than the level \nenacted for fiscal year 1996. In real terms, since the end of World War \nII, there have only been 5 years that the United States has spent less \nthan the Clinton administration is recommending for fiscal year 1997. \nOnly in fiscal year 1947, fiscal year 1948, fiscal year 1949, fiscal \nyear 1950, those years immediately following World War II, and fiscal \nyear 1955 immediately after the Korean war, has defense spending been \nless than the President's recommendation for this year. Not even during \nthe hollow force years of the 1970s, when we could not afford spare \nparts to keep our equipment running, have we spent so little on \ndefense. Clearly, it is the responsibility of Congress to address these \nshortcomings.\n  Now we know that events in the Persian Gulf over the past several \ndays have gotten President Clinton's attention. He appears to have \nreversed his earlier threat to veto this bill. But I wonder if he has \nconsidered the deeper ramifications of Saddam Hussein's recent \nactivity. This latest round of cruise missiles has reminded me of two \nbasic facts. One, of course, is that the Persian Gulf, like many other \nregions, remains a very unstable place. The second is that we must be \nprepared to project power on the other side of the world on very short \nnotice.\n\n  It is one thing to throw a few cruise missiles at easily identified \ndesert targets. But what if more is required? What if the missiles do \nnot stop Saddam's advance? Then we are right back where we were in \n1990--we must build up a force, move it to the gulf, and fight Saddam \nHussein the old fashioned way, of course with overwhelming firepower, \nbut also perhaps man to man and tank to tank.\n  My friends, should this worst-case scenario arise, we will have a \nproblem. Why? Because, in terms of military strength, we are not right \nback where we were in 1990. In fact, we aren't even close. Listen \ncarefully! We fought Desert Storm with 11 Army divisions plus two \nlarger Marine divisions, 10 Air Force tactical fighter wings, and 6 \ncarriers, and 100 ships from the Navy. We drew this Desert Storm force \nfrom an Army with 28 divisions, an Air Force with 38 tactical fighter \nwings, and a Navy with 15 carriers and 566 ships.\n  But look at today's numbers: instead of 28 Army divisions in 1991, we \nhave just 15 today; instead of 38 Air Force wings, we have 20 today; \nand instead of 566 ships and 15 carriers, our Navy has roughly 350 \nships and 12 carriers today. This means, for example, that while we \nused about 42 percent of the Army's combat power in 1991, we would use \nmore than 70 percent today. So what would we fight a second war with?\n  It only gets worse--these comparisons assume that the \nadministration's budgets will hold our forces at today's levels. But \nmost outside analysis--General Accounting Office, Heritage Foundation--\nshows that the Clinton 5-year budget plan is more than $150 billion \nshort of the amount needed to buy the force level that the President \nhimself says is necessary. This is worse than a difference of opinion \nover priorities--this mismatch between what we say we will do and what \nwe actually can do is dangerous. It undermines confidence among our \nallies, invites miscalculation by the Saddam Husseins of the world, and \ngives the American people a false sense of security. No government \nshould do this.\n  It is our duty, as U.S. Senators, to do our part in providing for our \nnational security. In doing our part, we must vote for a defense bill \nwhich gives our military the means to do their part. Our forces do not \nask much of us for their service, but they do need a certain amount of \nsupport from their Government in order to carry out their duties and \nprotect the security of the United States of America.\n  I feel it is time we take a more responsible approach to defending \nthis Nation. I urge my colleagues to make a good start, by supporting \nthe fiscal year 1997 DOD authorization bill and its attempt to slow the \nadministration's deep cuts to our Nation's military modernization. Even \nthis level of funding is inadequate; however, it is the best we will be \nable to do until we have a President who remembers that his first \nresponsibility is not to try to change Americans' behavior with \ngimmicks in the tax code, but to protect their lives, liberty, and \nproperty from threats around the globe.\n  As inadequate as it is, we must pass this defense authorization bill. \nIt is the best we can get until we change Presidents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nOklahoma for the excellent remarks he just made here on the floor of \nthe Senate on this bill. The Senator from Oklahoma is a member of the \nArmed Services Committee of the Senate, and a very valuable member. He \nhas made outstanding contributions to our defense on that committee. \nAgain, I commend him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Defense \nauthorization bill we have before us. I think it is an important step \nas we consider the appropriations bills that are left before us. I want \nto specifically commend the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Thurmond, the chairman, Senator Nunn, the ranking member, for \nbringing this bill to us.\n  I also want to specifically thank Senator McCain who worked on the \nfloor during Senate consideration of the authorization bill on both my \namendment on B-52's and on my national missile defense amendment.\n  I also want to commend those retiring members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Senator Bill Cohen, the chairman of the Seapower \nSubcommittee, announced he was not running for reelection. Senator \nCohen will be missed here in the U.S. Senate. He has always been \nsomebody who is respected on both sides of the aisle, someone who many \nof us look to for leadership not only on defense issues but others as \nwell.\n  Senator Exon of Nebraska, who is the ranking member on the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee, and the former chairman of that subcommittee, has \nannounced that he is retiring. And he, too, will be sorely missed in \nthis Chamber on both sides of the aisle. And, of course, Senator Nunn, \nthe ranking member and former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nwho has achieved respect not only in this Chamber but across the \ncountry as well as a defense expert.\n  I think we should also recognize the outstanding staffs that have \nworked on this legislation. I want to single out Les Brownlee, the \nmajority staff director, Eric Thoemmes, also on the majority side who \nwas very important in working with us on the amendments that I have \ntalked about, minority staff director Arnold Punaro, and minority \nstrategic forces expert Bill Hoehn. All of them we worked closely with \nin the development of this legislation. We appreciate their outstanding \nservice to the committee, to the Senate, and to the country.\n  Mr. President, I cannot help but respond to some of what I heard from \nmy colleague from Oklahoma. I am supporting this Defense authorization \nbill. I think it is the right course to take. But I must say, we ought \nto put some of this in perspective. I mean, we have to remember here \nthe cold war is over. We do not have any force on the face of the globe \nthat in any way rivals the\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\nmilitary strength of the United States. Thank goodness that is the \ncase, but it is the case. We also have to remember that we are still \nrunning budget deficits in this country, $116 billion in the current \nfiscal year.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to keep our eye on the ball. We just cannot \nspend money on everything everyone would like. And that includes our \narmed services. We have to make tough decisions. We have to stay on \nthis course of deficit reduction if we are to prevent fiscal calamity \nin the future.\n  It is true we have made enormous progress on the budget deficit. In \n1992 it was $290 billion. This year it is projected to be $116 billion, \na dramatic improvement, without question. But we also know that we face \nthe time bomb of the baby boom generation, and that requires us to \ncontinue to put spending under the microscope. We have to look at every \npart of the Federal budget, and that includes our defense budget. Let \nme just say that I think everybody in this Chamber understands that the \npressure will continue on every part of Federal spending, and that is \nas it should be.\n  Mr. President, there are some parts of this bill that I want to \ndiscuss specifically because I think they are critically important in \nlight of what has just happened with respect to the action in Iraq.\n  Section 1302 of the conference report wisely prohibits the retirement \nof any strategic systems pending Russian ratification of START II. But \nwe go even further with respect to our B-52's. Those bombers must be \nretained under these provisions whether or not START II is ratified in \nrecognition of their conventional capabilities.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I offered, that has been retained, \nstipulates that none of the 28 B-52's that were not funded in the \nDepartment of Defense request can be sent to the boneyard and that all \nmust be kept fleet standard in a fully maintained attrition reserve. I \nbelieve the recent cruise missile strikes in Iraq bring into sharp \nfocus why retention of these provisions in conference was wise.\n  Mr. President, if I could turn to the charts that I have brought with \nme, I would like to just point out for a moment the B-52 advantage--\nglobal reach, global power. Mr. President, in the recent action against \nIraq, the B-52's responded immediately from the United States. Naval \nvessels could only participate in cruise missile strikes because they \nhad completed a deployment process that can take days or even weeks. \nOther land and sea forces can take weeks or even months to arrive. The \nB-52 is able to be there in a matter of hours.\n  No. 2, B-52's did not require in-theater basing. The United States \ncould not use land-based forces in-theater because of political \nconsiderations. The B-52's can operate from the continental United \nStates and from bases in Guam and Diego Garcia, thousands of miles from \ncombat operations.\n  No. 3, the B-52's placed few lives at risk. Air, land, and sea forces \nin forward deployments involve hundreds of thousands of personnel in \ncombat operations. But more than one-quarter of the cruise missiles we \nfired in the first round were launched by only 14 Americans on two B-\n52's.\n  No. 4, B-52's were the least expensive system involved. Naval vessels \nand in-theater forces have large personnel complements and costly \nsupport requirements.\n  No. 5, the B-52 was the only bomber for the mission. The B-52 is the \nonly bomber that at this point carries cruise missiles.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense suggested that we not fund \n28 of our 94 B-52's. We believe that would have been a serious mistake. \nRetirement is clearly unnecessary. These B-52's have been \ncomprehensively upgraded. I have been told by the former head of Air \nCombat Command that these planes are good until the year 2035. Often we \nhear people say B-52's are older than the pilots flying them. Mr. \nPresident, that is with respect to the name plate on the B-52's. Many \nof these airframes were, it is true, constructed in the 1960's, but \nwhat people forget, there have been billions of dollars of upgrades to \nthese planes, including new skins, new everything.\n  Mr. President, General Loh, head of the Air Combat Command, told me \nthese planes are good until the year 2035 because, if you look at the \nlandings, you look at the flying hours, there are far fewer landings \nand flying hours on these airframes than on commercial planes. As a \nresult, these planes, with all of the upgrades that have been done, are \ngood until the year 2035. We should not be sending a single one of them \nto the bone yard.\n  Mr. President, in addition, reengining, the proposal by Boeing, could \nproduce $6 billion in savings, enough to finance retention of the 28 \nthat were unfunded in the DOD budget. This makes great sense to \nreengine these planes, put on commercial engines that will experience \nsome 40 percent in fuel savings, make these planes even more responsive \nand even longer lasting in our force inventory.\n  I believe that retirement of any of our B-52's would be ill-advised. \nI want to salute the committee for taking this position, as well. I \nbelieve it is unwise to retire B-52's for the following reasons:\n  No. 1, it endangers arms control. A B-52 retirement reduces Russia's \nincentive to ratify START II. We ought not to be taking down strategic \nsystems before there is a Russian ratification of START II. That makes \nno sense. I am very pleased that under the leadership of Senator \nThurmond and Senator Nunn, the committee has taken that position. That \nis a wise and prudent position. The committee ought to be saluted for \ntaking it.\n  No. 2, retirement of these strategic systems now preempts the 1997 \ndefense studies. We have major studies underway, Mr. President, to \ndetermine the appropriate force structure for the future. We ought not \nto preempt those studies now.\n  No. 3, to retire B-52's would sacrifice a superior global bomber. B-\n52's have a longer range than the B-1 or the B-2. They have the \ngreatest versatility because they are fully dual capable and the only \nbomber with cruise missiles allowing standoff operations, as we saw in \nthe Iraqi confrontation.\n  No. 4, they have the largest total payload of any bomber.\n  No. 5, they are the least costly to maintain and operate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, and perhaps most important, to reduce any of \nour bombers would only add to the existing bomber gap. Some have asked \nme, what do I mean by bomber gap? Mr. President, let me make clear, the \nBottom Up Review said we need at least 100 deployable bombers--100 \ndeployable bombers--in order to prevail in two MRC's simultaneously.\n  Mr. President, today we only have 92 deployable bombers, 92 \ndeployable; the Bottom Up Review said we need 100. Mr. President, to \nsend any bombers to the bone yard in this circumstance makes very \nlittle sense.\n\n  I might add that I believe the new efforts that are underway to \nevaluate our strategic systems will disclose that 100 deployable \nbombers are not sufficient. In fact, I believe 100 deployable bombers \nis sadly insufficient to meet the requirements of two MRC's. We will \nhave a chance at a later time to go into the assumptions that have been \nmade to establish the 100 deployable bombers as the appropriate target.\n  Mr. President, it certainly makes no sense to be adding to the bomber \ngap at a time when, I think, it is in great question whether or not 100 \ndeployable bombers is sufficient to meet the contingency of two MRC's.\n  Let me just close, Mr. President, by again thanking the committee \nleadership and the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee for \nworking with us to put together the Conrad amendment that calls for \nretaining our B-52 force and also for the national missile defense \nprovisions that are included in this conference report. I want to thank \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond. I want to thank the \nranking member, Senator Nunn, and I want to thank their very able and \nprofessional staffs for the assistance they have provided to us. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe the vote on this bill is set \nfor 2:15 tomorrow; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Arnold Punaro\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Arnold Punaro, the minority staff director.\n  At the close of this session, Arnold Punaro will be leaving the \nSenate after almost 24 years of service, both on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and on Senator Nunn's personal staff.\n  During his service on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Punaro served \nin the following positions: 1983 to 1987, minority staff director; 1987 \nto 1995, staff director; 1996 to the present, minority staff director.\n  Throughout his tenure on the committee, Mr. Punaro played a key \nsupporting role in virtually all legislation that the Armed Services \nCommittee considered, including the Goldwater-Nichols legislation and \ncreation of the Special Operation Command.\n  In addition to his superb work on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nPunaro serves in the Marine Corps Reserves. He currently holds the rank \nof brigadier general and is commanding general of the Marine Corps \nReserves Support Command.\n  Mr. President, I know I will be joined by all members of the Armed \nServices Committee in thanking Mr. Punaro, for his dedication and hard \nwork on behalf of our Armed Forces and for the service he has rendered \nto our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I wish him and his family continued success in the \nyears ahead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be granted to Marine Corps Lt. Mark Kerber. He is currently \npart of a fellowship program assigned to my office. He is a recent \ngraduate with distinction from the U.S. Naval Academy and next week \nwill actually be headed to basic training at Quantico and then the \nflight school at Pensacola.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am \npleased to rise in support of the 1997 Defense authorization conference \nreport.\n  The conference report takes a number of steps to strengthen our \nNation's defenses and improve the quality of life for our brave men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  The conference report authorizes a 3-percent pay raise for American \nmilitary personnel and a 4.6-percent increase in the basic allowance \nfor housing, an issue on which we have spent a great deal of time and \nwe know there certainly is a need.\n  The conference report provides $466 million for the construction of \nnew barracks, dormitories, and family housing.\n  The bill also continues efforts to address the No. 1 problem \nidentified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the lack of modernization of \nour military equipment. The bill provides for increased procurement of \nships and planes, missiles, trucks, communications systems, and night \nvision devices that our forces need to maintain the qualitative edge \nagainst possible foes.\n  The bill also increases funding for operations and maintenance to \nprovide training needed to keep our military forces ready for action.\n  The conference report also rectifies a past wrong by authorizing the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Medal of \nHonor to seven African-American soldiers who were denied this award \nafter World War II. While six of these awards will be awarded \nposthumously, the one living recipient, Vernon Baker, is a resident of \nSt. Maries, ID. I have spoken to Mr. Baker, and I can tell you of the \ngreat pride that he shares in knowing he will receive that award.\n  The bill also authorizes $5.5 billion, an increase of $100 million \nabove the President's request, for environmental cleanup and waste \nmanagement at Department of Energy facilities around the country.\n  The conference report reduces redundancies in existing law and \nstreamlines the regulatory process to expedite the opening of the Waste \nIsolation pilot project [WIPP] facility in the State of New Mexico. The \nbill also provides additional funding can make sure the WIPP facility \ncan accept waste on time.\n  The bill also provides greater authority for site managers at DOE \nfacilities to move funds from different accounts to address problems \ndeveloped during the fiscal year. This authority was requested by site \nmanagers at a hearing that I chaired earlier this year. We expect this \nincreased efficiency to save the taxpayers money.\n  The conference report also establishes technology demonstration zones \nat major DOE facilities to allow site managers to apply new \ntechnologies to the nuclear cleanup problems across the Department of \nEnergy complex.\n  The conference report also authorizes major privatization efforts at \nthe Hanford site and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to pay \nprivate contractors for the amount of waste treated.\n  At my request, the conference report creates a high-level commission \nto address the problem of recruiting the next generation of nuclear \nweapons scientists. This is another problem identified during this \nyear's hearings.\n  The conference report before the Senate is a good bill that reflects \nreasonable compromises between the House, the Senate, and the \nadministration. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. \nI was pleased to hear the President plans to sign this important piece \nof legislation.\n  I thank the able chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nStrom Thurmond, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Nunn, for \ntheir counsel and guidance throughout this difficult process. As \nalways, Chairman Thurmond's tireless leadership and his determination \nhave resulted in a strong Defense authorization bill reaching the \nSenate floor. Just as he has done through so many different periods of \nthis Nation's need when we have turned to strong individuals, once \nagain he is leading us, as he has done so many times in service to the \ncountry.\n  In addition, this is Senator Nunn's last defense authorization \nconference report. I feel honored to have served on the same committee \nas Senator Nunn. The knowledge and skill of the senior Senator from \nGeorgia will be missed, and the whole Senate and the Nation will feel \nhis absence.\n  This also will be the last conference report that will include the \nSenator from Maine, Senator Cohen. I can tell you, there have been \ntremendous insights and improvements that he has made throughout this \nprocess. Senator Cohen will be missed.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, Jim Exon, with whom I had the pleasure of \nserving--we had a particular trip in Russia, where we spoke to those \nthat head up the nuclear defenses there in Russia. Again, Senator Jim \nExon will be missed as well.\n  Also, I acknowledge the contributions of Senator Sheila Frahm, the \nSenator from Kansas, in her tenure in serving on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. We wish her the very best with her future as well.\n  In conclusion, as we saw last week in Iraq, despite the end of the \ncold war, the world remains a dangerous place. American military power \nis required to ensure stability and protect democracy and free trade. \nThere is no substitute for a strong America. The pending conference \nreport will ensure our military forces can respond to any threat to \nU.S. national interests. When we think about people in the military \nservices, such as Lt. Mark Kerber, we know it is our duty to make sure \nthey have the best training, equipment, and facilities so, when they \nrespond to any crisis anywhere in the world on behalf of this Nation, \nwe know they are doing it as the best.\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to express my appreciation to the able Senator \nfrom Idaho for the kind words he had to say about my service as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. Senator Kempthorne has been a \ndevoted, able member of that committee and has rendered the defense of \nthis country great service. Our country is indebted to him for all that \nhe has done to promote a strong defense in this Nation. Again, I am \nproud of his friendship and proud of his service to his Nation.\n  Mr. President, I understand this has been cleared on the other side \nof the aisle. I have been authorized to yield back all debate time on \nthe Defense authorization conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10036-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

EDWARD M. STRAW\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Vice Adm. \nEdward M. Straw, U.S. Navy, who will retire on October 25 after a \ndistinguished 35-year career. Admiral Straw will relinquish control of \nthe Defense Logistics Agency, which is also known as the DLA, on the \nday he retires. He has served as Director of the DLA since 1992.\n  DLA is the largest combat support agency in the Department of \nDefense. If it were a private company, it would be the 78th largest \ncompany in the Fortune 500. Admiral Straw's performance in directing \n50,000 civilian and military members, and in managing $14 billion in \nannual funding, has been recognized both inside the Department of \nDefense and in the private sector as a model of highly effective \nmanagement. Under his leadership, DLA became one of the first Federal \nagencies ever to win a Ford Foundation Innovations in Government Award.\n  During his tenure, Admiral Straw reengineered and completely revamped \nthe DLA. His fine efforts have saved our $10 billion to date, and are \nexpected to yield an additional $20 billion in savings and cost \navoidance over the next 6 years while significantly improving \nresponsiveness to customers.\n  Admiral Straw began his military service in 1961 when he was \ncommissioned upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy. He served \nnumerous sea duty assignments and held senior policy positions within \nthe Department of the Navy. These include Vice Commander, Comptroller \nand Chief Financial Officer of the Naval Supply Systems Command, and \nDirector of Supply Policy and Programs on the staff of the Chief of \nNaval Operations. In 1994, he organized and successfully conducted the \nDefense Performance Review. He will also receive the Society of \nLogistics Engineers' annual Founders' Award for 1996, later this year.\n  Mr. President, our Nation owes Admiral Straw its appreciation for his \ntruly distinguished service. I wish him and his wife, Chris, continued \nsuccess and happiness in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10047-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10047-S10048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, under a unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenate has obligated itself to consider the Chemical Weapons Convention \nlater this week.\n  The timing is fortuitous. Getting the Senate to this point has taken \nmuch longer than was needed or one would have hoped, but, if the Senate \ndoes indeed decide this week to consent to the ratification of the \nconvention, we will be in on the setting up of the organizations \nrequired by the convention--a conference of all the states parties, a \n41-member executive council, and a technical secretariat, which will be \nthe international body responsible for conducting verification \nactivities.\n  As of this point, 62 nations have ratified the convention. The \nconvention will enter into force l80 days after it gains the 65th \nparty. If the Senate acts now, our action will enable us to be in on \nevery aspect of the setting up of the convention. Moreover, we will \nsurely bring others with us and, thus, help ensure widespread adherence \nto the treaty and do much to ensure its effectiveness.\n  This treaty represents a serious and important step in our continuing \neffort to curb and to end the threats posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction to us, our friends and allies, and to the world.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention, when it enters into force, will ban \nthe production, acquisition, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.\n  In it each state party undertakes never, under any circumstances, to:\n  Develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, or retain chemical \nweapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to \nanyone;\n\n  Use chemical weapons;\n  Engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons; and\n  Assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any \nactivity prohibited to a state party under this convention.\n  It is very important that we be involved every step of the way. \nParticularly important is our involvement in a leading role during the \nl80-day period when so much is done to prepare for the entry into force \nof the treaty. Simply put, during this crucial period for the treaty, \nwe simply cannot afford to be on the outside looking in. If we stay \nout, we will have no say over the activities of the governing body. We \nwill not be involved in the establishment of the inspection regime, \nwhich, if done as envisaged, could be very important in providing \ninformation as to the presence or absence, worldwide, of chemical \nweapons programs. If we are not a party, we will certainly avoid having \nthe minor inconvenience of international inspections in our country, \nbut at the price of having no expert Americans on inspection teams \nworldwide looking for illicit chemical weapons activity.\n  These would be major prices to pay for failure to participate in this \nimportant undertaking. There is another major price to be made if we do \nnot become a party. Our failure to join the treaty would constitute a \nmajor body blow to our critically important chemical industry, which \nsupports ratification in overwhelming numbers.\n  The problem that failure to ratify would cause for the industry was \nput clearly to the Committee on Foreign Relations by the president of \nthe Chemical Manufacturers Association, Mr. Frederick Webber, who said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, honest businesses have nothing to fear from \n     this treaty. On the contrary, the real price to pay is for \n     not taking action. The United States, as I am sure you know, \n     is the world's preferred supplier of chemical products. \n     Chemical exports, last year, topped $60 billion. Indeed, we \n     are the leading exporting industry in America.\n       Those exports, that $60 billion figure, sustained 240,000 \n     high-paying American jobs throughout the land. That makes us \n     the nation's largest exporter. More than 10 cents of every \n     export dollar is a product of the chemical industry.\n       We are a fast, reliable, high-quality supplier to customers \n     in every corner of the globe. But we could lose that \n     distinction, we could lose it if the U.S. does not ratify the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       The Convention sharply restricts trade in chemicals with \n     countries who are not parties to the treaty. If the Senate \n     does not ratify, our customers will cut us off. They will \n     drop us, and find other suppliers.\n       Unfortunately, we will be lumped in the same categories as \n     nations like Libya, Iraq, and North Korea. We do not believe \n     this is an acceptable option.\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n       The critics like to say that this treaty imposes too many \n     burdens on business. They say that opening our plants to \n     inspections will mean forfeit our most important trade \n     secrets. It is a good story, if it were true, but it is not.\n       Yes, the Convention does open our plants to inspection. But \n     it also offers state-of-the-art protections for confidential \n     business information. This treaty will not reveal our \n     secrets.\n       Indeed, it will protect them. We know, because we helped \n     develop the inspection system. Then we put the system to the \n     test over and over again. We learned what works and what does \n     not. We found the gaps, and we believe that we have plugged \n     them.\n       Mr. Chairman, let me cut to the bottom line. The benefits \n     of this inspection system far outweigh the costs. The rewards \n     outweigh the risks. The treaty may not provide an iron-clad \n     guarantee that chemical weapons will not ever again be a \n     threat, but it does have teeth. It will provide a real \n     deterrent. It is the best available option.\n       The Convention strikes a balance. It is tough, but it is \n     fair. It is intrusive, but it is not stifling. It asks a lot, \n     but in return, it offers a significant reduction in the \n     threat of chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, I find the points raised by industry and the issue of \nU.S. involvement in activities that really are at the heart of our \nnational interests to constitute in themselves compelling reasons for \nus to be very, very careful before giving any serious thought to a \nturning down of this treaty. Today and over the next several days, I'm \nsure that Senators will be bombarded with arguments for and against \nthis treaty. I would like to draw my fellow Senators attention to a \nvery thoughtful analysis provided the committee by Dr. Brad Roberts \nthis year. Dr. Roberts, who has spent a considerable time assessing \nissues related to the treaty, spoke in full recognition of some of the \nconcerns that have been raised. He said:\n\n       In sum then, the CWC certainly is not perfect, and anybody \n     who has told you it is, is blowing smoke. The relevant \n     question for this committee, though, is simply: Is it good \n     enough? Is the treaty in the national interest?\n       If you believe, as I do, that it is better to narrow the \n     proliferation threat, than to let it spiral out of control, \n     which is where it is headed, that the only chemical weapons \n     that matter to the United States are those that pose real \n     military threats, that it is better to share verification and \n     compliance tasks and to have on-site access, than to go it \n     alone on these matters, that it is better to add relatively \n     modest regulatory burdens to industry than to jeopardize its \n     long-term competitiveness, that it is better to create more \n     tools to deal with the proliferation threat of the post-Cold \n     War than to have fewer, and if you agree that it is better to \n     share the burden of managing this problem than to saddle the \n     United States alone, then support the CWC.\n       It is not perfect, but it is largely up to us to define and \n     manage its risks through our military programs, our anti-\n     chemical protection systems, our own national verification \n     capabilities, a task that is far easier than coping with the \n     risks of a world of much broader chemical and perhaps \n     biological proliferation, and the difficult challenges that \n     would result to U.S. interests, capabilities, and leadership.\n\n  Mr. President, I know my fellow Senators will weigh this treaty very \ncarefully before deciding how they wish to vote. I deeply believe that \na positive vote is the correct one for our national interests. I hope \nvery much that most of my fellow Senators will reach the same \nconclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10047-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10048-S10049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STRENGTH FROM DIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a most insightful address on religious tolerance and freedom \ndelivered by Radm James R. Stark, president of the Naval War College, \nat Touro Synagogue in Newport, RI on August 25.\n  Admiral Stark has had a distinguished career, serving our Nation with \ngreat dedication and a strong commitment to the enduring principles \nupon which our country was founded. His address exemplified the \nprinciples of George Washington now memorialized today on the 30-cent \nstamp issued in August 1982 to commemorate the Touro Synagogue: ``To \nbigotry no sanctions. To persecution no assistance.'' These same words \nwere in George Washington's letter to Moses Seixas and the Touro \nSynagogue community.\n  Let me share Admiral Stark's concluding remarks:\n\n       Today, we have the opportunity to rejoice in the success of \n     the Touro congregation to be treated like any other citizens, \n     and to celebrate in the wisdom of George Washington and the \n     other founding fathers, who realized that our diversity did \n     not have to breed hate and suspicion and discrimination, that \n     our ``unlikeness'' did not prevent us from being good \n     citizens in a society of mutual trust, and respect, and \n     consideration. Rather than being a weakness, America's \n     diversity has become our strength.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Admiral Stark's remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Remarks of RADM. J.R. Stark, USN\n\n       Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so pleased to see \n     you all here. I want to start out by saying how honored I am \n     to be addressing you today.\n       When Governor Sundlun asked me to speak a few weeks ago, I \n     leaped at the opportunity--first, because I've been \n     interested in Touro Synagogue since I was first stationed in \n     Newport back in the '60's. And second, because we're here to \n     commemorate an event which is of such importance, that it \n     resonates still today across the length and breadth of \n     America.\n       That event was an exchange of letters between the warden of \n     Touro Synagogue and President George Washington over 200 \n     years ago. Some may say, what's the big deal? What's so \n     important about an exchange of letters? They're not even \n     legal documents. They're just a couple of pieces of paper, \n     written by people long dead--people who hadn't a clue about \n     life in the last 20th century, people who never imagined the \n     airplane, or the internet, or MTV. Even their language seems \n     stilted and old-fashioned--and the issue of religious freedom \n     really doesn't appear to be especially relevant today, does \n     it? So what?\n       But we know better, don't we. Those letters had an impact \n     that went far beyond the little community of 18th century \n     Newport. But, you know, this celebration is about more than \n     just letters. It's about 200 years of history, and a very \n     special, almost unique series of events that redirected that \n     history which took place here in the days when the United \n     States of America were still young and searching for what \n     this new concept called democracy really meant.\n       Several years ago, I was in command of a Navy cruiser on \n     its way from California to the Persian Gulf. It was a long \n     trip--it took us six weeks to sail halfway around the world. \n     And as we neared the end of our voyage, we stopped for fuel \n     in the ancient port of Cochin, on the southwest coast of \n     India. In the course of my visit, I was able to do some \n     sightseeing. I came across a Catholic church, nearly 500 \n     years old, where the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama was \n     buried in 1524, soon after ``discovering'' India. But I also \n     visited another building nearly twice as old. It was the \n     Jewish synagogue, which had been founded in first century \n     A.D. by Jews fleeing Jerusalem after the destruction of the \n     Second Temple--Herod's temple--by the Romans. To me, it was a \n     tangible illustration of how long and how far the Jewish \n     people have been forced to wander in their search for a \n     decent life.\n       Interestingly, history tells us that--except for their \n     periodic revolts in Judea--Jews fared well under the Roman \n     empire. They were merchants and craftsmen who were welcomed \n     wherever they settled. And by the end of the Roman era, \n     strong Jewish communities had sprung up all around the \n     Mediterranean. Even after the fall of Rome, Jewish \n     settlements continued to spread--first into Western Europe, \n     and then, after the 12th century, into the East.\n       But as time went by, the attitudes of their hosts changed. \n     The hard work, the education, the cohesion, and especially \n     the success of those Jewish communities created jealousy and \n     resentment. Jews who had been welcomed because they brought \n     needed skills and built the local economy gradually changed \n     from being neighbors to being outsiders, tolerated when \n     necessary and persecuted when it because convenient.\n       More and more restrictions were placed on Jews. As commerce \n     and skilled trades expanded during the Middle Ages, the guild \n     system was used to exclude Jews from a growing number of \n     vocations. They were prohibited from owning land. They were \n     restricted from universities. They were required to live in \n     certain urban districts--the ghettoes.\n       Rather then being the mainstay of regional and \n     international commerce, as they had been for centuries, in \n     many areas the only jobs open to Jews were as itinerant \n     craftsmen or as moneylenders to all levels of society.\n       But success in finance and the emerging business of banking \n     and credit carried its own dangers. When local businessmen \n     made poor decisions--or kings had to borrow money to finance \n     everything from wars to jewelry--they became more and more \n     indebted to the very people they had forced into being their \n     bankers.\n       And when it came time to repay those debts, it was a lot \n     easier to spread rumors of witchcraft and secret rites, \n     launch a wave of pogroms, expropriate Jewish businesses, \n     cancel the debts, and then expel the Jews.\n       And that's exactly what happened over and over during the \n     Middle Ages. In 1290, Edward the First of England solved his \n     debt problems by expelling the Jews. They were to remain \n     barred from England for the next 350 years, until the time of \n     Oliver Cromwell. A hundred years later, in 1394, they were \n     expelled again, this time from France. A similar fate befell \n     the Jews of Spain in 1492, and those of Portugal in 1497. \n     Some were forcibly\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\n     converted. Others were killed for refusing to abandon their \n     faith. Many of the original Jewish community here in \n     Newport--the people who founded Touro Synagogue--were the \n     descendants of those same Sephardic Jews who had been driven \n     from the Iberian Peninsula 150 years earlier.\n       These cycles of persecution waxed and waned for the next \n     500 years. Sometimes they were violent. Sometimes it was just \n     snide remarks and not being admitted into some exclusive \n     club.\n       As we all know, the culmination of all this was the \n     Holocaust. How could it happen? Wasn't it something we should \n     have foreseen?\n       Jews had lived in Germany for over a thousand years. They \n     had built its industry. They were part of its educational \n     system. They were skilled workers, bankers, businessmen, \n     artists, scientists. They had fought in Germany's war right \n     alongside the rest of their countrymen. There part of the \n     community. They were Germans, and they thought of themselves \n     as Germans. No wonder so many responded to the first acts of \n     the Nazis with disbelief and a total inability to comprehend \n     what lay in store.\n       And in the end, why did so many others, Germans and non-\n     Germans alike, turn their heads from what was happening to \n     their neighbors, or worse yet, take part in the persecutions?\n       Earlier this month, I read a very moving piece in the New \n     York Times entitled ``The Pogrom at Eishyshok.'' Some of you \n     may have seen it. It was the chilling first person account of \n     a man who, as 7 year old child in the fall of 1945, had \n     witnessed the murder of his mother and infant brother in a \n     little town--a ``stetl''--in what is now Lithuania. Their \n     attackers weren't Nazis bent on carrying out the final \n     solution--Hitler had already been defeated. These were their \n     neighbors, people they knew and had grown up with. At the end \n     of his story, the author observed that ``as our world shrinks \n     and its diverse nations become more entangled with one \n     another, it is of the utmost importance to understand that \n     the `dislike of the unlike' is what leads to the gas chambers \n     and the killing fields.''\n       ``The dislike of the unlike.''--the tendency of people to \n     divide the world into ``us'' and ``them'', and then treat \n     with suspicion or even hatred those who look different, or \n     talk different, or have funny names, or strange customs.\n       Those words--``the dislike of the unlike''--perfectly \n     capture the essence of what has plagued all mankind--not just \n     Jews--since time immemorial.\n       What we see is that, again and again, people can get along \n     for decades on the surface. But when society is placed under \n     stress, when it's confronted by war, or famine, or plague, or \n     economic collapse, people turn on those who aren't quite like \n     them. They look for something or somebody to blame--and then \n     they take out their fear and frustrations on them. For \n     Europe's Jews, that cycle was all too familiar.\n       And if it could happen there, could it ever happen here? \n     Clearly, there are a handful of people in every society, in \n     every country, who are capable of monstrous evil, even murder \n     on a massive, organized scale. There is no question in my \n     mind that such people exist in America today. But the \n     difference is, I don't see that ever happening here. We are \n     different. And because of that difference, I don't believe \n     American society could ever allow that handful of evil men to \n     work their will. We wouldn't put up with it. And the reason I \n     think that we are so special--that we are protected from that \n     kind of evil--has a lot to do with why we are here today.\n       Let's be very clear. Religious freedom wasn't always the \n     norm in colonial America. The same colonists who had fled \n     religious persecution in England were only too happy to \n     impose their beliefs on others when they were in control. \n     Fortunately, the tolerance established by Roger Williams here \n     in Rhode Island made it a mecca for people of all faiths who \n     sought the right to worship in peace. Huguenots and Baptists, \n     Jews and Quakers all lived together here, worshipping God in \n     their own ways.\n       One hundred-fifty years ago, the great French commentator, \n     Alexis de Tocqueville, observed a peculiar fact--that two \n     principles which in Europe had historically been mutually \n     exclusive--the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty--\n     had somehow been combined and made mutually supportive here \n     in America. Part of the reason for that happy fact lies right \n     here.\n       When warden Moses Seixas of Touro Synagogue wrote to \n     President George Washington to wish him well and to give \n     thanks for a government ``erected by the majesty of the \n     people'' which gave everyone--regardless of their origins--\n     the liberty to worship in peace and enjoy equally the \n     protections of citizenship, he started a series of events \n     which had consequences far beyond what he could have ever \n     imagined.\n       And when President Washington, in his reply, wrote of how \n     proud we should be for having given mankind a country where \n     ``all possess alike liberty of consicence and immunities of \n     citizenship'' he captured the very ideals that make America \n     special.\n       And, in what I think is one of the most remarkable insights \n     of the letter, President Washington notes that we're not \n     talking about toleration the way it was throughout history, \n     where one privileged group granted others some limited rights \n     as a form of indulgence, ``allowing'' them to be treated \n     fairly. No! What George Washington says is that there is no \n     single group which holds sway over the rest of us. All of us \n     have inherent natural rights, and the only thing required of \n     us is that we conduct ourselves as good citizens and support \n     the government. The government didn't just ``allow'' the Jews \n     to practice their religion and conduct their business like \n     everyone else; the President said it was their right all \n     along--so it couldn't be taken back arbitrarily if someone in \n     power changed his mind. That's what's so important here.\n       When they sought Washington's assurance of their right to \n     practice their religion, to be free from government \n     persecution, to be treated like all citizens of this country, \n     the Jews of Newport were not just achieving something for \n     themselves. They established a percedent which applied to \n     every other religion. And a year later, that precedent was \n     codified in the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       And look at what we've gained. Look at what that freedom \n     from oppression has enabled America's Jewish citizens to \n     contribute to this country during the last two centuries. \n     Art, education, music, science, literature, religion, \n     business--the list goes on and on. The political and \n     community involvement of America's Jewish citizens--across \n     the entire spectrum of issues and views--is absolutely \n     remarkable. The philanthropy of America's Jewish community \n     has aided those less fortunate out of all proportion to their \n     numbers. The Jewish community has strengthened and enriched \n     the intellectual and economic and political fabric of \n     American life to an extraordinary degree.\n       Today, we have the opportunity to rejoice in the success of \n     the Touro congregation to be treated like any other citizens, \n     and to celebrate in the wisdom of George Washington and the \n     other founding fathers, who realized that our diversity did \n     not have to breed hate and suspicion and discrimination, that \n     our ``unlikeness'' did not prevent us from being good \n     citizens in a society of mutual trust, and respect, and \n     consideration. Rather than being a weakness, America's \n     diversity has become our strength.\n       Yes, we do have much to be thankful for today. For the \n     congregation of Touro Synagogue truly helped make America \n     what it is--a special place where all can live in peace \n     together.\n       Thank you, and shalom.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, although it is unusual for me to speak from \na prepared text, I want to spend a little time providing my colleagues \nwith some of the history and facts regarding an item that appeared in \nthe Republican Party's platform last month. The issue is a successful \nDirect Student Loan Program which has saved students and taxpayers \nbillions of dollars by streamlining a complicated system and enhancing \ncompetition. It is a great disappointment to me that an issue with such \nstrong bipartisan roots has been turned into a one-line rhetorical \nattack on the President. That is unfair to the program, unfair to the \nPresident, and it is unfair to the Republicans who spent years \npromoting these reforms.\n  Five years ago, I teamed up with David Durenberger, then a Republican \nSenator from Minnesota, in proposing to shift to a direct loan program \nwith income-based repayments for all students who desire it. We \nproposed using the billions saved with that proposal to restore the \nbuying power of the Pell Grant Program, which has suffered from years \nof underfunding.\n  The loan reforms we put in our bill were not original. They were \nborrowed, with a few minor changes, from Representative Tom Petri, a \nRepublican from Wisconsin with conservative credentials, with whom you \nand I served, Mr. President, in the House.\n  My colleague, Senator Al D'Amato, now the head of the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee, cosponsored the Petri plan in the \nSenate. Republican support for direct lending was broad. Original \ncosponsors of the Petri legislation included my House colleague from \nIllinois, John Porter, now the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee that handles education, and three Members who have now \njoined us in this body: Senator Rick\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\nSantorum, Senator James Inhofe, and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n  Cosponsors also included the current Speaker of the House and spanned \nthe Republican spectrum from Susan Molinari to Dana Rohrabacher. Their \nsupport did not stop at cosponsorship. Thirty-three Republican House \nMembers wrote to President Bush urging him to make direct lending part \nof his domestic agenda. They argued that Republicans--and I am quoting: \n``should be advancing our own innovative, cost-effective solutions'' to \nhelp the middle class pay for college.\n  But after President Clinton proposed their innovative, cost-effective \nsolution, many of those Republicans became silent, or worse, opposed \ntheir own proposal. The basic policy did not change. It was pure \npartisan politics. The Republican party platform ratified last month \nincluded the following two sentences:\n\n       Congressional Republicans budgeted a 50 percent increase in \n     student loans while fighting Bill Clinton's intrusion of Big \n     Government into their financing. Heeding the outcry from the \n     nation's campuses, we will end the Clinton Administration's \n     perverse direct lending program.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the Republican platform.\n  Mr. President, the program that was innovative and cost-effective \nwhen it was a Republican idea somehow became perverse and an intrusion \nof Big Government--with a capital ``B'' and a capital ``G''--when \nPresident Clinton decided to promote it.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to these statements. And I speak not \nonly for myself. Members should know that every national higher \neducation association and student group that has taken a stand supports \ndirect lending. If there is any outcry on college campuses, it is for \nthe reforms that President Clinton has championed, not against them.\n  I have a chart here that compares the old Government guarantee \nprogram with the direct lending. I ask my colleagues to look closely \nand tell me which program is the so-called perverse, big Government \nsystem that the Republican platform would eliminate.\n  Is it the program on the left, with fewer than 500 Government \nemployees, or the one on the right with more than 2,500 Government \nemployees?\n  Which is big Government?\n  Is it the one that uses competition to determine how much to pay \nprivate-sector participants or the one in which Congress sets the \nprices?\n  Is it the one where a low default rate is rewarded or where more \ndefaults can bring more money to middlemen?\n  Mr. President, which is ``perverse''?\n  Is it the program that uses taxpaying private-sector companies and \ninvestors or the one that gives away tax subsidies? And again, you have \nthese comparisons here.\n  Is it the one that chooses contractors based on performance or the \none in which Congress gives entitlements to middlemen regardless of \nperformance?\n  Is it the program that can be audited or the one that requires \ntaxpayers to give away money in the dark?\n  Is it the one with or without costly conflicts of interest that \nthreaten billions in lost taxpayer dollars?\n  If we change the chart here, you will see at the bottom obviously \nthis is the one that Congressman Petri and Senator Durenberger and \nothers of us have proposed and is now in effect on about 1,700 campuses \nthat really makes sense.\n  Mr. President, strange as it may seem, the program that the \nRepublican platform has labeled ``perverse, big Government,'' is the \none that has fewer Government employees, no entitlements to middlemen, \nuses competition to set prices, and rewards only the good performers.\n  Congressman Tom Petri warned his Republican colleagues last September \nthat they were going down the wrong road. Let me repeat what he had to \nsay. This is Congressman Petri talking.\n\n       If at the end of this whole process we do kill off direct \n     lending, President Clinton and others will tell the American \n     people that the Congress, under Republican control, shut down \n     a conservative reform effort that was good for students and \n     schools in order to keep the gravy flowing to powerful \n     special interests. And that argument will resonate with the \n     American people because it was right.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to describe to my \ncolleagues how the Government guarantee program really works. The banks \nand Sallie Mae like to brag they now share the risk of defaults of the \nstudent loan program because they are reimbursed 98 percent rather than \nthe 100 percent they insisted was necessary before direct lending came \nalong as an alternative.\n  That 2 percent is a nice contribution, but it is also deceptive. A \nbank that makes a loan of $1,000 is guaranteed, by the Government, not \njust $980, but also full interest on the $1,000 at a rate 3.1 \npercentage points above the Government's cost to borrow. That is set by \nus in Congress. Some of these bankers who denounce welfare for poor \npeople will end supporting this welfare for bankers. If it cost us 5 \npercent to borrow, we pay them 8.1 percent every year. Then they offer \nto absorb 2 percent of any loan that defaults.\n  So if interest is included, what is the real guarantee? After 4 years \nof college, the Government, which will have paid about $324 in interest \non $1,000, then will reimburse $980 of the default, for a total payment \nto the bank of $1,304. The real Government guarantee is more than 130 \npercent, not the 98 percent that they advertise.\n  What about all those guarantee agencies, the middlemen in the \nGovernment guarantee system? They claim that they are the Federal \nGovernment's partner, sharing the risk of loan defaults.\n  Mr. President, that has not been true since 1976. These guarantee \nagencies have no private contributors, no private investors, no State \nfunds that contribute to the cost of the Federal loan program. Instead, \nthe funds that they ``share'' with us are the funds that we give them; \nentitlements such as a percentage of the student's loan, 27 percent of \nany defaults they collect, and administrative payment, and on and on. \nIt is like your child saving up his allowance to pay a small part of \nthe cost for a new bicycle. It is a nice exercise, but the money really \nall comes from your pocket.\n  It is true that the amount we pay to the banks and middlemen is lower \nthan it was before 1983. But it is lower only because direct lending \nforced the lobbyists to admit that they were fleecing taxpayers and \nstudents.\n  For 25 years the banks and student loan middlemen kept asking \nCongress for more subsidies, more entitlements, and less risk. Congress \nhad little choice but to comply. No elected official wants to risk \nstudents not getting loans. The banks and middlemen told us that to cut \nthe subsidies would risk loan access.\n  As recently as 1991, the banks warned that some borrowers could lose \naccess to loans if Congress did not increase the return to lenders.\n  Until President Clinton proposed a viable alternative to the \nGovernment guarantee program, there was no safe way to call the bluff. \nThe Republican platform's plan to eliminate direct lending would return \nus to that time when we had no choice but to follow orders from the \nbanking industry, the guaranty agencies, and their lobbyists.\n  This leads me to some questions about the Government guarantee \nprogram:\n  Why do we pay banks 3.1 percentage points over the Treasury rate? Not \nbecause of any market competition that led to the price, not because of \nany study by economists, but because that is what the lobbyists said \nthe industry could live with.\n  Why do we pay guaranty agencies 27 percent of any defaulted loan they \ncollect? Incidentally, that is an encouragement to default. We \nsubsidize that, not because of competition, not because of careful \nstudy, but because the lobbyists told us that was the right number.\n  Why did last year's appropriations bill require the Education \nDepartment to pay $176 million to guaranty agencies on top of the more \nthan $1.8 billion in Federal funds they already hold? Because that is \nwhat the lobbyists said they wanted. I could go on and on.\n  Mr. President, is this any way to run a program? Instead of lobbyist-\nset rates, why not use auctions to determine how much we should pay to \nget capital for student loans? That is direct lending.\n  Rather than Congress setting the rates, why not use competition to \ndetermine how much to pay the loan collectors? That is direct lending.\n  Why not give all borrowers a wide variety of repayment options \ninstead of\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\nleaving their options up to the whim of whatever secondary market \nhappened to purchase their loan from the bank? That is direct lending. \nI might add, direct lending is open to every student while in the old \nsystem you have to be below a certain level of income.\n  Why not provide the funds through the same system that delivers Pell \ngrants, work-study and other student aid rather than confusing schools, \nparents, and students with a plethora of agencies, offices, and forms? \nThat is the simplicity that direct lending provides.\n  What about savings for taxpayers? A few direct loan opponents have \nimplied that direct lending never was cheaper than the Government \nguarantee program. That is just plain nonsense, and it is easy to see \nwhy. Everyone agrees that the 1993 reforms forced several billions of \ndollars of reduced subsidies in the Government guarantee system. Now, \naccording to the Senate Budget Committee, the cost of the two programs \nare virtually identical. By definition, if the cost of the Government \nguarantee system has come down and now matches direct lending, then \ndirect lending must have been cheaper.\n  In fact, the cost of the direct loan program has been overstated for \na variety of reasons that I have explained in detail previously in the \nRecord, including the choice of discount rates, the cost of tax-exempt \nbonds used by secondary markets but not in direct lending, and the \nhandling of conflicts of interest and other costs of the Government \nguarantee system. Not only was direct lending cheaper 3 years ago when \nthe loan industry was forced to ante up, but it is still cheaper today.\n  Whether you agree with the Republican staff of the Budget Committee \nor with Congressman Tom Petri or Paul Simon, there is no question that \nthe 1993 student loan reforms have saved billions of dollars for \ntaxpayers because of the efficiency of direct lending.\n  Mr. President, millions of dollars have been spent in lobbying to \nsully direct lending, and there are two other charters to which I have \nnot yet responded. First, there was the cost-shifting scare. Before \ndirect lending had a track record, Sallie Mae provided colleges with \nsophisticated-looking analyses showing that direct lending would cost \nthe average college an additional $219,000 to administer each year. \nBanks and middlemen also got into the fray, hiring a CBO Director to \nsay that costs were being shifted to schools. Of course, colleges were \nconcerned.\n  But time has erased all those claims. Direct lending turned out to be \nexactly the opposite of the Sallie Mae scare tactic. Colleges saved \nmoney through a welcome relief from excess paperwork and redtape. In \nyour State of Colorado, Mr. President, the State auditor found that \ndirect lending in the first year reduced costs by $325,245, at two of \nthe State's universities.\n  That is why 1,700 schools have now joined the direct loan program. \nSchools now have the option. That is what we want to keep.\n  Next, there came the haven for defaults claim. Long-time opponents of \ndirect lending held a press conference to announce a rush of high-\ndefault schools into the direct loan program. They pointed to several \nshady trade schools but failed to point out that the schools, under the \nlaw, had to already be participating in the Government guarantee \nprogram. Still, they persisted in their claims for as long as no data \nwere available to refute them.\n  In March, the data arrived. That lie was put 6 feet under. The truth \nis that schools in the direct loan program last year had a lower \naverage default rate than those in the guarantee program. More data on \nthe performance of the two programs at similar schools is still to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, over time, every allegation made by the industry has \nturned out to be misleading or just plain groundless.\n  I have said very little about students. They, after all, are the \nreasons that these programs exist. How have they been helped by the \nStudent Loan Reform Act proposed by President Clinton and enacted by \nthe Congress in 1993?\n  I touched briefly on the repayment options. Direct lending makes a \nwide variety of repayment options available to any borrower. Borrowers \ncan even choose to make payments that vary according to their post-\ncollege income. That is critical, as students are increasingly relying \non loans to finance their continuing education.\n  USA Today reported that the direct loan program's ``simplicity has \nproved hugely popular at colleges across the country.'' In the \nGovernment guarantee program, the maze of agencies, lenders, and \npurchasers often cause confusion, delays, and errors. They are not only \nfrustrating but costly to colleges and students.\n  As millions of college students begin this academic year, one of the \nthings that is foremost on their minds is money. Whether they \nparticipate in the direct loan program or the guarantee system, the \nchanges that were enacted in 1993 will send students this week back to \ntheir dorm rooms with $650 million more than any would have had \notherwise. In other words, $650 million savings this school year to \nstudents because of the direct loan program and because the old \nguarantee program has been forced to come down in its expenditures \nbecause of direct lending. That savings would never have happened \nwithout the leadership that President Clinton and Congressman Petri, \nSenator David Durenberger, and Senator Ted Kennedy showed in standing \nup to the special interests and promoting the direct lending.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, although Republicans in Congress claim to \nsupport education, they cannot escape the record of harsh education \ncuts proposed by the Republican majority in Congress, led by Newt \nGingrich and Bob Dole. Just this past weekend, Christiane Valfour, a \ncollege student at the University of Pittsburgh, challenged Bob Dole to \nexplain why Republicans in Congress pushed for deep budget cuts in \nFederal student aid last year. Candidate Dole's response was silence. \nWhen the student asked why Dole opposed the highly successful direct \nstudent loan program, again, candidate Dole was at a loss for words.\n  It is no surprise that Bob Dole decided to take the fifth amendment \non education. In fact, anything he said would incriminate him. The \ntruth is that candidate Dole supported the Republican budget last year \nthat proposed the largest education cuts in the Nation's history. That \nRepublican budget also capped Direct loans for college students, \ndenying the opportunity for over a thousand schools to choose the loan \nprogram that provides the best service and lowest fees and other costs \nto their students.\n  I commend to all the Members the excellent presentation that was made \nby our colleague and friend from Illinois, Senator Simon, on this \nissue. He has been a strong leader in support of the direct loan \nprogram.\n  Candidate Dole and the Republicans in Congress are desperately trying \nto run away from their slash-and-burn record on education. But the \nAmerican people won't be fooled. They know investing in education is \nimportant to the Nation's future, and they won't be deceived by the \nRepublican claims that pretend to support education, while cutting the \nheart out of the investment that is needed to give education the \npriority it deserves.\n  In communities across America, it is back to school time, back to \nclasses, back to homework, back to parent-teacher meetings, and back to \npreparing pupils for the future.\n  It is also back to crowded classrooms. Secretary of Education Richard \nRiley has called this school year the\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\n``baby boom echo.'' Student enrollment will reach an all-time high of \n52 million, surpassing the 1971 record of 51 million.\n  Here in Washington there is a different echo--the echo of the \neducation-cutting Republican Congress. Last fall, the Republican \nCongress--led by Speaker Newt Gingrich and former majority leader Bob \nDole--proposed the largest education cuts in U.S. history. Democrats \nfought these harsh cuts at every turn, because we believe in education \nas the key to the door of the American dream.\n  Republicans proposed to cut $3.7 billion in education last year. That \nproposal failed because the American people would not stand for deep \ncuts in education funding. But the Republicans refused to listen. They \ninsisted on proposing similar cuts in education funding in a series of \nshort-term spending bills.\n  Last January, I offered an amendment to one short-term spending bill \nthat would have restored full funding to education--$3.1 billion. But \nthe Republican leadership blocked the measure. Even when a majority of \nthe Senate--51 Senators--supported the amendment, the Republican \nleadership used a procedural trick that required 60 votes for passage--\nso education lost again.\n  Last April, prospective college students were desperate to know how \nmuch financial aid would be available for the coming school year. \nTeachers were receiving pink slips because schools were expecting huge \ncuts in their budgets. As the crisis deepened, Republicans in Congress \nabandoned 90 percent of their harsh cuts and agreed to education \nfunding $400 million below the 1995 level. It took the Republicans 9 \nmonths to learn what American families already knew--education is the \nkey to America's future and must be a high national priority.\n\n  Throughout the past year, the American people have consistently said \n``no'' to education cuts and ``yes'' to doing more to see that every \nchild gets a decent education and can afford to go to college.\n  I might point this out, Mr. President, on this chart, to give you a \nbetter idea of what these cuts were. If we take the 1995 \nappropriations--and this is after the rescission of several hundreds of \nmillions of dollars--$3.7 billion was cut from education in the House \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. In the continuing resolution \n$3.1 billion was cut from education as compared to the 1995 \nappropriations level. In the 1996 omnibus appropriations agreement--the \nfinal agreement that was made--we cut $400 million from education. This \nagreement was made with the President after the Government shutdown. \nThe education cut was reduced to just $400 million less than the 1995 \nappropriations as a result of the President talking about the \nimportance of education, Medicare, and the environment, which are high \nnational priorities. President Clinton demonstrated a commitment to \nthese priorities by getting us back close to the 1995 appropriations \nlevels.\n  Notice what has happened this year. In the 1997 appropriations, the \nHouse of Representatives has cut education funding by more than one \nbillion dollars from last year's agreement. When they are able to get \ntheir hands on it, they go right back down to $1.5 billion in the House \nappropriations bill.\n  The Senate appropriations bill will be marked up soon. So, hopefully, \nwe will have an opportunity to address this issue. But if we are not \nassured that we are going to consider the education appropriations, \nothers are going to offer amendments to restore education funds on the \nnext appropriations bills that come before the Senate. We can't take a \nchance on the funding of education--not that money in and of itself \nguarantees improvements in education. It does not. But it is a \nreflection of the Nation's priorities.\n  That is what we are talking about in this debate; let's strengthen \nthe programs in various priority areas. We heard earlier today of the \nexcellent work that was done with the leadership of Senator Simon, \nSenator Bradley, Senator Durenberger, a bipartisan effort to move us \ntoward the direct loan programs. I welcome the opportunity to join in \nthat effort with the support of the President.\n  Thanks to the Direct Student Loan Program, we have alternatives in \nthe college financial aid programs, as was pointed out by Senator Simon \nearlier today. Last year, Republicans in Congress tried to eliminate \nthe Direct Loan Program. They would have taken away a good alternative \nfor young people to pay for college.\n  Nonetheless, I think is important to clarify what happened in last \nyear's battle over education funding. This past weekend, one of our \ncolleagues, who was answering a question from Christiane Valfour in \nPennsylvania at the University of Pittsburgh, denied the Republican \neducation costs. She challenged Bob Dole to explain why the Republicans \nproposed massive education cuts in their budget, and he was speechless. \nThen a Republican Senator came up and said that she was completely \nmisinformed, and that the Republicans had not cut education. It is \nimportant as we enter into the final days of this Congress, as we make \nour final judgments on the issue of higher education and also \nelementary and secondary education, that we understand exactly what has \nbeen done.\n  Now, as we begin a new school year, teachers are teaching more \nstudents than ever before. Communities are fighting to prevent youth \ndrug use and crime. Schools are trying to equip classrooms for the 21st \ncentury. But the elephant never learns. Instead of helping schools and \nchildren to prepare for the future, Republicans in congress are bent on \nrepeating the past instead of learning from it. They have slashed \neducation funding again this year, cutting education by $1.5 billion \nfrom the fiscal year 1995 level in the House appropriations bill for \n1997, which begins October 1. The label fits and sticks. This \nRepublican Congress--the Gingrich-Dole Republican Congress--is the most \nantieducation Congress in the Nation's history, bar none.\n  We know that when we ask and expect more of children, they achieve \nmore. More students than ever are taking harder courses. SAT scores are \nup. But Republicans don't get it. They tried to zero out Goals 2000 in \nthe fiscal year 1996 appropriation, but we stopped them. In the fiscal \nyear 1997 proposal, the Gingrich House Republicans again zeroed out \nfunding for Goals 2000, which is helping 5 million schoolchildren \nachieve higher standards of learning.\n  The Goals 2000 Act was passed with bipartisan support both in \ncommittee and on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Ninety percent of Goals \n2000 funds go to the schools at local level to give assistance to \nschoolteachers, to parents, and to citizens involved in their \ncommunities, who want to enhance students' academic achievement. Goals \n2000 has been zeroed out. Unfortunately, I think it was zeroed out \nbecause it was an initiative supported by President Clinton and his \nadministration.\n  We know that the use of advanced technology in education increases \nachievement and reduces dropouts. Computers help teachers spend more \ntime with students and teach them more complex lessons. Classroom \ntechnology helps prepare students for the 21st century workplace. But \nthe Republicans don't get it. In fiscal year 1996, they tried to zero \nout the Star Schools Program, but we successfully fought to restore the \nfunding. In their fiscal year 1997 proposal, the Gingrich House \nRepublicans again zeroed out the Star Schools Act, which helps bring \nschools into the information age. They cut $27 million from the \nPresident's budget for technology challenge grants, which help bring \ncomputers into classrooms.\n  I wish some of our Members had the chance to visit some of the Star \nSchools Programs I have visited. I remember several years ago visiting \nan excellent Star Schools Programs in the State of Mississippi. Senator \nCochran has been interested in distance learning for a long time. We \nfound that in a number of schools throughout Mississippi and the South \nstudents were taking classes in advanced calculus and advanced \nmathematics. These classes were not available within their particular \ncommunities, but the Star Schools connections allowed them to work with \nsome of the best teachers that exist, both in Mississippi and in other \nSouthern Communities. Star Schools programs bring high-level courses to \nmany students who would not have the opportunity to take these \nchallenging classes in their local schools. It was enormously \nimpressive.\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\nThis is just one example of the importance of bringing the newest \ntechnology that is available into our schools. Nonetheless, Republicans \nhave cut education technology programs including Star Schools and also \ntechnology challenge grants.\n  We know that communities, schools, and families are working hard to \nprevent youth crime and drug use. But Republicans don't get it. They \ntried to slash the funding for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act by 60 \npercent in fiscal year 1996, but we didn't let them. In their fiscal \nyear 1997 proposal, the House Republicans cut $25 million from the Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools Act, the only Federal Program dedicated to \nproviding funds to schools to combat drug use and violent behavior.\n  Even in the Human Resources Committee during the last Congress, the \nDrug-Free Schools Program was effectively wiped out, and the funding \nwas transferred to a youth block grant program. But it was one of a \nnumber of different programs that would be available to young people, \ndepending on the decisions of the various Governors. At the time, we \nmade a decision that schools needed to have some consistent support \nacross this country in terms of drug-use prevention and violence \nprevention activities. So we passed the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act. In this current appropriations bill, Republicans in \nCongress continue to reduce support for safe and drug-free schools.\n  The appropriations for education funding are going to be acted on by \nthe Senate this week. It is important, since the budget is an indicator \nof national priorities, that we understand exactly what is before the \nappropriator and what will be before the Senate and before the American \npeople. I believe that most Americans think that education programs \ndeserve a strong national investment.\n  We know that half of all college students need financial aid to go to \ncollege. Three-quarters of all student aid comes from the Federal \nGovernment. Between 1985 and 1994, the average cost of attending \ncollege rose by 39 percent while the median family income rose by only \n1 percent. College graduates earn almost twice what high school \ngraduates earn and nearly three times what high school dropouts earn. \nBut Republicans do not get it. In fiscal year 1996, their attempts to \neliminate the funding for Perkins loans and the supplemental State \nincentive grants failed. In their fiscal year 1997 proposal, the \nGingrich House Republicans again zeroed out funding for Perkins loans, \nwhich helped more than 700,000 students go to college last year. And \nthey again eliminated the supplemental State incentive grants, which \nhelped over 1 million students attend college.\n\n  In the coming weeks, we will hear Republicans claim that they support \neducation, schools, children, and teachers. But candidate Dole and \nSpeaker Gingrich and their Republican colleagues cannot escape their \nantieducation record.\n  President Clinton is the education President. He has fought hard and \nsuccessfully to block the Republican cuts in education funding. His \nbudget for the coming years is a budget that invests in education. \nWhile Republicans want to subtract $1.5 billion from education, the \nPresident wants to add $2.8 billion. That is the right priority for \nCongress, and the right priority for America.\n  As this chart shows, the House Republicans want to cut education by \n$1.5 billion this year, and the Senate Republicans are continuing the \nbattle in terms of cutting education funding.\n  Mr. President, the fact remains that over the period of the last \nCongress, 1992 to 1994, a series of education programs were enacted. We \npassed a reauthorization of the Head Start Program. In this act, we \nextended the Head Start education programs to include training programs \nfor expectant mothers, and we expanded the early intervention programs.\n  Then we passed the Goals 2000 Act to challenge students to a greater \ndegree and bring out the best in students. The purpose of Goals 2000 is \nto provide additional funding to local school districts so that \nteachers, school committees, parents, the business community, and other \ncommunity activists who want to improve their local schools, would have \nflexibility to develop new initiatives in terms of curriculum, in terms \nof the time students spend in class, and in terms of additional \ntraining for teachers. A number of communities have used Goals 2000 \nfunding to develop local initiatives to improve student achievement.\n  We also passed the School-to-Work Program to address the particular \neducational challenges that exist for the three out of four high school \ngraduates who do not go on to a 2- or 4-year college and receive a \ncollege degree. The purpose of the School-to-Work Program was to give \nthese students the opportunity to obtain job skills and additional \neducational training that could help them have more useful, productive \nlives. The School-to-Work Program, which has been supported by \nRepublican Governors as well as Democratic Governors, was, effectively, \ngoing to be terminated on the job training bill which we considered in \nconference committee. We should not terminate this important program, \nand we certainly should not terminate it just because it was developed \nby President Clinton.\n  So, Mr. President, we have seen in recent times, when we are talking \nabout the funding of those programs, support for those programs, a \ndramatic reduction in those programs, and a number of those programs \nhave actually been zeroed out.\n  It is increasingly clear that our Senate Republicans are so \nembarrassed by their antieducation record that they do not intend to \nbring the education appropriations bill before the full Senate for \nfinal action before the election. One way or another, either on the \ncontinuing resolution or on other legislation, the Senate should vote \non this vital issue so the American people know where we stand.\n  American families want good schools and affordable college education. \nThey want a brighter tomorrow for their children, and they will not let \nan education-cutting Republican Congress hold them back.\n  Republican priorities are also too extreme with regard to Medicare. \nTime and again Republicans in Congress have sought to slash Medicare in \norder to pay for irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\n  Medicare is a compact between the Government and the people. It says, \n``Pay into the system during your working years, and we will assure \nthat you have affordable health care in your retirement years.''\n  Today's senior citizens built the country. They worked hard, raised \ntheir children, stood up for America during depression and war, and now \nit is America's responsibility to stand by them--to guarantee that \naffordable medical care will be there for them when they need it in \ntheir retirement years.\n  You would think that these are principles that every American \nsupports, but not Bob Dole, not Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in \nCongress. Newt Gingrich says he wants Medicare to wither on the vine. \nHouse majority leader Dick Armey has said Medicare is a program he \n``would have no part of in a free world.'' And last year, Bob Dole said \nagain that he is proud to have voted against Medicare when it was first \nenacted. He told the American Conservative Union, ``I was there, \nfighting the fight, voting against Medicare, 1 of 12, because we knew \nit wouldn't work. * * *''\n  The Dole-Gingrich Republican budget last year would have slashed \nMedicare by an astounding $270 billion. Medicare premiums would have \ndoubled. Medicare deductibles would have doubled. The age of \neligibility for Medicare would have been raised. Elderly couples would \nhave paid an additional $2,400 in increased premiums alone during the \nbudget period.\n  Republicans pretend that they are not cutting Medicare, just slowing \nits rate of growth. But every American family knows that if your wages \ndo not keep up with inflation, your living standard is cut. Every \nfamily knows that if Medicare payments do not keep up with the cost of \nmedical treatment, senior citizens' health care will be cut. And every \nfamily knows that if Medicare deductibles are doubled, if Medicare \npremiums are doubled, and if Medicare eligibility is postponed, your \nMedicare has been cut.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said, ``You can fool some of the people all of \nthe time, you can fool all of the people\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\nsome of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the \ntime.'' Our Republican friends seem to be counting on fooling enough of \nthe people enough of the time until November 5--but they are not going \nto succeed.\n  The Dole-Gingrich attack on Medicare went even farther. In cahoots \nwith the private insurance industry, their scheme was designed to force \nsenior citizens to give up Medicare and join HMO's or private insurance \nplans. The Republicans said that their proposal was meant to offer \ngreater choice, but senior citizens know that slashing Medicare in \norder to divert billions in profits to private insurers is no choice at \nall.\n  Republicans claim that President Clinton and the Democrats are using \nscare tactics on Medicare. But the American people know better. In \nfact, the cost of the lavish new tax breaks that Senator Dole is \nproposing will make even deeper cuts in Medicare more likely.\n  Under the Dole-Gingrich plan last year, the Republicans proposed a 7-\nyear tax cut of $245 billion, paid for by $270 billion in Medicare \ncuts. Under the current Dole economic plan, the tax cut is $681 billion \nover 7 years, almost three times as large as last year's tax cut.\n  What about the Medicare cut? It is fair to ask where the cuts are \ngoing to come from. But still we have silence by Bob Dole on where the \ncuts are going to come from. I say to anyone who cares about Medicare, \nyou better keep tuned because, as we have seen, Bob Dole supported the \ntax cut of $245 billion and the Medicare cut of $270 billion. Now he is \nproposing a $681 billion tax cut, and he is silent. You can bet your \nbottom dollar that there are going to be significant cuts in Medicare.\n  You do not have to be a mathematical genius to understand that if you \nhave to pay for a tax cut three times as great, your Medicare cuts \nwould be even greater than in the Republican plan last year. Bob Dole \nis no friend of Medicare and neither is the Republican Party.\n  The Dole-Gingrich Republican plan for Medicare makes a mockery of the \nfamily values they claim to support. I want to point out, on this \nissue, what happened before the election of 1994. In 1994, Majority \nLeader Bob Dole said, ``President Clinton and Vice President Gore are \nresorting to scare tactics . . . falsely accusing Republicans of secret \nplans to cut Medicare benefits.'' That is the statement he made in \n1994, before the last election. And Haley Barbour said, ``The outrage, \nas far as I am concerned, is the Democrat's big lie campaign that the \nContract With America would require huge Medicare cuts. It would not.'' \nAfter the election, they proposed $270 billion in Medicare cuts. Bob \nDole said no, there would not be any cuts. Haley Barbour said no, there \nwould be no cuts, and then the Republicans in Congress proposed $270 \nbillion in Medicare cuts.\n  Now Dole has proposed a $681 billion tax cut. We ask him, all right, \nspell it out, where are you going to cut spending? We cannot get an \nanswer out of him. And what should the American people expect? They \nought to understand those cuts will be coming out of Medicare. If the \ncuts don't come out of Medicare, they will come out of other domestic \nprograms like education. If he doesn't cut Medicare, the Dole tax cut \nplan would require massive unspecified cuts in domestic investments. If \nBob Dole says no, it is not going to come in Medicare; it is not going \nto come in defense; it cannot come in interest on the debt; where else \ncan he cut? Domestic investments.\n  The President is trying to hold harmless the domestic investments, \nparticularly in education and in basic research in health care. He has \nindicated education, the environment, Medicare were the three \npriorities.\n  Here is the difference in this chart, where the President's balanced \nbudget program is. Here is the Republican program for the cuts. If we \nwere to enact the Dole tax cut, and if we were to exclude the Medicare \nfrom cuts, exclude defense, exclude the interest on the debt, then all \nother discretionary domestic spending would be cut from $254 billion \ndown to $158--40 to 45 percent in real cuts. Those are cuts in \neducation, NIH research, the fuel assistance programs for elderly \npeople, and legal service programs.\n  Next year, the Congress and the President will need to take serious \nsteps to deal with the very real financial problems in Medicare. The \nchoice in this election is clear. A Democratic President and a \nDemocratic Congress will address that challenge in a way that protects \nsenior citizens and improves and strengthens Medicare. A Republican \nCongress and Republican President will put senior citizens and Medicare \nat risk. I believe the American people share our Democratic commitment \nto the Nation's senior citizens, and they will vote accordingly on \nNovember 5.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 minutes \nwithout interruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10051-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10054-S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday the Senate began an important \ndebate on legislation to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have expressed strong support for \nthe Employment Nondiscrimination Act. We will vote tomorrow afternoon \non that legislation. I am very hopeful that the Senate will support it.\n  Last Friday, I reviewed the progress we have made as a country and as \na society to free ourselves from discrimination. I spent a brief period \nof time reviewing what I think has been the enormous progress that this \ncountry has made to eliminate discrimination--at least to the extent we \ncould eliminate such discrimination through legislation. After all, by \nincluding slavery, we enshrined discrimination in the Constitution of \nthe United States. We fought a civil war in the 1860's on this issue \nbut it was not until, I believe, Dr. King led a great movement in the \nlate 1950's and the early 1960's, that the Nation was truly challenged \nto eradicate discrimination. Dr. King, using the philosophy of \nnonviolence, drew together Republicans and Democrats, business and \nlabor, as well as church leaders all over the country, to begin a very \nimportant antidiscrimination grassroots effort. We made very \nsubstantial progress.\n  On Friday, I pointed out the achievements of the Civil Rights Act of \n1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968. Furthermore, in 1965 we changed the immigration \nlaws, eliminating the national origin quota system that determined \nwhich immigrants would be able to come to the United States. We \neliminated the Asian-Pacific triangle that restricted Asian immigration \nto 125 Asians a year, which was really a throwback to the period at the \nturn of the century known as the ``Great Period of the Yellow Peril.'' \nA period of great sadness and discrimination.\n  We made progress on race. We made progress on ethnicity, religion, \nand national origin during that period of time. We also made progress \nwith regard to issues of gender. We did not pass the equal rights \namendment. We did not say there were ``founding mothers'' as well as \nFounding Fathers, but we took a series of steps that moved us in a very \nimportant and significant way toward recognizing the full rights of \nwomen in our society. That was enormously important.\n  Some 6 years ago we passed the Americans With Disability Act to \nassert that having a disability does not mean a person is unable, even \nthough for the better part of our Nation's history they suffered from \ndiscrimination.\n  Just a few nights ago under the bipartisan leadership of Senator \nDomenici and Senator Wellstone, we began to take the first steps to \ninclude mental health in American health care considerations. We have \nlong recognized the challenges that cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or \nother illnesses provide for us, but we have been extremely reluctant as \na society to understand\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nthat there are also diseases that affect the mind. Mental health is an \narea that needs attention, recognition, and respect, for those that are \ndealing with those challenges. We made a very small step but not an \nunimportant step to move beyond the types of discrimination confronting \nthose with mental health illnesses.\n  Tomorrow, we have an opportunity to see whether we as a country are \nprepared to free ourselves from discrimination toward gay men and \nlesbian women. I will make the point tomorrow, when we have greater \nattendance, that I daresay there are no Members in the Senate that \nwould say we should repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964; or those who \nwill say ``no,'' we should not permit women to play sports; or, ``no,'' \nwe want a retreat on the kinds of rights we have been able to obtain \nfor those with disabilities; or let us go back to the time when we \nfound discrimination on mental health.\n  On each and every one of these debates and discussions we have heard \narguments that we do not need to take action at the Federal level, that \nif we take action it will be an intrusion by the Federal Government, \nthere will be a proliferation of that will clog the courts, and the \nlegislation will lead to all kinds of unintended consequences.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, I think one of the most \nproud parts of our history has been that we have been willing as a \ncountry and as a society--and this has been true by Republicans and \nDemocrats--to make important progress in moving us beyond \ndiscrimination.\n  Tomorrow, when we vote, we will have an opportunity to call the roll \nagain, and hopefully we will continue the march toward progress. I \nbelieve it will demonstrate that Republicans and Democrats alike are \njoining shoulder to shoulder to try and move this country beyond \ndiscrimination in the workplace. That is what we are talking about \ntoday--discrimination in the workplace. We are talking about skilled \nmen and women that are prepared to play by the rules, to work hard, and \nto be engaged in the workplace, but confront discrimination far too \noften. The sole reason they are losing their jobs or being fired is \nbecause of their sexual orientation. That is the issue that is before \nus. This bill is limited to workplace discrimination. It is an issue \nthat we are well familiar with.\n\n  Our legislation prohibits job discrimination based on sexual \norientation. Some Senators have questioned the need. What I have tried \nto do this afternoon is respond to some of the questions raised during \nthe course of the debate last week. I know we will have additional \npoints to be responded to on tomorrow.\n  So, hopefully, if our colleagues review this legislation with open \nminds, as they responded to a questionnaire when it was sent out to \nthem--I remind the Senate that our colleagues responded to a \nquestionnaire about employment discrimination based on sexual \norientation--they will support it. I believe this because 66 Senators \nand 241 Members of the House of Representatives have agreed with the \nfollowing principle: ``Sexual orientation of an individual is not a \nconsideration in the hiring, promoting, or termination of an employee \nin my office.''\n  If we are able to get that kind of response in the U.S. Senate \ntomorrow, people will have made a very, very important contribution to \nmaking America, America. There are 66 Members of the Senate, some 241 \nMembers of the House that are effectively saying that discrimination \nbased upon sexual orientation is wrong. Here is a clear statement that \nthese Senators know that there is a lot of stereotyping and a lot of \nexaggeration, and there are a lot of misstatements and misinformation \nregarding antidiscrimination policies. When they were back in their \noffices and addressing this issue quietly and deliberately, 66 members \nwere prepared to say there should not be discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation in the consideration of hiring, promoting, or \nterminating employees. We will find out now whether they are prepared \nto take that belief, that statement, that comment, and put it into \nreality by supporting our bipartisan legislation tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, the main categories of discrimination under the \nFederal law are race, gender, religion, disability, and age. \nClassifications not included in Federal law include personal \nappearance, poverty, and level of education.\n  In determining whether or not sexual orientation should be added to \nthe list of federally protected classes, I ask my colleagues to \ndetermine whether sexual orientation is more like those categories \nalready covered by Federal law or those that have not received Federal \nprotection. I think that is a question on the minds of some of our \ncolleagues. It is a fair question and it needs to be addressed.\n  My colleagues should consider the question of immutability. Doctors \ndo not know exactly what causes one's sexual orientation, but the \nleading theorists, including conservatives such as Judge Richard Posner \nand Prof. John Finnis, agree that sexual orientation is a feature of \none's personality or makeup and not a conscious choice. Therefore, in \nthis regard, it is more like national origin or religion.\n  Similarly, sexual orientation, like race, gender, religion, national \norigin, disability, and age, is rarely, if ever, relevant to one's \nability to perform in the workplace. Passage of the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act would signal congressional support for this \ntruism.\n  Rarely do we see vicious assaults in the workplace against someone \nbecause of their weight or because of smoking or some other kind of \nactivity. We are, however, well aware of the vicious assaults, \nepithets, taunts, and threats directed toward gay people. These cases \nvery closely resemble the pervasive and flagrant discrimination \ndirected toward racial and ethnic minorities, women, and people of \nvarious religious creeds. All we would have to do is reference the hate \ncrimes legislation to see that such crimes are increasingly directed \ntoward gay Americans.\n  Discrimination against gay and lesbian people for characteristics \nthey don't control or reflect their deep personal identity, that are \nirrelevant to their ability to do their job, and that provoke \nirrational animus among some of their coworkers is the classic case for \nFederal intervention.\n\n  The current patchwork of protection for gays and lesbians--laws in \nnine States, executive orders in eight States, and ordinances in \nvarious cities and counties--is far from sufficient.\n  I might mention the various States and point out for the membership \nthe States that do provide protection. We also know that the majority \nof Americans support this legislation. We have this in a general poll, \nand opponents will have other types of polls. We will be glad to get \ninto the battle of the polls should that be necessary during the debate \ntomorrow. An overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe that \nAmericans in the workplace ought to be discriminated against on the \nbasis of their sexual orientation; nine States passed laws prohibiting \nemployment discrimination based on sexual orientation; eight States \nhave executive orders for gays and lesbians--those could be altered or \nchanged easily. And 166 cities and counties have passed laws \nprohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. \nAlso, 650 employers have nondiscrimination policies that include sexual \norientation; the overwhelming majority of the Fortune 500, large and \nsmall companies. That is what is happening across the country. I will \ncome back to how many times these laws have actually been challenged. \nDo these States have various laws that provide a series of challenges \nin the courts, and are they loading up the courts? They clearly are \nnot.\n  Congress has ample power under the commerce clause and 14th amendment \nof the Constitution to enact civil rights laws such as the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act. That has been sustained--with regard to \nemployment discrimination--repeatedly by the courts.\n  America's workers keep America's commerce moving. Discrimination in \nthe workplace prevents the Nation from reaching its full potential. As \nPaul Allaire, the CEO of Xerox said:\n\n       We strive to create an atmosphere where all employees are \n     encouraged to contribute to their fullest potential. Fear of \n     reprisals on the basis of sexual orientation serves to \n     undermine that goal. Enhancing our work environment to \n     prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation \n     has not added any financial cost to our organization. \n     Instead, we believe our philosophy and practice of valuing \n     diversity brings financial benefits to\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\n     the workplace by encouraging full and open participation by \n     all employees.\n\n  In other words, it is good business for companies to free themselves \nfrom discrimination and discriminating against one particular group in \na work force. And that particular statement and comment was made by \nmany CEO's.\n\n  I think most Americans would feel that we are a stronger economy and, \nmost importantly, a stronger country when we free ourselves from \ndiscrimination and bigotry.\n  Nothing in the Employment Nondiscrimination Act condones \nunprofessional conduct in the workplace. Employers may enforce \nevenhanded rules. Dress codes for heterosexuals and homosexuals must be \nenforced fairly and equally across the board--that meets any available \ncriteria as long as the rules are applied uniformly to both \nheterosexuals and homosexuals.\n  We have heard during the course of the debate--what will an employer \ndo if a gay person acts inappropriately. The answer is that there is no \nproblem. A code of conduct can be enforced equally across the board, \nand should be equally respected by the employees. We are not talking \nabout creating special rights. We are talking about freeing the \nworkplace from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. That \nis it.\n  Employers may clearly take appropriate action, if employees violate \ndress codes or other codes of conduct. The Employment Nondiscrimination \nAct outlaws job discrimination in hiring, firing, promotion, or \ncompensation. As long as employers maintain a discrimination-free \nworkplace and enforce policies that are sexual orientation-neutral, \nthey will not violate the act.\n  That is it; period. No matter how many times we state it, nor how \nclear it is in the legislation, there will be those that will \nmisrepresent what this legislation does. That is it, as I have stated \nearlier.\n  In addition, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act clearly states that \n``the fact that an employment practice has a disparate impact on the \nbasis of sexual orientation does not establish a prima facie violation \nof the Act.'' The bill cannot be more clear. Employers have nothing to \nbe concerned about on the issue of disparate impact lawsuits.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act, like the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, provides that the EEOC shall have the same \nenforcement powers as it has to enforce title VII. Employers do not \nhave to keep any specific type of records. The EEOC simply requires \nthat any records already kept must be preserved for 1 year. The EEOC \nwill take the same approach under the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\n  The EEOC's only private sector reporting requirement is a form that \nemployers of more than 100 workers must file annually. The form only \nrequires information about race, gender, and national origin--not age \nand not disability. Like age and disability, there is no reason for an \nemployer to know the sexual orientation of an employee, and that \ninformation is not required under the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. \nThe act will not require employers to submit information on the sexual \norientation of their employees, and the EEOC will not require it \neither.\n  Let me repeat that. This act will not require employers to submit \ninformation on the sexual orientation of their employees, and the EEOC \nwill not require it either.\n  Adequate remedies for job discrimination are important in order to \ndeal with violations of the civil rights laws. The remedies under the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act are entirely appropriate. The act \napplies to clear cases of discrimination cases involving a smoking gun. \nDepending on the circumstances, a successful plaintiff should receive \nappropriate relief--reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and \neven punitive damages in the most flagrant cases.\n  Compensatory damages were capped by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. \nPunitive damages are awarded only in cases in which the jury finds that \nthe employer acted with ``malice or reckless indifference to a \nfederally protected right.''\n  You have to be able to prove that there was malice or reckless \nindifference to a federally protected right in order to be able to \ncollect.\n  Of the 284 EEOC cases settled by juries since July 1993, compensatory \nrelief was awarded in only 59 cases and punitive relief was awarded in \nonly 14 cases. The highest compensatory award was $450,000 and the \naverage is $38,418.74. The highest punitive award was $255,000 and the \naverage is $30,535.74. These awards include race and national origin \ndiscrimination cases, and compensatory awards in those cases, unlike \ncases settled under the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, are not \ncapped.\n  Some have expressed reservations about the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act because of religious objections to homosexuality. \nBut as Bishop Browning, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, has \nsaid:\n\n       Since 1976, the Episcopal Church has been committed \n     publicly to the notion of guaranteeing equal protection for \n     all citizens, including homosexual persons, under the law.\n       Employment Non-Discrimination Act explicitly fulfills that \n     mandate, and I urge Members of Congress to move swiftly to \n     pass this amendment, and the President to sign it into law. . \n     .\n       My warm embrace of this legislation, of course, reflects \n     more than my standing as Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal \n     Church. It represents my deep, personal belief in the \n     intrinsic dignity of all God's children.\n       That dignity demands that all citizens have a full and \n     equal claim upon the promise of the American ideal, which \n     includes equal civil rights protection against unfair \n     employment discrimination.\n\n  Many other religious leaders support the Employment Nondiscrimination \nAct. They believe that the religious exemption in the bill \nappropriately protects religious liberty. The American Jewish \nCommittee, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Evangelical \nLutheran Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association, United \nMethodist Church, the United Church of Christ, the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, and the National Council of Churches have written:\n\n       A general civil rights bill should not exempt individuals \n     because those individuals have reasons based on their \n     religious beliefs for discriminating.\n       There is a substantial difference between a business \n     operating in the arena of commerce and a religious \n     corporation which exists to serve an explicitly religious \n     mission. . . There are profound differences in religious \n     perspectives on th[e subject of homosexuality]. Individuals \n     are, of course, free to believe what they will. But this does \n     not necessarily mean that they are free to discriminate on \n     the basis of those beliefs.\n\n  Individuals who share these beliefs, including my Senate colleagues, \nare not bigots. There is a great deal of misinformation regarding \nhomosexuals and given that information, I recognize that some of my \ncolleagues have concerns about this legislation. I do believe that as \nwe learn from one another and realize that many of our peers, friends, \nand family members are homosexual, the misinformation will be replaced \nwith greater understanding. Until that time, however, we need \nlegislation like the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. This simple, \nstraightforward bill will address the egregious discrimination faced by \nso many gays and lesbians in the workplace.\n\n  African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, native Americans, women, \nthe elderly, the disabled, Jews, Catholics, and many other Americans \nknow what we are talking about here. I remember a time when it was said \nthat a Catholic could not be President. I remember ``Help Wanted'' \nsigns in stores when I was growing up saying ``No Irish Need Apply.'' \nThankfully, we have made a great deal of progress in ending that kind \nof racial, religious, and ethnic bigotry. The Employment \nNondiscrimination Act is the next great step on the American journey to \nfulfill opportunity and freedom from discrimination for all our \ncitizens, and I urge the Senate to enact it.\n  Mr. President, there is a statement that was made by a business when \nthey fired Cheryl Summerville, a former cook. ``This employment is \nbeing terminated due to violation of company policy. This employee is \ngay.''\n  That says it all. That says it all. I remember this was an employee \nwho had worked hard; an outstanding cook who worked at a Cracker Barrel \nrestaurant for many, many years; highly regarded, respected, and hard \nworking; but, nonetheless, was effectively terminated; lost her job \nbecause she was gay and for that reason only.\n  Here we have the statement by Barry Goldwater. It is an interesting \nand a\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\npowerful statement and it is a very worthwhile statement of which we \nshould remind ourselves. I will just read it:\n\n       It's time America realized that there was no gay exemption \n     in the ``right to life, liberty and the pursuit of \n     happiness'' in the Declaration of Independence. Anybody who \n     cares about real moral values understands that this isn't \n     about granting special rights--it's about protecting basic \n     rights.\n\n  That is why Barry Goldwater as well as Coretta Scott King are \nstrongly in support of this legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I mentioned before, there are many things \nthis bill does not do. There are no quotas or preferential treatment.\n  I have addressed the issue about quotas, about maintaining \ninformation or statistics. We do not require quotas in this very \ncarefully drafted legislation. We say no quotas and preferential \ntreatment:\n\n       A covered entity shall not adopt or implement a quota on \n     the basis of sexual orientation. A covered entity shall not \n     give preferential treatment to an individual on the basis of \n     sexual orientation.\n\n  That is about as clear as you could make it in the English language. \nWe invited others who were concerned about this to propose other \nlanguage, and there were many who were concerned about it. We feel that \nthe language included in the legislation addresses that issue about as \nclearly as you possibly could. It is not only our intention but it is \nincluded as language in the bill.\n  We also say:\n\n       No cases based merely on disparate impact claims. The fact \n     that an employment practice has a disparate impact, as the \n     term ``disparate impact'' was used under Section 703(k) of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the basis of sexual \n     discrimination, does not establish a prima facie violation of \n     this title.\n\n  Briefly, Mr. President--I will not take a lot of time on this--what \nthe law generally says with regard to disparate impact cases is, if you \nhave, for example, a 100-man work force and that work force is carrying \n150-pound cement bags, the employer may have a policy that employees be \nable to lift a certain weight. As a result, that employer may not hire \nmany women, even though there exists a pool of women who might want \nthat job. The employer may be able to support the policy resulting in a \ndisparate impact on the pool of women applying for the job. On the \nother hand, if you have 100 computer experts and you have 100 men and \n100 women who have similar qualifications, you are not expecting that \nparticular employer's policy to result in the hiring of 100 men. You \ncan make a case of disparate impact demonstrating that the employer's \npolicy or practice had a disparate impact on the pool of qualified \npeople. At that point, the burden shifts to the employer, who must \npresent evidence supporting their policy. The plaintiff will probably \nbe able to show that there are other, nondiscriminatory policies or \npractices that the employer may use. That is effectively the way the \nlaw goes.\n  This time we are saying that no disparate impact case will be made, \nwhich sustains the position that people do not have to keep statistics \non the sexuality of their employees. Even though that has been \nrepresented during the early course of the debate on Friday, that is \nnot the case. We have made that very, very clear in the language of the \nbill. Accordingly, employers do not have to maintain records on the \nsexual orientation of their employees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a written statement from \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regarding record keeping \nrequirements under the Employment Nondiscrimination Act be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There is no coverage for the armed services. There is no \ncoverage for the not-for-profit religious organizations. There were \nsome questions about the for-profit religious organizations. We think \nthey are more involved in the secular activities than nonsecular \nactivities and that they, therefore, would be covered. You may be able \nto nit-pick this and find a particular individual or a particular \nlocation or a job which might be of particular appeal, but nonetheless \nthis is the way that this legislation is crafted for the reasons that \nwe have outlined in the general presentation.\n\n  We have pointed out:\n\n       Religious organizations are defined as corporations, \n     associations, societies, colleges, schools, universities or \n     educational institutions.\n\n  So we have attempted to draft this legislation in a way to be \ntargeted, to be limited, to be focused, in a way that deals with the \nproblem. There is a problem in the American workplace. Discrimination \nbased upon sexual orientation exists. It is taking place today. We \nreferred to the various studies and, if necessary, we will come back \ninto those studies in the more general debate either tonight or \ntomorrow morning if there is any question about it.\n  I think any Member of the Senate who reads through the various \nDepartment of Justice studies on the hate crimes could not possibly \nquestion that animus toward gays and lesbians exists today. Other \nstudies prove that this is taking place in America's work force. It is \nout there.\n  Although we know the problem exists, there are no rules, regulations, \nor laws to protect people. That is the sad fact. There are limited laws \nin limited States to protect people, but it is not enough that as an \nAmerican you are free from discrimination in one jurisdiction but are \ngoing to be subject to discrimination in another. We should free our \ncountry from that type of travesty.\n  So there is a problem. There are not adequate solutions. Do we have a \ncarefully crafted or targeted program just to deal with this danger? \nThe answer is yes.\n  Finally, I want to just mention the number of cases filed in State \ncourts in the nine States which have laws, as I mentioned last Friday. \nWe are talking about two or three or four cases. I just mention these. \nIn the nine States, California, since 1992, has had five cases; \nConnecticut, four cases; Hawaii, since 1991, no cases; Massachusetts, \ntwo cases; Minnesota, three cases; New Jersey, zero; Rhode Island, \nzero; Vermont, one; Wisconsin, one.\n  So this idea that there is going to be a vast proliferation in the \nFederal courts just does not stand up. When you look at the EEOC \nrecord, as I mentioned earlier, and the whole range of discrimination, \non gender, on race, on disability, on religious discrimination, and \nnational origin, we are talking about a very limited number of cases \nthat have taken place. When you look at what is happening in the \nStates, you will find that these laws have not been the problem. When \npeople know what is expected of them and the forms of discrimination, \nthey will respond to it. What is called for is a clear statement about \nrights and liberties and about bigotry and discrimination. This law \ndoes it. I am very hopeful that we will accept this legislation on \ntomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             EEOC Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements\n\n       1. ENDA provides that the EEOC shall have the same powers \n     to enforce ENDA as it has to enforce Title VII. This tracks \n     the enforcement structure of the Americans With Disabilities \n     Act.\n       2. EEOC's recordkeeping requirements under Title VII are \n     set out at 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1602.12-1602.14. In these \n     sections, EEOC provides that it ``has not adopted any \n     requirement, generally applicable to employers, that records \n     be made or kept.'' Sec. 1602.12. Rather, EEOC requires that \n     ``[a]ny personnel or employment record made or kept by an \n     employer . . . shall be reserved by the employer for a period \n     of one year from the date of the making of the record or the \n     personnel action involved, whichever occurs later'' or until \n     the disposition of a charge of discrimination or lawsuit \n     regarding such action.\n       3. It is likely that EEOC would take the same approach if \n     ENDA were to be enacted into law, requiring employers to keep \n     for specified time periods whatever records they already \n     keep. There is no reason to believe that EEOC would change \n     its longstanding approach to recordkeeping and require the \n     creation or maintenance of any specified records.\n       4. EEOC's only reporting requirement applicable to private \n     sector employers is the EEO-1 form. See 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1602.7. Employers of 100 or more employees are required \n     to file annually a form setting out certain aggregate \n     information about the race, national origin and gender of \n     their employees. The EEO-1 form does not request information \n     regarding age or whether employees have disabilities. Since \n     there is no reason for an employer to know the sexual \n     orientation of an employees in order to comply with ENDA, it \n     is highly unlikely that the EEOC would require employers to \n     gather or submit information regarding the sexual orientation \n     of their employees.\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n       5. The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection also \n     include certain recordkeeping requirements. 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1607. These guidelines--which address issues of \n     disparate impact discrimination--apply to discrimination on \n     the bases of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. \n     Since ENDA specifically does not recognize a cause of action \n     for disparate impact discrimination, the Uniform Guidelines \n     would have no applicability.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 is under control of the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell].\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that will be \nunder my control or a designee, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10054-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10058-S10064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TAX RELIEF AND TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a little earlier today, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was talking about the tax relief proposal of our \nformer colleague, Senator Dole, which, just to sketch it out, calls for \nreplacing the current tax system with a simpler, flatter, fairer \nsystem; it cuts the personal income tax rates across the board by 15 \npercent, it cuts the top capital gains tax rate for individuals in \nhalf, to 14 percent; creates the much-debated $500 per child tax \ncredit, and much needed, I might add; and expands individual retirement \naccounts. It goes on to offer a 1-year tax amnesty during the \ntransition to a new tax system, eliminates tax returns for 40 million \nlow- and middle-income taxpayers, it shifts the burden of proof from \nindividuals to the IRS, which I have long thought should be the case.\n  We currently have two legal systems in the country. In most cases, \nyou are innocent until you are proven guilty, but not if you are \ndealing with the IRS; then you are guilty unless you can somehow \nextract yourself from it. And it ends lifestyle audits, that is just \nspeculation about, ``You are driving sort of an interesting car, maybe \nwe ought to look into that.'' I do not know of any agency in the United \nStates Government--which is a real reach, when you think about it--that \nshares a lower reputation among the American people than the IRS. \nAnybody who has visited with Americans anywhere in the country knows it \nimmediately.\n  I think that lowering the economic pressure on America's working \nfamilies ought to be among our first priorities in this country. I have \nsaid many times here on the Senate floor that an average working family \nin my State is now forfeiting 53 percent of their earned wages to a \ngovernment tax. It is absolutely unheard of.\n\n  I thought this was an interesting quote from Cal Thomas, in a recent \narticle that appeared in the Washington Times. He says:\n\n       When government wants to spend your money it's doing \n     something noble. When you want to keep more of your money, \n     you are greedy.\n\n  I think that perfectly defines what so much of the debate and \nlanguage and rhetoric we hear here in Washington is. It is almost as if \nthe Government owns all the fruits of your labor and once in a while \nallows you to keep some of it. I have to tell you, that is absolutely \nbackward from what Thomas Jefferson had in mind. He warned us, time and \ntime again, of governments that consume the fruits of labor and take it \naway from the laborer for their own purposes.\n  Recently, there was a story that I think appeared in Readers Digest, \nand also the Wall Street Journal, that asked every strata of American \nlife what they thought was a fair tax burden, male/female; income \ngroups from $30,000 to $75,000 or more; Republicans, Democrats, \nindependents, conservatives, moderates, liberals--what is a fair tax?\n  It is almost stunning that it did not matter what their philosophy, \nwhat their gender, what their income strata was, they all had an almost \nidentical answer. The appropriate tax burden on American citizens and \nworkers should not exceed 25 percent. In other words, America believes \nthe tax burden today, which is the highest level it has ever been, or \nthe highest percentage of the gross domestic product, should be half \nwhat it is today; that the Government ought to be able to fulfill its \nresponsibilities with half of what it is extracting from every working \nfamily.\n  Of course, we are hearing a lot of moans and groans from the other \nside. ``Oh, my heavens, what is the Government going to do if it is \nunable to extract all these resources from our working families?'' As \nthough the Government's priorities come ahead of every one of those \nmothers and fathers who are trying to feed their children, educate \nthem, house them, and give them higher education, prepare them \nspiritually. It is just amazing to me. You would think it was the other \nway around, that this money all belonged to the Government and every \nnow and then it passes a little favor out to you.\n  I read over the weekend a story, the headline, ``France to Cut Taxes \n$5 Billion in Effort To Reduce Deficit.''\n\n       Paris, September 5. France will follow Republican \n     Presidential nominee Robert J. Dole's prescription for \n     economic health and cut taxes to the help reduce its budget \n     deficit in the face of a shrinking economy.\n\n  That is what happens. When the Government consumes too much it chokes \nthe economy, it causes people to lose jobs, it causes new businesses \nnot to be formed. I never thought the French would be ahead of us on \nthis.\n  It goes on to say they are adopting Senator Dole's prescription for \neconomic health, cutting taxes to help reduce the budget deficit in the \nface of the shrinking economy.\n\n       The Prime Minister announced tonight--[that is September \n     5]--the $5 billion tax cut for next year and further \n     reductions in following years will make France virtually the \n     only nation in Western Europe to reduce taxes so far this \n     decade.\n\n  That is quite an amazing turn of events, that France would be \nfollowing the advice of Senator Dole and we have nothing but rejection \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts. That is a very, very interesting \ncomparison.\n  Then we see here the Senate minority leader Tom Daschle, South \nDakota, said, ``* * * he detected very little desire in the Democratic \ncaucus to act on a tax cut bill before this election.'' I guess it is \nunderstandable, considering that that caucus is who gave us the highest \ntax increase in American history, and little wonder--nor should we be \nsurprised--they have very little interest in leaving these dollars in \nthe checking accounts of America's families.\n  As a matter of fact, this average family I was talking about just a \nfew moments ago now has 2,600 fewer dollars in their checking account \nsince the arrival of this administration in Washington. In just 4 \nyears, they are now consuming over $2,000 more out of these beleaguered \nworking families in our country.\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota. I would like, if he is agreeable, to extend \nup to 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota on this very, very \nimportant subject of tax relief and tax reform--much, much needed in \nour American economy. More important, around the kitchen table and in \nthe checking accounts of just the poor average family trying to make \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to add, as my colleague mentioned \nabout the tax cuts that are being proposed for France, I think we note \nGermany is also proposing tax cuts because of the huge unemployment \nrate in that country. Again, the same thing, as more government taxes \nhave begun to choke that economy as well as in Sweden, so other nations \naround the world are looking for ways to encourage economic growth \nthrough a reduction in their governments. Like the Senator from Georgia \nsaid, it is hard to believe they would be ahead of the United States \nmaking those determinations.\n  But, Mr. President, America's working families, as we have been \ntalking about, face greater hardships now than at any time in the last \ndecade and the\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\nimpact of the Clinton Presidency is being felt on all fronts: the \neconomy is flat, taxes are on the rise, while take-home pay is not \ngoing anywhere at all.\n  Despite his administration's claims to the contrary, the economy has \nmerely slogged along since Bill Clinton took office, growing at a \nbarely perceptible 2.4 percent and making this recovery the slowest of \nthe past century. The projected growth for next year is only 1.9 \npercent. At the same time, the Government's tax collectors are making \nnew demands of working Americans and siphoning away more of their \ndollars than at any other time in history. In too many cases, workers \nare actually taking home less in their pay envelopes than they did 4 \nyears ago.\n  It did not help when Bill Clinton vetoed the balanced budget \nlegislation passed last year by Congress. Without a balanced budget to \nkeep interest rates in line, families are paying significantly more to \nfinance necessary expenditures: an extra $36,000 for a home mortgage, \nfor example, or $1,400 more for a student loan and higher interest fees \nagain because of a vetoed balanced budget by this President. Those are \ndollars that could have been spent saving for a child's education, or \npurchasing health care, insurance, and other basic family needs.\n\n  If families feel as though they are being squeezed between high \ntaxes, a White House that cannot stop spending, and a stagnant economy, \nthey are right--and it is called the Clinton crunch.\n  Under economic policies perpetuated by the Clinton administration, \nour cities are suffering as well. Since 1965, 15 of the 25 largest U.S. \ncities have together lost over 4 million residents, at the same time \nthe Nation's population has grown by 60 million. As residents bail out \nin record numbers, America's job creators have joined the flight. \nDozens of Fortune 500 companies, once headquartered in New York City \nhave relocated since the 1970's, and the statistics are similarly grim \nin other major cities such as Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, and St. \nLouis.\n  The urban centers in my home State of Minnesota are no exception--\naccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, St. Paul and Minneapolis are \nshrinking, too. In the 4-year period between 1990 and 1994, the \npopulation in my State's two largest cities dropped by nearly 4 \npercent. A study recently released by the Minnesota Planning Office \nrevealed that even as the rest of the State is experiencing dramatic \ngrowth in the 1990's, its metropolitan hubs are not.\n\n  Once the job creators are gone and employment opportunities vanish \nwith them, the hearts of our once mighty economic centers wither away. \nPoverty and crime flourish like weeds in their place.\n  Consider the alarming murder statistics now rocking the Twin Cities. \nSt. Paul recorded 25 homicides in all of 1995; already this year, 25 \nmurders have been reported. The 71 homicides on the books this year in \nMinneapolis mean the city may match--or even exceed--last year's record \nnumber of killings.\n  What is driving people away? Why are our cities no longer the \npowerful economic magnets of the past? Sadly, just as it is responsible \nfor the state of the economy as a whole, the Government itself bears \nmuch of the responsibility.\n  A recent study by the Cato Institute found excessive Government \nspending and high taxes to be a major cause, not just a consequence, of \nurban decline.\n  Researchers have learned that cities that overspend and overtax lose \npopulation; cities with low spending and low taxes gain population.\n  The Federal tax burden continues to rise. Today, a typical, two-\nincome family is paying nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, \nState, and local taxes. That is devastating for urban families who \nstruggle every day to keep a job, put food on the table, and make a \ndecent home for themselves and their children--while Government \ncontinues to demand more.\n\n  We have two workers in most households today. One is working to \nprovide for the family, the other is working to provide for the \nGovernment.\n  Most taxpayers do not realize that in recent years, 15 cents of every \ntax dollar they have contributed has gone toward paying the interest on \nour $5.2 trillion national debt.\n  In 1995, more than $230 billion which could have been put to work \nmeeting the Nation's needs was instead squandered on interest \npayments--payments amassed because for 40 years, Washington always got \nwhatever it wanted when it visited the candy store, whether it had the \nmoney or not.\n  Until Washington stops spending more than it takes in, the national \ndebt will continue to swell, until we have left our grandchildren a \nbill even they will be hard pressed to pay off, if they have the \nability at all to pay.\n  America must do better, and so Republicans, along with Bob Dole, have \nunveiled a plan that will stimulate economic growth and restore \nopportunity to every American family.\n  It is a comprehensive blueprint for our future built on three, \ninterwoven themes: First, America's budget must be brought into \nbalance; second, working families deserve tax relief, and third, the \nIRS, as we know it, must come to an end.\n  And again Bob Dole, has detailed this plan and what it offers for \nindividuals, for families, and for the country.\n  Despite the arguments you hear from across the aisle who draw \nconclusions, irrespective of what is based on these plans, a balanced \nbudget is at the heart of our economic plan. By boarding up the candy \nstore and cutting Federal waste and inefficiency, we will balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 while we protect and preserve Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other vital Federal programs upon which millions of \nAmericans rely.\n  At a time when nearly 1 out of every 4 dollars earned by working \nAmericans goes to pay Federal taxes, we believe relief from Washington \nis long overdue.\n  Our plan benefits every taxpayer by automatically cutting their taxes \nby 15 percent. That is a significant change from the policies of the \npast 4 years, when promises of tax relief were displaced by a 1993 tax \nincrease of historic proportions.\n  More than any other segment of society, America's middle-class \nfamilies have borne the brunt of the Government's tax-happy ways. We \nhave recognized their sacrifice by offering them a $500-per-child tax \ncredit.\n  As the Senate author of the child tax credit, I have long recognized \nthe dramatic results we could achieve by cutting taxes for 24 million \nworking households nationwide and allowing families to control more of \nthe dollars that they work so hard to make. The $500-per-child tax \ncredit is not peanuts--it is real help at a time when more Americans \nare working extra jobs or taking on overtime hours to keep from sinking \nunder their tax burden.\n  In my State alone, it means families in Minnesota would keep $500 \nmillion in their pockets to spend on their families to decide how to \nspend rather than turning those dollars over to Washington for \nWashington to make those decisions.\n  Our vision for America's economic future will confound those who \ncontinue to defend the failed policies of the past. Clinging \ndesperately to their borrow-and-spend ways, they claim that tax relief \nand deficit reduction cannot go hand in hand. Yet our plan proves these \nare compatible goals. The tax cuts of the Reagan era ushered in \nAmerica's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new \njobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs. As more \nAmericans found work and earned higher salaries, they collectively paid \nmore in taxes even though individually they were paying less.\n  Yes, the deficit rose, but it was in the hands of a Democrat-\ncontrolled Congress that failed to match tax cuts with spending cuts of \nits own and instead a Congress that spent $1.59 for every tax dollar it \ncollected. They say we cannot have tax cuts and balance the budget, but \nwe can if we have a Congress that is willing to cut the spending at the \nsame time. A Congress and President committed to realizing a balanced \nbudget in 6 years would achieve unparalleled growth in the economy and \noffer Americans unparalleled opportunities for success.\n  Finally, we must untangle the deeply rooted IRS from the lives of the \nAmerican people. If the IRS seems omnipresent, well, it is. Today, it \nis five times as big as the FBI and twice as large as the CIA. Just to \ncomply with the jumble of laws it has imposed on the taxpayers it takes \nthe annual equivalent of 3 million people, working full time, and the \nIRS continues to grow.\n  But even as its budget has increased from $2.5 billion in 1979 to \n$7.5 billion\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\nthis year, IRS service to the taxpayers has steadily declined.\n  An example: Working families have paid billions just to modernize the \nagency's tax collection system. The results, according to the GAO, have \ncreated chaos, and more importantly, the IRS remains hostile to the \naverage American taxpayer.\n  For example, every day, my State office received complaints from \nconstituents who have been frustrated that they can't even get through \nto an IRS agent. The have been calling the IRS 1-800 lines. The lines, \nthey say are constantly busy. In some cases, my constituents tried for \n3 or 4 days before they were actually able to get through.\n  Another story I recently encountered was that of one Minnesotan who \nowes about $24,000 in back taxes because his building business had a \nfew lean years. He said he built a spec house in 1994 and now he \nfinally has a buyer for it.\n  But here is the problem. He says he will be able to make $18,000 on \nthe house if he sells it, which will all go to the IRS, but the IRS \nstrapped a lien on the house and it will not release it because he \ncan't pay the entire $24,000.\n  So by holding him hostage and demanding it all, the IRS is shooting \nitself in the foot when it could have already collected at least 70 \npercent of the debt and allowed this individual to go on and try to \nearn more money to pay his back taxes. And this is quite typical.\n  The abusive power and the arrogance of the IRS must be brought to an \nend. Fundamental reform of the IRS must be part of any plan to help \nunleash the American economy--a reinvented IRS, a balanced budget, \nrelief from high taxes, and an economy that frees, not entraps, \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, finally, that is the difference between another 4 \nyears of what we have called and what you have heard talked about as \nthe Clinton Crunch and our vision for America's future. That is a \nvision of hope and opportunity, a vision that deserves a closer look by \nthe American taxpayers. I hope they do that in the next couple of \nweeks. Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota \nmight comment. His discussion about American cities is most \ninteresting. My home city since 1970-75 has lost 125,000 residents. My \nargument is that if these cities just continue to impose higher and \nhigher financial burdens, the end result is they make the city richer \nand poorer, because every time they ratchet the tax up, they drive \nanother big segment of the middle class right out of the city. You \ncannot destabilize the middle class. They are going to find the relief \nthat they want. They vote with their feet. Does the Senator concur with \nthat?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Very much so. It is kind of a catch-22. Every time the \ncity says they need more programs to encourage people to stay, they \nhave to somehow have the revenues, so they raise taxes. And every time \nthey raise taxes, they have an ever-increasing burden, not only on the \npeople, but the businesses that support them. Once the businesses \nleave, it leaves a vacuum for crime and other problems. It is a catch-\n22. The Government says they will put more money into it, so they have \nto raise taxes and generate more revenue. And it compounds the problem, \nas the Cato Institute said. The Government is a consequence, not just a \ncontributing factor, but a consequence of this problem.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator for his remarks.\n  In just a moment I am going to turn to our colleague from Alabama. \nBut with regard to the IRS, when I was a youngster, I was always taught \nGovernment was our partner. I think some people have gotten confused \nand they now think it is our boss.\n  Since 1954, the number of different penalties the IRS imposes on \ntaxpayers has increased from 13 to 150--13 to 150. In 1992, the IRS \nimposed 33 million penalties on taxpayers. The amount of penalties the \nIRS assesses has soared from a total of $1.3 billion in 1978 to $12.5 \nbillion in 1992. You think we have a rage of criminality in our \ncountry? I think this is just absurd. The over 100 new penalties \ncreated in recent decades amounts to a deck of trump cards the \nGovernment can play against their own citizens. It is just totally \ninappropriate.\n  Since 1980, the number of levies, the IRS seizures of bank accounts \nand paychecks, has increased fourfold, reaching 3.2 million in 1992. \nThe U.S. General Accounting Office estimated in 1990 that the IRS \nimposes 50,000 incorrect and unjustified levies on citizens and \nbusinesses per year--50,000. GAO estimated that 6 percent of IRS levies \non businesses were incorrect. It is time for a major overhaul there.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to my colleague \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today and \ntry to set the record straight on Senator Dole's tax relief plan. Over \nand over, Mr. President, the media pundits and the liberal Democrats, \nsuch as our President, have been telling the American people that \nSenator Dole's tax relief plan will ``balloon the deficit'' or result \nin ``extreme'' or ``draconian\" spending cuts which will hurt our \nchildren and starve the poor.\n  Mr. President, I believe these scare tactics are not only wrong, they \nare shameless, and it is time we start standing up here and telling the \nAmerican people the truth. I want to briefly lay out in a few minutes \ntoday some of the facts to expose the myths put forth by the guardians \nof Big Government--yes, the guardians of Big Government.\n  First, Mr. President, President Clinton, I believe, is wrong, wrong \nto claim that broad-based tax relief will increase the deficit. He \noften points to the 1980's as proof that cutting taxes results in \nhigher deficits. However, the facts just do not support his claim. For \nexample, when President Reagan, with the help of the Congress, cut the \ntaxes in the early 1980's from a top rate of 70 percent down to 28 \npercent, total revenues to the Treasury during that time increased by \n99.4 percent during the following decade.\n  What was this due to? It was due to the record rates of economic \ngrowth which occurred during the 1980's, an average, Mr. President, as \nyou will recall, of about 4 percent a year. These cuts stimulated the \nlongest peacetime economic expansion in American history. More than 20 \nmillion new jobs were created, and more people were paying taxes, \nincreasing Government revenues at that time.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the massive deficits of the 1980's \ndid not result from tax cuts; they resulted from skyrocketing rates of \nFederal spending. For example, during the 1980's, Federal spending \nincreased by 112 percent; it doubled in just 10 short years. This out-\nof-control spending is the culprit for the deficits of the 1980's, not \nPresident Reagan's tax cuts.\n  What this means for us today is that we should not hesitate to give \nthe American people long overdue tax relief. History over and over, Mr. \nPresident, has proven that lower taxes generate economic growth and \nwill increase every citizen's standard of living. But we need to make \nsure such relief is accompanied by cuts in spending. Cuts in spending \nis the issue.\n  This is where the Democrats have tried to scare people. We have heard \nover and over that broad-based tax relief will result in extreme cuts \nin spending. Mr. President, the underlying assumption of this argument \nis that the Government has cut costs everywhere it can and that all \nwasteful Government programs have been eliminated and that the only \nGovernment programs which are left are ones that, if cut, would hurt \nchildren or starve the poor. That, Mr. President, is every bit as \nextreme as it is ridiculous.\n  The idea that the Government simply cannot afford to let people keep \nmore of the money that they earn is appalling. Whose money is it \nanyway, Mr. President?\n\n  Since when did the Government have an entitlement to everything \npeople earned? This is an important point here today because, by buying \ninto the argument that the Government cannot afford to give Americans a \ntax cut, we lose title to our freedom every day, sort of by adverse \npossession, if you will. Congress should not have to justify broad-\nbased tax relief. Rather, Mr. President, it should justify every single \ndollar it takes out of the pockets of the American people who work \nevery day to supply it.\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\n  The White House should never again say that we cannot afford broad-\nbased tax relief.\n  Let me give you just a small example of one way we could pay for tax \nrelief. I think it is instructive. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive \nPolicy Institute has identified, Mr. President, more than $100 billion \nof corporate welfare hidden in the current Tax Code, special interests' \nTax Code. We should eliminate all corporate welfare, Mr. President, and \nenact immediate tax relief for individuals in America.\n  I have introduced legislation which would do this by scrapping the \nentire Tax Code, eliminating all deductions and special tax breaks for \nspecial interests, and replacing it with a low, flat-rate tax system. \nThe Tax Code should not be a tool, Mr. President, for Washington to \nmaintain control over our citizens' private resources. Washington \nshould not single out certain people or corporations in America to \nreceive special treatment in the form of tax breaks, as they have done \nover the years.\n  Everyone--everyone--in America should be on the same playing field. \nAnd they are not. The flat tax would rid this town of thousands of \nlobbyists who spend millions of dollars a year trying to get special \ntax breaks for corporate America. All in all, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has identified thus far 64 provisions of the Tax Code which can \nbe considered corporate welfare. This is increasing the tax burden of \nthe average taxpayer by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n  Mr. President, I reject the notion that we cannot afford broad-based \ntax relief for the American people. That view is simply a smokescreen \nused by the President and the Democrats to safeguard their sacred \nsocial programs and maintain Federal control over the economy. There is \nplenty of room in the Federal budget, I believe, if we look hard \nenough, to provide broad-based tax relief and still balance the budget.\n  Republicans have already done it once and I think we can do it again. \nI just hope the next time we do, Mr. President, we will have a \nPresident who will not protect the status quo and veto our proposal but \nlook to help the working people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I certainly want to thank and commend \nthe Senator from Alabama for his remarks on the current economic burden \non America's working families. We have just been joined by my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma. We have been talking about the IRS and the way it almost \nfunctions out of a system of fear and as an arrogant bully. I know the \nSenator has come to speak on that.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I am glad to have an \nopportunity to talk about this. I certainly agree with the Senator from \nAlabama when he talks about the situations that come up.\n  I do not know why it is that people will not read a little history. \nIn three decades in the last 100 years we have dramatically increased \nour revenues by reducing marginal tax rates. Of course, the last one \nthat was the most obvious, the first one in our lifetime, was John \nKennedy when he said we have to have more revenue, and to get more \nrevenues we will reduce the tax rates. It worked. Of course, it \nhappened again in the 1980's.\n  Again, the problem we have with a number of bureaucracies, and \ncertainly the IRS is probably the best example to use, is they have so \nmuch power and they are able to use that power to whip people into \nsubmission.\n  I have several cases I will share with you, Mr. President. An IRS \ncase, one William Pell Thompson, an Air Force captain based in Montana \nwas expecting a modest $104 tax refund for 1995. Instead he was told by \nthe IRS that his $104 had been seized for back child support payments \nin North Carolina where he was accused of owing $6,700 that soon would \nbe taken from his wages. Captain Thompson has never lived in North \nCarolina, had only two children by his first and only wife, to which he \nwas still happily married. Captain Thompson was awaiting transfer to \nColorado Springs in which he was unable to get the credit to buy a home \nand a number of things that happened that really were destructive in \nhis life.\n  Here is a story that was testimony before a Senate subcommittee. \nRather than go into the details, I will read the letter, a suicide note \nthat was given by a man named Council. His wife's name was Kay. This is \nthe letter:\n\n       My Dearest Kay: I have taken my life in order to provide \n     capital for you. The IRS and its liens which have been taken \n     against our property illegally by a runaway agency of \n     our government have dried up all sources of credit for us. \n     So I have made the only decision I can. It is purely a \n     business decision. You will find my body on the lot of the \n     north side of the house.\n\n  She eventually won a Federal court ruling and she and her husband \nowed the IRS nothing.\n  I got off the phone a few minutes ago and there is a guy in Tulsa, \nMr. President, named Iliff. He rebuilds airplanes. In fact, a couple \nyears ago I flew an airplane around the world emulating the flight of \nWiley Post. He is the one who rebuilt the aircraft for me that had been \npreviously wrecked.\n  In 1994--and I know this guy real well, and his family--we were \ncontacted by Chuck Iliff regarding a problem his mother, Edna Faye \nIliff, a 90-year-old widow from Muskogee, OK, was having with the IRS. \nThe IRS was pursuing a case against his brother, a self-employed \nboilermaker.\n  What had happened here was Mrs. Iliff, who is a widow, had failing \nhealth. She had a small savings of some $3,600 she put in her account, \nbut she allowed her two sons to have their names on the account in the \nevent something happened to her so they could get at the money without \nhaving serious problems.\n  The IRS came along and seized her account because they felt they had \na case against the son of failing to pay withholding taxes. They \nactually got that money from Mrs. Iliff, a 90-year-old widow. Later on \nthey found they were wrong, and they were able to get back--at a cost \nto the Iliffs of $1,600--that $3,600 back, and there is no interest \nthat was paid.\n  What I can say is there are a lot of people in Government that are \nvery good people. Unfortunately, the more power you give to someone, \nthe greater the propensity to abuse that power. As Lord Acton said, \n``absolute power corrupts absolutely.''\n  It is not just the IRS. We have a case in Tulsa, Jimmy Dunn, Mill \nCreek Lumber Co., called and said, ``Inhofe, the EPA has put me out of \nbusiness.'' I said, ``What did you do wrong?'' And he said, ``I don't \nthink I did anything wrong. I have been selling in our small family-\nowned lumber company, our used crankcase oil to the same contractor for \n20 years.'' He said that contractor was licensed by the Federal \nGovernment, the State of Oklahoma, the county of Tulsa, and yet they \nhave traced some of that oil from 10 years ago that went to the Double \nEagle Superfund site, and now I have a letter in front of me which he \nread from the Administrator of the EPA that said, ``We are going to \ncome after you for fines of $25,000 a day.''\n  Now, obviously, they did not do it, but the whole idea is many people \nin the bureaucracy consider it their job and they seem to enjoy abusing \nnormal, honest, taxpaying citizens. These cases with the IRS just point \nout that not only are we an overtaxed society, we are paying too much \nin taxes, the American families are having to pay too much, but the way \nin which it is collected is also abusive.\n  I am hoping--and we have made several proposals, Mr. President, the \nRepublican Party, some call it a flat tax, some talk about having a VAT \ntax to replace income taxes altogether--something will come along and \nwe will be able to propose and pass that. We know if we pass it with \nthis Republican Congress that now the President will veto it. We have \nheard that over and over again. I am hoping we will be able to be \nsuccessful in changing the personality in the White House so we can get \nreal tax reform and the abusive practices of many of the bureaucracies \noff the backs of the honest taxpaying American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I, too, had noted \nthe case where the husband committed suicide in order to protect the \nfinancial interests.\n  Another case noted that way, ``The IRS had claimed that my parents \nJack and Wanda Biggars owed $90,000 in back taxes. On February 10, \n1988, the agency\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\nwas going to auction off their home. On the morning of the auction my \nmother shot my father and then turned the gun on herself.''\n  Some of these cases are just absolutely beyond belief. One of them I \nwas reading earlier this afternoon, about a day care center. And this \nwoman, Sue Stoya, had gone to Englewood World to pick up her 7-year-old \ndaughter, Katherine. Before they could leave with their children, the \nparents said they had to sign a form pledging to pay the Government \nwhat they owed the day care center, because the day care center was in \narrears. They indicated that you could not take your child out of the \nbuilding--get this--the Federal agent said, ``You cannot have your \nchild until you sign this document.''\n\n  This whole thing has gone way too far. We have been joined by the \nSenator from Wyoming. I would like to yield up to 10 minutes to him for \nhis presentation this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for arranging for time \nto talk about taxation. It seems to me that it is one of the things \nthat all of us talk about most of the time in various ways, and we need \nto talk about it. I would like to move away a little bit from the \nspecifics of the amount that we talk about and the specifics of even \nhow it is done and, rather, talk a little more about the philosophy of \ntaxation. I will talk a little bit about the strategy of taxation. I \nthink it is important, over time, that we really take a look at where \nwe want to go, what the choices are with respect to Government, with \nrespect to taxation, where you and I will be, where our kids will be, \nand where our grandkids will be in terms of the strategy and philosophy \nof taxation over a period of time. It is a broad question.\n  The numbers I have seen now, Mr. President, indicate that, on the \naverage, American families pay 38 percent of their income in total \ntaxes. Now, that is a lot of money. That is a lot. Think about how long \nyou work out of the year in order to pay your taxes. I believe in May, \nor late May, is tax day. So without the detail, I think that is a \nphilosophy of taxes.\n  Obviously, there have to be taxes paid in a democracy, in a civilized \nsociety, to cover those kinds of things that clearly have to be done by \nGovernment, whether it be defense, interstate commerce, or whatever. \nThere is no question about that. But it seems to me what we really \nought to be thinking about, as we are into an election cycle, and \nindeed into an election, is the fact that there are choices. There are \nfairly clear choices as to where we go with Government and where we go \nwith taxes. And there is a direct relationship between the two things. \nWe are not just talking here about numbers, about arithmetic, and we \nare not just talking about addition; we are talking about Government. \nObviously, the more Government that we ask for, the more Government \nthat we want, and if we are going to be fiscally responsible, of \ncourse, the more taxes we have to come up with to pay for that. So \nthere are choices. That is what elections ought to be about.\n  I must tell you that I am a little concerned that over the years--and \nthis campaign is more so than any that I think I have ever seen, where \nthe choices are pretty badly blurred. We don't really have spelled out, \nas we should have, the clear choices that voters have to make. That is \nwhat elections are for--making choices. Taxes, of course, is one of \nthem. But it is really secondary to how much Government you are going \nto have. And that is a choice that we make.\n  Some people want more Government; others choose less. I happen to, as \nyou can tell from my comments, be on the less side. But it is choice. \nYou have to talk about the role of government. What do you think the \nFederal Government ought to be doing? What are the roles? What are the \nroles of the State and local governments? I have just come back, as \nmost of you have, from my State--in my case, Wyoming--where you get \ninvolved in lots of things. Most recently, frankly, was a fundraiser \nfor the museum at the University of Wyoming honoring Alan and Ann \nSimpson. An effort was made, voluntarily, to do something in our town, \nin our State, for the museum for the university. I spoke earlier to the \nemergency medical people in Cheyenne, people who volunteer to do things \nin their communities. These are very important, life or death matters \nin small towns. There is no hospital there. So if something happens, \nyou use the emergency medical service. It's done by local government \nand voluntarism.\n\n  It has to do with choices and the role of government. Federal \ninvolvement? Obviously, some things are inherently Federal, such as \ninterstate commerce, and many of those things. So I guess I am taking a \nvery difficult topic and trying to make it simple for myself. There is \na strategy of where we go, where you want to be in a number of years, \nand in terms of the size and role of government and, consequently, the \ntaxes that are paid with it. Too often, it seems to me, we get involved \nwith the details--and they are important--of how you tax, who you tax, \nhow you enforce it, and all those kinds of things, which are critical. \nBut overshadowing all that and overriding that is a strategy and a \nphilosophy.\n  There are different philosophies, and they are legitimate. \nUnfortunately, they are not altogether clear. There is a gentleman at \nthe University of Wyoming who is very clear. He is a very liberal man, \nand it is a legitimate view. He thinks there ought to be more \nGovernment and there ought to be more taxes. He believes government can \nspend the money better than you and I can in families. That is a \nlegitimate view. But it is a choice. Quite often, right here, those \nbasic differences are sort of submerged and we begin to talk about \ndetails when we really ought to start with the question of philosophy, \nof where you want to go.\n  I think it is important to recognize that there are differences. One \nof the things that we need to think about, strategically, of course, is \nwhat is the impact of high taxes? What is the impact on the economy? \nClearly, if there is less money taken in taxes, more money is invested \nin the system, more money is invested in the economy, more money is \ninvested to create jobs, more people are able to earn and take care of \nthemselves. That is inherently clear. It is a very efficient way of \nallocating funds in the market system.\n  The other question you have to ask yourself, of course, is whether \nmoney is spent better by being collected in taxes and then spent by the \nGovernment on behalf of the people, or is it indeed spent better when \nyou and I and our families in this country decide for ourselves where \nto spend our money?\n  A further question, of course, is, what are the incentives? This is a \nsystem of economic incentives. We work and we invest because there is a \nchance to be successful, there is a chance to be profitable, there is a \nchance to do well. That is what the system is about. That is what the \nincentives are. So taxes seek to take away some of that.\n  I guess I want to stress again that taxes are a legitimate thing, but \nwe have to decide what it is we want. It is very key, I believe, to \nwhere we go in the future. So there will be a great debate around tax \nrelief. I think maybe, in the case of tax relief, it will be fairly \nclear. The differences are fairly clear and people can make the choice. \nOne of the things, of course, inherent is that, at least to some \ndegree--and I am not a economist and I know it only goes so far--\nreducing tax levies and tax percentages increases the total taxes that \ncome in, because it encourages the investment and more and more \nactivity.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that as we talk about our choices, you and \nme, as citizens, as we come to making the decisions that are inherent \nin an election, that we take a look at the philosophy of taxes. Are we \nbetter off if we could reduce that 38 percent, have some tax relief, \nhave more money to invest, have more money to spend, and more money to \ngenerate for the economy, or not?\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest that one of the real issues for us is--and \nmy philosophy obviously is that we ought to have less government--that \nwe ought to do more closer to the people, and more in the States and \nlocalities where we can do it more efficiently. Our real task is to \nlook forward to the future as to where we go with young people, where \nthey will be, where they will be paying taxes, and whether they will \nhave the freedom to choose to spend vis-a-vis other questions that we \nface.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity. I appreciate my friend \nfrom\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nGeorgia providing for this debate, this discussion, about an issue that \naffects all of us and that we will decide in November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks by \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  In a moment I am going to turn to the Senator from Florida. But just \nlet me say very quickly that we know that virtually every segment of \nAmerican life deals with the tax burden today, and it is about what \nthey think it should be. You would be hard pressed to find a segment of \nour country that believes the IRS is not a threatening institution \ntoday. That is the majority of American people--the vast majority of \nAmerican people--think this agency needs an overhaul. By staggering \nnumbers, the American people feel the tax system is utterly too \ncomplicated. In fact, it takes the average taxpayer 11 hours to do \ntheir taxes. That adds up to 5.4 billion man-hours per year. The \nstatistics are alarming. It is too high. It is too intrusive, and it is \ntoo complicated. It ought to be at the core of the work of this \nCongress and the next Congress to get these things corrected.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida. That will be about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. That should \nbe plenty of time.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to lay the \ngroundwork about why it is important that the Dole-Kemp economic plan \nbe embraced by the Nation and eventually passed into law.\n  There are two points that I want to talk about. One has to do with \nthe growth of the economy, and the other has to do with the tax relief \nthat is really needed for the American family.\n  But I want to start from a premise that the discussion here really is \nmotivated by the opportunity over the years to talk to people in my \nState about the burden that they feel the Government has imposed on \nthem in the form of taxes. They believe that there is too much \nWashington interference in their lives, that Washington spends too \nmuch, that Washington wastes too much of the money, that Washington \ntaxes them too much, and that they really want Washington off their \nbacks. You have to think about the perspective that they have. If you \nstop and think about individuals that you know, or individuals that you \nhave met when you have been out to town meetings, or wherever, that \nhave told you stories about their lives, then it becomes real. It \nbecomes something other than a debate about economics. It becomes \nsomething other than a debate about Democrats versus Republicans, or \nconservatives versus liberals. It becomes a debate about what is in \ntheir best interest, about what we can do, in essence, to allow \nAmerica's families to become stronger. As America's families become \nstronger, the Nation becomes stronger as well.\n\n  So the kind of people who I think about are those individuals who \ncome to me and tell me that both husband and wife are working and that \nthey are working long, long hours; that they get up before sunrise, and \nthey probably don't get back to their home until after the sun has set. \nThey get up on Tuesday and do it over again; on Wednesday and do it \nover again; on Thursday and do it over again; and on Friday and do it \nover again. Some do it on Saturdays.\n  I know of a family where the husband works two jobs during the week, \ngoes home Friday night, and the wife begins work for the weekend. He \ntakes care of the children over the weekend, and she works over the \nweekend. Those are the kinds of people that I am talking about that are \npaying--as the Senator from Georgia indicated--almost 40 percent of \ntheir earnings in taxes. That is, when they pick up their paycheck at \nthe end of the week, or every 2 weeks, or at the end of the month, like \neverybody else, they immediately look at the deductions. ``How much is \nbeing taken out of my pay?'' That number is getting larger and larger \nevery year.\n  What it means is that they are having to work longer and longer. In \nfact, I think the tax freedom day is now occurring sometime in May. For \nthose who do not know what tax freedom day is, tax freedom day is the \nday, when it arrives, where you no longer have to be working to pay \nyour taxes. Everything from that day forward is free of taxes. You paid \nfor the Government in Washington, the government in Tallahassee, or the \ngovernment in Lee County, or whatever it might happen to be. That tax \nfreedom day is taking each of us individually longer and longer and \nlonger through each year to get to the point where the worker actually \nis doing it for their families--to be able to see that our children \nhave an opportunity for a better education, that they are better \nclothed, that their housing is in better condition.\n  In fact, that brings to mind one of the things that the Dole-Kemp \nfolks are talking about--that today in America the typical family in \nAmerica is paying more in taxes to Washington, to Tallahassee, to Lee \nCounty, Fort Myers--more in taxes than they are spending on food, \nclothing, and shelter. There is just something fundamentally wrong when \ngovernment has gotten to that size.\n  Again, without getting into the debate about liberal versus \nconservative, I think when people pick up those paychecks and look to \nsee what their deductions are, they are realizing that they are paying \nfor a government, frankly, that they believe is wasting their money. So \nit is from that premise that I make these remarks.\n  Again, two points: There is economic growth and the burden of taxes \non the American family. There are those who are going to say, ``Connie, \nyou know, you are going to be talking about weak economic growth in the \ncountry, but President Clinton has told us that this is the strongest \neconomic growth in three decades, I think.'' That is just fundamentally \nwrong. Yes, we had a good month or a good quarter last quarter. I am \ndelighted about that. We saw the unemployment rate drop, and we saw the \ngrowth rate in the country go to 4.8 percent. That is good. But the \nproblem is that every economist, that I am aware of anyway--or I should \nprobably should say almost all economists are predicting that the \ngrowth rate in the economy is going to slow down again. The year 1997 \nis projected by the Federal Reserve, I believe, which is saying 1.75 to \n2.25 for 1997. The administration's own forecast is 2.3.\n\n  Again, let me put into context where we have been with the Clinton \nadministration. The average growth in the economy now during the \nClinton administration is 2.35 percent. How does that compare with \nother periods of time? For the 10 years preceding President Clinton, \nthe average growth was 3.2 percent; the year immediately preceding \nPresident Clinton, 3.7 percent. The five economic expansions since \nWorld War II, 4.4 percent. If you take every year since the end of \nWorld War II, it is 3.2 percent. I mean the economy is moving along at \na snail's pace.\n  What does that mean to that family I was referring to a minute ago? \nIt means the loss of production in the country that amounts to about \n$308 billion. If you convert that into what that means to the family, \nif we had been growing, let us say, at the average of 3.2 over these \nlast 3\\1/2\\ years compared to what we have been, the average family in \nAmerica would be $3,116 better off; $260 a month better off as a \nresult.\n  Some of the other statistics that I have developed: The typical \nhousehold income is about $1,000 less than the average of the decade \nbefore President Clinton. Real hourly wages and real weekly wages are \nboth lower now than they were in 1992. After-tax incomes are growing at \nabout roughly half the rate prior to President Clinton. They are \ngrowing at a rate now of about 1.8 percent compared to the decade \nbefore President Clinton of 3.2 percent. Median family income has \ndeclined 4 out of the last 5 years. As I said a moment ago, families \nare paying more in taxes than they are for food, clothing, and shelter.\n  The Dole-Kemp--I think it is important that people focus on it as an \neconomic plan, not just as a tax plan, but an economic plan--has a \nnumber of components to it.\n  One is the requirements to pass a balanced budget constitutional \namendment which would make it a constitutional requirement that we \nbalance the budget.\n  What does that mean? Let us say that the critics are right, that the \ngrowth, the return, if you will, the recapture that comes as a result \nof the\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nlower tax rates is not 27 percent but 20 percent. That means we are \ngoing to have to find more spending to make the reductions or we are \ngoing to have to put off some tax relief for the American family. I \nhappen to believe that we can do the 15-percent reduction in marginal \ntax rates and that we can give a $500 per child tax credit and still \nmeet that goal. So, No. 1, balance the budget, constitutional \namendment, a balanced budget plan to balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  The second component--I think the first most important--reduce the \ntaxes, a 15 percent reduction in the marginal tax rate. I would ask \npeople to focus on the marginal tax rate. What we are saying to \nindividuals with these lower rates is you get to keep more of what you \nsave, earn, invest, work for. You get to keep more of it.\n  Most people believe that if you get to keep more of what you are \nearning, you are more inclined to try to figure out ways to earn more \nbecause you get to keep more of it.\n  In addition to that, the plan calls for a cutting in half of the \ncapital gains tax rate. I know there are people who say this is just \nnothing but a giveaway to the wealthy. I adamantly disagree with that. \nI think there is statistical data which indicates that is not an \naccurate statement. The issue here is about America's future. Are we \ngoing to have the capital necessary to invest in the new technologies \nof the 21st century?\n  I give a little bit different perspective. Think of capital gains \ntaxes as a wall that has been built around old investment. If that wall \nis too high, you are not going to be able to get that capital to move \nfrom the old investments to the new investments because people are \ngoing to say the rate on that tax is too high; I just will not sell the \nasset. If it is not sold, A, there is no revenue to the Federal \nGovernment and, B, there is no ability to transfer that capital from \nthe old technologies into the technologies of the future. So I think \nthey are right on target in saying we need to find a way to allow this \ncapital to flow.\n  Third, it is time that we gave American families, middle-income \nAmerica, a break; that we say to them, yes, there is something in this \nfor them in the sense if we are going to reduce the size, the scope and \nthe involvement of Washington, DC, clearly there ought to be a benefit \nto the taxpayer and we think that that benefit ought to be directed \nmore at the low income, at the families of America, and that happens as \na result of a $500 per child tax cut.\n  The next element of the plan is to look at areas like litigation and \nregulation. We all know that the area of too much legal attack on \nbusiness today has slowed down and reduced our productivity. So we \nbelieve that we have to make changes with respect to regulation and \nlitigation.\n  Equally important, Senator Dole and Jack Kemp have pointed out the \nimportance of education and training. If we do those combinations of \nthings, balancing the budget, reducing the tax burden, providing \nopportunities for education, training, and changing the laws with \nrespect to litigation and regulation, we can get this economy moving \nagain.\n  I for one--and I think the American people--believe that accepting \nthe notion that this country can only grow at 2.5 percent is a tragedy. \nWe are taking away the opportunities for American families and for our \nchildren.\n  The last point I mention is that I believe President Clinton's \neconomic policies are robbing America and our families and our children \nof their economic future, and we have to change that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am going to start off with a few remarks about the \nbudget and tax issues which the Senator from Florida and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming have been talking about. I listened to them carefully. \nWhen I hear it said that President Clinton is robbing this country of \nits economic future, I have to ask the question, where were we before \nPresident Clinton was elected and before we passed his budget?\n  Well, we were in a very sad state, indeed. We did not see any jobs \nbeing created. Under this President, we have seen 10 million new jobs \ncreated. We now have a 5.1-percent unemployment rate which is the \nlowest in many a year. We have people feeling better about themselves, \nabout their future. And we have seen for 4 years in a row, Mr. \nPresident, deficit reduction that has more than cut the deficit in \nhalf.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that this \ndeficit reduction for 4 years in a row is the first time since the \nCivil War that we have seen that record, and it is not much of a trick \nto have economic growth when you are priming the pump of Government \nspending. As a former economics major, I learned that very early on in \nEconomics 101. That is what happened in the early 1980's. That pump was \nprimed and the budget deficit shot up to almost $300 billion, almost $1 \nbillion a day, and yet under the George Bush administration we \nstagnation.\n  So we have come very far. And because I really mostly want to talk \nabout the DOMA legislation and the ENDA legislation that is pending, I \nam going to be very brief, but I feel I must respond to the point about \nthe tax cuts and the Senator from Florida saying I know we get accused \nof being for tax cuts for the rich. He said he does not agree with \nthat. Well, I want to put the facts out here. Under the Dole plan, if \nyou earn between $1,000 and $10,000 a year, you are the working poor, \nyou do not even get 50 cents back a month from the Dole economic plan \nand his tax cuts. You get $5 a year. If you earn a little more than \nthat, between $10,000 and $20,000, you would get back $120 a year--a \nfew dollars a month. And I have to tell you that in this country \nbetween earning a dollar a year and $30,000 a year, you get 8 percent \nof the tax cut benefit. You get 8 percent of the tax cut benefit and \nyou are really more than 56 percent of taxpayers.\n  So why not be honest about where the breaks go. And let me tell you \nwhere they go. If you earn approximately $250,000, you get back $25,000 \na year. If you earn $1 million a year, the Donald Trumps of the \ncountry, you will get back $50,000. So the wealthiest get back $50,000 \nand the working poor get back $5. And we have statements on this floor \nthat say this Dole plan is fair. The difference between the Clinton \nplan and the Dole plan is that our President is targeting those tax \ncuts to the people who need it and the Dole plan again favors the very \nwealthiest among us. Good people, hard-working people who earn a lot of \nmoney, I congratulate them for that. It is the American dream. But if \nyou were to ask them, I think they would candidly say they are not in \nneed of a tax cut because what it means is, if you look at the Dole \nplan, over $500 billion of cuts--and we have looked at this carefully--\nit is about a 40-percent cut in education that would be required, a 40-\npercent cut in the environment that would be required. Since Senator \nDole says he will not touch Medicare, that means he has to go in and \ncut cops on the beat and everything else. Forty percent to do what? To \ngive a tax break to the wealthiest. I mean this is the deja vu all over \nagain theory.\n\n  So I am going to move to the legislation that is before us. Tomorrow \nI am going to make some comments on it. But I really wanted to put some \nof those numbers out on the record as a member of the Budget Committee \nbecause we have looked at them very, very carefully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10064-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10064-S10065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, tonight I rise to speak on the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act and on the Defense of Marriage Act. The \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, is necessary, and I \nthank very much Senator Kennedy for being so tenacious to get it to the \nfloor and Senator Lieberman for his help and Senator Jeffords. This is \na bipartisan bill and it deserves broad bipartisan support.\n  ENDA is necessary because gay men and lesbians face discrimination in \nhiring, promotions, and pay simply by virtue of their sexual \norientation. Some\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nStates do offer protection to all the people who are victims of \nemployment discrimination. Unfortunately, 41 States do not. So it seems \nto me this is a bill we should be proud to support as Republicans and \nas Democrats.\n  The reach of ENDA is modest. It exempts small business, religious \ninstitutions, and the military and explicitly prohibits the adoption of \nquotas. It places the burden of proof entirely on the person claiming \nto be the victim of discrimination.\n  I think it is quite instructive to note that ENDA has been endorsed \nby such blue chip companies as Apple Computer, AT, Bankers Trust, \nBethlehem Steel, Eastman Kodak, Genentech, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft, \nNynex, Pacific Gas & Electric, Pacific Telesis, Polaroid, Prudential \nInsurance, Quaker Oats, RJR Nabisco, Silicon Graphics, and Xerox. Mr. \nPresident, among that list there are many, many endorsers from my home \nState. These excellent companies that understand fairness and justice \nin the workplace have endorsed ENDA. I hope it will pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10064-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10065-S10066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now there is the question of the other bill that will \ncome before us, known as DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. When I \nheard that there was going to be a bill before us called the Defense of \nMarriage Act, I thought it was going to be about our families and how \nthey cope with the problems and stresses that most married people face. \nThere are financial insecurities with jobs that are ever changing, \npension insecurities with corporate raids on pensions and inadequate \nprotections in the law, there is pressure to save enough to afford a \nhome, there is child abuse going on in families, there is alcohol and \ndrug abuse, there is spousal abuse, there are pressures from lack of \nhealth care. We have tried to fix some of those in this Congress. There \nare pressures, worrying, ``Will Grandma and Grandpa be all right? Will \nthey make it? Will their Medicare be cut? Can we function as an \nextended family in this fast moving world?'' These are some of the \npressures.\n  I thought it was about, perhaps, flexible working schedules so there \ncould be more time off for school and doctor appointments. I thought it \nmaybe addressed the issue of child care. It is called the Defense of \nMarriage Act. I thought we were going to deal with those issues, the \nstresses on marriage. So I was looking forward to seeing this \nlegislation.\n  Then, when I see it, it turns out to be something completely \ndifferent. It turns out to be about the U.S. Congress getting into the \nissue of marriage. No State legislature is even suggesting that it \nrecognize gay marriage, not one State in this Union. Not one person in \nthe Senate or the House has introduced legislation to recognize gay \nmarriage--not one. There is no bill pending before us to legalize gay \nmarriage and provide benefits to these couples. Not one group has asked \nany of us, to my knowledge, to carry such legislation.\n\n  We are told by constitutional scholars that even if one State does \nrecognize gay marriage, other States have the option not to recognize \nit. University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein, one of the \nNation's most distinguished legal scholars, author of numerous texts \nand articles on constitutional law, testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that States are not required to recognize other \nStates' marriages. So why this legislation now? With all the things we \ncould be doing that would make a real difference in people's lives, \nwith all the things we could be doing that would really matter to \nfamilies, we are taking up this so-called Defense of Marriage Act, \nwhich, as I have stated, has nothing to do, in my view, with helping \nmarried couples cope with the stress on their marriages.\n  Does the author of the bill in the House, whom the press says has \nbeen married three times, truly believe that the Defense of Marriage \nAct would have made him a better husband or his wives better wives? I \nseriously doubt that. I doubt that.\n  Marriages do run into trouble; one in two ends in divorce and that is \ntragic. It is tragic for the people involved and it is tragic for the \nchildren. There are things we should all do in our relationships and as \na community and in our religious institutions to make marriage \nstronger. But passing this act does nothing to affirm marriage at all.\n  Many of us in this Chamber, myself included, have been married for \nmany years to the same person, and I truly believe that those of us who \nare honest about it would never list the possibility of gay marriage \nlooming on the horizon as a reason there may be stress in our marriage. \nI believe, if we were honest, we would never cite that as a reason for \na problem of stress in our marriage. In any event, gay marriage is not \nlooming anywhere. As I said, not one State is considering it, not one \nState legislature. No one has asked to do it. There is no bill pending.\n  Yes, the Hawaii courts are looking at the issue, but that final \nresolution is years away. There is plenty of time for us to have this \ndebate. But this Congress cannot wait to have this debate. The Hawaii \ncase is only now about to go to trial. Legal experts are convinced that \ngiven the stakes, the losing side will surely appeal the case all the \nway to the State supreme court. We are talking about a long time here.\n  So why are we doing this bill now? No one is asking for it, no one is \nproposing any of it, no one State is considering recognizing gay \nmarriage.\n  I have to give my opinion. It is all about the calendar, that is what \nI think. It is an election-year ploy to get Senate and House Members to \ncast a tough vote. We know it is a tough vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 10 \nminutes. My understanding is we would not have a 10-minute rule at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator has an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But I think, when we do this, we do lose something. I \nthink we lose our soul. That is what you lose when you scapegoat a \ngroup of people, a whole group of people who have never even asked us \nto legalize gay marriage. Scapegoating is ugly. History has seen it too \nmany times. You know that and I know that. Groups of people who are \ndifferent are identified. It becomes ``we'' versus ``them.'' Their \nidentity as individuals is lost and they become faceless. Special rules \nare written for them. They are singled out as a group. Read the history \nbooks, my colleagues. You will find it there. We are all Americans in \nthis country, regardless of our differences. We are Americans first. We \nare God's children, all of us, regardless of our differences. Why do we \nneed to craft a piece of legislation designed to hurt our fellow \nAmericans when there is absolutely no need to do it?\n\n  President Clinton, who comes to a different conclusion on this bill \nthan I do, writes in his book ``Between Hope and History'':\n\n       . . . we must make a choice . . . shall we live by our \n     fears and define ourselves by what we are against, or shall \n     we live by our hopes and define ourselves by what we are \n     working for, by our vision of a better future . . . that is a \n     choice we must make every day.\n\n  This DOMA bill, in my opinion, is a statement of what we are against. \nIt does nothing, it does not do one thing, to make Americans' lives \nbetter. It is a classic example of the politics of division, of a so-\ncalled wedge issue to divide us one from another without any reason to \ndo so. I think even if it means you pick up a seat or two in Congress, \nthe better angels of our nature should stop this politics of division \nand hatred. The Defense of Marriage Act is a preemptive strike against \na gay marriage proposal that does not even exist. It is a little bit \nlike bombing a country because you think they are a threat when in \nreality they want nothing more than to live in peace. We would never do \nthat as a nation, and we should not do this. It hurts people for no \nreason.\n  I thank those of my colleagues, in advance, who will vote against \nthis scapegoating measure. There will only be a few of us. It will be a \nbrave vote. I say that because I know what the polls show. But what is \nleadership about, anyway? It is about the really tough votes.\n  When I went into politics 20 years ago, I told my constituents then \nand I tell them now I would not always take the popular side of an \nissue if I felt it was meanspirited. For me to do that\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\nwould be an insult to them and an insult to me. It would diminish all \nof us.\n  To me, this vote is not about how I feel about gay marriage. I have \nalways supported the idea of communities deciding these issues without \nthe long arm of the Federal Government.\n  Many communities recognize domestic partnerships for those who choose \nto make a long-term commitment. Many communities in California do this, \nand, Mr. President, it seems to be working. I have not had one phone \ncall or one letter indicating Congress should override these community \ndecisions. Clearly, this is an issue that should be decided in our \ncommunities, not in the Senate.\n  So to me, this vote is not about how Senators feel about marriage, \nand it certainly is not about defending marriage. To me, it is about \nscapegoating. It is about dividing us. It is ugly politics. It is a \ndiversion from what we should be doing. For example, we could be using \nthis time to pass President Clinton's college tax breaks to ease the \nstress on our married couples today. Now that would be defending \nmarriage.\n  By my no vote on this legislation tomorrow, I am disassociating \nmyself from the politics of negativity and division, from the politics \nof scapegoating, and I will cast my vote in that spirit.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much for the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nickles pertaining to the introduction of S. 2060 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10065-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10066-S10067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to respond \nto some of the statements that were made earlier today by some of our \ncolleagues dealing with a variety of legislation, most important, the \nlegislation that is called ENDA, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, \nthat Senator Kennedy and some other people have alluded to.\n  I heard comments such as, ``If this bill becomes law, employers will \nnot be required to keep any information concerning sexual \norientation.'' I totally disagree with this analysis. Granted, there is \na section in ENDA that says no quotas, but also if you read the bill, \nand I encourage my colleagues to read the bill, if you look at section \n11(A)(1), it grants to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the \nsame powers with respect to sexual orientation it now has with respect \nto race, religion and sex.\n  Under current law, employers are required to make, keep, and preserve \nrecords on their employment practices and to make reports to EEOC. That \nis under the United States Code 42, section 2000 e-8c. I read that code \nlast Friday when we had the debate.\n  I am amused, or interested, when people say, ``Well, that's just not \nfactual. Employers, you won't have to do that.''\n  I am reading section 11(A) of the bill that says the EEOC has the \nsame authority as currently under the Civil Rights Acts to require such \nrecords. So the net result is employers are going to have to find out \nwhat people's sexual orientation is. They are going to have to ask \nquestions they never asked before that employers don't want to ask and \nemployees don't want to be asked. They are going to have to ask those \nkinds of questions.\n  Plus, people said, ``It is not really required. Disparate impact is \nnot allowed to be considered under this bill. We're not going to allow \ndisparate impact to be used.'' Well, how is an employer to defend \nhimself or herself? If they are sued under the legislation--and \nsponsors of this bill do not deny they have the right to sue for \npunitive and compensatory damages--how is an employer able to prove \nthey have not discriminated? They have to show they have employed \nhomosexuals and bisexuals. How do they show that? They have to ask \nquestions. That is their defense. It is the same defense employers have \nas far as race, as far as sex, as far as disability or age.\n  They have to be able to show that is not their practice, they have \nnot discriminated; therefore, they have employed people of whatever \nsexual orientation. So, for that defense, they are going to have to ask \npeople, they are going to have to ask questions: ``What is your sexual \norientation? Are you homosexual, are you bisexual, are you \nheterosexual,'' in order to defend themselves.\n  Maybe some people don't agree with that, but I don't see any other \nway. So the net result of this legislation will require employers to \nask questions about sexual orientation which are not desired by \nemployees or by employers.\n  Plus, Mr. President, I have heard people imply, ``Wait a minute, this \nis not a whole lot different than what several people in the Senate \nhave signed on to, a statement put out by the Human Rights Campaign \nFund which says: ``Sexual orientation is not a consideration in the \nhiring, promoting or terminating of employees in my office.'' And 66 \nMembers of the Senate have signed this statement.\n  I did not sign that statement, but I guess I could have, because it \nhas never been a consideration in my office. I never asked anybody, I \ndo not want to ask anybody what their sexual orientation is. I didn't \nsign it because I thought, well, what if a person who is leading a gay \nactivist cause--and there are individuals like that and some are in \nCongress, and other people--if somebody who had a known propensity to \nbe a very strong advocate of gay rights, I guess, if they came and \nasked for a job in my office, I don't think they would be compatible \nand, therefore, I wouldn't hire them. So I didn't sign that pledge. But \nI can see why Senators would. Basically, I could sign it. It has never, \never been any consideration in any of my employment decisions as a \nSenator or when I ran a manufacturing company in Oklahoma.\n\n  But some people could interpret this language as the same as ``don't \nask, don't tell.'' If you don't ask, they can't tell. It is not a \nconsideration, so no big deal. But that is not what is underlying \nSenator Kennedy's bill.\n  Under the bill that we have before us, ENDA would make it law of the \nland, ENDA would elevate sexual orientation to a protected class under \nthe Civil Rights Act. What it would do is say if the school board, for \nexample, did not want to hire a person who was openly homosexual or a \ngay activist and have that person be a teacher or a coach or physical \neducation instructor, if they felt like that was an inappropriate type \nperson to have as a role model, they are in trouble under this \nlegislation because that school could be sued. That school board might \nwant to take disciplinary action or might not want to employ a person \nwho had that orientation as a role model or mentor to a grade school \nclass.\n  So they might say, ``We don't want to make that decision,'' and, \nfrankly, they could be sued under this legislation.\n  Recently, there was a case in West Virginia where a principal was \nfound dressing in drag and actually soliciting sexual favors in West \nVirginia. It just happened a couple of days ago. Because the principal \nasked for money, it was in violation of the State's prostitution act \nand, therefore, illegal. But if he had not asked for money, you could \nhave a person who would be cross-dressing and soliciting sex--and that \nmight be their sexual orientation--and the school board could not take \ndisciplinary action because of their sexual orientation if it is kept \nprivate. My point being, you could have a lot of repercussions that go \nbeyond what individuals have thought about in this legislation.\n\n  This legislation is not ``don't ask, don't tell.'' I look at this \nstatement that many Senators signed. I think a lot of people thought, \n``Hey, don't ask, don't tell. That's my policy. I'll stick by it.'' \nThat is not what we will ask if this proposed bill became law. ENDA \nwould elevate sexual orientation to a much higher level, giving Federal \nprotection and sanction, almost a Federal acceptance to promiscuity.\n  You might say, how would that be? The legislation says you cannot \ndiscriminate on account of someone's sexual orientation as defined by \n``homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual.'' It does not say by individual \nconduct that is done in monogamous relationships in private. So you \nmight have a homosexual or heterosexual that is very promiscuous, with \nlots and lots of partners, and a company or an individual\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\nor an organization, maybe with somewhat of a religious orientation or \nmoral commitment, finds that behavior very repulsive. If such \nindividual or organization did not want to hire such a person or \ncontinue their employment, they would find themselves subject to suit. \nIf ENDA passes, the Federal Government will say: Wait a minute. You \ncan't make any distinctions no matter what your religious beliefs are. \nYou can't make any distinction on account of a person's sexual \norientation.\n  ``Bisexual'' by definition means promiscuous, having relations with \nboth male and female. We are going to give that a Federal preferred \nprotected status under this legislation. I think that is a serious \nmistake. What about that school board in West Virginia? What about a \nschool board in Montana? What about a school board making decisions \nlike this in Alabama where maybe this small community says we do not \nthink we should have avowed open homosexual leaders, gay activists, as \nteachers in the fifth grade?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If they want to have that policy--right now they are \nable to choose to have such a policy. If this legislation became law, \nthey could be sued. I think it is important to point that out. Do we \nwant to give that kind of special status to behavior that many \nAmericans find objectionable? Some people have said, ``Well, it's \nimmutable.'' I would debate that or question that. But many, many \npeople feel, because of Biblical orientation, that it is immoral. Do we \nwant to give that special protection and status to ``sexual \norientation'' under the Civil Rights Act?\n  I met with a couple of black ministers who were very offended by the \nassessment of some that, well, this is just another special class that \nneeds special status, such as race and gender. They are offended \nbecause they participated in civil rights demonstrations and they \nworked to bring about civil rights for minorities. They are very, very \noffended by this. So, Mr. President, I just make that comment. Plus, I \nwant to make another comment in regard to the military.\n  The legislation exempts the military. I guess everybody applauds \nthat. This Congress, 3 years ago, voted basically to repeal President \nClinton's efforts to say that homosexuals should serve in the military. \nIt was one of President Clinton's first efforts in this Congress. In a \nbipartisan fashion, we said we do not agree, and we changed the \nPresident's policy. He did not like it, but we changed it. And we came \nup with a policy, ``don't ask, don't tell.'' Most of us basically were \ncomfortable with that result and still are. That is the law of the land \ntoday.\n  It was not what President Clinton wanted. President Clinton wanted to \nhave gays serve in the military, but a lot of us thought, no, that is a \nmistake. Evidently, the promoters of the legislation agree this is a \nmistake because they do not try to change this policy in ENDA. They \nsaid, OK, we are going to have an exemption for the military. The \nmilitary is a large Federal employer. We are going to exempt the \nmilitary from this language.\n  Wait a minute. We have millions of private companies and employers in \nthis country that we are going to say, wait a minute, for this big \nFederal employer, the Federal Government, we are going to exempt them \nfrom this policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation. But \nfor all other employers, no matter what your religious conscience tells \nyou, no matter what your religious beliefs are, whether it is Christian \nor Jewish or Moslem--all of those basic religions have very strong \ntenets and statements that homosexuality is wrong and it is immoral--no \nmatter what your religious belief is, no matter where you are coming \nfrom, too bad, that is an irrelevant decision concerning your \nemployment practices.\n\n  When we are exempting the military and saying, oh, it does make a \ndifference in the military--and we passed that; that is now the law of \nthe land--but now we are going to say for all other employers, no \nmatter what your convictions are throughout the country, you are not \nexempt. I think that is a serious mistake, a serious mistake.\n  Granted, nine States have some type of nondiscrimination based on \nsexual orientation laws, nine States. That means there are 41 States \nthat do not. I guess a few of those States have done something by \nexecutive order. Senator Kennedy is right, those executive orders can \nbe changed, rescinded, or amended. But why in the world would we think \nwe have to come in and have 41 States be overridden by the Federal \nGovernment? I think that would be a serious mistake.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just urge our colleagues to think about if \nschool boards in some places, maybe, again, Alabama or West Virginia, \nreally find promiscuous conduct unacceptable, and such persons engaging \nin such conduct not the right type of role models they would like to \nhave for their young people they would be subject to suit under ENDA. \nLet us not leave them subjected to unbelievable lawsuits. Let us not \nhave the Federal Government tell them that, no, they are not right. Let \nus not tell organizations such as the Boy Scouts or others that might \nhave a policy that would be contrary to this legislation, let us not \ntell them they have to change it because we have decided we know \nbetter. I think that would be a serious mistake.\n  The reason why I mention this tonight is we will have 3 hours of \ndebate on the defense of marriage bill tomorrow. But we only have 30 \nminutes on the legislation dealing with sexual orientation, elevating \nsexual orientation to special status under the Civil Rights Act. I know \nmy colleague from Massachusetts spoke on this earlier today. I felt \nlike it was important to speak on it because tomorrow we only have 30 \nminutes, 15 minutes equally divided, for the biggest expansion to the \nCivil Rights Act since its inception, and in my opinion a serious, \nserious mistake. So I hope all of our colleagues will look at it very, \nvery closely before they vote, and I hope that they will vote no \ntomorrow afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina, [Mr. Helms], \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, I commend the distinguished assistant majority leader, \nMr. Nickles. He has made some excellent points that have floated like a \nship passing in the night by a lot of Senators. I hope Senators who did \nnot hear him by way of television in their offices will have the \nSenator's remarks called to their attention by their assistants \ntomorrow morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10066-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10067-S10068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during my years in the Senate I have been \nprivileged on many occasions to work with a substantial number of \nministers whose Washington churches today are referred to as ``African-\nAmerican.''\n  These fine ministers have almost unanimously supported efforts by \nmyself and Joe Gibbs and others to restore school prayer to the \nNation's classrooms. They are, in the main, opposed to abortion. In \nfact, I do not recall even one of these ministers ever describing \nhimself or herself as ``pro-choice.'' But that perhaps is neither here \nnor there in terms of what I am here this evening to speak about.\n  The day before the Senate adjourned for the August recess, I ran into \none of these fine ministers over in the Russell Building. His church is \nBaptist. He has a booming, cheerful voice. And when I heard that voice, \nI knew who it was. He was saying, ``Are you going home tomorrow?'' And \nI told him I thought I was since the Senate probably would recess for \nthe month of August.\n  I asked him, Mr. President, if he had a message for the folks back \nhome. And he said, ``I sure do. Tell them that God created Adam and \nEve--not Adam and Steve.''\n  Some may chuckle at this good-natured minister's humor. But he meant \nexactly what he was saying. In fact, it was a sort of sermonette. The \ntruth is, he was hitting the nail on the head, if you want to use that \ncliche, or telling it like it is. However one may choose to describe \nthis minister's getting down to the nitty-gritty, it was no mere \ncliche, Mr. President. There could not have been, as a matter of fact, \na better way to begin this debate in favor of the Defense of Marriage \nAct, which is H.R. 3396. The formal debate will begin tomorrow morning \nin this Chamber, the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\n  Now then, let there be no mistake about it, this bill in no way, to \nany degree, is the kind of legislation which homosexual and lesbian \nleaders have disdainfully described as a, to use their words, ``hate-\ndriven bill.''\n  In fact, it is precisely the critics of H.R. 3396 who are demanding \nthat homosexuality be considered as just another lifestyle--these are \nthe people who seek to force their agenda upon the vast majority of \nAmericans who reject the homosexual lifestyle.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the pending bill--the Defense of Marriage \nAct--will safeguard the sacred institutions of marriage and the family \nfrom those who seek to destroy them and who are willing to tear apart \nAmerica's moral fabric in the process.\n  Isn't it disheartening, Mr. President, that Congress must clarify the \ntraditional definition of marriage? But inch by inch, little by little, \nthe homosexual lobby has chipped away at the moral stamina of some of \nAmerica's courts and some legislators, in order to create the shaky \nground that exists today that prompts this legislation being the \nsubject of debate tomorrow morning in the U.S. Senate.\n  Just think, the prospect of a sovereign State's being compelled to \nrecognize same-sex marriages sanctioned in another State is incredibly \nstark. If Hawaii's supreme court legalizes same-sex marriages in \nHawaii, does the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution \ncompel the other 49 States to recognize the new marriage law within \ntheir jurisdictions? I say no.\n  Such a suggestion, Mr. President, is a cockeyed interpretation of the \nConstitution; and this is one of so many times that I have wished the \nlate, great Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr., were here to cut it down to \nsize. Homosexuals and lesbians boast that they are close to realizing \ntheir goal--legitimizing their behavior.\n  Mr. President, Bill Bennett has championed the cause of preserving \nAmerica's culture; he contends that we are already reaping the \nconsequences of the devaluation of marriage. And he warns that ``it is \nexceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested, and inherently \nflawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone and the \narch of civilization.''\n  Bill Bennett is everlastingly right, and I believe the American \npeople in the majority understand that the Defense of Marriage Act is \nvitally important. It will establish a simple, clear Federal definition \nof marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman, and it will \nexempt sovereign States from being compelled by a half-baked \ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution to recognize same-sex marriages \nwrongfully legalized in another State.\n  If the Senate, tomorrow, makes the mistake of approving the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act proposed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, it will pave the way for liberal judges to threaten the \nbusiness policies of countless American employers, and, in the long \nrun, put in question the legality of the Defense of Marriage Act. The \nhomosexual lobby knows this and that is why there is such a clamor \nfavoring adoption of the Kennedy bill.\n  Mr. President, at the heart of this debate is the moral and spiritual \nsurvival of this Nation. Alexis de Tocqueville said a century and a \nhalf ago that America had grown great because America was good. Mr. de \nTocqueville also warned that if America made the mistake of ceasing to \nbe good, America would cease to be great.\n  So, we must confront the question posed long ago: ``Quo Vadis, \nAmerica?''\n  The Senate is about to answer that question. We will decide whither \ngoeth America. It is solely up to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10067-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10068-S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I addressed the Senate earlier today, but \nI just take a very few moments to respond to some of the points that \nhave been made earlier by those who are opposed to the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act.\n  First of all, on the question of disparate impact and disparate \ntreatment of individuals, I want to make it clear again this evening, \nas we tried to make it clear earlier in the day--this is an issue that \nkeeps coming up and I think it is important that we address--the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act covers a showing of discrimination \nbased on disparate treatment, not disparate impact. That means the \nperson must do the following, first, prove that he or she is covered by \nENDA.\n  Second, a person must show that he or she was qualified for the \nemployment opportunity at issue and that the employer's adverse \ntreatment was based on the person's sexual orientation.\n  Third, the employer must then present evidence to show that the \nadverse treatment was taken because of some legitimate \nnondiscriminatory reason, not sexual orientation, and then the \nindividual making the claim bears the ultimate burden of proving that \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation actually occurred.\n  Now, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is not violated merely \nbecause an employment practice has a disparate impact on gay men and \nlesbian women. Therefore, statistics are not needed to enforce the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act and employers are not required to ask \nwhether an employee is gay. Despite this provision in the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act, my colleagues are concerned that the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission will require employers to keep \nstatistics regarding the sexual orientation of their employees.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act grants the EEOC the same \nenforcement powers that it has under title VII. This enforcement \nstructure parallels the ADA--under which employers do not have to ask \nif an employee has a disability or keep statistics--and the EEOC says \nthat it will undoubtedly enforce ENDA in the same way that it enforces \nthe ADA. Therefore, there will not be any additional reporting \nrequirements.\n  Finally, the EEOC says that because ENDA does not recognize a cause \nof action for disparate impact discrimination, there are no \nrequirements pursuant to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection. \nThat has been an issue that has been brought up several times and \nraised again this evening. I hope I have responded to any of the \nconcerns that people have on this issue, and I have included \ninformation from the EEOC in the record earlier today.\n  Second, Mr. President, this legislation is not a license for bizarre \nbehavior--we heard that referenced earlier this evening. Like other \ncivil rights laws, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act does not \nprotect bizarre behavior. Employers can still enforce workplace rules \nas long as they apply them uniformly to heterosexuals and homosexuals. \nThis legislation allows employers to discipline homosexuals and \nheterosexuals whose behavior is illegal or unsafe or that compromises \ntheir ability to perform their job--the examples given earlier this \nevening would clearly fall under those standards. These policies must \nsimply be applied to all employees--heterosexual and homosexual.\n  For example, my colleagues expressed concern about dress conveying \nexplicit sexual messages or that is otherwise inappropriate. There is \nno need for concern. An employer can enforce a dress code. It must \nsimply apply to all employees. An employer may also enforce a code of \nconduct. School systems can discipline teachers who appear in \npornographic movies or other kinds of activities, but they must \ndiscipline both homosexuals and heterosexuals similarly.\n  That is all we are looking for, similar treatment. Employers can \nestablish codes of conduct. All they have to do is make sure that they \napply to both groups.\n  I say to my colleagues who feel they do not understand this \nlegislation, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is not a license to \nillegal behavior. It is legislation that allows homosexuals and \nheterosexuals to work without being the subject of discrimination. Once \nagain, the legislation simply says that employees, whether heterosexual \nor homosexual, must be treated fairly and equally.\n  Finally, there is some question about where all of this would lead. I \nthink we can look to the nine States that have laws at the present \ntime. They can be the best answers to many of the questions posed by \nthose opposed to the bill. We know, that these laws are not, and they \nhave not been problematic. I\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\nhave pointed out that in the 9 States, if you added all the cases \ntogether, over the period of the last 5 years, you would be lucky if \nthere are 15 cases, in the last 4 to 5 years.\n  In fact, when the people of California faced a referendum in 1978 to \nexclude gay people from teaching or mentoring, that referendum was \ndefeated with the help of Ronald Reagan, who did television spots in \nopposition. He understands, and I think most understand, that we should \nnot be stereotyping individuals. But stereotypes have been used against \ngay men and lesbians in the past and in this debate, as well.\n  This is what former President Reagan said in 1978:\n\n       As to the role model argument, a woman writing to the \n     editor of a Southern California newspaper said it all: ``If \n     teachers had such power over children, I would have been a \n     nun years ago.'' Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a \n     contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific \n     opinion is that a child's teachers do not really influence \n     this.\n\n  Although I have not always agreed with former President Reagan, in \nthis case, I think he is right on target, just as Senator Barry \nGoldwater.\n  This legislation deals with the unfair stereotypes. Homosexuals are \nnot strangers, or pedophiles, or child molesters. They are people we \nknow, respect, and care about. They are people of integrity. They have \na sense of right and wrong, an understanding of justice and fair play, \nand a willingness to work hard. They are American citizens, and they \ndon't deserve to be subjected to discrimination on the job.\n  We have fought against similar stereotypes regarding women, \nminorities, the disabled, the elderly, and religious believers.\n  In the past, we thought women were too weak to compete in the board \nroom or on the playing field. Today, we celebrate their business acumen \nand gold medal-winning athletic achievements. In the past, people in \nthis Chamber have questioned the intelligence and tenacity of \nminorities. We still fight some of those battles, but we are not where \nwe used to be. In the past, the Nation questioned whether a Catholic \nshould be President. I remember when our country pushed bigotry aside \nand put such a man in the White House.\n  We have become a better country because we rose above the \ndiscrimination that divides us and nurtures bigotry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased that the Senate, tomorrow, will be voting on \nthe Employment Nondiscrimination Act. Every worker in this country \nshould be judged solely on the basis of valid work-related criteria: \nThe worker's job performance and his or her ability to perform the job. \nPeople who work hard and perform well should not be kept from leading \nproductive and responsible lives because of sexual orientation any more \nthan they should be kept from employment or discriminated against \nbecause of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability.\n  Unfortunately, workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation remains a real problem in many communities. In case after \ndocumented case, highly qualified individuals have been dismissed, or \notherwise discriminated against in their jobs for no other reason than \ntheir sexual orientation.\n\n  Such discrimination is intolerable in America. We are better than \nthat. A recent poll in Newsweek indicates that this measure is \nsupported by over 80 percent of the American people. It has been \nendorsed by a wide array of religious organizations, including the \nUnited Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Episcopal \nChurch, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the American Jewish \nCongress, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., \nthe Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and the United Church of \nChrist, to mention some.\n  As the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Edmund L. Browning, \nwrote in a letter, dated July 30, 1996:\n\n       Since 1967, the Episcopal church has been committed \n     publicly to the notion of guaranteeing equal protection for \n     all citizens, including the homosexual persons, under the \n     law. In that year, the General Convention of the Episcopal \n     Church, the Church's highest policymaking body, expressed its \n     conviction that homosexual persons are entitled to equal \n     protection of the laws with all other citizens and called \n     upon society to ensure that such protection is provided in \n     actuality. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act explicitly \n     fulfills that mandate. . .\n       My warm embrace of this legislation, of course, reflects \n     more than my standing as Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal \n     Church. It represents my deep, personal belief in the \n     intrinsic dignity of all God's children. That dignity demands \n     that all citizens have a full and equal claim upon the \n     promise of the American ideal, which includes equal civil \n     rights protection against unfair employment discrimination. \n     For far too long, our civil rights laws look the other way \n     with respect to discrimination based on race, gender, \n     religion, national origin, age, or disability. Fighting to \n     right those wrongs taught us that the cause of civil rights \n     protection for one is the cause of such protection for all. \n     Today, so long as some of us remain subject to employment \n     discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, our system \n     of civil rights protection for all Americans remains an \n     unfulfilled ideal. The long overdue protection embodied in \n     this legislation brings that ideal one significant step \n     closer to reality.\n\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation have argued that the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act will cause practical problems in the \nworkplace. But we know that this is not true, because similar \nlegislation is already in place, as the Senator from Massachusetts \npointed out, in nine States. As Michael P. Morely, the president of \nEastman Kodak Co., testified on July 17 of this year:\n\n       It is our belief that ENDA is good for American business, \n     large or small. The bill is in step with trends in the \n     Nation's most successful businesses, and is in tune with the \n     fundamental sense of fairness valued by Americans. If we at \n     Kodak felt that this bill were intrusive, expensive, or \n     otherwise inappropriate for American business, we would not \n     support it. But after a thorough analysis of its provisions, \n     we are convinced that the Employment Nondiscrimination Act \n     will have a positive impact on our country's ability to \n     compete.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation is carefully drafted to prohibit any \npreferential treatment, including quotas, and to prohibit disparate \nimpact suits based on sexual orientation, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts has pointed out. It exempts small businesses with fewer \nthan 15 employees, and it exempts religious organizations, including \neducational institutions substantially controlled or supported by \nreligious organizations.\n  Mr. President, for too long, many Americans have suffered employment \ndiscrimination. In recent decades, we have done much to eliminate this \nblot on our history. It is time for us to enact this legislation and \nextend the principle of fairness embodied in the Nation's civil rights \nlaws to all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10068-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10069-S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under a previous unanimous-consent agreement \nentered on June 28, 1996, the Senate is scheduled to consider the \nChemical Weapons Convention by the end of this week. There has been \nmuch written and much said about the convention, whether it is the \nright thing to do or not; is it verifiable?\n  On the other side, there are those who say it would affect the \noverall atmosphere with regard to these chemical weapons. There is very \nlegitimate debate about whether or not this convention should be \nratified or not. It is my intention to go forward with the \nconsideration of this Chemical Weapons Convention beginning probably on \nThursday. We are scheduled to have votes on Friday.\n  But as we near consideration of that convention, I wanted to share \nwith my colleagues some of the correspondence that I have recently \nreceived. Late on Friday of last week, I received a letter of \nopposition to the convention signed by more than 50 defense and foreign \npolicy experts, including two former Secretaries of Defense, former \nmembers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many others. The letter made \nfour fundamental points: The Chemical Weapons Convention is not global, \nit is not effective, and is not verifiable, but it will have \nsignificant costs to American security.\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\n  Their letter concludes by stating that ``The national security \nbenefits of the Chemical Weapons Convention clearly do not outweigh its \nconsiderable costs. Consequently, we respectfully urge you to reject \nratification of the CWC unless and until it is made genuinely global, \neffective, and verifiable.''\n  This is not my judgment. It is the judgment, however, of Caspar \nWeinberger, William Clark, Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ed Meese, Dick \nCheney, and many others who served with distinction under Presidents \nReagan and Bush. I think their views deserve serious consideration from \nevery Member.\n  As you will note, two of those names that I read are former \nSecretaries of Defense and certainly highly respected. Our colleague \nfrom the House of Representatives, Dick Cheney, is one that I really \nhad not known exactly what his position was, so it was of great \ninterest to me to see what his thoughts might be.\n  I have two other letters that I encourage Members to review. First, \nthe National Federation of Independent Business wrote to me today \nexpressing serious concern about the impact of the CWC on the more than \n600,000 members of the NFIB. The letter notes that under the CWC, for \nthe first time small businesses would be subject to a foreign entity \ninspecting their businesses. The concerns that are expressed concerning \nincreased regulatory burden of the Chemical Weapons Convention on \nAmerican small business I think should be weighed very carefully before \ncoming to a decision about his or her attitude and what the position \nwould be of that Senator on the convention. I know my colleagues do not \nwant to vote first and ask questions later when it comes to small \nbusiness, which already bears a disproportionate share of the \nregulatory burden from the Federal Government.\n  I also received a letter today from retired Gen. James A. Williams, \nformer head of the Defense Intelligence Agency with almost four decades \nof experience in intelligence. General Williams raises very serious \nconcerns over the potential of CWC being used to gain proprietary \ninformation from American business.\n  He concludes that ``there is potential for the loss of untold \nbillions of dollars of trade secrets which can be used to gain \ncompetitive advantage, to shorten R cycles, and to steal U.S. market \nshare.''\n  Many businesses have contacted my office and the offices of other \nSenators expressing these and similar concerns about Senate action on \nthis convention.\n  Last week I wrote to the President expressing my concern that the \nClinton administration was less than fully forthcoming in responding to \nthe Senate's request for information and documents. I requested \nspecific documents previously requested by other Senators. Senator \nHelms, the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction, has been very \nactive in trying to have questions answered, to get information \nprovided, to get intelligence information available to Senators, and in \nmany instances that information was late in coming or has not been \nprovided at all. As a matter of fact, much of it has been described as \nbeing classified; therefore, it could not be provided.\n  In view of that, I am very seriously considering and probably will \nseek a closed session to consider this matter so that Senators can be \nmade aware of intelligence information that is classified, if that is \nnecessary. In order to avoid that, I have asked that some of this \ndocumentation be declassified by the administration so that all \nSenators can have access to it without our having to go into closed \nsession.\n  I wanted to call to the Senate's attention this correspondence that I \nhave outlined because it is very important that a range of views be \nmade available to all Senators. The administration has been making its \ncase for quite some time, but opponents of the convention have just \nbegun the serious examination the convention really deserves.\n  There were some Members who have been involved in this issue --I \nbelieve Senator Stevens arranged for a briefing this very afternoon \nthat was sponsored by the Arms Control Observer Group. We did have some \npeople testifying, stating they had opposition to the convention, \nothers that were supportive of it. We are trying to get a balance in \nwhat is presented to the Senators, both privately and publicly.\n  My own personal greatest concern is the question of verification. \nWhat do we do about Iraq? If we pass a convention like this, that would \nbe applicable to us, sort of the law-abiding citizens of the world, how \ndo we make sure what is happening in Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, the \nrenegade countries of the world? Is this going to be a situation where \nwe go forward with this convention, this Chemical Weapons Convention, \nyet those who are the real threat do not participate, or deny that they \nare involved, or we are not in a position where we can verify what they \nare actually doing?\n  So, I ask unanimous consent the three letters I received and the \nletter I wrote to the President last week be printed in the Record so \nall Senators will have access to these letters and to this information, \nmuch of which had not been made available prior to tonight.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader, On behalf of the more than 600,000 members \n     of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     want to express serious concern regarding the regulatory \n     requirements and burdens that would be placed on small \n     businesses who ``produce, process, consume, export or \n     import'' certain regulated chemicals with ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty (CWC) and its implementing \n     legislation.\n       This Congress has begun to address the serious problems of \n     paperwork burdens and red tape which are strangling small \n     businesses in this country. The passage of the Paperwork \n     Reduction Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act were positive first steps in reducing the \n     excessive regulatory burden which consistently ranks in the \n     top five problems small business face in NFIB surveys.\n       The CWC reverses the trend of reducing the growing \n     regulatory burden on small business. According to the \n     Congressional Office of Technology inspections of businesses \n     required under CWC will cost small business $10,000-$20,000. \n     The typical small business owner takes home only $40,000 per \n     year. The Department of Commerce has estimated that a \n     business will spend from 2.5-9 hours on paperwork for each \n     chemical used depending on its classification.\n       There is a great deal of disagreement on the number of \n     businesses which would be affected by the CWC. Numbers have \n     ranged from 3,000 to 10,000. The regulatory burden of the CWC \n     will hit small businesses harder than big business. A 1995 \n     Small Business Administration study stated that while small \n     business employs 53 percent of the workforce, they bear 67 \n     percent of business' total regulatory expense. Even if the \n     number of small businesses in the initial list of affected \n     companies is limited to a specific list, the fact that \n     additional businesses might be regulated by CWC without \n     approval by the U.S. Congress will leave small business \n     powerless to have any input as it does under the U.S. \n     regulatory system. For the first time, small businesses would \n     be subject to a foreign entity inspecting their business.\n       The CWC will continue to bury small businesses in paperwork \n     and regulations. Therefore, NFIB urges your serious \n     consideration of the affect of this Treaty on the small \n     businesses in this country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                September 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As you weigh the benefits and costs of \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) I would like to offer \n     some insight gained during my 28 years at every level of \n     Military Intelligence and my subsequent ten years in \n     competitive intelligence and counterintelligence for some of \n     the premier companies in this country. The need for \n     international mechanisms to control or eliminate the \n     potential use of chemical weapons cannot be denied but the \n     mechanisms must not be adopted in haste or under pressure. I \n     ask only that you delay consideration long enough for an \n     informed debate to take place, and I stress informed.\n       My foremost concern is that the CWC adds little to the \n     ability of this country, or any other for that matter, to be \n     assured that chemical weapons are not being manufactured by \n     specific nations. Experience in Iraq has amply demonstrated \n     the ease with which inspections can be thwarted and sanctions \n     evaded. With all of the effort put into the inspection \n     program the United States is still unable to say whether Iraq \n     retains a capability to manufacture chemical weapons. We are \n     unable to state publicly the chemical weapons production \n     capabilities of nations\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n     such as Libya, Iran, Syria, China or Korea. Many nations \n     possess a production capability or are thought to possess \n     such capabilities. Nations that are likely to produce \n     chemical weapons for use by terrorists or for limited \n     battlefield deployment can produce sufficient quantities in \n     laboratories small enough that they can be temporarily closed \n     or relocated to avoid inspections. The exiting treaty on \n     chemical weapons is already so weak on this point that no \n     effort has been made to enforce it and provisions of the CWC \n     are even weaker. Let's discuss objectively what information \n     is required to verify such a treaty, the capabilities \n     required to collect the information, the cost of doing so, \n     and the likelihood of making such collection.\n       Furthermore, the opportunity for unfettered access to \n     virtually every industrial facility in this country, not \n     merely the pharmaceutical and chemical plants, would make \n     most foreign intelligence organizations very happy, even \n     gleeful. It is likely to cause the counterintelligence \n     sections of the FBI and the Defense Investigative Service \n     major problems for the foreseeable future. The inspection \n     procedures which apply to ALL industries constitute \n     unprecedented access to our manufacturing base, not just \n     those thought likely to be engaged in proscribed activities! \n     My experience in protecting patents and intellectual property \n     over the past ten years leads me to conclude that there is \n     the potential for the loss of untold billions of dollars in \n     trade secrets which can be used to gain competitive \n     advantage, to shorten R cycles, and to steal US market \n     share. To allow the invasion of private property without \n     probable cause or a search warrant could undermine every \n     industrial security standard established under government \n     regulations or by private firms seeking to protect industrial \n     processes or other proprietary information. Under the \n     inspection and reporting practices specified in the CWC I see \n     no prohibition against the exchanging of lucrative \n     information among the nations conducting a given inspection. \n     This country, for valid reasons, does not permit its \n     intelligence agencies to conduct industrial espionage but we \n     may be the only nation in the world to hold to such a \n     standard.\n       The CWC constitutes a significant departure from the way \n     this country conducts business and the way our society has \n     elected to protect its very fabric. It seems to me that the \n     CWC has been put together as a placebo measure to make people \n     feel good but without considering the overall long term \n     impact on our industry, our society and our legal system. The \n     Congress bears the responsibility of assuring our citizenry \n     that the advantages and disadvantages have been carefully \n     considered and balanced.\n       We look to you to insure that those safeguards are built \n     into the process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James A. Williams,\n     LTG U.S. Army (Ret.)\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                September 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As you know, the Senate is currently \n     scheduled to take final action on the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention (CWC) on or before September 14th. This treaty has \n     been presented as a global, effective and verifiable ban on \n     chemical weapons. As individuals with considerable experience \n     in national security matters, we would all support such a \n     ban. We have, however, concluded that the present Convention \n     is seriously deficient on each of these scores, among others.\n       The CWC is not global since many dangerous nations (for \n     example, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Libya) have not agreed \n     to join the treaty regime. Russia is among those who have \n     signed the Convention but is unlikely to ratify--especially \n     without a commitment of billions in U.S. aid to pay for the \n     destruction of Russia's vast arsenal. Even then, given our \n     experience with the Kremlin's treaty violations and its \n     repeated refusal to implement the 1900 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement on chemical weapons, future CWC violations must be \n     expected.\n       The CWC is not effective because it does not ban or control \n     possession of all chemicals that could be used for lethal \n     weapons purposes. For example, it does not prohibit two \n     chemical agents that were employed with deadly effect in \n     World War I--phosgene and hydrogen cyanide. The reason speaks \n     volumes about this treaty's impractical nature: they are too \n     widely used for commercial purposes to be banned.\n       The CWC is not verifiable as the U.S. intelligence \n     community has repeatedly acknowledged in congressional \n     testimony. Authoritarian regimes can be confident that their \n     violations will be undetectable. Now, some argue that the \n     treaty's intrusive inspections regime will help us know more \n     than we would otherwise. The relevant test, however, is \n     whether any additional information thus gleaned will \n     translate into convincing evidence of cheating and result in \n     the collective imposition of sanctions or other enforcement \n     measures. In practice, this test is unlikely to be satisfied \n     since governments tend to look the other way at evidence of \n     non-compliance rather than jeopardize a treaty regime.\n       What the CWC will do, however, is quite troubling: It will \n     create a massive new, UN-style international inspection \n     bureaucracy (which will help the total cost of this treaty to \n     U.S. taxpayers amount to as much as $200 million per year). \n     It will jeopardize U.S. citizens' constitutional rights by \n     requiring the U.S. government to permit searches without \n     either warrants or probable cause. It will impose a costly \n     and complex regulatory burden on U.S. industry. As many as \n     8,000 companies across the country may be subjected to new \n     reporting requirements entailing uncompensated annual costs \n     of between thousands to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars per \n     year to comply. Most of these American companies have no idea \n     that they will be affected. And perhaps worst of all, the CWC \n     will determine the standard of verifiability that has been a \n     key national security principle for the United States.\n       Under these circumstances, the national security benefits \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention clearly do not outweigh \n     its considerable costs. Consequently, we respectfully urge \n     you to reject ratification of the CWC unless and until it is \n     made genuinely global, effective and verifiable.\n     William P.

Chairman \n     Helms also requested the provision and declassification of \n     documents and a cable relating to critical issues of Russian \n     compliance with existing chemical weapons arms control \n     agreements and with the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       On July 26, 1996, having received no response to his \n     earlier letter, Chairman Helms reiterated his earlier request \n     and asked additional questions concerning the apparent \n     Russian decision to unilaterally end implementation of the \n     1990 U.S.-Russian Bilateral Destruction Agreement on chemical \n     weapons. Chairman Helms also asked for specific information \n     and documents concerning Russian conditions for ratification \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as other \n     information important to our consideration of the Convention. \n     While Chairman Helms did receive responses to his letters on \n     July 31 and on August 13, his request for declassification of \n     documents was refused and the answers to many of his \n     questions were incomplete.\n       During a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on \n     June 17, 1996, Senator Kyl asked for a specific document--a \n     cable written in Bonn, Germany by Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency (ACDA) Director Holum concerning current \n     Russian government positions on the Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     and on U.S. assistance for the destruction of Russian \n     chemical weapons. On numerous occasions, Senator Kyl was told \n     the document did not exist. Finally, on July 26, Senator Kyl \n     was able to see a redacted version of the document under \n     tightly controlled circumstances but the document has not \n     been made available to Chairman Helms or other Senators.\n       Mr. President, the unanimous consent agreement of June 28, \n     1996, was entered into in good faith, and based on our \n     understanding that the administration could and would be \n     fully forthcoming in the provision of information and \n     documents to enable the Senate to fulfill its constitutional \n     responsibilities. Numerous judgements of the United States \n     intelligence community deserve as wide a circulation as \n     possible--particularly since they are distinctly different \n     than some public statements made by officials of your \n     Administration concerning the Convention.\n       Accordingly, I respectfully request that you reconsider \n     your refusal to declassify critical documents and consider \n     the declassification of important intelligence community \n     judgments--consistent with the need to protect intelligence \n     sources and methods. Specifically, I request that you act \n     immediately to declassify the May 21, 1996, cable written by \n     ACDA Director Holum and the July 8, 1996, letter from Russian \n     Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to Vice-President Gore, and \n     consider immediate declassification of the paragraphs from \n     which the attached statements are excerpted--all drawn from \n     documents produced by the Central Intelligence Agency and the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency on the Russian chemical weapons \n     program, the verifiability of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, the effect of the Convention on the chemical \n     weapons arsenals of rogue states, and the relevance of the \n     Convention to acts of terrorism committed with chemical \n     weapons.\n       I make these requests to enable the Senate to fully prepare \n     for its consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I \n     am certain you would agree it is necessary for the Senate to \n     have complete and usable information in order to fulfill our \n     constitutional obligations and to responsibly meet the terms \n     of the current unanimous consent agreement. Because the \n     unanimous consent agreement calls for the Senate to vote on \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention by September 14, 1996, I \n     respectfully request that you respond to my declassification \n     requests no later than the close of business on Tuesday, \n     September 10, 1996. With best wishes, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10069-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10072-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2428) to encourage \nthe donation of food and grocery products to nonprofit organizations \nfor distribution to needy individuals by giving the Model Good \nSamaritan Food Donation Act the full force and effect of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10072-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10072-S10073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3919.

A bill to require the District of Columbia to comply with \nthe 5-year time limit for welfare recipients, to prohibit any future \nwaiver of such limit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                          Welfare Legislation\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwould reverse President Clinton's recent District of Columbia welfare \nwaiver which exempts the District of Columbia from the 5-year time \nlimit for 10 years. It may shock our colleagues. President Clinton \nsigned the welfare reform bill with a great deal of fanfare and said, \n``We have ended welfare as we know it.'' What most people don't know is \non the day he signed it, he signed a 10-year waiver for the District of \nColumbia, so it does not apply. The waiver will apply for 10 years.\n  I am just amazed that he had the audacity to do that. I am somewhat \namazed that a lot of people in the press, and maybe we in Congress, \nhave not said much about it.\n  Think of that. The cornerstone of the welfare reform bill was a bill \nwith real time limits. I am quoting President Clinton. President \nClinton said, ``We need to have real welfare reform, we need to end \nwelfare as we know it, we need a bill with real teeth, a bill that has \nreal time limits.'' What does he do on the same day? He signs the \nwelfare bill. He gives a 10-year waiver, a 10-year exemption to the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  It is interesting to note, he was able to grant the waiver within 14 \ndays to the District of Columbia. He has had over 103 days to grant the \nwaiver that was requested by the State of Wisconsin, which he mentioned \nin a political address on one of his Saturday morning addresses. He \nsaid, ``We need welfare reform like the State of Wisconsin. They have \nreal workfare. They have time limits. We need to do it.''\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\n  It is interesting to note he has not granted that waiver yet. Maybe \nhe made a speech and got some points for it, but the fact is, by his \ngranting the DC waiver, maybe he is trying to placate some liberal \npeople who did not like him signing the welfare reform bill. I do not \nknow. But today, I am introducing legislation to reverse the 10-year \nexemption, or welfare waiver, that he granted to the District of \nColumbia.\n  It basically says that any other waiver that would come forward must \ncomply with the 5-year time limit on cash benefits that passed by an \noverwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I send that to the desk, and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record. It is my hope and \nit is my plan to pass this legislation before we go out of session this \nyear.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask that written testimony from \nRabbi David Saperstein, director and counsel for the Religious Action \nCenter of Reform Judaism, and a letter from Herman Hill Kay concerning \nS. 1740, the Defense of Marriage Act, be printed in the Record. Both \nRabbi Saperstein and Mr. Kay submitted these materials to be included \nin the transcript of the hearing held before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on July 11, 1996. Unfortunately, their statements were \nreceived too late to be included, and for that reason, I ask that they \nbe printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                  Testimony of Rabbi David Saperstein\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for this \n     opportunity to comment on the ``Defense of Marriage Act'' (S. \n     1740). My name is Rabbi David Saperstein, and I am Director \n     and Counsel of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism \n     (RAC). The RAC represents the Union of American Hebrew \n     Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis, \n     the lay and clerical bodies of Reform Judaism, with \n     membership of over 1.5 million Reform Jews and 1700 Reform \n     rabbis in 850 congregations nationwide. In recent years, both \n     the parent bodies of the RAC have passed formal resolutions \n     supporting gay civil marriage, and I have included copies of \n     those statements as appendices to my testimony this morning.\n       I am also an attorney who teaches advanced Constitutional \n     Law, especially on the First Amendment's religion clauses at \n     the Georgetown University Law Center. Over the years, I have \n     written a number of books and articles addressing church-\n     state and constitutional legal issues.\n       This bill is woefully ill-advised and is morally wrong. Let \n     me first address the legal concerns, lay out why this bill \n     would likely fail to pass even the most forgiving \n     constitutional test and why, under the current legal system, \n     it is, unnecessary. I will then turn to some of the broader \n     political and moral issues the bill raises.\n\n\n         ii. legal observations on the defense of marriage act\n\n       There are two key legal issues at stake in this \n     legislation. The first is that the legislation is almost \n     certain to be found unconstitutional both for its violation \n     of the Full Faith and Credit clause and for its denigration \n     of states rights as protected in the Tenth Amendment. The \n     second issue is that it is, in all likelihood,--and from the \n     perspective of my organizations, sadly--legally unnecessary \n     since many of its key aims would be accomplished under the \n     ``public policy exception'' to the conflict of laws rules, \n     i.e. states would be able to avoid being forced to recognize \n     same sex marriages if they determine such marriages to be in \n     violation of fundamental public policy interests.\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\n     A. Why Federal Government Intrusion in this Area is \n         Unconstitutional\n       The key issue in this regard is whether Congress has the \n     power to abridge in any fashion the full faith and credit \n     accorded sister states' judgments. While it will be offered \n     by the proponents of the legislation that the measure does \n     not restrict states' ability to offer full faith and credit, \n     the plain face of the Constitution does not speak of a \n     state's right to recognize sister states' judgments, rather, \n     it is a mandate.\n       As a doctrinal matter, while the proponents purport to be \n     protecting states' rights and interests, they are, in fact, \n     diluting those rights and interests. The clear expression in \n     this legislation that the Congress has a role in determining \n     when a state may not offer full faith and credit creates a \n     standard of Federal control antithetical to the Tenth \n     Amendment (and, ironically, to conservative political \n     philosophy): that powers not enumerated for the Federal \n     Government are reserved to the States. This legislation \n     enumerates a Federal power, namely the power to deny sister \n     states recognition, grants that power to the state, and \n     therefore dangerously pronounces, expressio unius est \n     exclusio alterius, that the Federal government in fact \n     retains the power to limit full faith and credit and, for \n     that matter, to regulate marital law more broadly. And it \n     only need express that power substantive issue by substantive \n     issue. This is an arrogation of power to the federal \n     government which one would have assumed heretical to the \n     expressed philosophy of conservative legislating. Under the \n     guise of protecting states' interests, the proposed statutes \n     would infringe upon state sovereignty and effectively \n     transfer broad power to the federal government.\n       Further, without exception, domestic relations has been a \n     matter of state, not federal, concern and control since the \n     founding of the Republic. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 112 SCT \n     2206 (1992) (no subject matter jurisdiction in federal courts \n     for domestic relations cases). There is simply ``no federal \n     law of domestic relations.'' De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. \n     570, 580 (1956). ``[T]he whole subject of the domestic \n     relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to \n     the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the U.S.'' In \n     re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-4(1890). As a result, Congress \n     has never before passed legislation dealing purely with \n     domestic relations issues, especially marriage.\n       As to the second prong of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, \n     only rarely has Congress exercised the implementing authority \n     that the Clause grants to it, and never in ways that limited \n     application of the clause. The first, passed in 1790, 28 \n     U.S.C.A. Sec. 1738, provides for ways to authenticate acts, \n     records and judicial proceedings, and repeats the \n     constitutional injunction that such acts, records and \n     judicial proceedings of the states are entitled to full faith \n     and credit in other states, as well as by the federal \n     government. The second, dating from 1804, provides methods of \n     authenticating non-judicial records. 28 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1739.\n       Since 1804 these provisions have been amended only twice: \n     the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C.A. \n     Sec. 1739A, which provides that custody determinations of a \n     state shall be enforced in different states, and 28 U.S.C.A. \n     Sec. 1738B, ``Full Faith and Credit for Child Support \n     Orders'' (1994). Neither of these statutes purported to limit \n     full faith and credit; to the contrary, each of these \n     statutes reinforced or expanded the faith and credit given to \n     states.\n       While the Supreme Court has not yet passed explicitly on \n     the manner in which marriages per se are entitled to full \n     faith and credit, it would appear from the face of the clause \n     they should be afforded full faith and credit as either \n     ``Acts'' or ``Records.'' In the absence of an express \n     constitutional protection under full faith and credit, the \n     general rule for determining the validity of a marriage \n     legally created and recognized in another jurisdiction is to \n     apply the law of the state in which the Marriage was \n     performed. Albert A. Ehrenzweig, A Treatise on the Conflict \n     of Laws, Sec. 138 (1961).\n       Both Restatements support this general rule. Commentators \n     to the Restatement urge that a choice of law rule that \n     validates out-of-state marriages provides stability and \n     predictability in questions of marriage, ensures the \n     legitimization of children, protects party expectations, and \n     promotes interstate comity. See, e.g., Hovermill. 53 \n     Md.L.Rev. 450, 453 (1994).\n     B. Why the Public Policy Exception Makes this Legislation \n         Unnecessary\n       There is, however, a recognized exception to this choice of \n     law rule: a court will refuse to recognize a valid foreign \n     marriage if the recognition of that marriage would violate a \n     strongly held public policy of the forum state. Restatement \n     (Second) Conflict of Laws Sec. 283 (1971).\n       While we believe strongly that states should not invoke \n     this power in this situation, that such a stance would be \n     morally wrong and we will, accordingly, vigorously oppose all \n     such efforts, until the Court makes a Constitutional ruling \n     upholding same sex marriages within the rubric of a \n     fundamental right (in which case the proposed legislation \n     would clearly be useless), states will have a stronger \n     argument under the public policy exception than they will \n     under this legislation.\n       Those states which desire to avoid the general rule \n     favoring lex celebri will rely on an enumerated public policy \n     exception to the rule through state statute, common law, or \n     practice, and will make a showing that honoring a sister \n     state's celebration of marriage ``would be the approval of a \n     transaction which is inherently vicious, wicked, or immoral, \n     and shocking to the prevailing moral sense.'' \n     Intercontinental Hotels Corp. v. Golden, 203 N.E. 2d 210, 212 \n     (N.Y. 1964). The rhetoric notwithstanding, the public policy \n     exception will provide a means for states to withhold full \n     faith and credit, (subject to the limitations of other \n     constitutional provisions, i.e. equal protection, substantive \n     due process, etc.) States will express their public policy \n     exception to recognize same-sex marriages in other states by \n     offering such legislation as gender specific marriage laws, \n     and anti-sodomy statutes.\n       Different courts have required different levels of clarity \n     in their own state's expression of public policy before that \n     exception could be sustained in that stat's court. Some have \n     required explicit statutory expressions, Etheridge v. \n     Shaddock, 706 S.W.2d 396 (AR 1986), while others much less \n     clearly so, Condado Aruba Caribbean Hotel v. Tickel, 561 P.2d \n     23, 24 (CO Ct App 1977).\n       Courts have considered a marriage offensive to a state's \n     public policy either because it is contrary to natural law or \n     because it violates a positive law enacted by the state \n     legislature. Courts have invalidated foreign marriages that \n     are incestuous, polygamous, and interracial, or marriages \n     with a minor on the ground that they violate natural law, \n     e.g., Earle v. Earle, 126 N.Y.S. 317, 319 (1910). For \n     invalidation based on positive law, some courts have required \n     clear statutory expressions that the marriages prohibited are \n     void regardless of where they are performed, State v. Graves, \n     307 S.W. 2d 545 (AR 1957), and sometimes a clear intent to \n     preempt the general rule of validation. E.g., Estate of \n     Loughmiller, 629 P.2d 156 (KS 1981). Other courts create not \n     so high a hurdle, such that a statutory enactment against the \n     substantive issue was sufficient. Catalano v. Catalano, 170 \n     A.2d 726 (Ct 1961) (finding express prohibition in a marriage \n     statute and the criminalization of incestuous marriages \n     sufficient to invalidate an out-of-state marriage). Those \n     states that are enacting anti-same sex marriage statutes will \n     likely find they have satisfied the first exception to the \n     choice of law rule validating a marriage where celebrated, \n     lex celebri.\n       Interracial marriages were, before Loving v. Virginia, \n     treated with the above choice of law analysis, and courts \n     frequently determined the validity of interracial marriages \n     based on an analysis of the public policy exception. ``Early \n     decisions treated such marriages as contrary to natural law, \n     but later courts considered the question one of positive law \n     interpretation.'' 53 Md LRev at 464.\n       How do these rules, then, apply to the question at hand? \n     First, it would seem that states do have the ability to check \n     the impact of the conflict of laws recognition as described \n     above. However, it should be noted that where there have been \n     such limitations those that have held up over time are those \n     that have been aimed at protecting parties involved in \n     marriage (i.e. spouses and potential children) such as \n     prohibitions against incestuous relations, marriages \n     involving a minor, polygamy. The ban on interracial \n     marriages--the argument most analogous to this situation--was \n     aimed at protecting the society's perception of public mores \n     and public morals at a given moment. That shifted from a \n     natural law argument to a positive law argument to its \n     rejection based on Constitutional doctrine. I suggest that \n     this is the very direction laws related to same sex \n     marriages are moving--a direction we wholeheartedly \n     approve of, but, under current law, the public exception \n     doctrine would probably prevail in most states.\n       It should be noted, however, that in 17 states, the status \n     of the public policy exception is called into question by the \n     Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, which provides that ``[a]ll \n     marriages contracted within this State prior to the effective \n     date of the act, or outside this State, that were valid at \n     the time of the contract or subsequently validated by the \n     laws of the place in which they were contracted or by the \n     domicile of the parties, are valid in this State.'' 9A U.L.A. \n     Sec. 210 (1979). The Act specifically drops the public policy \n     exceptions; ``the section expressly fails to incorporate the \n     `strong public policy' exception to the Restatement and thus \n     may change the law in some jurisdictions. This section will \n     preclude invalidation of many marriages which would have been \n     invalidated in the past.'' Id., official comment. Of course, \n     any state that wants to reassert a public policy exception \n     for same sex marriages retains the right to so legislate, or \n     not. The proposed federal bill has no effect on that.\n     C. Constitutional Restraints\n       There are several possible Constitutional limits on a \n     state's ability to invoke a public policy exception to the \n     general rule of validating foreign marriages under the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process Clause, Equal \n     Protection or Substantive Due Process.\n       As to due process, the second state must, before it can \n     apply its own law, satisfy that it has ``significant contact \n     or a significant aggregation of contacts'' with the parties \n     and the occurrence or transaction to which it is applying its \n     own law. Allstate Ins Co v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302 (1981). The \n     contacts necessary to survive a due process challenge have \n     been characterized as ``incidental,'' 53 Md L Rev at 467, and \n     the fact that the same sex couple is probably a domiciliary \n     of the\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\n     second state would be enough to satisfy the Hague test.\n       Substantive due process and equal protection can bar a \n     state's application of the public policy exception as well. \n     For the former, a court would have to find that there is a \n     fundamental right for gay couples to marry. There is complete \n     agreement that there is a fundamental right to marry, \n     Zablocki, v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978), and the argument \n     will be pursued that this incorporates marriage of gay men \n     and lesbians to each other.\n       Turning to an Equal Protection analysis, a state's anti-\n     same sex marriage statute could be subjected to one of three \n     levels of scrutiny. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \n     Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). If it is viewed as almost all \n     statutory enactments, it will receive rational basis review, \n     and will, in almost all circumstances, survive challenge. If \n     an argument can be persuasive that the anti same sex marriage \n     statute is discrimination based on gender, it may well \n     receive intermediate scrutiny. No court has yet been \n     persuaded that anti-same sex marriage laws are gender-based \n     discrimination, e.g., Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W. 2d 185 (MN \n     1971). For strict scrutiny, the court would have to elevate, \n     for the first time, classifications based on sexual \n     orientation to that of strict scrutiny--a level which we \n     believe is appropriate in theory, but nowhere operative.\n       The key point here is that if our view on the standard \n     should prevail and becomes the standard adopted by the \n     federal courts, then the legislation before you would be \n     invalidated just as the public policy exception would be \n     validated. So, again, the legislation would accomplish \n     nothing.\n     D. Conclusion\n       Whatever the result of this proposed legislation, a legal \n     quagmire awaits us. If under any of these scenarios the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause does not compel states to honor each \n     other's marriages, there is virtually universal argument that \n     it does operate to compel recognition of each other's \n     adoption judgments, divorce decrees, and final custody \n     determinations. We could someday find ourselves in legal \n     situations in which a couple, considered married in one state \n     and unmarried in another, seeks divorce in the first state \n     and recognition of a divorce decree in a state which did not \n     ever consider them married. This is not the uniformity one \n     would desire from the plain language of the Full Faith and \n     Credit clause, but the proposed legislation has no bearings \n     on the situation anyway. Congress simply cannot change the \n     core application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause no \n     matter how it legislates. Until a court determines that \n     marriage is entitled to the same full faith and credit \n     accorded divorce or other judgments, the anomalies will \n     remain.\n\n\n                   III. moral and political concerns\n\n       If the legislation is unconstitutional and unnecessary, why \n     we are here today at all?\n       We all know that same-sex civil marriage is not an issue of \n     overwhelming importance to the average citizen. From our \n     perspective, of course, we wish more people did care about \n     this issue, about according gays and lesbians this \n     fundamental right. Sadly, that is not yet the case,--but \n     someday it will be. But the reality as we sit here today, \n     discussing this specious proposal, is that our cities are \n     mired in poverty, violence is on the rise, the middle class \n     is shrinking and losing ground economically, talented, \n     educated young people cannot find jobs; and incivility and \n     divisiveness abounds in our public and culture life. Does \n     anyone here doubt that if we left the dignified solemnity of \n     this room and ventured onto the streets outside the Capitol--\n     or onto the streets of your home states--to ask people what \n     most troubles them, very few, if any, would say ``same-sex \n     civil marriage.''\n       This bill is not about protecting families. Certainly my \n     family and your families will not be hurt by giving states \n     the freedom to recognize the committed relationship of two \n     loving adults. This bill is about politics, and whether it is \n     your intent or not, this bill will surely turn out to be \n     about gay bashing and scapegoating.\n       Who gives us this bill? The same people who elsewhere \n     complain of big, intrusive government; who believe that the \n     Federal Government overregulates; who stand on ideological \n     principle for the rights of State and local governments. \n     These same people now want to weaken States' rights by \n     enacting a dubious and discriminatory exemption to the ``Full \n     Faith and Credit'' Clause. How strange.\n       How odd that politicians who elsewhere wax eloquent about \n     the sanctity of marriage and the wisdom of small government \n     would now have the Federal Government massively moved into an \n     arena effecting the most intimate aspects of people's lives \n     shattering the Constitution's protections of States' rights \n     and legitimizing the invalidation of civil marriages of \n     committed, loving adult couples simply because they happen to \n     be of the same sex.\n       Mr. Chairman, my mind keeps returning to one question: How \n     can two living adults coming together to form a family harm \n     family values? Are our families and marriages and communities \n     so fragile and shallow that they are threatened by the love \n     between two adults of the same sex?\n       Proponents of this legislation argue that families are the \n     cornerstone of our society, and that, today, families are \n     threatened. I agree. But what truly threatens families?\n       Poverty threatens families, yet we face assaults on all \n     types of programs aimed at supporting families in economic \n     distress.\n       Unemployment, underemployment and stagnant wages threaten \n     families, yet this Congress has been tragically silent as \n     corporations cut jobs and employees in a myopic obsession \n     with short-term profits.\n       Efforts to thwart a livable minimum wage, quality child \n     care, and lack of education threatens families, yet almost \n     every vital part of this country's public education \n     infrastructure, from the Department of Education to Head \n     Start is under attack today.\n       Polluted air and drinking water threaten families, yet the \n     vital environmental laws that keep our water and our air and \n     our communities clean are similarly under attack.\n       And that, sadly, is what this bill is all about. It is \n     about saying to the American people, ``Pay no attention to \n     these truly anit-family policies; gay men and lesbians are \n     the real threats to the security and sanctity of your \n     marriages, your homes, and your communities.''\n       This bill is about targeting scapegoats; and as a people \n     who have been the quintessential scapegoats of Western \n     civilization, we stand with our gay and lesbian brothers and \n     sisters in saying that this bill is immoral and unjust. A \n     national debate over this unnecessary and unconstitutional \n     bill will only distract America from finding real solutions \n     to real problems.\n       Above all, the bill will only serve to codify bigotry. It \n     has been proposed for no other reason than because some \n     States and localities have properly interpreted the spirit, \n     if not the letter, of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution to require them to treat gays and lesbians no \n     different under the law than heterosexuals.\n       Mr. Chairman, the stamp of the divine is found in the souls \n     of all God's children--gay, lesbian and straight. The love \n     that God calls us to, the love that binds two people together \n     in a loving and devoted commitment, is accessible to all \n     God's children. Let the State acknowledge that. This \n     legislation betrays those values. This Congress deserves a \n     better legacy; the American people deserve a better, and more \n     loving, vision.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n       Adopted by the General Assembly Union of American Hebrew \n     Congregations, October 21-October 25, 1993--San Francisco\n\n\n              recognition for lesbian and gay partnerships\n\n       Background: The Union of American Hebrew Congregations has \n     been in the vanguard of support for the full recognition of \n     equality for lesbians and gays in society. This has been \n     clearly articulated in UAHC resolutions dating back to 1977. \n     But far more remains to be accomplished. Today, committed \n     lesbian and gay couples are denied the benefits routinely \n     accorded to married heterosexual couples: they cannot share \n     in their partner's health programs; they do not have spousal \n     survivor rights; and, as seen in recent court rulings, \n     individual lesbian or gay parents have been adjudged unfit to \n     raise their own children because they are lesbian or gay and/\n     or living with a lesbian or gay partner, even though they \n     meet the ``parenting'' standards required of heterosexual \n     couples.\n       It is heartening to note the steps being made toward \n     recognition of the legitimacy of lesbian and gay \n     relationships. Adoption of Domestic Partnership registration \n     in cities such as San Francisco and New York and extension of \n     spousal benefits to partners of lesbian and gay employees by \n     companies such as Levi Strauss, Lotus, Maimonides Hospital in \n     New York City, are models for adoption by other governmental \n     authorities and corporations.\n       Therefore the Union of American Hebrew Congregations \n     resolves to:\n       1. call upon our Federal, Provincial, State and local \n     governments to adopt legislation that will:\n       (a) afford partners in committed lesbian and gay \n     partnerships spousal benefits, that include participation in \n     health care plans and survivor benefits:\n       (b) ensure that lesbians and gay men are not ajudged unfit \n     to raise children because of their sexual orientation; and\n       (c) afford partners in committed lesbian and gay \n     relationships the means of legally acknowledged such \n     relationships; and\n       2. call upon our congregations, the Central Conference of \n     American Rabbis and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute \n     of Religion to join with us in seeking to extend the same \n     benefits that are extended to the spouses of married staff \n     members and employees to the partners of all staff members \n     and employees living in committed lesbian and gay \n     partnerships.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      On Gay and Lesbian Marriage\n\n       Adopted by the 107th Annual Convention of the Central \n     Conference of American Rabbis, March, 1996\n       Background: Consistent with our Jewish commitment to the \n     fundamental principle that we are all created in the divine \n     image, the Reform Movement has ``been in the vanguard of the \n     support for the full recognition of equality for lesbians and \n     gays in society.'' In 1977, the CCAR adopted a resolution \n     encouraging legislation which decriminalizes homosexual acts \n     between consenting adults; and prohibits discrimination \n     against them as persons, followed by its adoption in 1990 of \n     a substantial position paper on homosexuality and the \n     rabbinsic. Then, in 1993, the Union of American Hebrew \n     Congregation observed that ``committed lesbian and gay \n     couples are\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\n     denied the benefit routinely accorded to married heterosexual \n     couples.'' The UAHC resolved that full equality under the law \n     for lesbian and gay people requires legal recognition of \n     lesbian and gay relationships.\n       In light of this background,\n       Be it resolved, That the Central Conference of American \n     Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share \n     fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and\n       Be it further resolved, That the CCAR oppose governmental \n     efforts to ban bay and lesbian marriage.\n       Be it further resolved, That this is a matter of civil law, \n     and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at \n     such marriages.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                                 School of Law\n\n                                      Berkeley, CA, June 14, 1996.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dianne: Thank you for inviting me to give you my views \n     on the Defense of Marriage Act, I do so from the perspective \n     of a law professor who has taught both in the areas of family \n     law and the conflict of laws.\n       As I said to you on the telephone, I think that the Act is \n     ill-advised regardless of what one's attitudes may be toward \n     the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n       The Act, as presently drafted in H.R. 3396, contains two \n     substantive provisions. Section Two exempts sister states \n     from any obligation imposed by the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause of the United States Constitution or its implementing \n     statute ``to give effect to any public act, record, or \n     judicial proceeding of any other State . . . respecting a \n     relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated \n     as a marriage under the laws of such other State, . . . or a \n     right or claim arising from such relationship.'' Section \n     Three defines the terms ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' for the \n     purpose of federal law, including eligibility for federal \n     benefit programs, as follows: ``the word `marriage' means \n     only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband \n     and wife, and the word `spouse' refers only to a person of \n     the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.''\n       Section Three changes a uniform and long-standing federal \n     practice of deferring to state law on questions affecting the \n     family. Eligibility for federal entitlement programs, such as \n     social security, Medicare, and veteran's benefits \n     traditionally have been measured by state, not federal law. \n     Similarly, marital status for the purpose of applying federal \n     statutes such as tax codes and immigration laws has been \n     defined by state law. This long-standing practice \n     appropriately recognizes the prerogative of state \n     legislatures to regulate the family as a matter of local \n     policy, and the greater experience of state court judges, \n     charged with implementing the state laws governing family \n     dissolution as well as matrimony, in determining marital \n     status. The Defense of Marriage Act would reverse that \n     wholesome tradition by creating a federal law of marriage for \n     purposes of the federal code. As Professor Laurence H. Tribe \n     observed, in the New York Times on May 26, 1996, ``[i]t is \n     ironic . . . that such a measure should be defended in the \n     name of states' rights.''\n       Moreover, despite the claims of proponents who assert that \n     the Act does not prohibit states from legalizing same-sex \n     marriage, Section Three would make even-handed administration \n     of such a state's family law impossible. Take, for example, \n     the ability of married couples to split their income for \n     purposes of the federal income tax laws. Single-earner \n     opposite-sex married couples could take advantages of the \n     lower tax burden made available by this provision, while \n     similarly situated same-sex married couples could not. This \n     difference would arise, not from the state law defining \n     marriage, but from the federal policy against same-sex \n     marriage. Same-sex couples would thus have less available \n     assets for the support of their families, perhaps placing a \n     burden on the state. This outcome might influence a state in \n     deciding whether to permit same-sex marriage in the first \n     place. The impact of Section Three on other federal benefit \n     programs is open to a similar analysis.\n       Section Two is designed to excuse states that do not wish \n     to legalize same-sex marriage from any supposed obligation \n     imposed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to recognize such \n     marriages that may be validly performed in other states. This \n     section is both unnecessary to achieve its desired end and \n     pernicious as a matter of sister state relations.\n       The usual conflict of laws doctrine governing the \n     recognition of a marriage performed in another state is that \n     the state where recognition is sought need not recognize a \n     marriage that would violate its public policy. A state with a \n     clear prohibition against same-sex marriage could, if it \n     chose to do so, invoke that prohibition as declaratory of its \n     public policy and as a justification for refusing \n     recognition. The provisions of Section Two merely confirm \n     what such a state may already do for itself, and are \n     therefore superfluous.\n       Finally, Section Two does not facilitate sister state \n     relations: rather it intrudes federal authority into a \n     state's decision whether to extend voluntary recognition to \n     another state's action. This is contrary to prior \n     congressional action, which has been confined to requiring \n     recognition of one state's action by other states, and thus \n     has acted as a unifying force. By stating instead that \n     recognition is unnecessary, Congress would be approving \n     dissention among the states.\n       I hope these comments are helpful. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Herma Hill Kay,\n     Dean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10076-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE FIREMAN'S MUTUAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATION'S 100TH ANNUAL CONVENTION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, Bob Estill, an experienced and \ndistinguished columnist in the Washington Bureau of the Copley News \nService, recently wrote a column paying tribute to my departing press \nsecretary, David Carle.\n  Since the 1960's Mr. Estill has covered Illinois politics and worked \nclosely with the Illinois congressional delegation. Press secretaries, \nespecially the very good ones like David, rarely are mentioned in the \nmedia. But David's outstanding work, his honesty, and his loyalty and \ncommitment to family and friends truly merits special mention, so I \nsubmit this column for the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                   Longtime Simon Aide Exits to Kudos\n\n                            (By Bob Estill)\n\n       Washington.--Retiring Sen. Paul Simon's highly regarded \n     press secretary, David Carle, is leaving the cornfields and \n     gently rolling hills of the ``Prairie State'' for the Green \n     Mountains of verdant Vermont.\n       The longtime spokesman for the Illinois Democrat will begin \n     work after Labor Day as press secretary for Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt., a four-term veteran from a state so sparsely \n     populated it has only one congressional district.\n       Spending most of his adult life as Simon's spokesman, the \n     44-year-old Carle has worked with reporters from small weekly \n     newspapers to metropolitan dailies, from rural radio stations \n     to the major television networks.\n       ``It was an exhilarating ride that included two Senate \n     campaigns and a presidential campaign,'' noted Carle, who had \n     planned to return to graduate school in his native Utah if he \n     hadn't landed the job with Simon in January, 1981.\n       Usually, the comings and goings of congressional press \n     secretaries are frequent, routine, and scarcely noteworthy.\n       But the soft-spoken, unassuming Carle is exceptional in \n     longevity, dedication and performance, creating a model \n     congressional press operation that mirrors Simon's reputation \n     for integrity.\n       Simon extols Carle as a ``fine human being'' and an \n     ``incredibly hard worker'' who is on the job before Simon \n     shows up at 8 a.m. and, even on weekends, keeps Simon posted \n     on any news breaking anywhere.\n       The Senator, a onetime newspaper owner and longtime \n     columnist, said Carle's philosophy on dealing with reporters \n     meshes with his own.\n       ``Sometimes you have to say `no comment' or sometimes you \n     duck a question by giving an evasive answer,'' Simon noted. \n     ``But you never lie to anyone.''\n       Carle also has earned the respect of Republican and \n     Democratic staffers and lawmakers, as well as reporters \n     covering the Illinois congressional delegation.\n       As Major League Baseball's lobbyist, Springfield native \n     Gene Callahan knows a ``most valuable player'' when he sees \n     one.\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\n       ``There's none better than David Carle,'' said Callahan, a \n     former newspaper political columnist, longtime aide to former \n     Sen. Alan Dixon, and Simon's press secretary when he was \n     lieutenant governor.\n       ``He's completely honest and effective in his role as press \n     secretary,'' continued Callahan, who's dealt with myriad \n     press aides over the last four decades. ``He's timely in \n     returning telephone calls and would never think of misleading \n     a reporter.''\n       Doug Booth, press secretary for Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-\n     Yorkville, has known Carle since 1984 when Booth was a \n     newsman for a radio station in Marion and Simon represented \n     the state's southernmost House district.\n       ``Dave always has been extremely effective in the job he \n     has done for Paul Simon,'' Booth said. ``Pat Leahy is lucky \n     to get him on board.''\n       Similar kudos come from Terri Moreland, who heads \n     Republican Gov. Jim Edgar's office here. Moreland said Carle \n     has been ``great to work with'' on Illinois matters.\n       ``He's absolutely professional, and he is so highly \n     regarded on `the Hill,' '' Moreland said of Carle.\n       Indeed, Carle's ability, credibility and workaholic habits \n     resulted in his being drafted for the thankless-but-sensitive \n     job of spokesman for Democrats on Senate panels probing the \n     financial dealings of President Clinton and the First Lady \n     when Clinton was governor of Arkansas.\n       Although seemingly shy, Carle is the master of the soft \n     sell. A believer in preparation, he always has been ready, \n     responsive and reliable when reporters hit him with questions \n     on almost any subject.\n       If a reporter showed even the faintest interest in a Simon \n     issue, Carle would bombard him before day's end with a raft \n     of material which not only supported Simon's viewpoint but \n     also provided opposing arguments and sources.\n       Simon and Carle fit like hand-and-glove. Simon has kept his \n     press secretary well posted on his activities and is \n     comfortable talking with reporters.\n       Carle said he considers himself very fortunate to have \n     worked for ``one of the finest politicians of this era or, I \n     think, any era.''\n       He tends to speak of Simon as if the senator could walk on \n     water.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Employment Nondiscrimination Act, to express my strong support for \nthis important legislation. I do so in the belief that every single \nAmerican deserves fair treatment under the law, no matter their gender, \nrace, religion, or sexual orientation. As one of the few women ever to \nserve in the U.S. Senate, I bring a different perspective to this \nissue. As a mother and as the ninth woman ever elected to the Senate \nand the first ever from my home State of Washington, I understand very \nclearly what it means to be part of a group who seeks fairness and \nequal opportunity.\n  Not so long ago, many thought it impossible for women to serve in the \nSenate, much less elected office of any other kind. Today, I am \nconfident none of my colleagues would deny the contributions women have \nmade here, in the House, in the State and local governments, and at \nevery level of public service.\n  Mr. President, I am proud, not only that I was elected to one of the \nhighest offices in the land, but also because I know now that my \ndaughter will have the same opportunity.\n  The point is this: She will have choices and she will have the \nopportunity, because these are the values of the American people.\n  I do not believe elected leaders serve our country well if they deny \nany of our citizens these choices. A person's success or failure must \ndepend on their qualifications, skills, effort, and sometimes even \nluck. Most important, their fate should rest on having the opportunity \nto test these things. No one, not one person, should be denied \nopportunity because of their race, their religion, their gender, or \ntheir sexual orientation.\n  I know that historic debates such as this one have been very hard, \nbut I say to my colleagues, change is never easy and we should let our \npast successes be our guide in the future.\n  Thirty-five years ago, our national conscience was challenged like \nnever before as the civil rights movement blossomed. By passing the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, we made unquestionable progress toward \nensuring equality for all citizens. Today, none among us would deny \nthat we did the right thing by outlawing discrimination based on race. \nWe know we did the right thing by guaranteeing the civil rights of \nwomen, racial minorities, and members of every religion. The same must \nbe done in this case.\n  So we can be justifiably proud of our rich history of protecting \ncivil rights, and we should dedicate ourselves to doing better. And \nmake no mistake, we can do better. To my colleagues, I offer this \ncaution: Do not be convinced by those who argue that discrimination is \nno longer a problem in the workplace.\n  Every day, citizens of this Nation somewhere feel the sinister burn \nof job discrimination, be they women, racial minorities, or gays and \nlesbians. And unlike the rest of America, this latter group cannot \ntoday count on the protection of Federal law to ensure equal \nopportunity in the workplace.\n  I recently heard the story of a woman named Nan Miguel who worked for \na hospital in my home State of Washington as an administrator in the \nradiology department. She oversaw a small staff and worked very hard at \nher job. Three years ago, she hired a woman she believed was the most \nqualified candidate for an x-ray technician's position. She did this \ndespite pressure from certain staff members who believed that the woman \nshe wanted to hire was a lesbian. The new employee went on to work hard \nand did an excellent job, just as Nan expected she would.\n  Unfortunately, it did not end there. One coworker in particular was \nopposed to working with a woman because of the rumors about her sexual \norientation. Nan sought help from senior management in resolving this \nissue, but to her shock, they told her that the coworker must simply be \nresponding to the discord created by the technician.\n  Her employee's job performance was strong and, therefore, she felt it \nwrong to fire her. Instead, she continued to try and find a solution. \nIn the end, the hospital told Nan that it would be easier for them to \nremove her than to remove her coworker. Nan was placed on \nadministrative leave and subsequently fired. A short time later, the \ntechnician was fired as well. Only the worker who displayed intolerance \non the job stayed on the job.\n  If the same situation had occurred because the technician was \nHispanic, because she was a woman, or because she belonged to the \nMormon Church, the same outcome could not have happened. We would not \neven be talking about it, because today no one would question the \ncompetence of an employee based on those characteristics,\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\nand if someone did, that employee would have recourse under the law.\n\n  Mr. President, a moment ago I mentioned my daughter and the \nopportunities that she will have. I am also very concerned about the \nexperiences of young people who may be denied those same opportunities. \nI am worried about those who must find jobs in cases where their \nparents have forced them out of the House and they are on their own. At \na very early age, they must support themselves just to get through high \nschool, let alone college. Young people are very vulnerable to \ndiscrimination and cannot hold jobs, and they will have an extremely \nhard time.\n  I have heard real stories of gay and lesbian young adults in my State \nwho ended up moving away from home, relying on public assistance or \neven considering suicide if they did not get help. They become very \ncynical about the world they live in, and they start to think that the \nregular rules do not apply to them. When this happens, we lose very \nproductive members of our society. We may pay more for public \nassistance, and we deny young people the chance to pursue the same \ngoals every one of us has--education, a good job and a place in the \ncommunity.\n  As I said before, current law says people cannot be treated \ndifferently in the workplace based on race, origin, gender or religion. \nThe bill before us today would simply add sexual orientation to that \nlist. It is written even more narrowly than current law because it does \nnot allow positive actions, such as quotas or other preferential \ntreatment. All it says is a person cannot be treated differently in any \ndecision related to employment based on their sexuality--whether they \nare heterosexual or homosexual.\n  Under this bill, a person could not be hired solely because they are \nhomosexual, nor could they be denied a job if they are heterosexual.\n  A person cannot get a raise simply because they are married to a \nmember of the opposite sex, nor can they be denied a promotion because \nthey marched in a gay pride parade. In short, it simply takes the issue \nof sexual orientation out of personnel decisions altogether.\n  Mr. President, these are reasonable expectations and, in fact, they \nhave already been adopted by nine States, many local governments across \nthe country and Fortune 500 companies that recognize that it makes good \nbusiness sense to value each and every one of their employees equally. \nIt is time that our laws reflect these values as well.\n  To my colleagues who believe this bill would bring up increased \nlitigation, I ask these questions:\n  Should we then have denied women equal rights because it would have \nincreased the number of cases in our courts?\n  Should we have allowed segregation to continue because it would take \ntoo much time and money to hear Brown versus Board of Education?\n  Did the Framers of our Constitution think about caseloads in our \ncourts when they guaranteed our freedom to worship?\n  My answer to these questions is a strong, clear no, and I am \nsurprised at the arguments against this legislation. They sound \nhauntingly familiar to the ones we have heard in the past against \nallowing women, religious members, and racial groups equal protections \nunder the law.\n  We have heard a lot from both political parties in the past few weeks \nabout the big tent philosophy and the importance of inclusion, equal \ntreatment under the law, and equal opportunity in the workplace. The \nENDA bill gives Senators of both parties a chance to act on that \nrhetoric.\n  Mr. President, this is not a conservative or a liberal issue. It is \nnot about one group's protection at another's expense. It is about \ncommon sense, common decency, and about our fundamental values as \nAmericans.\n  Consider an editorial written 2 years ago by former Arizona Senator \nBarry Goldwater. He wrote that we must allow gay and lesbian citizens \nthe same protections we have extended to other people to ensure their \ncivil rights. He points out that ``anybody who cares about real moral \nvalues understands that this is not about granting special rights--it \nis about protecting basic rights.'' Like many of my colleagues on both \nsides of this aisle, I strongly agree with him.\n  When Nan Miguel tells her story, she says that by treating the woman \nshe hired with dignity and respect, she was following the Christian \nbeliefs that she was brought up with. And I know that in my family, my \nmother and father taught us to respect other people and to treat them \nthe way we wanted to be treated.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the high ground on this issue. Think of \nwhat history will say when the 104th Congress made the decision which \nonce again protected our civil rights. This is not about one group of \npeople, it is about all people and our belief in one another. If we do \nnot pass the ENDA bill, our sisters and brothers, sons and daughters \nwill remain vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace. We can do \nbetter than that. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/09/senate-section/article/S10088-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
